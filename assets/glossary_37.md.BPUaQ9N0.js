From 1780 to 1920, Saunt traces the Graysons and their interaction and intermixing with whites and blacks. At the center of this family saga is Katy Grayson, a Creek woman, who, along with her brother, had children with partners of African descent. Katy later married a Scottish-Creek man, disowned her black children, and became a slave owner. Her brother, William, stayed with his black wife and children, later emancipating them. In 1907, when Creeks were granted U.S. citizenship, state law split the family by defining some as black and some as white. The divergent paths of these families parallel the interactions among whites, blacks, and Indians as racial and social differences solidified through slavery and the mistreatment of Indians. This is a fascinating look at a seldom-recognized aspect of American race relations.\\" -- Vernon Ford.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UH88DwAAQBAJ&dq=Choctaw+(White+Indian+(Americana))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reincarnation (Theosophical manuals)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tumQDxYQpPUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paris-underground,","description":"This early work on wartime Europe is both expensive and hard to find in its first edition.

The table is on the carpet; hence the carpet is under the table. The vase is in the box; hence the box is not in the vase. But what does it mean for an object to be somewhere? How are objects tied to the space they occupy? In this book Roberto Casati and Achille C. Varzi address some of the fundamental issues in the philosophy of spatial representation. Their starting point is an analysis of the interplay between mereology (the study of part/whole relations), topology (the study of spatial continuity and compactness), and the theory of spatial location proper. This leads to a unified framework for spatial representation understood quite broadly as a theory of the representation of spatial entities. The framework is then tested against some classical metaphysical questions such as: Are parts essential to their wholes? Is spatial co-location a sufficient criterion of identity? What (if anything) distinguishes material objects from events and other spatial entities? The concluding chapters deal with applications to topics as diverse as the logical analysis of movement and the semantics of maps.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JLhNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Parts+and+Places:+The+Structures+of+Spatial+Representation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sopa de Pollo para el Alma de los Padres: Relatos sobre el amor, el aprendizaje y la condicion de los padres (Chicken Soup for the Soul) (Spanish Edition)","description":"This latest offering in the best-selling Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul series explores a host of challenges faced by today's teens.

From the earliest days of his thirty-four-year military career, Victor  Brute  Krulak displayed a remarkable facility for applying creative ways of fighting to the Marine Corps. He went on daring spy missions, was badly wounded, pioneered the use of amphibious vehicles, and masterminded the invasion of Okinawa. In Korea, he was a combat hero and invented the use of helicopters in warfare. In Vietnam, he developed a holistic strategy in stark contrast to the Army s  Search and Destroy  methods but when he stood up to LBJ to protest, he was punished. And yet it can be argued that all of these accomplishments pale in comparison to what he did after World War II and again after Korea: Krulak almost single-handedly stopped the U.S. government from abolishing the Marine Corps. Praise for Brute  Coram captures General Krulak s striding march across the Marine Corps, and across the American century . . . [and] is a meticulous investigator of the things that drove Brute Krulak, not all of them pretty... Brute is plainspoken and absorbing . . . and captures its subject in strokes that are sharp, simple and often funny.

Gauri Viswanathan demonstrates how the literary text functioned as a mirror of the ideal Englishman and became a mask of exploitation that camouflaged the material activities of the colonizing British government. In her new preface, she argues that the curricular study of English can no longer be understood innocently or inattentively to the deeper contexts of imperialism, transnationalism, and globalization in which the discipline first articulated its mission. Masks of Conquest illuminates the transcontinental movements and derivations of English studies, revealing the discipline?s origins are as diffuse as its future shape.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NFQZBQAAQBAJ&dq=Masks+of+Conquest:+Literary+Study+and+British+Rule+in+India+(Oxford+India+Paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SONAR SIGNAL PROCESSING","description":"This discussion of sonar signal processing bridges a number of related fields, including acoustic propagation in the medium, detection and estimation theory, filter theory, digital filtering, sensor array processing, spectral analysis, fast transforms and digital signal processing.

While many books have addressed this question, Dead on Arrival is the first to do so based on original archival research for the full sweep of the twentieth century. Drawing on a wide range of political, reform, business, and labor records, Colin Gordon traces a complex and interwoven story of political failure and private response. He examines, in turn, the emergence of private, work-based benefits; the uniquely American pursuit of \\"social insurance\\"; the influence of race and gender on the health care debate; and the ongoing confrontation between reformers and powerful economic and health interests. Dead on Arrival stands alone in accounting for the failure of national or universal health policy from the early twentieth century to the present. As importantly, it also suggests how various interests (doctors, hospitals, patients, workers, employers, labor unions, medical reformers, and political parties) confronted the question of health care--as a private responsibility, as a job-based benefit, as a political obligation, and as a fundamental right. Using health care as a window onto the logic of American politics and American social provision, Gordon both deepens and informs the contemporary debate. Fluidly written and deftly argued, Dead on Arrival is thus not only a compelling history of the health care quandary but a fascinating exploration of the country's political economy and political culture through \\"the American century,\\" of the role of private interests and private benefits in the shaping of social policy, and, ultimately, of the ways the American welfare state empowers but also imprisons its citizens.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1Y5i7IX3ZcsC&dq=Dead+on+Arrival:+The+Politics+of+Health+Care+in+Twentieth-Century+America+(Politics+and+Society+in+Twentieth+Century+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Top of the World","description":"Ernenek's Eskimo life is a never-ending adventurous struggle to provide food and shelter for his family, made easier only by the love of his wife and children and the occasional companionship of friends","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rzaNvgAACAAJ&dq=The+Top+of+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Edge (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jNfV5knMh70C&dq=The+Edge+(G+K+Hall+Large+Print+Book+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thomas Aquinas: Theologian of the Christian Life (Great Theologians Series)","description":"The work of Thomas Aquinas (1224-1275) has become increasingly influential in recent doctrinal theology and theological ethics, aside from his extraordinary historical significance. Thomas has been read ever since his death, today as much as ever. What is it that distinguishes his work, and can his theological judgments and proposals still be brought to bear in contemporary theological inquiry? This book presents a new study of Thomas Aquinas, focusing on the evangelical, pastoral and theocentric character of his premodern theology. Healy presents Thomas as first and foremost a theologian of the Christian life, who when he used philosophical concepts did so in order to fulfill the task of theology, which he conceived as an ecclesial discipline dedicated above all to helping Christians follow Jesus Christ. Thomas's interpretation of Scripture and his theological method, his Trinitarian ontology, his Christology and his Christological anthropology, conception of the church and sacramental theology, are all examined from this perspective. The richness and complexity yet profound simplicity of the Christian way of life Thomas reveals is shown to make a valuable contribution to the thought of contemporary readers, and the significance of Thomas's writings for contemporary theological questions and concerns is revealed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qj1NEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soul Mates & Twin Flames: The Spiritual Dimension of Love & Relationships (Pocket Guide to Practical Spirituality) (Pocket Guides to Practical Spirituality)","description":"\\"A New Look at Love, Karma and Relationships  Uses real-life experiences and love stories to define and illuminate the inner mysteries of the soul....

Some Americans insist that we're living in a post-racial society. But racist thought is not just alive and well in America -- it is more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues, racist ideas have a long and lingering history, one in which nearly every great American thinker is complicit. In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. He uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to drive this history: Puritan minister Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, W.E.B. Du Bois, and legendary activist Angela Davis. As Kendi shows, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. They were created to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation's racial inequities. In shedding light on this history, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose racist thinking. In the process, he gives us reason to hope.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e_3cCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teenage Worrier's Guide to Lurve","description":"Worry no more!

Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol was born in Sorochintsi, Ukraine in 1809. In 1831, Gogol brought out the first volume of his Ukrainian stories, 'Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka'. It met with immediate success, and he followed it a year later with a second volume. 'The Nose' is regarded as a masterwork of comic short fiction, and 'The Overcoat' is now seen as one of the greatest short stories ever written; some years later, Dostoyevsky famously stated \\"We all come out from Gogol's 'Overcoat'.\\" He is seen by many contemporary critics as one of the greatest short story writers who has ever lived, and theFather of Russia's Golden Age of Realism.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wuDerQEACAAJ&dq=Gogol%27s+Coat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"California real estate principles","description":"Completely revised and thoroughly comprehensive, this is the brand new edition of the state's premier real estate licensing manual!

He talks about how we can come to pursue our best efforts at finding something that resembles a path through the foggy haze of an earth-dwellers life, and the fuzzy twists and turns and convolutions of existence. If our voyage is one of expectation, our reality will become just that. It's a perceptual thing; how we each perceive it is a highly individual matter. If you keep an open mind, Michael's promise is that rewards will come out of your enthusiastic reading participation. Don't assume you know anything whatsoever about real life; it goes better for us when we think of it like that. In reality, each day we start out new, and each new day presents itself with an entirely new set of illusions. In sorting out the illusions, we have the chance to make things happen in our lives. The book is presented in five sections. To begin with, in Section One the whole matter of reality and illusion is examined. The next section talks about the individual self, and what reality means to him. The third section explores reality close to home, in the lives of our mind, and with our friends and family. Section Four moves into the outer world, where a global view of reality is addressed. Finally, in the last section (Five), Michael takes on the great and perennial metaphysical questions, doing his best to apply the human notions of \\"God\\" and \\"Universe\\" to the world of the thinking self. Michael admits he is only sharing thoughts on how he narrowly see things. You will hopefully have your own spin on reality, different from everyone else in the world. Keeping it real comes in many shapes, sizes and colors. Each of us looks at it uniquely, and what you are about to experience in this book is merely one tiny sliver of reality perspective. When you are finished reading the book, it is Michael's hope that you will have given more consideration to the matter of what's real and not real for yourself. And that you will take valuable living information from it. Reality. It's a funny thing. How we negotiate our way through it goes a long ways towards whether we adapt or fail in our experiences and encounters with life. Enjoy your journey, both through the book, and through life!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jd_awAEACAAJ&dq=Engineering+on+the+Edge:+The+Future+of+Nanotechnology+and+Robotics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robert Johnson: The New Transcriptions","description":"(Guitar Recorded Versions).

Fortune is a dazzling, endlessly surprising, and gripping historical novel that opens the day Napoleon leads his victorious Grande Arm e into Berlin after having conquered Prussia in battle. As crowds throng the streets to witness this momentous event, a handful of lives that briefly touch are sprung from their orbits and set on courses that will take them across Europe and around the world their fates and desires sometimes intersecting to strange lands in the Caribbean and South America, the Australian continent and van Diemen's Land, and back to a Europe now transformed. A frustrated general in Napoleon's army, billeted with one of Berlin's finest families. Elisabeth, a passionate young woman living with her aunt in that house. A young man of eighteen years and no particular talent, drawn to the smoky coffeehouses where students debate, whom she spies through a window fornicating with a serving girl at the moment Napoleon makes his grand entrance. An entrepreneur in New World exotica with a passion for shrunken heads, to whose house the young man was led for his tryst. A slave from Suriname, Mr. Hendriks, with his resentful white American companion, who have traveled to Berlin to sell a barrel of electric eels for their master.

With a determined commitment to the history of his native land, Nathaniel Hawthorne revealed, more incisively than any writer of his generation, the nature of a distinctly American consciousness. The pieces collected here deal with essentially American matters: the Puritan past, the Indians, the Revolution. But Hawthorne was highly - often wickedly - unorthodox in his account of life in early America, and his precisely constructed plots quickly engage the reader's imagination. Written in the 1820s, 30s, and 40s, these works are informed by themes that reappear in Hawthorne's longer works: The Scarlet Letter, The House of the Seven Gables and The Blithedale Romance. And, as Michael J. Colacurcio points out in his excellent introduction, they are themes that are now deeply embedded in the American literary tradition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TNLDZr0RBREC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Awakening Curry Buckle","description":"Curry Buckle and Darwin Bownes discover a portal to hidden knowledge.

This analysis is enhanced with vivid accounts of those who were there the frightened foot soldier, the general in command, the young cavalry officer whose boils made it impossible to ride, and the smartly dressed aide-de-camp, tripped up by his voluminous pantaloons. Muir considers the interaction of artillery, infantry, and cavalry; the role of the general, subordinate commanders, staff officers, and aides; morale, esprit de corps, soldiers  attitudes toward death and feelings about the enemy; the plight of the wounded; the difficulty of surrendering; and the way victories were finally decided. He discusses the mechanics of musketry, artillery, and cavalry charges and shows how they influenced the morale, discipline, and resolution of the opposing armies. \\"Muir has filled an important gap in the study of the Napoleonic era.\\" Library Journal","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vBMaCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American History for Young Catholics - Grade 1","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qjq-bwAACAAJ&dq=American+History+for+Young+Catholics+-+Grade+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High Impact Quotations: Things I Wish I'd Said","description":"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ?

Offers an important symbol for modern women seeking to reconnect with their ancient, integral sense of self and wholeness. ? Presents an archetype for the sacred potential of female bonding, whether between mother and daughter, teacher and student, friends, or lovers. ? Illustrated with 149 examples of double goddess images. Numerous figures depicting two women in intimate relation with one another, or as a single body with two heads, have been discovered in important centers of early civilizations such as Catal Huyuk and Gozo. These have been routinely ignored by scholars or dismissed as mere dolls with no sacred connotations whatsoever. Vicki Noble shows, to the contrary, that this double goddess is an ancient icon that can considerably expand our understanding of female sovereignty, as well as provide contemporary women with a way to reconnect with the integral sense of self and wholeness enjoyed by their ancestors. Ancient Goddess religion was informed by the organic cycles of nature--the dual poles of Life and Death. The double goddess represents phenomena such as the Earth-Moon pair, the Upper-Underworld pair, the Summer and Winter poles of the seasonal year, and the dual poles of the female biological reality of menstruation and ovulation--the dark and the light. The double goddess in all her varied forms also depicts the vast array of potential relationships women can form with themselves and each other. This book is a celebration of an archetype that not only empowers women, but also teaches them how to share that power with each other.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=41koDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Routledge Companion to Medieval Warfare (Routledge Companions to History)","description":"This comprehensive volume provides easily-accessible factual material on all major areas of warfare in the medieval west.

FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH! 30+ PHOTOS Different from idolatory books on James Dean, this new work examines the actor from interviews with those who knew and worked with him. Used by his directors ruthlessly, Dean s revenge beyond the grave was upon the actors who played their lives and their roles in a mock parallel to the rebel without a cause. Among the actors who tried to imitate Dean and were called by tabloids, \\"the next James Dean,\\" were Martin Sheen, Anthony Perkins, Dean Stockwell, Jack Nicholson, Paul Newman, Brandon deWilde, Dennis ,Hopper, Steve McQueen, Michael Parks, Christopher Jones, Troy Donahue, Michael Landon, Warren Beatty, Robert Blake, Stephen McHattie, James Franco, Sal Mineo, Rod Lauren, and even Elvis Presley! THE NEXT JAMES DEAN is a hard-hitting and humorous look at the actors who tried to become Dean in his wake. Between 1955 and 1975, dozens of young movie stars were hailed and predicted to take the place of James Dean, the rebel without a cause hero. Now, in the style of Confidential and Whisper, comes a book that blows the lid off the Dean clones and their ultimate fates. With savage humor the author traces their rise and fall, relying on the source of their fame and misfortune, the tabloids of the era, to document their fate! Who were called The Next James Dean'?

In Sartor Resartus ( the tailor retailored ) a fictitious editor retells the theories of an equally fictitious German professor who has come to the conclusion that human institutions and morals are only clothes to shield us from nothingness, clothes that can be changed as the whims of the age or fashion dictate. This radically deconstructive vision reveals the very highest symbols of belief for what they are  merely symbols. How to believe in anything after such an insight is a question even more acute today than it was in Carlyle s time, when he first asked it in this masterpiece of invention, parody and profound laughter. This Canongate Classics edition incorporates illustrations by Edmund Sullivan, reproduced as they appeared in the 1898 edition of the text. Also included is the notable Emerson preface to the original American edition and an incisive, specially commissioned introduction from Alasdair Gray.  The character of his influences is best seen in the fact that many of the men who have least agreement with his opinions are those to whom the reading of Sartor Resartus was an epoch in the history of their minds.

Highly recommended. Choice Containing contributions by more than fifty scholars, this volume, the second of Diane Marting's edited works on the women of the literature of Spanish America, consists of analytical and biographical studies of fifty of the most important women writers of Latin America from the seventeenth century to the present. The writers covered in the individual essays represent most Spanish-speaking American nations and a variety of literary genres. Each essay provides biographical and career information, discusses the major themes in the body of work, and surveys criticism, ending with a detailed bibliography of works by the writer, works available in translation if applicable, and works about the writer. The editor's tripartite introduction freely associates themes and images with/about/for the works of Spanish American women writers; explains the history and process of the collaborative effort that this volume represents; and traces some feminist concerns that recur in the essays, providing commentary, analysis, suggestions for further research, and hypotheses to be tested. Two general essays complete the volume. The first examines the oral testimony of contemporary Indian women outside of the literary tradition, women whose words have been recorded by others. The other surveys Latina writers in the United States, an area not otherwise encompassed in the scope of this volume. Appendixes classify the writers in the main body of the work by birth date, country, and genre. Also included is a bibliography of reference works and general criticism on the Latin American woman writer, and title and subject indexes. This book addresses the needs of students, translators, and general readers, as well as scholars, by providing a general reference work in the area of Spanish American literature.

John Elway's historic moments are known by two-word phrases. He was at the center of the wildest play in college football history, simply known as \\"The Play.\\" Before he signed a pro contract, there was \\"The Trade.\\" His NFL career included \\"The Drive\\" and \\"The Fumble,\\" and, of course, \\"The Helicopter,\\" one of the most iconic highlights in Super Bowl lore. There are so many memorable comeback victories and heroic plays that people have to make lists rather than consider Elway in the context of any singular event. Yet Elway's story is filled with one challenge after another. At Stanford, he never played in a Bowl game. He was ripped for being petulant after refusing to sign with the Baltimore Colts when he was drafted No. 1 overall, and later for his failure to get along with coach Dan Reeves. Over the first 10 years of his career, Elway led Denver to three Super Bowls, but lost in progressively worse fashion each time. Finally, after fifteen years of perseverance, Elway led the Broncos to back-to-back championships, including the biggest upset in Super Bowl history. Elway won the MVP award in his final Super Bowl and then walked away from the game. Within four years, Elway's father and twin sister both died, and he went through a difficult divorce. Reeling in his post-retirement, he returned to football . . . at the bottom, running the Colorado Crush of the Arena Football League. He waited more than a decade to return to his beloved Broncos. While many people doubted him initially, Elway navigated the Broncos through massive changes and to victory in Super Bowl 50, making Elway the rare Hall of Famer to win a title both on and off the field. Elway has put his passion for competition on display in a way that only a handful of other NFL greats have ever done, and Elway is the most complete look at one of the most accomplished legends in the history of American sports.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kXfIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting a Job in CG: Real Advice from Reel People","description":"Get the Inside Track to Landing an Enviable Job in Computer Graphics Breaking into the wildly creative and fiery 3D/Effects industry is a tough proposition.

The Glyphs are an easy method that can be used by anyone to help themselves and others to be healed. The magical system developed in the Problem Solvers Alphabet combines Hermetic Magic, Gematria and magical alphabets as utilized by many ancient cultures. You will be taught how to energize your own magical creations in such a way as to key into the vibrations, colors and images of the glyphs and akashic gemstones; all based on tested ancient wisdom - updated and developed for students in a new magical age. The alphabet is an integral part of my system to stop negative energies from harming you or others Testimonials- A good book is often plainly written, when the writer writes from experience, from a gentle kindness that wishes not to impress, but to be understood. A good book of wisdom is often plainer still, for the words are not the writer's own, and the work itself is alive. The Problem-Solver's Alphabet is both: elegantly simple and alive with magic. As Nita Hickok found so many of us in our darkest hour, may this book find you in yours. Bill I found Nita through Robert Bruce's book. I was starting to experience a real slate of bad luck, no money, bad guy, and magical workings from others on me. People say these things don't exist. I am a pretty sane person & I can tell you, they do exist. I experienced some dreadful stuff, and money especially was extremely scarce. I almost lost my home.. I contacted Nita and she could see right away that the guy I was associated with had some bad stuff on him and it was affecting me very badly. She also alerted me to her book, the Problem Solvers's Alphabet. I found this extremely useful. Nita was very helpful, kind & generous with her help and information. She was always concerned & showed a genuine interest in helping me to solve my problems. Fight magic with magic, is how I put it. I am finally coming through that harsh time, and it is because of Nita's help. She is the real deal. But one thing is, as Nita will say, you have got to help yourself as well. If you have psychological problems, then you must seek some outside help like psychotherapy or counselling. You can protect yourself, but you have to deal with the issues that caused the problem too. Like, why was I ever associated with such a person? How am I making decisions? You have to work on yourself, and Nita does say that. Thank you Nita for your help in not only teaching me but showing me how to take care of myself. You are a real gift and I treasure you. God Bless you lovely lady. Thank you Nita. Patty Turner I first met Nita when she agreed to assist me with a personal issue I was experiencing with psychic attacks. Since then I have realized more and more that her greatest gift is the amount of love she gives and offers to those in need. My spiritual journey has now taken a different path to that of hermetics. However, I have never doubted that Nita has the energy of a healer, and will bring her gifts and insights to many people now and in the future. Nita is a humble person, free from the attitude that often accompanies gifted healers. I recommend her whole heartedly because I trust her. That is the biggest compliment I could give anyone.

The culmination of a physicist's thirty-five-year journey from MIT to Jerusalem, Genesis and the Big Bang presents a compelling argument that the events of the billions of years that cosmologists say followed the Big Bang and those of the first six days described in Genesis are, in fact, one and the same identical realities described in vastly different terms. In engaging, accessible language, Dr. Schroeder reconciles the observable facts of science with the very essence of Western religion: the biblical account of Creation. Carefully reviewing and interpreting accepted scientific principles, analogous passages of Scripture, and biblical scholarship, Dr. Schroeder arrives at a conclusion so lucid that one wonders why it has taken this long in coming. The result for the reader whether believer or skeptic, Jewish or Christian is a totally fresh understanding of the key events in the life of the universe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7oggd2UbJfEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gondar","description":"The lives of four young people--Princess Rachel, Jamie Oran, Mamkinga, and Toomi--are drawn together in a mission to take the fabled nineteenth-century African kingdom of Gondar","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b1e10j65gPAC&dq=Gondar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quotable Ustinov","description":"Presents a collection of witticisms and observations drawn from the English actor, author, and UNICEF representative's books, interviews, and articles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7I6fGQAACAAJ&dq=Quotable+Ustinov&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Your Foot in the Door When You Don't Have a Leg to Stand On","description":"This title is based on the theory that your relationship with a potential employer is like the relationship between products and consumers.

It was originally published in the Cincinnati Enquirer in 1903, and the Sunday editor of the Enquirer, George Randolph Chester, wrote the stories in verse, which McCay then illustrated. Jungle Imps married McCay's first foray into the world of the newspaper comic strip, to be followed by Little Sammy Sneeze in 1904 and Dream of the Rarebit Fiend in 1905, both of which are also collected here.

A bootlegger and labor racketeer, he corrupted politicians, promoted crooked stock sales, and imported narcotics. And, perhaps most importantly, he transformed organized crime from a thuggish activity practiced by hoodlums into a big business, run like a corporation, with himself at the top. For twenty years, the name of Arnold Rothstein symbolized money big-time money, gambling money, racket money, illegal money, millions upon millions of dollars. His share was ninety percent of any deal; he was never indicted for a single crime; he always won at cards and horses. And, despite his involvement in dozens of murders and hundreds of other crimes, his luck never ran out. At least not until 1928, the year in which he was fatally shot.

Why do organizations \\"forget\\"? Could productivity gains acquired in one part of an organization be transferred to another? These are among the questions addressed in Organizational Learning: Creating, Retaining and Transferring Knowledge. Since its original publication in 1999, this book has set the standard for research and analysis in the field. This fully updated and expanded edition showcases the most current research and insights, featuring a new chapter that provides a theoretical framework for analyzing organizational learning and presents evidence about how the organizational context affects learning processes and outcomes. Drawing from a wide array of studies across the spectrum of management, economics, sociology, and psychology, Organizational Learning explores the dynamics of learning curves in organizations, with particular emphasis on how individuals and groups generate, share, reinforce, and sometimes forget knowledge. With an increased emphasis on service organizations, including healthcare, Linda Argote demonstrates that organizations vary dramatically in the rates at which they learn with profound implications for productivity, performance, and managerial and strategic decision making.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lro1J_ISmesC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Francis Bacon's Personal Life Story","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yvEkAQAAIAAJ&dq=Francis+Bacon%27s+Personal+Life+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faithful Tribe: The Loyal Institutions","description":"If there is any more controversial body of men than the Orange Order (and, with the exception of Ruth Dudley Edwards, who has been admitted to an honorary position in her very own lodge, they are all men) in the British Isles, it is hard to think who they might be.

Y. Evans-Wentz, great Buddhist scholar and translator of such now familiar works as the Tibetan Book of the Dead and the Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation, spent his final years in California. There, in the shadow of Cuchama, one of the Earth's holiest mountains, he began to explore the astonishing parallels between the spiritual teaching of America's native peoples and that of the deeply mystical Hindus and Tibetans. Cuchama and Sacred Mountains, a book completed shortly before his death in 1965, is the fruit of those explorations. To Cuchama, \\"Exalted High Place,\\" came the young Cochimi and Yuma boys for initiation into the mystic rites for their people. In solitude they sought and received guidance and wisdom. In this same way, the peoples of ancient Greece, the Hebrews, the early Christians, and the Hindus had found access to inner truth on their own holy mountains: and in this same way must the modern person find the path to inner knowing. Surveying many of the most Sacred Mountains in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia, Evans-Wentz expresses the belief that the secret power of these high places has not passed away but only awaits the coming of a New Age. This new age, in accord with the oldest prophecies of our continent, will be a time of renaissance, the long-waited era of harmony and peace among all peoples. This renaissance shall be uniquely American, a renewal based on the values so long honored by the Americans before Columbus, and so ruthlessly trampled by the \\"civilized\\" Europeans who overran them. No other race of people has been as spiritual in their way of life than the original Americans, notes Evans-Wentz. Perhaps none other has known such martyrdom. Yet the secret greatness of the Indian religion still lives, ancient as the Earth itself, yet ageless in its power to renew.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=axV1AAAAMAAJ&dq=Cuchama&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War Drums (White Indian (Americana))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EK13PwAACAAJ&dq=War+Drums+(White+Indian+(Americana))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early settlers of New York State: Their ancestors and descendants","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jTduA7gtMxgC&dq=Early+settlers+of+New+York+State:+Their+ancestors+and+descendants&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"100 Magical Moments","description":"100 Magical Moments contains one hundred innovative ideas with detailed instructions for wooing your partner, even if you're broke!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6_R3PQAACAAJ&dq=100+Magical+Moments&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NATURAL PRAYERS","description":"Following the changing seasons, the physics and astronomy professor presents meditations inspired by attention to the natural world","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6QYRAQAAIAAJ&dq=NATURAL+PRAYERS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Apostasy: The Triumph of \\"Other\\" Gospels (Encounter Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FvPYAAAAMAAJ&dq=American+Apostasy:+The+Triumph+of+%22Other%22+Gospels+(Encounter+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies: A Novel","description":"If Ridley Jones had slept ten minutes later or had taken the subway instead of waiting for a cab, she would still be living the beautiful lie she used to call her life.

A political and legal analyst of unparalleled journalistic skill, Jeffrey Toobin is the ideal writer to distill the events of the thirty-six anxiety-filled days that culminated in one of the most stunning Supreme Court decisions in history. Packed with news-making disclosures and written with the drive of a legal thriller, Too Close to Call takes us inside James Baker's private jet, through the locked gates to Al Gore's mansion, behind the covered-up windows of Katherine Harris's office, and even into the secret conference room of the United States Supreme Court. As the scene shifts from Washington to Austin and into the remote corners of the enduringly strange Sunshine State, Toobin's book will transform what you thought you knew about the most extraordinary political drama in American history. The Florida recount unfolded in a kaleidoscopic maze of bizarre concepts (chads, pregnant and otherwise), unfamiliar people in critically important positions (the Florida Supreme Court), and familiar people in surprising new places (the Miami relatives of Eli n Gonz lez, in a previously undisclosed role in this melodrama). With the rich characterization that is his trademark, Toobin portrays the prominent strategists who masterminded the campaigns--the Daleys and the Roves--and also the lesser-known but influential players who pulled the strings, as well as the judges and justices whose decisions determined the final outcome. Toobin gives both camps a treatment they have not yet received--remarkably evenhanded, nonpartisan, and entirely new. The post-election period posed a challenge to even the most zealous news junkie: how to keep up with what was happening and sort out the important from the trivial. Jeffrey Toobin has now done this--and then some. With clarity, insight, humor, and a deep understanding of the law, he deconstructs the events, the players, and the often Byzantine intricacies of our judicial system. A remarkable account of one of the most significant periods in our country's history, Too Close to Call is endlessly surprising, frequently poignant, and wholly addictive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V1IHSL89yMIC&dq=Too+Close+to+Call&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Griffin & Sabine Notecards","description":"The comedian and Emmy-winning self-proclaimed \\"D-list\\" star celebrates those who supported her on her rise to fame and also offers intimate details in a humorous look at the funny woman's life.

Seven years ago Paul Raeburn s son, Alex, eleven, was admitted to a psychiatric hospital after leaving his fifth-grade classroom in an inexplicable rage. He was hospitalized three times over the next three years until he was finally diagnosed by a psychiatrist as someone exhibiting a clear-cut case of bipolar disorder. This ended a painful period of misdiagnosis and inappropriate drug therapy. Then Raeburn s younger daughter, Alicia, twelve, was diagnosed as suffering from depression after episodes of self-mutilation and suicidal thoughts. She too was repeatedly admitted to psychiatric hospitals. All during this terrible, painful time, Raeburn s marriage was disintegrating, and he had to ask what he and his wife might have done, unwittingly, to contribute to their children s mental illness. And so, literally to save his children s lives, he used all the resources available to him as a science reporter and writer to educate himself on their diseases and the various drugs and therapies available to help them return from a land of inner torment. In Paul Raeburn s skilled hands, this memoir of a family stricken with the pain of depression and mania becomes a cathartic story that any reader can share, even as parents unlucky enough to be in a similar position will find it of immeasurable practical value in their own struggles with the child psychiatry establishment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_EUcwlTuDHgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Family Redeemed: Essays on Family Relationships (Meotzar Horav)","description":"Focus on family relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children.The essays develop a Jewish theory of marriage and sexuality, parenthood and the duty to honor and revere one's parents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SCTG_4n_MH0C&dq=Family+Redeemed:+Essays+on+Family+Relationships+(Meotzar+Horav)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Guide to Corals for the Mini-Reef Aquarium","description":"Each coral is appraised and colour-coded according to the ease with which it can be maintained in your mini-reef.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JQ2NNAAACAAJ&dq=A+Guide+to+Corals+for+the+Mini-Reef+Aquarium&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bird-Self Accumulated","description":"\\"When BooBoo stabs Morris Boyle I am reading a news magazine that someone has smuggled into the wing.\\" Thus, the protagonist of this novella introduces us to prison, one of the several worlds he inhabits, worlds most of us would rather ignore but which inexorably, through what we see and hear and read and live on uncountable American streets, has become the one world we can no longer avoid.

Celebrating the college's acquisition of 17 preparatory drawings for the mural from the artist's family, the book is illustrated with Orozco's work and that of his contemporaries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tvFeAAAAMAAJ&dq=Jose+Clemente+Orozco:+Prometheus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Petals Journal","description":"Blank 200 page journal","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=skYsMQAACAAJ&dq=Petals+Journal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Civilian Conservation Corps, 1933-1942: A New Deal case study (Duke historical publications)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bo83AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Civilian+Conservation+Corps,+1933-1942:+A+New+Deal+case+study+(Duke+historical+publications)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundations of Probability with Applications : Selected Papers 1974-1995 (Cambridge Studies in Probability, Induction and Decision Theory)","description":"This is an important collection of essays by a leading philosopher, dealing with the foundations of probability.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lhxRQAzIa6oC&dq=Foundations+of+Probability+with+Applications+:+Selected+Papers+1974-1995+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Probability,+Induction+and+Decision+Theory)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smart Guide to Starting a Small Business (The Smart Guides Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1s5cAQAACAAJ&dq=Smart+Guide+to+Starting+a+Small+Business+(The+Smart+Guides+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jailhouse Stud","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RHByAgAAQBAJ&dq=Jailhouse+Stud&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Hundred Great Essays","description":"A monumental, canon-defining anthology of three centuries of American essays, from Cotton Mather and Benjamin Franklin to David Foster Wallace and Zadie Smith--selected by acclaimed essayist Phillip Lopate. Not only an education but a joy. This is a book for the ages. --Rivka Galchen, author of Atmospheric Disturbances The essay form is an especially democratic one, and many of the essays Phillip Lopate has gathered here address themselves--sometimes critically--to American values. We see the Puritans, the Founding Fathers and Mothers, and the stars of the American Renaissance struggle to establish a national culture. A grand tradition of nature writing runs from Audubon, Thoreau, and John Muir to Rachel Carson and Annie Dillard. Marginalized groups use the essay to assert or to complicate notions of identity. Lopate has cast his net wide, embracing critical, personal, political, philosophical, literary, polemical, autobiographical, and humorous essays. Americans by birth as well as immigrants appear here, famous essayists alongside writers more celebrated for fiction or poetry. The result is a dazzling overview of the riches of the American essay.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6LVCEAAAQBAJ&dq=One+Hundred+Great+Essays&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Without Remorse","description":"John Kelly befriends a young woman with a checkered past.

This definitive study takes readers into the cockpits and onto the flight decks of the versatile and hardy U.S. escort carriers (CVEs) to tell of their vital, yet little-known contribution to the anti-U-boat campaign. Sailing apart from the Allied convoys, the CVE captains had complete freedom of action and frequently took their ships on \\"hunt and kill\\" missions against the enemy. The German submarines were allowed no respite and no place to relax without the fear of discovery. World War II historian William Y'Blood explains that in the eighteen months between the spring of 1943, when the escort carriers began to prowl the Atlantic, to November 1944, the average number of U-boats in daily operation was reduced from 108 to a mere 31. Though land-based aircraft, various support groups, and the convoy system itself helped win the Battle of the Atlantic, the escort carrier groups' influence was profound. In addition to documenting the escort carriers' exciting operational history, the author also traces the CVE's development and construction and examines its tactical and strategic uses.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H6f6VLTgSSAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LA Familia Tillerman Busca Hogar","description":"Desde el principio del viaje, Dicey tuvo oscuros presentimientos que se confirmaron cuando su madre despareci , dej ndola a ella, a su hermana Maybeth y a sus hermanos James y Sammy abandonados en un alto en el camino.

Since the early 20th century the accepted number of species of bamboos, world wide, has tripled. However, until now information was scattered through numerous, often not easily available publications. The Bamboos of the World, is the first comprehensive (taxonomic as well as horticultural) reference work that provides basic information on bamboos world wide, whether they are wild or cultivated, well-known or rather unknown. The work, based on bamboo literature, facilitates access to further data by citation and a comprehensive bibliography. Among the main data included are botanical names with synonyms, and geographical distribution of genera and species, varieties with their distinctive characters, common bamboo names, plant introductions to the West, plant size and uses. The distribution of genera is mapped. The Bamboos of the World presents a wealth of essential information in an accessible and structured manner. It gives the opportunity to check under what names, and where, relevant information on any bamboo can be found. For the researcher with management and development interests it provides a convenient means of basing bamboo resource on a sound understanding of generic and species relationships, with names that appear in earlier literature put into context. The work should prove to be invaluable for those interested in the morphology, taxonomy, distribution and cultivation of bamboos.

By the time Umberto Eco published his best-selling novel The Name of the Rose, he was one of Italy's most celebrated intellectuals, a distinguished academic and the author of influential works on semiotics. Some years before that, in 1977, Eco published a little book for his students, How to Write a Thesis, in which he offered useful advice on all the steps involved in researching and writing a thesis from choosing a topic to organizing a work schedule to writing the final draft. Now in its twenty-third edition in Italy and translated into seventeen languages, How to Write a Thesis has become a classic. Remarkably, this is its first, long overdue publication in English. Eco's approach is anything but dry and academic. He not only offers practical advice but also considers larger questions about the value of the thesis-writing exercise. How to Write a Thesis is unlike any other writing manual. It reads like a novel. It is opinionated. It is frequently irreverent, sometimes polemical, and often hilarious. Eco advises students how to avoid  thesis neurosis  and he answers the important question  Must You Read Books?  He reminds students  You are not Proust  and  Write everything that comes into your head, but only in the first draft.  Of course, there was no Internet in 1977, but Eco's index card research system offers important lessons about critical thinking and information curating for students of today who may be burdened by Big Data. How to Write a Thesis belongs on the bookshelves of students, teachers, writers, and Eco fans everywhere. Already a classic, it would fit nicely between two other classics: Strunk and White and The Name of the Rose. Contents The Definition and Purpose of a Thesis ? Choosing the Topic ?

With so much data on the Web, managing it with conventional tools is becoming almost impossible. New tools and techniques are necessary to provide interoperability as well as warehousing between multiple data sources and systems, and to extract information from the databases. XML Databases and the Semantic Web focuses on critical and new Web technologies needed for organizations to carry out transactions on the Web, to understand how to use the Web effectively, and to exchange complex documents on the Web. This reference for database administrators, database designers, and Web designers working in tandem with database technologists covers three emerging technologies of significant impact for electronic business: Extensible Markup Language (XML), semi-structured databases, and the semantic Web. The first two parts of the book explore these emerging technologies. The third part highlights the implications of these technologies for e-business. Overall, the book presents a comprehensive view of critical technologies for the Web in general and XML in particular. The semantic Web, XML, and semi-structured databases are still relatively new technologies that integrate many other technologies. As these technologies and integration of these advances mature, we can expect to see progress in the semantic web. The information contained in XML Databases and the Semantic Web is essential to the future success of effective e-business on the Web.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UNDLBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An American Homeplace","description":"In the tradition of Wendell Berry and John McPhee, Donald McCraig writes with a powerful sense of place about the history of Virginia's Highland County.

Provides profound insights into our perceptions of reality, telepathy, mutants, and parallel universes ? Reveals the occult influences on the Nazis and introduces the alchemist Fulcanelli and the work of Charles Fort and Gurdjieff ? Over Half a Million Copies Sold This groundbreaking, international bestseller, first published in 1960, couples profound insights into the hidden history of humanity and our perceptions of reality with the scientific evidence that supports the existence of paranormal activity, telepathy, and extraterrestrial communications. The first book to explore in depth the Nazi fascination with the occult, Pauwels and Bergier also broke new ground with their study of pyramidology, alchemy and its close kinship with atomic energy, and the possibility of a widespread mutation of humanity that would herald the dawn of a new age for the earth. Their study of secret societies, starting with the Rosicrucians, suggests that such changes are actively being pursued in the present day by a  conspiracy  of the most spiritually and intellectually advanced members of the human race. The Morning of the Magicians also explores the anomalous events collected by Charles Fort, the work of Gurdjieff, and the history of the mysterious Fulcanelli, who was widely believed to have manufactured the philosopher s stone--which provided the Nazis the motive for mounting an intensive search for him during their occupation of Paris. Much more than a collection of strange facts defying conventional wisdom, this book remains a sophisticated philosophical exploration of repressed phenomena and hidden histories that asks its readers to look at reality with ever  awakened eyes.

In a cross-cultural approach to understanding astrology as a magical language, Alice Sparkly Kat unmasks the political power of astrology, showing how it can be channeled as a force for collective healing and liberation. Too often, magic and astrology are divorced from their potency and cultural contexts: co-opted by neoliberalism, used as a force of oppression, or distilled beyond recognition into applications that belie their individual and collective power. By looking at the symbolic and etymological histories of the sun, moon, Saturn, Venus, Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter, we can trace and understand the politics of magic--and challenge our own practices, interrogate our truths, and reshape our institutions to build better frameworks for communities of care. Fearless, radical, and fresh, Sparkly Kat's Postcolonial Astrology ushers in a new wave of astrology revival, refusing to apologize for its magickism and connecting its power to the spirituality and politics we need now. Intersectional, inclusive, and geared towards queer and POC communities, it uses our historical and collective constructs of the planets, sun, and moon to re-chart our subconscious history, redefine the body in the world, and assert our politics of the personal, in astrology and all things.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8EsqEAAAQBAJ&dq=Power+Astrology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spirit-Filled Life Bible Discovery Series: B10-Everyday Wisdom for Everlasting Life (Spirit-Filled Life Bible Discovery Guides)","description":"The wisdom contained in the Book of Proverbs is as meaningful today as when it was written thousands of years ago.

Symbolism is the language of the Mysteries; in fact it is the language not only of mysticism and philosophy but of all Nature, for every law and power active in universal procedure is manifested to the limited sense perceptions of man through the medium of symbol. Every form existing in the diversified sphere of being is symbolic of the divine activity by which it is produced. By symbols men have ever sought to communicate to each other those thoughts which transcend the limitations of language. This book is often hailed as an encyclopedia for all things hidden, ancient, and arcane, and it explores a vast array of topics, from secret societies and the Zodiac to Mystic Christianity and William Shakespeare's identity.

Henry Blake Fuller s depiction of social climbing and human depravity among the  cliff-dwelling  residents and workers in the new Chicago skyscrapers shocked readers of the time, and influenced many American writers that followed. With its frenetic pace and many interrelated stories, it remains a compelling document of Chicago s social history, as well as a searing indictment of modern American life at the close of the nineteenth century. The extensive appendices to this edition include Fuller s literary criticism and his correspondence about the novel, reviews, and visual and historical materials on turn-of-the-century Chicago and literary realism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KAYAXdIecGIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building Cocoa Applications : A Step by Step Guide","description":"This is a step-by-step guide to developing applications for Apple's Mac OS X.It describes how to build object-oriented apps using Cocoa.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CnEdAmel0PEC&dq=Building+Cocoa+Applications+:+A+Step+by+Step+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inequality, Globalization, and World Politics","description":"This text suggests that globalization is creating urgent problems for states and international institutions to deal with, and that these organisations are increasingly unsuitable for handling such problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7U5Q3TzSI1EC&dq=Inequality,+Globalization,+and+World+Politics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living on the Land: Change Among the Inuit of Baffin Island","description":"Matthiasson offers both a vivid picture of Inuit society as it was and an illuminating look at the nature and the extent of the enormous changes of the past thirty years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=om_8SeO6utsC&dq=Living+on+the+Land:+Change+Among+the+Inuit+of+Baffin+Island&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Annulments and the Catholic Church","description":"Annulment.

Lee: Icon for a Nation (Great Commanders S.)","description":"An authoritative and balanced assessment of a great American commander. General Robert E Lee, handsome, immaculately attired and dignified, quickly emerged as one of the great heroes of the American Civil War. This is rather surprising for, as Brian Holden Reid points out in his lucid new study, Lee was the most successful general to command troops against the armies of the United States before General Vo Nguyen Giap in Vietnam. Lee's reputation as a peerless commander was greatly embroidered by writers after 1865 who were dedicated to the Lost Cause and presented a sentimental picture of the Old South with Lee as its finest product. His character and achievements in the Civil War were presented as a validation of the Confederate cause. It is important for historians to come to terms with this legacy. Professor Holden Reid briskly surveys the forms that the Lee legend took after his death in 1870 and discusses the reasons behind the way it crystallised as it did. As a non-American he brings a fresh, detached eye to this process. Holden Reid argues that Lee's qualities as a general do not require any exaggeration or embellishment. Lee's short period of field command, just under three years, was marked by imagination, decisiveness, stamina, and a determination to win the Civil War rather than just avoid losing it. Holden Reid defends Lee stoutly against later critics who have argued that his offensive strategy was self-defeating. He believes that it was the only realistic course offered to the Confederacy to win its independence. He acknowledges though that all great commanders have their faults. Lee exhibited occasional over-confidence, under-estimated his enemy, and failed to develop his staff in any modern sense. The result is an authoritative and balanced assessment of a great American commander.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wRn9AAAAQBAJ&dq=Robert+E.+Lee:+Icon+for+a+Nation+(Great+Commanders+S.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thomas and the Great Race (Thomas & Friends)","description":"When his friend Bertie the Bus challenges him to a race, Thomas really pours on the steam, in a train-shaped book with die-cut board pages and wheels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BEpOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Thomas+and+the+Great+Race+(Thomas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flowers","description":"Learn how to buy, style, and present seasonal flower arrangements for every occasion.

Rather, she invites you to step back and consider the bigger picture: What is the purpose of life and parenthood? What are our human limitations? How can we cope with our guilt and fear? What are our family's values and how do we pass them on? What is our family's structure and place within the wider community? When she was desperate for answers, Harriet Connor turned to the ancient wisdom of her ancestors--the Bible. She went looking for little pieces of grandmotherly advice, but what she found was a grand vision--a big picture--that made sense of both life and parenthood.

A tribal ranger, he lives among people far different from any he has known. Balanced precariously between isolation and community, he is drawn to both the fastness of a remote river canyon and the Apaches who have come to be the only family he has. Nashoba's world is peopled by, among others, a bright young man who sells vision quests to romantic tourists, a determined elder whose power makes her a force to be reckoned with on the reservation, a resident anthropologist more \\"native\\" than the natives, a corrupt tribal chairman, a former Hollywood extra who shouts at reservation women the scraps of Italian he learned from other \\"Indian\\" actors, and the ranger's estranged wife. Confusion and violence follow their encounter with a right-wing militia group training secretly on tribal land. The contrast between these Rambo types and the various Native American characters typifies the sardonic humor running throughout this novel of contemporary Indian identity. Louis Owens, who is of Choctaw-Cherokee-Irish descent, is Professor of English at the University of New Mexico.

In fact, Beppe would prefer if you left behind the baggage his crafty and elegant countrymen have smuggled into your subconscious. To get to his Italia, you ll need to forget about your idealized notions of Italy. Although La Bella Figura will take you to legendary cities and scenic regions, your real destinations are the places where Italians are at their best, worst, and most authentic: The highway: in America, a red light has only one possible interpretation Stop! An Italian red light doesn t warn or order you as much as provide an invitation for reflection. The airport: where Italians prove that one of their virtues (an appreciation for beauty) is really a vice. Who cares if the beautiful girls hawking cell phones in airport kiosks stick you with an outdated model? That s the price of gazing upon perfection. The small town: which demonstrates the Italian genius for pleasant living:  a congenial barber . . . a well-stocked newsstand . . . professionally made coffee and a proper pizza; bell towers we can recognize in the distance, and people with a kind word and a smile for everyone.  The chaos of the roads, the anarchy of the office, the theatrical spirit of the hypermarkets, and garrulous train journeys; the sensory reassurance of a church and the importance of the beach; the solitude of the soccer stadium and the crowded Italian bedroom; the vertical fixations of the apartment building and the horizontal democracy of the eat-in kitchen. As you venture to these and many other locations rooted in the Italian psyche, you realize that Beppe has become your Dante and shown you a country that  has too much style to be hell  but is  too disorderly to be heaven.  Ten days, thirty places. From north to south. From food to politics. From saintliness to sexuality. This ironic, methodical, and sentimental examination will help you understand why Italy as Beppe says  can have you fuming and then purring in the space of a hundred meters or ten minutes.

Forthright, brusque and driven by a firm desire to educate the working-class, Felix is at first viewed with suspicion by many, including the elegant but vain Esther Lyon, the daughter of the local clergyman. As she discovers, however, his blunt words conceal both passion and deep integrity. Soon the romantic and over-refined Esther finds herself overwhelmed by a heart-wrenching decision: whether to choose the wealthy Transome as a husband, or the impoverished but honest Felix Holt.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h3T_wAEACAAJ&dq=Felix+Holt+the+Radical&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BETTY CROCKER'S NEW OUTDOOR COOKBOOK \\"Here\\"s everything you need to know about outdoor cooking; the complete guide to cooking on the grill, rotisserie, smoker, camp stove and campfire; 450 success-insured recipes and menus. \\" (PICNICS - BOAT TRIPS - CAMP-OUTS - BARBEQUES)","description":"Tracing the course of the history of cooking and dining in McLean County and the Bloomington-Normal area takes us back 180 years. Early settlers from the Southern states and parts of the Northeast brought with them divergent tastes, but irrespective of their culinary leanings they generally made do with foods they either raised or collected themselves. Later on, newcomers from Ireland and Continental Europe established homes in various parts of the county. As a result, area foodways increased in complexity, and a variety of new food-related industries developed. Residents made beer, candy, ice cream, pickles, sausages, soda water, and vinegar. They manufactured stoves and refrigerators, milled flour, baked various types of bread, packed pork, and canned tomatoes. Bloomington companies distributed produce and groceries throughout Central Illinois. Still, many families beyond the city limits produced and processed nearly everything they ate and only occasionally visited a grocery store. By the end of the second millennium it was hard to find locally produced food in McLean County, let alone people with many food-related skills. The areaa s telephone directories listed no cheese shops or fishmongers. Skilled butchers and bread bakers barely existed. A couple of artisanal confectioners still had shops in Bloomington, but you could forget it if you wanted to buy milk from a local dairy. Finding groceries and fresh produce outside of a chain supermarket was a challenge, not to mention locating a chef-owned restaurant.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZDE6twAACAAJ&dq=BETTY+CROCKER%27S+NEW+OUTDOOR+COOKBOOK+%22Here%22s+everything+you+need+to+know+about+outdoor+cooking%3B+the+complete+guide+to+cooking+on+the+grill,+rotisserie,+smoker,+camp+stove+and+campfire%3B+450+success-insured+recipes+and+menus.+%22+(PICNICS+-+BOAT+TRIPS+-+CAMP-OUTS+-+BARBEQUES)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zone System: Step by Step Guide for Photographers","description":"The zone system is a comprehensive approach to the exposure and development of b/w film.

They believe people have the right to an equal share of political power. And they believe that political participation is good for us it empowers us, helps us get what we want, and tends to make us smarter, more virtuous, and more caring for one another. These are some of our most cherished ideas about democracy. But Jason Brennan says they are all wrong. In this trenchant book, Brennan argues that democracy should be judged by its results and the results are not good enough. Just as defendants have a right to a fair trial, citizens have a right to competent government. But democracy is the rule of the ignorant and the irrational, and it all too often falls short. Furthermore, no one has a fundamental right to any share of political power, and exercising political power does most of us little good. On the contrary, a wide range of social science research shows that political participation and democratic deliberation actually tend to make people worse more irrational, biased, and mean. Given this grim picture, Brennan argues that a new system of government epistocracy, the rule of the knowledgeable may be better than democracy, and that it's time to experiment and find out. A challenging critique of democracy and the first sustained defense of the rule of the knowledgeable, Against Democracy is essential reading for scholars and students of politics across the disciplines. Featuring a new preface that situates the book within the current political climate and discusses other alternatives beyond epistocracy, Against Democracy is a challenging critique of democracy and the first sustained defense of the rule of the knowledgeable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ND_BDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pleading guilty","description":"The star litigator from a top-notch law firm has gone missing , along with 5.6 million dollars from a class-action settlement, and \\"Mack\\" Malloy, a foul-mouthed ex-cop and partner-on-the-wane must find both.

This book is the revised James Legge translation which has been extensively reworked and restored compared to the freely available Legge translations. The Analects, also known as the Analects of Confucius, is the collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher Confucius and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been written by Confucius' followers. It is believed to have been written during the Warring States period (475 BC221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the Analects was considered merely a \\"commentary\\" on the Five Classics, but the status of the Analects grew to be one of the central texts of Confucianism by the end of that dynasty. During the late Song dynasty (960-1279) the importance of the Analects as a philosophy work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the \\"Four Books\\". The Analects has been one of the most widely read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and East Asian thought and values today. Confucius (551479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher of the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZvJBBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mammal Remains from Archaeological Sites: Southeastern and Southwestern United States (Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pBYrzgEACAAJ&dq=Mammal+Remains+from+Archaeological+Sites:+Southeastern+and+Southwestern+United+States+(Papers+of+the+Peabody+Museum+of+Archaeology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Waves (Vintage Classics)","description":"The Waves is an astonishingly beautiful and poetic novel.

Apollonius of Rhodes wrote the best-known version, in Greek, in the third century B.C.E. The Latin poet Gaius Valerius Flaccus began his own interpretation of the story in the first century of the Christian era, but he died before completing it. With The Voyage of the \\"Argo,\\" the acclaimed poet and translator David Slavitt recovers for modern readers the only surviving work of this little-known writer. The result is an engaging rendition of Jason's adventures, of particular interest when compared to the Greek version of the story. While Apollonius' tale offers a subtle psychological study of Medea, Valerius Flaccus' achievement is to present Jason as a more complete and compelling heroic figure. Slavitt, for one, enjoyed the rediscovery immensely and he invites his readers to do the same. \\"I am content to let my rendition into English speak for Valerius, but for those whom I imagine standing in an aisle of a library or bookstore, trying to decide, I can offer some reassurance. This piece is playful, unpredictable, oddly contrarian, sometimes almost mannerist. Valerius' description in book 8 of Medea's putting the serpent to sleep so Jason can filch the fleece involves a gesture no other Latin poet I know would have thought to try a brief moment in Medea's head when she allows herself to feel sorry for the snake . . . It is this kind of droll surprise that drew me to undertake the translation of a work that is not, I freely confess, well known.\\" David Slavitt","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qvAglirCwBsC&dq=The+Voyage+of+the+Argo:+The+Argonautica+of+Gaius+Valerius+Flaccus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just so stories for little children","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n2KbzgEACAAJ&dq=Just+so+stories+for+little+children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aurora 7 (Norton Paperback Fiction)","description":"Young space enthusiast Gregory Noonan skips school to watch Scott Carpenter's Aurora 7 voyage on T.V. in Grand Central Station, crossing paths with an acerbic novelist and a confused priest before his destiny gradually becomes clear","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WkAgAQAAIAAJ&dq=Aurora+7+(Norton+Paperback+Fiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CHRISTIAN SLAVES, MUSLIM MASTERS WHITE SLAVERY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN, THE BARBARY COAST, AND ITALY, 1500-1800","description":"This is a study that digs deeply into this 'other' slavery, the bondage of Europeans by North-African Muslims that flourished during the same centuries as the heyday of the trans-Atlantic trade from sub-Saharan Africa to the Americas.

Shantanu Das is living in the shadows of his past. In his fifties, he finds himself isolated from his traditional Bengali community after a devastating divorce from his wife, Chaitali; he hasn t spoken to his eldest daughter Mitali in months; and most painfully, he lives each day with the regret that he didn t accept his teenaged daughter Keya after she came out as gay. As the anniversary of Keya s death approaches, Shantanu wakes up one morning utterly alone in his suburban New Jersey home and realizes it s finally time to move on. This is when Shantanu discovers a tucked-away box in the attic that could change everything. He calls Mitali and pleads with her to come home. She does so out of pity, not realizing that her life is about to shift. Inside the box is an unfinished manuscript that Keya and her girlfriend were writing. It s a surprising discovery that brings Keya to life briefly. But Neesh Desai, a new love interest for Mitali with regrets of his own, comes up with a wild idea, one that would give Keya more permanence: what if they are to stage the play? It could be an homage to Keya s memory, and a way to make amends. But first, the Dases need to convince Pamela Moore, Keya s girlfriend, to give her blessing. And they have to overcome ghosts from the past they haven t met yet. A story of redemption and righting the wrongs of the past, Keya Das s Second Act is a warmly drawn homage to family, creativity, and second chances. Set in the vibrant world of Bengalis in the New Jersey suburbs, this debut novel is both poignant and, at times, a surprising hilarious testament to the unexpected ways we build family and find love, old and new.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uhhJEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BEARING FRUIT: And Its Significance to Entering the \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\"","description":"In Lancaster, Connecticut, Margaret Adler is gone.

How can I infuse my life with spirituality and build a strong relationship with God? In these probing and inspiring discourses, Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein addresses these other questions. Eschewing simplistic black-and-white approaches, he explores the issues with depth and sensitivity. Based firmly on halakhic sources, yet appreciating the best of Western culture, he presents an ideology marked by balance and complexity. While demanding maximal spiritual attainment, Rabbi Lichtenstein champions tolerance of those with different approaches; and while steeped in the eternal values of Jewish tradition, he remains cognizant of the challenges and opportunities of the contemporary era.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i4cNe1Te438C&dq=By+His+Light:+Character+and+Values+in+the+Service+of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Yeamans-Yeomans-Youmans genealogy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DPdgAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Yeamans-Yeomans-Youmans+genealogy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toledo: A History in Architecture 1835-1890 (Images of America)","description":"The last place most 19th-century settlers wanted to move was the swampy, fever-ridden Toledo area. However, with the assistance of Irish and German immigrants, among others, Toledo was transformed from a village into a thriving city within 50 years. Captured here is the growth and expansion of the area through the indelible contributions of Toledo's architects. In 1850, Toledo had only 3,800 residents, but the introduction of canals and railroads quadrupled the population. Designated as the new county seat, major public buildings and hotels were built. Isaiah Rogers, one of the most famous architects in the nation, designed the Oliver House Hotel; Toledo's first architect, Frank Scott, planned many notable landscapes in the city as well as some of the most interesting houses; and designing almost every major commercial building in the city was Charles Crosby Miller. All of these, as well as David Stine and Edward Fallis, infused Toledo's pride into local landmarks of the past and present, including the Boody House, the Wheeler Opera House, the mansions of Collingwood Avenue, and the churches and breweries that complete Toledo's neighborhoods and downtown.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tmXZS8kQkNsC&dq=Toledo:+A+History+in+Architecture+1835-1890+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Virgin of Bennington (Nova Audio Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QxQQAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Virgin+of+Bennington+(Nova+Audio+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I'm Retiring, Now What?!: Get Your Finances in Order/ Decide Where To Retire/ Healthy Living","description":"CHAKRAS are ancient principles derived from India's oldest text called Vedas originated 2,000 - 6,000 B.C.Another name of CHAKRA is a Wheel. They are also known as pinpoints in your body. Until now they have been known as 7 elements of body which help human being live Happy, Healthy, Harmonious, Peaceful, & Prosperous life when all of them are inline.For example, My grandfather is 93 years old. He practices yoga everyday to align his 7 CHAKRAS. Because, his chakras are aligned he is living a dieses free life.

This book is about aligning your CHAKRAS Of Retirement. This is just one of the CHAKRAS of financial matters.Retirement: It's nice to get out of the rat race, but you have to learn to get along with less cheese. ~Gene PerretNow that quote might be humorous, but it doesn't have to be true. Most people associate retirement with much more than not working. They also think that when you don't go to the office every day you also don't get that paycheck either.Retirement is different things to different people. For those in their 20s, it's a distant dream. For those in their 30s and 40s, it's a minor concern. For those 50 and beyond, it's a reality that must be dealt with. No matter what your age, you should start to prepare for your retirement and the sooner the better. So lets take a ride together and tackle this issue once and for all. Retirement planning is about more than investing and saving. It's also about enjoying your life after you decide to retire from your career or job. To fully enjoy yourself after retirement, you should have a plan on how you will spend your time and where you will live. You probably should start now to get in shape so you will enjoy a healthy retirement. What about your family, how do they fit into your retirement plans? Your retirement plans should go well beyond finances.Many young people don't think that they need to plan for retirement. Heck, I'm only 40 and I don't really think about planning for retirement. But the reality is that there is no time like the present to start thinking about your future. Unless you are near retirement age, you will no doubt procrastinate about planning for your retirement and coming up with a robust strategy. It's probably impossible to expect someone in there twenties to make serious retirement plans. Even those with 15 to 20 years left before retirement might have trouble with firm financial plans. In your twenties, your retirement plans will probably consist of a basic savings program. Retirement is many years away and your thoughts are probably more on buying a house than on retiring. In your thirties, your thoughts might be on sending your children to college and thoughts of retirement are not important. When you reach your forties, you begin the wonder where the years went and start to consider serious planning for when you retire. Here, consider, is the key word. If you're like most people, you consider planning but don't quite get around to it. Then all at once, you are in your fifties and realization hits. You are near retirement age and haven't given any thoughts to how you will afford to quit working and enjoy your retirement years. OK, no matter what your age, there is hope for your retirement plan. Most employers provide a pension plan, the government provides social security, and you might have some investments and real estate. The younger you are the better but with some serious thought, you can pull it off.Of course, first, you'll need to commit yourself to quitting in the first place.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ySaBngEACAAJ&dq=I%27m+Retiring,+Now+What%3F!:+Get+Your+Finances+in+Order/+Decide+Where+To+Retire/+Healthy+Living&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Idea Guide: The Step-By-Step Guide for Planning and Starting Your Own Business","description":"This user-friendly guide is ideal for those who have a business idea or already own a business.

This edition, selected from over 140 volumes in German, is the new standard in English, and contains poetry, drama, fiction, memoir, criticism, and scientific writing by the man who is probably the most influential writer in the German language. The executive editors of this collection are Victor Lange of Princeton University, Eric Blackall of Cornell University, and Cyrus Hamlin of Yale University. Princeton University Press is proud to be the distributor of the twelve volumes in hardcover of the originating publisher, Suhrkamp Verlag. In addition, Princeton will issue paperback reprints of these volumes over the next two years, beginning with volumes one through three. Goethe, the founder of the poetry of experience, created a body of poetry that is unsurpassed in lucidity of speech and imagery and in instinct for melody and rhythm. Nonetheless, many of his poems are relatively unknown to English-speaking audiences, partly because of the difficulties they have posed to translators. This volume contains translations, side by side with the German originals, of Goethe's major poems--all prepared by eminent American and English writers, and all attesting to his poetic genius. Goethe's most complex and profound work, Faust was the effort of the great poet's entire lifetime. Written over 60 years, it can be read as a document of Goethe's moral and artistic development. Faust is made available to the English reader in a completely new translation that communicates both its poetic variety and its many levels of tone. The language is present-day English, and Goethe's formal and rhythmic variety is reproduced in all its richness. The reflections on art and literature that Goethe produced throughout his life are the premise and corollary of his work as poet, novelist, and man of science. This volume contains such important essays as \\"On Gothic Architecture,\\" \\"On the Laocoon Group,\\" and \\"Shakespeare: A Tribute.\\" Several works in this collection appear for the first time unabridged and in fresh translations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LGDW6Df_y_gC&dq=Selected+Poems+(Goethe:+The+Collected+Works,+Vol.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gardening Without Stress and Strain","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DvHTYgEACAAJ&dq=Gardening+Without+Stress+and+Strain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Samsara","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wb-zAQAACAAJ&dq=Samsara&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Say It in Hindi (Dover Language Guides Say It Series)","description":"DIVContains over 1,000 useful sentences and phrases for travel or everyday living abroad: food, shopping, medical aid, courtesy, hotels, travel, and other situations. /div","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4VK8AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Batman: Dark Legends","description":"/Bryan Talbot, Alan Grant, Dennis O'Neil /and Dan Raspler /Brett Blevins, Arthur Ransom & Mike Mignola, illustrator Batman's moodiest thrillers, from the early days of his crimefighting career, are collected in this new volume.

The Eighth Edition provides mathematically sound and comprehensive coverage of the topics considered essential in a basic college math course. Furthermore, the Instructor's Annotated Edition features a comprehensive selection of instructor support material. The Aufmann Interactive Method is incorporated throughout the text, ensuring that students interact with and master the concepts as they are presented. This approach is especially important in the context of rapidly growing distance-learning and self-paced laboratory situations. Study Tips margin notes provide point-of-use advice and refer students back to the AIM for Success preface for support where appropriate. Integrating Technology margin notes provide suggestions for using a calculator in certain situations. For added support and quick reference, a scientific calculator screen is displayed on the inside back cover of the text. Aufmann Interactive Method (AIM) Every section objective contains one or more sets of matched-pair examples that encourage students to interact with the text. The first example in each set is completely worked out; the second example, called 'You Try It,' is for the student to work. By solving the You Try It, students practice concepts as they are presented in the text. Complete worked-out solutions to these examples in an appendix enable students to check their solutions and obtain immediate reinforcement of the concept. While similar texts offer only final answers to examples, the Aufmann texts' complete solutions help students identify their mistakes and prevent frustration. Integrated learning system organized by objectives. Each chapter begins with a list of learning objectives that form the framework for a complete learning system. The objectives are woven throughout the text (in Exercises, Chapter Tests, and Cumulative Reviews) and also connect the text with the print and multimedia ancillaries. This results in a seamless, easy-to-navigate learning system. AIM for Success Student Preface explains what is required of a student to be successful and demonstrates how the features in the text foster student success. AIM for Success can be used as a lesson on the first day of class or as a project for students to complete. The Instructor's Resource Manual offers suggestions for teaching this lesson. Study Tip margin notes throughout the text also refer students back to the Student Preface for advice. Prep Tests at the beginning of each chapter help students prepare for the upcoming material by testing them on prerequisite material learned in preceding chapters. The answers to these questions can be found in the Answer Appendix, along with a reference (except for chapter 1) to the objective from which the question was taken, which encourages students who miss a question to review the objective. Extensive use of applications that use real source data shows students the value of mathematics as a real-life tool. Focus on Problem Solving section at the end of each chapter introduces students to various problem-solving strategies. Students are encouraged to write their own strategies and draw diagrams in order to find solutions. These strategies are integrated throughout the text. Several open-ended problems are included, resulting in more than one right answer and strengthening problem-solving skills. Unique Verbal/Mathematical connection is achieved by simultaneously introducing a verbal phrase with a mathematical operation. Exercises following the presentation of a new operation require that students make a connection between a phrase and a mathematical process. Projects and Group Activities at the end of each chapter offer ideas for cooperative learning. Ideal as extra-credit assignments, these projects cover various aspects of mathematics, including the use of calculators, collecting data from the Internet, data analysis, and extended applications. Eduspace helps instructors take the proven Aufmann Interactive Method to the next level. Eduspace provides instructors with online courses and content in multiple disciplines.

In Huxley's darkly satiric yet chillingly prescient imagining of a \\"utopian\\" future, humans are genetically designed and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively serve a ruling order. A powerful work of speculative fiction that has enthralled and terrified readers for generations, it remains remarkably relevant to this day as both a warning to be heeded and as a thought-provoking yet satisfying entertainment. This deluxe edition also includes the nonfiction work \\"Brave New World Revisited,\\" \\"a thought-jabbing, terrifying book\\" (Chicago Tribune), first published in 1958.

In this chronicle, Norris remembers the education she received, both formal and fortuitous; the influence of her mentor Betty Kray, who shunned the spotlight while serving as a guiding force in the poetry world of the late 20th century; her encounters with such figures as James Merrill, Jim Carroll, Denise Levertov, Stanley Kunitz, Patti Smith, and Erica Jong; and her eventual decision to leave Manhattan for the less-crowded landscape she described so memorably in Dakota. This account of the making of a young writer will resonate with anyone who has stumbled bravely into a bigger world and found the poetry that lurks on rooftops and in railroad apartments and with anyone who has enjoyed the blessings of inspiring teachers and great friends.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ex1z1P3WCVQC&dq=The+Virgin+of+Bennington&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Capital Markets: Institutions and Instruments (2nd Edition)","description":"Fabozzi and Modigliani describe all phases of the capital market, including the instruments, institutions and valuation of instruments.

Fly fishing has a long and storied history. While many flyfishermen will find and purchase their favorite fly rod, there are those who desire to go a step further. For those discerning flyfishermen and women, simply buying a rod is not enough they must build one. And just as fly fishing is an art, so is the creation of the bamboo fly rod. Many people believe that the best-feeling rods, particularly for trout fishing, are made from bamboo, and today s bamboo rod-making tradition is particularly indebted to one man: Everett E. Garrison. Using principles he learned as an engineering student, Garrison created an exacting method of building rod a method that for decades was a well-kept secret. These techniques are presented to the reader in A Master s Guide to Building a Bamboo Fly Rod, a classic volume written by Hoagy B. Carmichael to honor and maintain Garrison s legacy. Completely illustrated with black-and-white drawings and over three hundred and sixty black-and-white photographs, along with copious notes on the mathematical and engineering principles that underlie Garrison s unique rod-making technique, this book will guide you through each step of creating a classic bamboo fly rod. Skyhorse Publishing is proud to publish a broad range of books for fishermen. Our books for anglers include titles that focus on fly fishing, bait fishing, fly-casting, spin casting, deep sea fishing, and surf fishing. Our books offer both practical advice on tackle, techniques, knots, and more, as well as lyrical prose on fishing for bass, trout, salmon, crappie, baitfish, catfish, and more.

Owton begins by framing how poetry can appeal to all of the senses, how it can offer readers a shared experience of the world and why poetry should be used as a research approach. Chapters explore various aspects of poetic inquiry including poetry as data, turning data into poetry, poetry as literature review and poetry as reflective writing. The final chapters consider how one might draw on characterising traits to judge poetic inquiry, and how poetry might resonate with audiences to effect wider dissemination of research. This interdisciplinary exploration will be of interest to scholars in psychology, sociology, social work, and literature, as well as to medical and sports practitioners.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Cds1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Piece of My Heart","description":"In the latest thrilling collaboration from #1 New York Times bestselling author and  Queen of Suspense  Mary Higgins Clark and Alafair Burke, television producer Laurie Moran must solve the kidnapping of her fianc e s nephew just days before her wedding.

A boy stands on the roadside on his way to London, alone in the rain. No memories, beyond what he can hold in his hands at any given moment. No directions, as written words have long since been forbidden. No parents--just a melody that tugs at him, a thread to follow.

The world around Simon sings, each movement a pulse of rhythm, each object weaving its own melody, music ringing in every drop of air. Welcome to the world of The Chimes. Here, life is orchestrated by a vast musical instrument that renders people unable to form new memories. The past is a mystery, each new day feels the same as the last, and before is blasphony. But slowly, inexplicably, Simon is beginning to remember. He emerges from sleep each morning with a pricking feeling, and sense there is something he urgently has to do. In the city Simon meets Lucien, who has a gift for hearing, some secrets of his own, and a theory about the danger lurking in Simon's past.

But as Dr. Toon, an able historian who specializes in the Puritan era, shows in this book, John Owen was even more than just a great theologian. He exercised a profound influence on youth as Dean of Christ Church, and Vice Chancellor in the University of Oxford; he was also a statesman of no mean order, whose wisdom often prevented excesses into which his contemporaries would have fallen in their untampered zeal; but above all, he was a spiritual shepherd with a true pastor s heart who delighted in nothing so much as to feed the flock of God. Dr. Toon, who has been engaged for over four years on almost continuous research, has produced a volume full of new information as well as an assessment of the tremendous influence of this outstanding leader. The current worldwide interest in the Puritan period underlines the timeliness and importance of this new work. John Owen achieved national recognition when at the comparatively early age of thirty he preached before the House of Commons at St. Margaret s, Westminster. Yet his achievements would eventually be recorded in higher archives than any mere earthly ones, for he was to become a revered and redoubtable servant of the King of kings. Like many other renowned servants of God, John Owen cared little for personal aggrandizement and by his own command not one of his diaries has been preserved; and since the extant letters in which he lays bare his soul are very few, his biographer is hard put to find those personal touches which have helped to establish biography as an important part of English literature. Nevertheless this carefully researched study has been produced to help meet the need for a fuller life of this remarkable man.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WEZPDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead Soul","description":"Chichikov, an amusing and often confused schemer, buys deceased serfs' names from landholders' poll tax lists hoping to mortgage them for profit","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XKxvQFyoGyQC&dq=Dead+Soul&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Birthday Monsters!

Grant's mastery was never more appar-ent than during his last battle.

Both suffered ridicule and abuse as they participated in the national pastime. Nevertheless, each excelled. Greenberg became one of the preeminent sluggers of the 1930s and 1940s who took a break from baseball to serve in the war. Robinson, from the mid-1940s into the following decade, helped bring back speed and a thinking man s approach to the game, both of which had largely been discarded for a generation. Two Pioneers presents these remarkable players  experiences while competing in a nation that was deeply divided on social issues such as anti-Semitism and racism. Both men earned nearly as much attention off the field as they did on it. Greenberg called into question the idea of a \\"master race  as Adolf Hitler rose to power and gained supporters all over the world. Likewise, Robinson contested racial notions regarding the supposed inferiority of people of African ancestry, even though segregationists proved determined to maintain social barriers separating blacks and whites. It is only fitting that when Robinson finally crossed baseball s color line, Greenberg was one of the first players to welcome him publicly. Robert Cottrell s well-researched work shows how two baseball superstars became important figures in the civil rights crusade to ensure that all Americans, no matter their religion or race, are given equal opportunity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3BUDWrdl8wgC&dq=Hank+Greenberg+(Baseball+Hall+of+Fame+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nazi connection","description":"When Hitler published Mein Kampf in 1924, he held up a foreign law as a model for his program of racial purification: The U.S. Immigration Restriction Act of 1924, which prohibited the immigration of those with hereditary illnesses and entire ethnic groups. When the Nazis took power in 1933, they installed a program of eugenics--the attempted \\"improvement\\" of the population through forced sterilization and marriage controls--that consciously drew on the U.S. example. By then, many American states had long had compulsory sterilization laws for \\"defectives,\\" upheld by the Supreme Court in 1927. Small wonder that the Nazi laws led one eugenics activist in Virginia to complain, \\"The Germans are beating us at our own game.\\" In The Nazi Connection, Stefan K hl uncovers the ties between the American eugenics movement and the Nazi program of racial hygiene, showing that many American scientists actively supported Hitler's policies. After introducing us to the recently resurgent problem of scientific racism, K hl carefully recounts the history of the eugenics movement, both in the United States and internationally, demonstrating how widely the idea of sterilization as a genetic control had become accepted by the early twentieth century. From the first, the American eugenicists led the way with radical ideas. Their influence led to sterilization laws in dozens of states--laws which were studied, and praised, by the German racial hygienists. With the rise of Hitler, the Germans enacted compulsory sterilization laws partly based on the U.S. experience, and American eugenists took pride in their influence on Nazi policies. K hl recreates astonishing scenes of American eugenicists travelling to Germany to study the new laws, publishing scholarly articles lionizing the Nazi eugenics program, and proudly comparing personal notes from Hitler thanking them for their books. Even after the outbreak of war, he writes, the American eugenicists frowned upon Hitler's totalitarian government, but not his sterilization laws. So deep was the failure to recognize the connection between eugenics and Hitler's genocidal policies, that a prominent liberal Jewish eugenicist who had been forced to flee Germany found it fit to grumble that the Nazis \\"took over our entire plan of eugenic measures.\\" By 1945, when the murderous nature of the Nazi government was made perfectly clear, the American eugenicists sought to downplay the close connections between themselves and the German program. Some of them, in fact, had sought to distance themselves from Hitler even before the war. But Stefan K hl's deeply documented book provides a devastating indictment of the influence--and aid--provided by American scientists for the most comprehensive attempt to enforce racial purity in world history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UGYfRv3DWuQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ANSEL ADAMS: CLASSIC IMAGES.","description":"A beautiful collection of Adams' work, hand-picked by himself--a last statement portfolio to represent his life's work. 76 duotones.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0poIMQAACAAJ&dq=ANSEL+ADAMS:+CLASSIC+IMAGES.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Family, Dependence, and the Origins of the Welfare State: Britain and France, 1914-1945","description":"A comparative analysis of social policies in Britain and France between 1914 and 1945.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wjWaVKIH57wC&dq=Family,+Dependence,+and+the+Origins+of+the+Welfare+State:+Britain+and+France,+1914-1945&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Designers Guide to Color 3","description":"1000's of colour combinations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sHrJ8DNWcKEC&dq=Designers+Guide+to+Color+3&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Only Love (Number, 114)","description":"For the better part of three decades romance comics were an American institution.

The meddling mothers of the Regency would do anything to wed their daughters to Andrew Carrington, the wealthy, handsome, and athletic heir to an earldom. There is one problem, however. No woman in all England would suit the determined bachelor, for Andrew far prefers the company of men at his table and in his bedroom. But with privilege comes responsibility. Andrew must take a bride. And while Phyllida Lewis, the penniless, spirited, and curvaceous author of romantic novels, is not quite what his family had in mind, a marriage to her would enable Andrew to live his life as he pleases. The arrival of Matthew Thornby, the honorable and dashing son of a self-made baronet, into their cozy arrangement makes Andrew's happiness complete. Yet a shrewd enemy is waiting in the wings, threatening to expose them all an act that will surely lead to scandal and ruin.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GcV5dfB6JXwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shared Spirits: Wildlife and Native Americans (Religion and Spirituality)","description":"Teaching Spirits offers a thematic approach to Native American religious traditions. Through years of living with and learning about Native traditions across the continent, Joseph Epes Brown learned firsthand of the great diversity of the North American Indian cultures. Yet within this great multiplicity, he also noticed certain common themes that resonate within many Native traditions. These themes include a shared sense of time as cyclical rather than linear, a belief that landscapes are inhabited by spirits, a rich oral tradition, visual arts that emphasize the process of creation, a reciprocal relationship with the natural world, and the rituals that tie these themes together. Brown illustrates each of these themes with in-depth explorations of specific native cultures including Lakota, Navajo, Apache, Koyukon, and Ojibwe. Brown was one of the first scholars to recognize that Native religions-rather than being relics of the past-are vital traditions that tribal members shape and adapt to meet both timeless and contemporary needs. Teaching Spirits reflects this view, using examples from the present as well as the past. For instance, when writing about Plains rituals, he describes not only building an impromptu sweat lodge in a Denver hotel room with Black Elk in the 1940s, but also the struggles of present-day Crow tribal members to balance Sun Dances and vision quests with nine-to-five jobs. In this groundbreaking work, Brown suggests that Native American traditions demonstrate how all components of a culture can be interconnected-how the presence of the sacred can permeate all lifeways to such a degree that what we call religion is integrated into all of life's activities. Throughout the book, Brown draws on his extensive personal experience with Black Elk, who came to symbolize for many the richness of the imperiled native cultures. This volume brings to life the themes that resonate at the heart of Native American religious traditions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wZozjvBdPB0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (Broadview Edition)","description":"The fourteenth-century poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is one of the greatest classics of English literature, but one of the least accessible to most twentieth-century readers.

As the twentieth century began, he was collecting and publishing the recollections of old-timers who had participated in making Texas history. This book combines two of Biggers s works, History That Will Never Be Repeated> (1901) and Pictures of the Past (1902) both rare and coveted by collectors of Texana. The two, republished in 1991 as a Book Club of Texas special edition and trade clothbound edition, are now available in paperback for the first time. For Pictures of the Past the author wove old buffalo hunters  stories into descriptions of the herds, the slaughter, Indian incidents, Fort Griffin, the battle at Adobe Walls, and much more. History That Will Never Be Repeated records lore of the cattle industry in West Texas from 1876. In these vivid accounts by cowboys and ranchers are some of the most emblematic events of the American West riding line, working roundup, turning a drift herd recalled not for their romance but for their hardship and for the sheer endurance required of the men who lived them.

Gruzinski analyses the process of colonization that took place in native Indian societies over three centuries, focusing on disruptions to the Indian s memory, changes in their perception of reality, the spread of the European idea of the supernatural and the Spanish colonists  introduction of alphabetical script which the Indians had to combine with their own traditional  oral and pictorial  forms of communication. Gruzinski discusses the Indians  often awkward initiation into writing, their assimilation of Spanish culture, and their subsequent reinterpretation of their own past and recovers the changing Indian perceptions of the sacred and their  absorption  of elements from the Christian tradition. The Conquest of Mexico is a major work of cultural history which reconstructs a crucial episode in the European colonization of the New World.

In the years that followed, however, detective fiction in America saw no significant progress as a literary genre. Much to the dismay of moral crusaders like Anthony Comstock, dime novels and other sensationalist publications satisfied the public s hunger for a yarn. Things changed as the century waned, and eventually the detective was reborn as a figure of American literature. In part these changes were due to a combination of social conditions, including the rise and decline of the police as an institution; the parallel development of private detectives; the birth of the crusading newspaper reporter; and the beginnings of forensic science. Influential, too, was the new role model offered by a wildly popular British import named Sherlock Holmes. Focusing on the late 19th century and early 20th, this volume covers the formative years of American detective fiction. Instructors considering this book for use in a course may request an examination copy here.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eprIfmj-GukC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On black nationalism and self-determination","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zQWczAEACAAJ&dq=On+black+nationalism+and+self-determination&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Body Snatchers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aY3ZJgAACAAJ&dq=Body+Snatchers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oxford Handbook of Free Will (Oxford Handbooks in Philosophy)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Legend of the Celtic Stone (Caledonia Series, Book 1)","description":"When a legendary stone is stolen from Westminster Abbey, Great Britain is set astir.

The places and the principals involved change, but the messages calling people to turn from lives of violence and sin and to seek repentance are remarkably similar. By focusing on the most widely known and documented appearances and presenting them in chronological order, the events and the messages emerge in a powerful way. Swann shows how advances in science have placed the apparitions in a more intriguing light. One of the historic challenges concerning them was how could something which was not there be there in a way that registered on the eye mechanisms. The discovery of holography, where images that appear to be three-dimensional having bulk, shape and mass, images that can even be photographed, has provided an analogy that enlarges our perception of the physical laws and challenges the skeptics' verdict of hallucination. Catholic or not, religious or not, believer or not, this fascinating and compelling account of the appearances of Mary challenges readers to reflect on the messages and their possible consequences for our civilization and for our future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NetqDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"IN A GERMAN PENSION.","description":"In a German Pension captures the youthful views of esteemed writer, Katherine Mansfield, who jumpstarted her illustrious career with a series of remarkable short stories.

The authors track its predecessors, describe its several components, and assess their theological significance within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Four principal sections are discussed, along with attendant controversies associated with each. The Book of Moses purports to be a Mosaic narrative missing from the biblical version of Genesis. Too little treated in the scholarship on Mormonism, these chapters, produced only months after the Book of Mormon was published, actually contain the theological nucleus of Latter-day Saint doctrines as well as a virtual template for the Restoration Joseph Smith was to effect. In The Pearl of Greatest Price, the author covers three principal parts that are the focus of many of the controversies engulfing Mormonism today. These parts are The Book of Abraham, The Book of Moses, and The Joseph Smith History. Most controversial of all is the Book of Abraham, a production that arose out of a group of papyri Smith acquired, along with four mummies, in 1835. Most of the papyri disappeared in the great Chicago Fire, but surviving fragments have been identified as Egyptian funerary documents. This has created one of the most serious challenges to Smith's prophetic claims the LDS church has faced. LDS scholars, however, have developed several frameworks for vindicating the inspiration of the resulting narrative and Smith's calling as a prophet. The author attempts to make sense of Smith's several, at times divergent, accounts of his First Vision, one of which is canonized as scripture. He also assesses the creedal nature of Smith's \\"Articles of Faith,\\" in the context of his professed anti-creedalism. In sum, this study chronicles the volume's historical legacy and theological indispensability to the Latter-day Saint tradition, as well as the reasons for its resilience and future prospects in the face of daunting challenges.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iParDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Dont Care If I Never Come Back","description":"Two friends take a wild month-long road trip to hit every Major League Baseball stadium in America:  A fun ride  (The Boston Globe).

Kidd shows, Henry cherished a vision of America as a virtuous republic with a clearly circumscribed central government. These ideals brought him into bitter conflict with other Founders and were crystallized in his vociferous opposition to the U.S. Constitution. In Patrick Henry, Kidd pulls back the curtain on one of our most radical, passionate Founders, showing that until we understand Henry himself, we will neglect many of the Revolution's animating values.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ajq6duOCLgcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Darkness Within","description":"A gripping new crime novel from the global bestseller Cathy Glass writing as Lisa Stone  The Darkness Within hooked me from the start.

Wedding design expert Karen Bussen highlights these elements as she shows couples how to design their own weddings without going crazy or broke. Simple Stunning Weddings is the first wedding design book to focus on the where of the wedding. Location is the first and most important decision brides and grooms must make: everything else flows from that. Bussen showcases 12 popular wedding settings, including the city loft, country inn, art gallery, botanic garden, and private club, and demonstrates how to make them extraordinary. With the site as the starting point, she creates unifying themes with color, flowers, and personal touches.

There were no survivors of the crash and 257 people lost their lives. The New Zealand Government appointed me to be a Royal Commissioner of Inquiry to investigate the disaster and to report to the Government my opinion to the cause ... The aircraft was navigated by the inertial navigation system which has for many years dispensed with the need for human navigators on commercial flights ... The INS on this DC10 was found to have been operating accurately during the flight, so the aircrew had always known where they were. But following the disaster there were many senior pilots in Air New Zealand who suspected that the standard flight track to Antarctica had not been the flight track which had been typed into the aircraft computer on the morning of the flight. They believed that the standard flight track had been changed without the knowledge of the crew.

The first two are diagnostic: how far are there legitimate grounds for concern about public support for democracy world-wide? Are trends towards growing cynicism evident in the United States evident in many established and newer democracies? The second concern is analytical: what are the main political, economic, and cultural factors driving the dynamics of support for democratic government? The final questions are prescriptive: what are the consequences of this analysis and what are the implications for strengthening democratic governance? This book has brought together a distinguished group of international scholars who develop a global analysis of these issues that looks at trends in establishes and newer democracies as we approach the end of the twentieth century. It also presents the first results of the 1995-7 World Values Study as well as drawing on an extensive range of comparative empirical evidence. Challenging the conventional wisdom, this original and stimulating book concludes that accounts of a democratic \`crisis' are greatly exaggerated. By the mid-1990s most citizens world-wide shared widespread aspirations to the ideals and principles of democratic government. At the same time there remains a marked gap between evaluations of the ideal and the practice of democracy. The public in many newer democracies in Central and Eastern Europeand in Latin America proved deeply critical of the performance of their governing regimes. And in many established democracies the 1980s saw a decline in public confidence in the core institutions of representative democracy including parliaments, the legal system, and political parties. The book considers the causes and consequences of the development of critical citizens. It will prove invaluable for those interested in comparative politics, public opinion, and the dynamics of the democratization process. ADVANCE PRAISE \`The great democratic paradox of the 1990s is that it has simultaneously been the decade of democratization and the decade of growing distrust of democratic institutions. This volume admirably dissects the complex and multi-dimensional background of these conflicting trends, and presents a judicious evaluation of the grounds of optimism and pessimism--in which, fortunately, the former prevails.' AREND LIJPHART, University of California San Diego \`Critical Citizens is the most comprehensive collection of comparative work on confidence in government and sources of public support for democracy. I strongly recommend it.' SEYMOUR MARTIN LIPSET, George mason University \`Pippa Norris and her colleagues examine claims and counter-claims about the erosion of public confidence in democracy, describe the depth and dynamics of trust in government, and lay out a broad and differentiated approach to the phenomenon. They sort out the rather highdegree of support for democracy from widespread uneasiness with the workings of instituions and with the behaviour of politicians. Their book is must reading for survey researchers and comparative students of democracy alike.' SIDNEY TARROW, Cornell University \`This is the most impressive comparative study of how citizens in contemporay democracies relate to their governments. In an age of expanding democratic institutions around the globe, the authors of Critical Citizens capture the reader's interest and provide a masterful update on one of the critical issues of our time.' CHRISTOPHER J. ANDERSON, Binghamton University (SUNY) \`It is the Civic Culture study 40 years later . . .Critical Citizens is a landmark comparative study of trends in attitudes toward nation, government regime, political institutions, and leaders, in some forty regionally well-distributed countries, bringing together the resaerch of a cross-national team of social scientists, led by Pippa Norris ofthe Harvard Kennedy School. It is full of theoretically interesting insights, as well as findings that have an important bearing on public policy.'

In much the same way that Westerners analyze their personalities and predict their futures by studying the positions of the stars under which they were born, Asians use the ancient animal zodiac to explain individual personalities and predict their futures. Originally the Chinese zodiac, this custom spread to all corners of East Asia. According to legend, the twelve years in the Asian animal cycles were named for the twelve animals who visited Buddha on his deathbed: the rat, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, cock, dog, and boar. This informative and delightful book examines each animal of the zodiacal cycle and describes its history, its virtues and flaws, its \\"all-too-human characteristics.\\" Traditional tales from China, Japan, Korea, Tibet, and Vietnam illustrate each animal's personality as the people of those nations see it. With carts, descriptions, and stories in this zodiac book, the Western reader too may find useful wisdom in the Asian animal zodiac.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kZHTAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Is Fred Dead?

What role, if any, should race play in our moral obligations to others and to ourselves? Ethics along the Color Line addresses the question of whether black Americans should think of each other as members of an extended racial family and base their treatment of each other on this consideration, or eschew racial identity and envision the day when people do not think in terms of race. Anna Stubblefield suggests furthermore that white Americans should consider the same issues. She argues, finally, that for both black and white Americans, thinking of races as families is crucial in helping to combat anti-black oppression.Stubblefield is concerned that the philosophical debate--argued notably between Kwame Anthony Appiah and Lucius Outlaw--over whether or not we should strongly identify in terms of race, and whether or not we should take race into account when we decide how to treat each other, has stalled. Drawing on black feminist scholarship about the moral importance of thinking and acting in terms of community and extended family, the author finds that strong racial identification, if based on appropriate ideals, is morally sound and even necessary to end white supremacy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qTCRTCCv1G4C&dq=Ethics+Along+the+Color+Line&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ONCE UPON A TIME (Loveswept)","description":"A modern-day Prince Charming finds his Cinderella in a woman struggling to escape her memories of a former lover, with the help of one glass shoe","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lo1CHqorw94C&dq=ONCE+UPON+A+TIME+(Loveswept)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gay Sex Quotes","description":"In this collection of over 500 quotations, gay sex is the focus, and a far-ranging group of commentators are the speakers.

An omnibus for children. Containing The Live Dolls House Party, The Live Dolls busy days; The Live Dolls in wonderland.","description":"Beginning in the mid nineteenth century in America, childhood became synonymous with innocence--a reversal of the previously- dominant Calvinist belief that children were depraved, sinful creatures. As the idea of childhood innocence took hold, it became racialized: popular culture constructed white children as innocent and vulnerable while excluding black youth from these qualities. Actors, writers, and visual artists then began pairing white children with African American adults and children, thus transferring the quality of innocence to a variety of racial-political projects--a dynamic that Robin Bernstein calls \\"racial innocence.\\" This phenomenon informed racial formation from the mid nineteenth century through the early twentieth, while enabling sharply divergent political agendas to appear, paradoxically, to be innocuous, natural, normal, and therefore justified. Racial Innocence takes up a rich archive including books, toys, theatrical props, and domestic knickknacks which Bernstein analyzes as \\"scriptive things\\" that invite or prompt historically-located practices while allowing for resistance and social improvisation. Integrating performance studies with literary and visual analysis, Bernstein offers singular readings of theatrical productions, literary works, material culture including Topsy pincushions and Raggedy Ann dolls, and visual texts ranging from fine portraiture to advertisements for lard substitute. Throughout, Bernstein shows how \\"innocence\\" gradually became the exclusive province of white children--until the Civil Rights Movement succeeded not only in legally desegregating public spaces, but in culturally desegregating the concept of childhood itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kbIUCgAAQBAJ&dq=The+live+dolls+in+Wonderland.+An+omnibus+for+children.+Containing+The+Live+Dolls+House+Party,+The+Live+Dolls+busy+days%3B+The+Live+Dolls+in+wonderland.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Good, the Great, and the Awesome: The Top 40 High Sierra Rock Climbs (Eastern Sierra Climbing Guides Ser. 4)","description":"A guide to the best alpine rock climbs in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California.

The authors of JavaScript books are probably some of the brightest people around. And maybe that's the problem. Maybe they don't know how to relate to those of us who may sometimes struggle to learn. My sister is a wonderful dancer. I dance like Bill Gates. She says, \\"C'mon, dancing is easy!\\" Yeah, for her, but not for Bill and me. She'll never teach me to dance until she understands that dancing isn't easy for me. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder doesn't matter. Plenty of veterans have told me, \\"I wish someone had used this approach to teach me [HTML, PHP, jQuery, C#, Ruby, Java, Python-fill in the blank].\\" Experienced or not, you'll probably like my book if you find other books too dense, too technical, and too unsympathetic to the learner's needs. What you'll especially like, I think, is that the book is just the tip of the iceberg. The larger part is the abundance of interactive exercises that encourage you to practice, practice, practice. You'll agree, I think, that without practice, a coding student might as well be reading a novel. One caveat: If you're an older programmer who has established ways of doing things, you may get bent out of shape by my insistence that you do some things that aren't habitual for you. If you think this might be a problem, please try the free sample of the book before you buy it. Then do a few of the interactive exercises. You'll soon know whether you can tolerate being pushed around by me. Here's what's different about my book: Testing showed that books and courses load up the reader with far too much information at a time. So I divide up the information into little chunks that won't overwhelm anyone. A book on coding doesn't have to be written in impenetrable legalese. It can actually be human-readable. My book is. Most people learn best through examples, so I provide plenty of them. Most important, before you have a chance to forget what you've read in the book, I ask you to fire up your desktop or laptop (not your mobile device) and head over to my website, where you run a set of interactive exercises, practicing everything you've learned-until you're sure you've mastered it. Readers tell me they often start the exercises thinking they know the material cold. and quickly find out they don't. The automated exercise manager keeps you at it until your overconfidence becomes real confidence-confidence that's based on your excellent performance. There are 1,750 exercises in all. They're all interactive, with an automated answer-checker that corrects your missteps and points you in the right direction when you stumble. And they're all free. Readers tell me the combination of book and interactive exercises is involving, fun, frustration-free, addictive, confidence-building, and...well, read the reviews.

Yamashita s Hawai i Regional Cuisine: The Food Movement That Changed the Way Hawai i Eats is the first in-depth study on the origins, philosophy, development, and legacy of Hawai i Regional Cuisine (HRC). The book is based on interviews with thirty-six chefs, farmers, retailers, culinary arts educators, and food writers, as well as on nearly everything written about the HRC chefs in the national and local media. Yamashita follows the history of this important regional movement from its origins in 1991 through the following decades, offering a boldly original analysis of its cuisine and impact on the islands. The founding group of twelve chefs Sam Choy, Roger Dikon, Mark Ellman, Amy Ferguson Ota, Beverly Gannon, Jean-Marie Josselin, George Mavrothalassitis, Peter Merriman, Philippe Padovani, Gary Strehl, Alan Wong, and Roy Yamaguchi grandly announced in August 1991 the establishment of what they called Hawai i Regional Cuisine. At the time, they had no idea how dramatically they would change the food scene in the islands. While they each had their own style, their common commitment to using fresh, locally sourced ingredients of the highest quality at their restaurants quickly attracted the interest of journalists writing for national newspapers and magazines. The final chapters close with a discussion of the leading chefs of the next generation and an assessment of HRC's impact on farming, fishing, ranching, aquaculture, and culinary education in the islands. Hawai i Regional Cuisine will satisfy those who are passionate about food and intrigued by changes in local foodways.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3VnGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Flash: The Return of Barry Allen","description":"As Kid Flash, Wally West idolized Barry Allen, The Flash, and thought he was just about perfect.

How do they stay slender and willowy while maintaining the extraordinary energy it takes to perform night after night? Can a nondancer or an amateur attain a dancer's figure and a dancer's vitality? And keep it? Here, in The Dancers' Body Book, the legendary ballerina Allegra Kent discloses the health, weight-watching, and relaxation secrets of some of the world's greatest ballet dancers -- from Suzanne Farrell and Fernando Bujones to Darci Kistler and Madame Alexandra Danilova. Combining them with two well-balanced diets -- one to lose weight by and one to live by -- and an exercise regimen that can be tailored to the individual, she provides a fabulous fitness program for everyone who longs to be slimmer, healthier, and more energetic. Fourteen varied menus incorporate delicious recipes from the dancers themselves (such as Jacques D'Amboise's Wonderful Dinner Salad and Dierdre Carberry's Almond Meringue Kisses), along with calorie guides and advice on how to create additional menus using your own favorite dishes. Helpful discussions on sports and exercise systems -- ranging from jogging and swimming to the sophisticated \\"Pilates\\" workout -- are also included, and in a special chapter entitled \\"A Healthy Outlook,\\" the dancers talk candidly on such issues as smoking, anorexia, vitamins, doctors, massage, junk foods, fad diets, and injuries. Dancers take meticulous care of all their equipment because training and performance depend on it.

It s the first essential work of cultural history of the new decade.\\"  Charles Kaiser, The Guardian One of The Washington Post's 50 best nonfiction books of 2021 | A Publishers Weekly best book of 2021 The Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist and New York Timesbestselling author of the behind-the-scenes explorations of the classic American Westerns High Noon and The Searchers now reveals the history of the controversial 1969 Oscar-winning film that signaled a dramatic shift in American popular culture. Director John Schlesinger s Darling was nominated for five Academy Awards, and introduced the world to the transcendently talented Julie Christie. Suddenly the toast of Hollywood, Schlesinger used his newfound clout to film an expensive, Panavision adaptation of Far from the Madding Crowd. Expectations were huge, making the movie s complete critical and commercial failure even more devastating, and Schlesinger suddenly found himself persona non grata in the Hollywood circles he had hoped to conquer. Given his recent travails, Schlesinger s next project seemed doubly daring, bordering on foolish. James Leo Herlihy s novel Midnight Cowboy, about a Texas hustler trying to survive on the mean streets of 1960 s New York, was dark and transgressive. Perhaps something about the book s unsparing portrait of cultural alienation resonated with him. His decision to film it began one of the unlikelier convergences in cinematic history, centered around a city that seemed, at first glance, as unwelcoming as Herlihy s novel itself. Glenn Frankel s Shooting Midnight Cowboy tells the story of a modern classic that, by all accounts, should never have become one in the first place. The film s boundary-pushing subject matter homosexuality, prostitution, sexual assault earned it an X rating when it first appeared in cinemas in 1969. For Midnight Cowboy, Schlesinger who had never made a film in the United States enlisted Jerome Hellman, a producer coming off his own recent flop and smarting from a failed marriage, and Waldo Salt, a formerly blacklisted screenwriter with a tortured past. The decision to shoot on location in New York, at a time when the city was approaching its gritty nadir, backfired when a sanitation strike filled Manhattan with garbage fires and fears of dysentery. Much more than a history of Schlesinger s film, Shooting Midnight Cowboy is an arresting glimpse into the world from which it emerged: a troubled city that nurtured the talents and ambitions of the pioneering Polish cinematographer Adam Holender and legendary casting director Marion Dougherty, who discovered both Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight and supported them for the roles of  Ratso  Rizzo and Joe Buck leading to one of the most intensely moving joint performances ever to appear on screen. We follow Herlihy himself as he moves from the experimental confines of Black Mountain College to the theatres of Broadway, influenced by close relationships with Tennessee Williams and Ana?s Nin, and yet unable to find lasting literary success. By turns madcap and serious, and enriched by interviews with Hoffman, Voight, and others, Shooting Midnight Cowboy: Art, Sex, Loneliness, Liberation, and the Making of a Dark Classic is not only the definitive account of the film that unleashed a new wave of innovation in American cinema, but also the story of a country and an industry beginning to break free from decades of cultural and sexual repression.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5bniDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of African Violets: All About America's Favorite House Plants and How to Make Them Bloom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FY8QLgEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Book+of+African+Violets:+All+About+America%27s+Favorite+House+Plants+and+How+to+Make+Them+Bloom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black nationalism;: A search for an identity in America (A Laurel edition)","description":"An account of the author's view the Nation of Islam at Chicago headquarters and it's importance in serving the Black Nationalism movemen.t u.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d1VmPwAACAAJ&dq=Black+nationalism%3B:+A+search+for+an+identity+in+America+(A+Laurel+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conceptualizing Qualitative Inquiry: Mindwork for Fieldwork in Education and the Social Sciences","description":"What to ask and how to ask it are the basic  problems  of qualitative research.

After a brilliant career in professional kitchens (including a six-year tour as chef de cuisine at Caf  Boulud), he was faced with the harsh reality of life as a civilian cook: no prep cooks, no saucier, no daily deliveries--just him and his wife in their tiny Manhattan-apartment kitchen. Urban Italian is made up of the recipes that result when a great chef has to use the same resources as the rest of us. In these hundred recipes--covering four distinct courses, side dishes, and base recipes--Carmellini shows how to make stunning, soulful food with nothing more than the ingredients, techniques, and time available to the ordinary home cook. The food is sophisticated but also easy to make: lamb meatballs stuffed with goat cheese; veal, beef, and pork ravioli; roast pork with Italian plums and grappa; fennel with Sambuca and orange; and a honey-flavored pine nut cake. The book opens with a narrative (written by Carmellini with his wife and coauthor, Gwen Hyman) that traces Carmellini's culinary education--a series of outrageous tales that will delight anyone who loved Heat or Kitchen Confidential. Also scattered through the book are short pieces on places and ingredients, placed alongside recipes to shed light on the history and practice of simple, beautiful cooking. This is a book you'll find yourself using all the time--to cook from for weeknights and for special occasions, or just to sit down with and read.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UqzcMAAACAAJ&dq=Urban+Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zebra Dazzle: How to Build Stunning Teams","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uz8eAAAACAAJ&dq=Zebra+Dazzle:+How+to+Build+Stunning+Teams&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Connecting Heaven and Earth","description":"Deanna Sulick the author of Connecting Heaven and Earth did and it has changed her life forever.

Yet there are those who insist that the death of six million Jews in Nazi concentration camps is nothing but a hoax perpetrated by a powerful Zionist conspiracy. Sixty years ago, such notions were the province of pseudohistorians who argued that Hitler never meant to kill the Jews, and that only a few hundred thousand died in the camps from disease; they also argued that the Allied bombings of Dresden and other cities were worse than any Nazi offense, and that the Germans were the  true victims  of World War II. For years, those who made such claims were dismissed as harmless cranks operating on the lunatic fringe. But as time goes on, they have begun to gain a hearing in respectable arenas, and now, in the first full-scale history of Holocaust denial, Deborah Lipstadt shows how despite tens of thousands of living witnesses and vast amounts of documentary evidence this irrational idea not only has continued to gain adherents but has become an international movement, with organized chapters,  independent  research centers, and official publications that promote a  revisionist  view of recent history. Lipstadt shows how Holocaust denial thrives in the current atmosphere of value-relativism, and argues that this chilling attack on the factual record not only threatens Jews but undermines the very tenets of objective scholarship that support our faith in historical knowledge. Thus the movement has an unsuspected power to dramatically alter the way that truth and meaning are transmitted from one generation to another.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_yLm_cHp_REC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Overseer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FCYLAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Overseer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disorder and Decline: Crime and the Spiral of Decay in American Neighborhoods","description":"Much has been written about crime and its economic causes, but very little attention has been paid to the social and environmental factors stimulating the appearance and spread of crime.

Not only is it central to ecological health and essential to the economy, it has helped form our culture and serves as a basis of national pride. The heart of America lies in the rock and soil, the mountains and the plains that surround us.In this illuminating portrait of America at the threshold of the new millennium, author Tim Palmer explores and assesses the landscape of the United States -- both timeless wonders of natural beauty and lost places scarred by human exploitation. He takes the reader on an informative and inspirational tour of our most vital landscapes, including mountains, forests, grasslands, deserts, rivers, lakes, wetlands, and seashores. He introduces us to the basic geography and ecological value of each landscape, describes historical patterns of land use, considers the most serious threats, and discusses what is being done to protect the landscape for future generations. Throughout, he instills a deeper understanding of the importance of the land, a sense of outrage at the damage that has been done, and a feeling of hope that those working to correct past abuses will succeed.Weaving together geographical, historical, and ecological information and insights, Palmer draws on thirty years of professional experience as a writer, photographer, conservationist, planner, landscape architect, and veteran traveler to present a fresh look at the past, present, and future of our land.Resounding in its account of these landscapes, compelling in the force of its information and the hope of its timely message, The Heart of America offers a fascinating measure of the land around us and a unique look at the place we call home.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KNON3nhZUrcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The three worlds of Albert Schweitzer (A midland book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xp5qAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+three+worlds+of+Albert+Schweitzer+(A+midland+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moons 2005 Wall Calendar","description":"Your intrepid guide to the art of spellcraft, Power Spellcraft for Life takes you on an in-depth magical journey of personal fulfillment.

Rather, the majority of lynch victims were forcibly seized from police and shot by small bands of carefully organized vigilantes rather than frenzied mobs.

In Created Equal, Michael Nava and Robert Dawidoff argue that the movement for gay equality is central to the continuing defense of individual liberty in America. Beginning with an examination of the determined assault on gay issues by the religious right, the authors show how this sectarian movement to legislate private religious morality into law undermines the purpose of American constitutional government: the protection of the individual's right to determine how best to live his or her life. The book starts from the premise that gay men and lesbians are, first and foremost, American citizens, and then looks to what rights belong to every individual American citizen, arguing from the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Addressing their argument to the great majority of their fellow Americans, Dawidoff and Nava emphasize that what is at stake is not the fate of the gay community, but the future of constitutional principle and the rights of free individuals in American society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G1STBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With grief acquainted","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3mFqQgAACAAJ&dq=With+grief+acquainted&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Reaper","description":"A memoir by a Special Operations Direct Action Sniper traces his extraordinary career during the War on Terror, which was marked by his record-setting deployment to Afghanistan and his face-off against an enemy sniper known only as The Chechnian.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tDq3BQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Reaper&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Selection of Telegu Proverbs: Translated & Explained","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xOD7MgEACAAJ&dq=A+Selection+of+Telegu+Proverbs:+Translated&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Pleasuredome: Inside Las Vegas (Gambling Studies Series)","description":"Briefly traces the history of Las Vegas, describes the people who work and gamble there, and looks at the casinos and how they are run","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j89qQgAACAAJ&dq=Welcome+to+the+Pleasuredome:+Inside+Las+Vegas+(Gambling+Studies+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bride Of The Bad Boy (Blame It On Bob) (Harlequin Desire)","description":"WHAT A WEDDING!

Upon its original publication in 1969, Turkish Delight was a sensation and a scandal. Its graphic language and explicit sex scenes had an explosive effect, but just as revolutionary was its frank, colloquial style. The more straightlaced critics condemned the book, but readers saw a novel that reflected the way that they spoke, thought, and felt. Turkish Delight opens with a screed: a sculptor in his studio, raging against the love he lost and describing, in gory detail, the state of his life since she left him. Our narrator alternates between the story of his relationship with Olga its passion and affection, but also its obsessiveness and abuse and the dark days that followed, as he attempts to recapture what they had when they lived together,  happy as beasts.  The two only reunite during Olga s inexorable and tragic decline into cancer the chemo having taken her hair and rotted her teeth, she will only eat the soft, sweet Turkish Delight that her ex-lover brings to her bedside. In a new translation by Sam Garrett (Herman Koch s The Dinner), readers get a sense of Wolkers s revolutionary style and musical prose, Turkish Delight s particular balance of naked impulse and profound longing.

British Catholic writer and artist Caryll Houselander lovingly explores Mary s intimately human side, depicting Our Lady as a musical instrument who makes divine love known to the world. This refreshed edition is rich and rewarding reading for all Christians who wonder what Mary was really like. While the Second Vatican Council led to a renewed interest in the theology and person of Mary, Caryll Houselander offered a simple yet profound reflection on the Mother of God almost fifteen years before the council began. Confronting the static, surreal  Madonna of the Christmas card,  Houselander provides instead an intuitive, warmly human, and approachable image of the Mother of God. Through the central image of a reed that is played for music, Houselander demonstrates how Mary chose to make herself an instrument for the divine plan, giving her inmost being to the proclamation of God s greatness. In sharing her distinctive vision of Mary, Houselander offers the Mother of God as a model for all people seeking to be instruments of the Divine. The essays and poems in The Reed of God also reflect on the mysteries of Mary s life and her impact on salvation history. In the book s four parts, Houselander explores key events of Mary s life, including her fiat, finding Jesus in the Temple, and the Assumption, as well as the themes of fruitful emptiness and the eternal search for union with God.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tXZNCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Escape!

The cause, a miscommunication between the pilot and the air traffic controller. The pilot radioed, \\"We are now at takeoff,\\" meaning that the plane was lifting off, but the tower controller misunderstood and thought the plane was waiting on the runway. In Fatal Words, Steven Cushing explains how miscommunication has led to dozens of aircraft disasters, and he proposes innovative solutions for preventing them. He examines ambiguities in language when aviation jargon and colloquial English are mixed, when a word is used that has different meanings, and when different words are used that sound alike. To remedy these problems, Cushing proposes a visual communication system and a computerized voice mechanism to help clear up confusing language.

And while there are a plethora of books on the subject, most are either personal accounts of recovery or attempts to explain the disease from only one perspective, be it psychoanalytic, behavioral, cultural, or biological. Now, in this much-needed resource, Dr. Alexander Lucas draws on 40 years of experience, mostly at the Mayo Clinic, to offer clear guidance and authoritative advice on how to overcome anorexia nervosa. Based on his own unique research with thousands of patients, and striking a careful balance between psychological, cultural, and biological approaches, Dr. Lucas demystifies this seemingly irrational disease and guides parents through the harrowing process of recovery. The book defines anorexia, illustrates how it can evolve and how common it really is, and outlines every part of the treatment process, from the early warning signs that parents should watch out for, to the initial evaluation, to specific treatment plans. Dr. Lucas emphasizes the patient's role in defining the healing process, with the support of the family and medical team. Throughout the book, he counsels optimism, stressing that in spite of the destructive power of the disease, most who suffer from anorexia nervosa fully recover and are able to live normal, healthy, and productive lives. For anyone seeking level-headed, medically sound, and comprehensive guidance on the most effective treatments for this life-threatening disorder, Demystifying Anorexia Nervosa offers a wealth of reliable, reassuring information.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kdjhBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adeline's Porcupine","description":"Young Adeline's pet porcupine feels sad because she is not as beautiful as the arrogant city pets, but her inner beauty and compassion help the other pets discover her true worth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ymsBAAAACAAJ&dq=Adeline%27s+Porcupine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dawn And The Halloween Mystery (The Baby-Sitters Club Mystery)","description":"When Dawn witnesses a holdup and Stoneywood's trick-or-treating is called off while the investigations are underway, she and the other members of the We Love Kids Club decide to catch the robber themselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UVT2AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bleeding of the Stone (Interlink World Fiction)","description":"The moufflon, a wild sheep prized for its meat, continues to survive in the remote mountain desert of southern Libya.

Why did so many railroad mergers in the 1950s and 1960s, intended as a panacea for the ills of an outdated system, go sour and, in fact, make a bad situation worse? Saunders addresses these and many other issues in this authoritative history of U.S. railroads and their corporate mergers. Beginning with a wide-ranging analysis of the role of railroads in the economic and social fabric of American life, Saunders traces the causes and results of the twentieth century's \\"merger mania.\\" Mergers, he explains, were expected to save money, to improve service to customers, and to help railroads compete against other modes of transportation, such as the growing airline and trucking industries. Saunders then gives colorful, richly detailed accounts of the mergers and shows the reasons--including corporate greed and the inept blundering of government regulatory agencies--the outcomes fell far short of expectations. Merging Lines explores the impact of shifting political control of railroads as no history has done before. The fates of both workers and railroad companies were dictated by the rise and fall of business and governmental leaders, including Bill Brosnan, Robert R. Young, Alfred Perlman, President John F. Kennedy, and President Lyndon B. Johnson. As power struggles erupted, the original goals of the mergers were thwarted by consumer frustration, violent labor strikes, and organizational collapse. Saunders explores these and other crucial developments in this extensive work, carefully designed for railroad historians and enthusiasts at any level. Encyclopedic in its scope, Merging Lines includes sixty-eight maps, a list of court cases involving railroad mergers, and a wealth of information on American railroads from coast to coast. An extensively revised, updated, and supplemented edition of Saunders's earlier classic, The Railroad Mergers and the Coming of Conrail (1978), it is essential reading for all who are interested in railroad and transportation history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cJdrQgAACAAJ&dq=Merging+Lines+:+American+Railroads,+1900-1970&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE HARD DISK TECHNICAL GUIDE","description":"For information on the basics of hard drive operation, step-by-step installation instructions, or hard drive technical data--like setup specifications, jumper settings, pin assignments, and more--this is an indispensable reference tool.

Are Swedes truly shy, unemotional, conflict-avoiding, melancholy, and dour? Swedish Mentality, the English translation of the hugely successful book published in Sweden in 1989, considers the reality behind the myth. The author, ?ke Daun, is a respected ethnologist who is sometimes referred to as the \\"guru\\" of Swedish character. In recent years, it has become popular to discuss Swedishness and Swedish identity. The advent of the European Union and the increasing presence of immigrant refugees in Sweden have fueled public debate on the distinctiveness of Swedish culture. Daun, however, goes beyond stereotype, drawing upon statistics gathered over more than a decade of research. The result is an entertaining and engagingly written book. Throughout, Daun quotes from interviews with native Swedes and immigrants as well as from travel accounts, folklore, and proverbs. We learn why some Swedes might prefer to walk up a flight of stairs rather than share an elevator with a neighbor and why some gain satisfaction from walking alone in the woods or going fishing. Daun describes a range of factors influencing Swedish character, including population composition, rural background, and even climate. He recognizes behavioral variations related to gender, age, class, and region, and he considers subtleties of individual character as well. Swedish Mentality should interest a wide array of readers, whether of Swedish descent or not.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DVYtCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mystic Sweet Communion","description":"Set in turn-of-the-century Florida, this frontier saga traces the life of Ivy Cromartie Stranahan, the first English-speaking teacher in the region, as she struggles to teach school in the Seminole Nation and lead Indian families to Christ.

Their positions would come to frame national conversation over the role of corporations in American life, determine the relation between the state and society that still controls our thinking about market regulation, and usher in a period of Progressive reform. Connecting the debates of 1912 to some of the most pressing issues of the Progressive Era, this volume presents selected sensational speeches, correspondence between these important figures and their allies and opponents, and 12 lively political cartoons.

John Philip Newell shares the long, hidden tradition of Celtic Christianity, explaining how this earth-based spirituality can help us rediscover the natural rhythms of life and deepen our spiritual connection with God, with each other, and with the earth. Newell introduces some of Celtic Christianity s leading practitioners, both saints and pioneers of faith, whose timeless wisdom is more necessary than ever, including: Pelagius, who shows us how to look beyond sin to affirm our sacredness as part of all God s creation, and courageously stand up for our principles in the face of oppression. Brigid of Kildare, who illuminates the interrelationship of all things and reminds us of the power of the sacred feminine to overcome those seeking to control us. John Muir, who encourages us to see the holiness and beauty of wilderness and what we must do to protect these gifts. Teilhard de Chardin, who inspires us to see how science, faith, and our future tell one universal story that begins with sacredness. By embracing the wisdom of Celtic Christianity, we can learn how to listen to the sacred and see the divine in all of creation and within each of us. Human beings are inherently spiritual creatures who intuitively see the sacred in nature and within one another, but our cultures and at times even our faiths have made us forget what each of us already know deep in our souls but have learned to suppress. Sacred Earth, Sacred Soul offers a new spiritual foundation for our lives, once centered on encouragement, guidance, and hope for creating a better world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ARkBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Buddha Smiles: a Collection of Dharmatoons","description":"The Buddha Smiles is a delightful gathering of Mari Gayatri Stein s cartoons, or dharmatoons.

The Beardless Warriors are a squad of teenage U.S. infantrymen fighting their way across Germany during the final weeks of the war. Under fire and in over their heads, the fresh-faced young men must grow up fast if they ever hope to see home again.

Running through orchards, farmland, swamps, and cities, this electric railway began its life in 1905. Service eventually ran from Chico to Oakland, but after the Bay Bridge opened in 1939, the 186-mile route started in San Francisco's Financial District, crossed the bridge on the lower deck, ran through Contra Costa County towns like Moraga, Lafayette, and Pittsburg, across the Suisun straits on the massive rail ferry Ramon (which could hold an entire train), and into Sacramento, the halfway point. From there, the train continued through rolling hills and farms on to Marysville, and finally to Chico before making its return journey. The Sacramento Northern soldiered on until World War II, but eventually the growing car culture, along with competing diesel railroads, undid this splendid line. Interurban passenger service ended in 1941, and the various lines were gradually abandoned or dieselized. Today a 22-mile segment of the route remains in operation at the Bay Area Electric Railway Museum in Solano County.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PQ14B7fW0goC&dq=Sacramento+Northern+Railway+(Images+of+Rail)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sue De Beer","description":"Artist Sue de Beer has cited Proust's influence on her oeuvre, particularly the great author's work \\"The Captive,\\" which in achingly beautiful prose recounts a young man's quest to comprehend the object of his amorous obsession.

The first writer to demonstrate that English was as effective a medium for literature as Latin or French, Chaucer introduced realism, satire, and humor into English writing. In examining Chaucer's cultural importance, however, Fisher ventures beyond literary excellence, basing his cultural interpretation on inferences about Chaucer's domestic life, about his possible experience in the inns of chancery and inns of court, and about the possibility that Henry V and the Lancastrian government sought deliberately to promote Chaucer's poems as models of what could be accomplished in the vernacular. Fisher's willingness to boldly infer from the scant evidence available allows him to place Chaucer in the poet's, and our, culture in a way he has not been placed before. By attributing to Chaucer innovations to which other writers have only alluded, and by reaching conclusions which others have been hesitant to approach, Fisher presents an interpretation at once controversial, engaging, and informative.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NWBaAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Importance+of+Chaucer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of nature-study,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OHoeAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mountain of Adventure","description":"Enid Blyton's much-loved classic series, packed full of adventure and mystery.

The \\"figurings\\" of speech reveal the apparently limitless plasticity of language itself. We are inescapably confronted with the intoxicating possibility that we can make language do for us almost anything we want. Or at least a Shakespeare can. The figures of speech help to see how he does it, and how we might. Therefore, in the chapters presented in this volume, the quotations from Shakespeare, the Bible, and other sources are not presented to exemplify the definitions. Rather, the definitions are presented to lead to the quotations. And the quotations are there to show us how to do with language what we have not done before.

San Francisco historian and tour guide Lorri Ungaretti, author of San Francisco's Sunset District, showcases here a stirring collection of vintage Richmond images, detailing this district's journey from windswept sand dunes to the modern and livable place we know today. Among the Richmond's long-gone sights are cemeteries, farms, racetracks, and improvised cottages built in the wake of the 1906 earthquake. The area remained mostly rural through the 1880s, when mining entrepreneur Adolph Sutro (who also developed Sutro Heights and Sutro Baths) put in a commuter rail line to connect San Francisco's central district with his entertainment destinations in the \\"Outside Lands\\" near Ocean Beach. The Richmond District's history includes large cemetery plots that are now covered with homes. In addition, the various roadhouses, racetracks, and amusement parks in the area made it what Ungaretti calls \\"the city's playground.\\" They're gone now, but remain important parts of the Richmond's fascinating history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3OefDnYoVhQC&dq=San+Francisco%27s+Richmond+District+(CA)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ghostmobile","description":"Ryan is bored by his new life in Wisconsin, until the Ghostmobile appears.

Indians retained control over most of the lands in Spain's American empire. Mounted on horseback, savvy about European ways, and often possessing firearms, independent Indians continued to find new ways to resist subjugation by Spanish soldiers and conversion by Spanish missionaries. In this panoramic study, David J. Weber explains how late eighteenthcentury Spanish administrators tried to fashion a more enlightened policy toward the people they called b rbaros, or \\"savages.\\" Even Spain's most powerful monarchs failed, however, to enforce a consistent, well-reasoned policy toward Indians. At one extreme, powerful independent Indians forced Spaniards to seek peace, acknowledge autonomous tribal governments, and recognize the existence of tribal lands, fulfilling the Crown's oft-stated wish to use \\"gentle\\" means in dealing with Indians. At the other extreme the Crown abandoned its principles, authorizing bloody wars on Indians when Spanish officers believed they could defeat them. Power, says Weber, more than the power of ideas, determined how Spaniards treated \\"savages\\" in the Age of Enlightenment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EWlKdlHgC8wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Man in the Moon","description":"When a newly orphaned baby in the moon makes friends with the children of Earth, he seeks a way to ward off their fears and nightmares.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hCj24q64-KcC&dq=The+Man+in+the+Moon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Illegally Easy Halloween Costumes for Kids","description":"Learn to create traditional, storybook, fantasy, celestial, clown, animal, cultural, and historical costumes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w5UrAAAACAAJ&dq=Illegally+Easy+Halloween+Costumes+for+Kids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex and the Teenager Revised Leader's Manual","description":"Sex and the Teenager has a clear, straightforward goal: to encourage teens to say \\"no\\" to premarital sexual intercourse and to avoid such serious problems as teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bUaMAAAACAAJ&dq=Sex+and+the+Teenager+Revised+Leader%27s+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confessions Of A Casanova","description":"When his notorious charms begin wearing off, Tony Romero, a calculating Casanova who is selfish, dishonest, and unscrupulous, finally finds The One and, vowing to change his wicked ways, will stop at nothing to achieve real happiness.

In the spheres of literature and popular culture, Poe wields more global influence than any other U.S. author. This influence, however, cannot be attributed solely to the quality of Poe s texts or to his compellingly tragic biography. Rather, his continued prominence as a writer owes much to the ways that Poe has been interpreted, portrayed, and packaged by an extensive group of mediators ranging from anthologizers, editors, translators, and fellow writers to literary critics, filmmakers, musicians, and illustrators. In this volume, the work of presenting Poe s texts for public consumption becomes a fascinating object of study in its own right, one that highlights the powerful and often overlooked influence of those who have edited, anthologized, translated, and adapted the author s writing over the past 170 years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ac3xDwAAQBAJ&dq=Los+Mejores+Cuentos+Policiales+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Street Crazy : America's Mental Health Tragedy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2r_4RAdGrUAC&dq=Street+Crazy+:+America%27s+Mental+Health+Tragedy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundations of American Education (3rd Edition)","description":"Note: This is the bound book only and does not include access to the Enhanced Pearson eText.

In Putting Islam to Work, Gregory Starrett focuses on the historical interplay of power and public culture, showing how these new forms of communication and a growing state interest in religious instruction have changed the way the Islamic tradition is reproduced. During the twentieth century new styles of religious education, based not on the recitation of sacred texts but on moral indoctrination, have been harnessed for use in economic, political, and social development programs. More recently they have become part of the Egyptian government's strategy for combating Islamist political opposition. But in the course of this struggle, the western-style educational techniques that were adopted to generate political stability have instead resulted in a rapid Islamization of public space, the undermining of traditional religious authority structures, and a crisis of political legitimacy. Using historical, textual, and ethnographic evidence, Gregory Starrett demonstrates that today's Islamic resurgence is rooted in new ways of thinking about Islam that are based in the market, the media, and the school.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lkPRGi9P2JwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adeline","description":"Sweet Adeline Addison receives valentines from many admirers, but in the end discovers that it is God who loves her most of all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2FkFAAAACAAJ&dq=Adeline&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Room Redux: The Home Decorating Workbook","description":"Learn to decorate like the pros and discover every rooms potential with Room Redux.

Southwesterners are well accustomed to this sleek, mostly brown and white, long-tailed nemesis of coyote as it darts across roads or perches on a post or branch never too far from the ground. Equally familiar is the stylized image of the roadrunner, which adorns everything from Native American pottery and jewelry to clothing and logos. Clearly the roadrunner continues to thrive as a cultural icon. Yet no other study comes close to equaling Wyman Meinzer's stunning classic, now 04 Activeable in this tenth anniversary edition. Meinzer's photo study is his personal account of the years he has spent observing and recording the daily routine of several roadrunner families. Through his lens, Meinzer chronicled roadrunners' courting, mating, nesting, hunting, and rearing their young. Punctuated by humor and poignancy, his story possesses an unmatched connectedness and insights afforded only those who develop a longstanding relationship with their subjects of study. Many of the roadrunners that Meinzer recorded became comfortable with his presence--one even permitted his assistance in catching a lizard. Though it is hard to improve upon a classic, this new edition, celebrating the book's tenth year of publication, includes a new preface from Meinzer and several new photographs, including that of a rare white roadrunner.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IZ0AAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Roadrunner:+The+Tenth+Anniversary+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bosnia: Hope in the Ashes","description":"\\"Ethnic hatred is centuries old.

Hedged about with all manner of complex pressures, personal, societal, religious, sexual and other forms of taboo, it remains a phenomenon only imperfectly understood. Geoffrey Hughes traces these two contrasting strands through our linguistic history. His discussion starts with the use of language as magic in 'primitive' society, the binding oath of heroic commitment in Anglo-Saxon warrior society and the emergence of blasphemy in the medieval age of faith. With the Renaissance came a shift from a religious to a secular idiom of swearing, a period combining rich exuberance in language with severe restraint. This oscillation between institutional censorship and individual defiance continues to modern times. Professor Hughes includes in this broad-ranging survey such topics as xenophobia and the racist basis of abuse, graffiti, the sexual and sexist patterns of swearing, the multifarious forms of euphemism and the curious varieties of verbal duelling known as 'flyting' and 'sounding'. His book is a tireless exploration of a little discussed but irrepressible part of our linguistic heritage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0W20ngEACAAJ&dq=Swearing:+A+Social+History+of+Foul+Language,+Oaths+and+Profanity+in+English+(Language+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where the Action Was: Women War Correspondents in World War II","description":"Relates the experiences of some of the women war correspondents who managed to break the biggest stories of World War II in spite of rules prohibiting women from covering combat.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S1vhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Where+the+Action+Was:+Women+War+Correspondents+in+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Low Power CMOS VLSI: Circuit Design","description":"This is the first book devoted to low power circuit design, and its authors have been among the first to publish papers in this area.

An overwhelmed homicide detective hooks up with a rookie detective assigned to investigate minor thefts. The first case assigned to the rookie detective is a theft of two flowerpots from a cemetery. The rookie, apprehensive of his investigative knowledge, solicits help from the seasoned homicide detective. The case quickly evolves from a pair of plundered flowerpots to a million dollar operation involving several owners of the City's most exquisite and prominent antique shops. Together, the two become hopelessly lost in some of the city's most majestic burial grounds; known as the world famous \\"Cities of the Dead.\\" During the investigation, the two detectives begin to notice several strange and unexplainable coincidences that seem to guide their every move. After some time, they manage to put aside their macho police attitudes; and learn to accept the fact that they were catapulted into the realm of the spiritual world--and the supernatural. The wacky and zany antics by the rookie and the straightforward nature of the homicide detective make for an unusual, but most effective, crime fighting partnership. And . . . just when the two detectives thought they had pushed the investigation to the limit, the case explodes, and leads them directly into a morbid, voodoo, serial murder plot of millennial proportions. Finally, the investigation reveals a suspect who is linked in the disappearance of the homicide detective's missing sister from when he was a child. In the end, the two detectives accept and understand the reasons for the spiritual interventions. As a result, hundreds of Lost Souls in the \\"Cities of the Dead\\" were freed from their torment, and the demons were finally revealed in a tremendous battle between the powers of good and evil. But, at what cost . . . Although the story is fictional, it is inspired from a true-life investigation involving the two detectives who authored this story. It is a spin off of certain events concerning the theft of stolen cemetery artifacts. We leave it totally up to the reader to decipher the fictional occurrences, and any similarities to persons or parties involved with the actual investigation are totally coincidental and unintentional.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3jSvqbegXP8C&dq=They%27re+All+Trying+to+Kill+Me!:+(Or+How+I+Manage+to+Survive+as+a+Flight+Instructor)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dying For A Blue Plate Special","description":"New Jersey expatriate Jewel Feynmann finds herself up to her kugel in aggro when her fledgling business, Blue Plate Catering, does dinner for Commencement Bay University, aka Zoo U. Keeping dreamy employee Del Troutman and runaway student waiters in line is hard enough. Then Zoo U Dean Matthew Mulcahy dies of poison at Blue Plate's dinner while hundreds of poorly dressed academics watch in horror. Chocolate-eyed homicide detective Ben Hartsock works the case in a quiet, capable, good-looking way-damn good-looking, not that Jewel cares-but too methodically for her East coast taste. Everyone from the Brown and Hailey candy factory to the Museum of Glass will think Blue Plate killed Mulcahy unless Jewel finds out who did. And yesterday. Jewel dives in among the college people, including foul-mouthed playwright Leo Wallinsky; puppy-like Ace Birney, fraternity boy; and watchful Helena Moore, in charge of student grievances and a lot more. Del pitches in. Together, they find out enough about Mulcahy and his women students to gag a mule. Ben's-no, Detective Hartsock's-official investigation gets close enough to lift Jewel's pulse to code red. Surely it's unethical for a cop to have sex with a suspect? When Jewel's e-mail box fills with death threats and Courtney Mitznick cancels her son's Bar Mitzvah buffet supper, Jewel really gets mad. Hair flying, she finally finds the answer with the murderer in Blue Plate's deserted kitchen, late at night. Maybe too late. Beth Kalikoff grew up in New Jersey and Connecticut.

The answer is simple. An emphasis on reading and literacy skills in the content areas has an exponential effect on learning in every discipline. This completely revised third edition of the best-selling Teaching Reading in the Content Areas seeks to help educators understand how to teach reading in their respective disciplines, choose the best reading strategies from the vast array available, and positively impact student learning. Throughout, it draws from new research on the impact of new technologies, the population boom of English language learners, and the influence of the Common Core State Standards. Given the complexities of the reading process, teachers deserve--and this book provides--clear, research-based answers to overarching questions about teaching reading in the content areas: * What specific skills do students need to read effectively in each content area? * Which reading strategies are most appropriate to help students become more effective readers and independent learners? * What type of learning environment promotes effective reading and learning? By focusing on the differences in how content-area experts read and reason, teachers can be better prepared to help their students understand that the ways they read in biology are different from the ways they read in English, history, or mathematics. To read successfully in different content areas, students must develop discipline-specific skills and strategies along with knowledge of that discipline. With that in mind, this book also includes 40 strategies designed to help students in every grade level and across the content areas develop their vocabularies, comprehend informational and narrative texts, and engage in meaningful discussions of what they read.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VdibbXKJkSAC&dq=Teaching+Through+Text:+Reading+and+Writing+in+the+Content+Areas+(3rd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eagle Strike (Seals Eagle Force)","description":"Guadalcanal...The Solomons...The Coral Sea...The legendary Pacific battlegrounds of a bygone era are about to erupt again -- as the U.S.Navy embarks upon a war of nerves and strategy against a compound in the mountains of New Zealand, a madman sets the world on the road to Armageddon with a brazen, unthinkable act: the kidnapping of the wife and son of the President of the United States.

Sure, there are a few isolated pockets of propriety still to be mopped up, but most of the wholesome, clean-living people have taken to the hills. Tomorrow belongs to us, the Dirty-Minded Americans, and there are more of us than even we dared to dream. This book is an official battle-by-battle history of the American Sex Revolution. It documents the names, dates and scandalous events. And, it dispels some myths. For example, it proves once and for all that the younger generation could not have started the Revolution. The first shot was fired November 10, 1945-long before they were born. The Sex Revolution was started by the Americans who went through puberty before World War II. (But at the time, we had to call it the S_x Revolution; that's how uptight things were then.) One chapter, entitled, \\"Short Chapter, Long Footnote\\" consists of just the single word \\"F*ck\\" followed by an asterisk. The \\"Long Footnote\\" goes on for 20 more pages as he excruciatingly scrutinizes (no pun intended) the four-letter word, providing its possible origins, and our different ways of saying this forbidden word (like saying \\"screwed\\" or \\"I'm seeing him\\") without actually saying it. Sherman confesses that the word held such power over him personally, that he devoted nearly three full pages of this book to just typing the word again and again and again, until after about the 487th time of typing it, he found he wasn't nearly so traumatized by it anymore. \\"The Rape of the APE: the Official History of the Sex Revolution\\" is written by comedian (and self-proclaimed sex symbol) Allan Sherman, most famous for his hit single \\"Hello, Muddah!

We have also experienced the frustration of interminable discussion that does not lead to progress. Co-Laboratories of Democracy enable large, diverse groups to dialogue and generate positive results. Many group processes engender enthusiasm and good feeling as people share their concerns and hopes with each other. Co-Laboratories go beyond this initial euphoria to: Discover root causes; Adopt consensual action plans; Develop teams dedicated to implementing those plans; and Generate lasting bonds of respect, trust, and cooperation.Co-Laboratories achieve these results by respecting the autonomy of all participants, and utilizing an array of consensus tools including discipline, technology and graphics that allow the stakeholders to control the discussion. These are explained in depth in a book authored by Alexander N. Christakis with Kenneth C. Bausch: Co-Laboratories of Democracy: How People Harness Their Collective Wisdom to Create the Future (Information Age, 2006).Co-Laboratories are a refinement of Interactive Management, a decision and design methodology developed over the past 30 years to deal with very complex situations involving diverse stakeholders. It has been successfully employed all over the world in situations of uncertainty and conflict. On Cyprus, for example, it has been used to bridge the divide between the Turkish and Greek factions on the island. It is currently being employed on that island to help Palestinian authorities organize their government.Co-Laboratories in one day can draw together a diverse group of people on an issue, elicit authentic feelings and respectful listening, generate agreed upon language, and identify leverage points for effective action. Participants will be able to generate a consensual action plan. Co-Laboratories generate real respect, understanding, and cooperation among participants and do it rapidly.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g_onDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oxford Picture Dictionary of American English: Spanish and English","description":"4,000 words and phrases are organized thematically within 163 topics.

Known as the \\"Greatest Master\\" (al-Shaykh al-Akbar), he led an extraordinary inner and outer life. He travelled huge distances, from his native Spain to Syria and Turkey, writing over 350 books on the mystical path. His whole life was dedicated to exposing, at the deepest level, the primordial Unity underlying all human and natural existence, and the true degree of human dignity. The book presents a unique portrait of Ibn 'Arabi 'from the inside', using his own writing to tell the story of his life and teachings. The biographical chapters, supplemented with photographs and maps, give a vivid picture of his life and times during the height of medieval culture. These are interwoven with a series of chapters that portray the central elements of his thought, and highlight their relevance in today's world. This unusual approach gives a direct flavour of Ibn 'Arabi's genius, whose life and thought are inextricably linked. Above all, his deep insights into what it means to be truly human are applicable to people of all times and places.

Transcultural essentialism is analysed through the lens of critical regionalism and architectural phenomenology, with emphasis on the sense of place and tectonics in Utzon s architectural works. It provides a new understanding of the Danish architect as an early proponent of a still emergent and increasingly relevant direction in architecture. Going beyond biographical studies, it presents a more comprehensive understanding of the broad range of transcultural influences that formed his thinking. The volume includes numerous previously unpublished photographs, drawings, and interviews with Utzon s family members, former students, and colleagues, offering a significant contribution to the existing body of knowledge for any architecture scholar interested in Utzon s work and design principles.

Crewmen died, developed rare or yet unidentified diseases, and most horrifying of all, some became fused to the metal, their arms and legs protruding from the bulkhead. A team of psychologists has gathered at a small university to study and analyze the same reoccurring dream of seven completely different people. The dream involves a large navy ship in a vast desert with soldiers trapped inside the bulkheads. Slowly, by depriving the dreamers of REM sleep, the dreams are killing the dreamers. What the dreamers do not realize is that another vessel; this one equipped with nuclear missiles has disappeared in a green-gray mist over the North Atlantic. Only Elizabeth Foxworth, a social worker studying the dreamers, can prevent nuclear disaster by entering the dream, and risking her life and the lives of the dreamers.

I The United States and China: Into the Twenty-First Century--now in its third edition and thoroughly revised and updated--looks at over a century of Chinese-American turmoil from a dual perspective, examining how two dramatically different cultures interacted and collided. Based on research by the author as well as by scholars in both countries, it examines the periodic cooperation and hostility between both governments and people in the United States and China. The book places special emphasis on understanding China's unique role in the Cold War and its centrality to the American obsession with the Vietnam War. It explains the interactions between domestic policies in China and the United States and their international behavior. The discussion of the post-World War II period, which constitutes a major portion of this textbook, has been completely revised to incorporate a vast new body of primary materials and research monographs written by Chinese and American scholars since 1990. Two entirely new chapters analyze Chinese-American relations during the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations and examine the paradox of how, despite increasingly close social, political, and economic cooperation, fear of China has again become part of the American political debate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ncbItQEACAAJ&dq=THE+UNITED+STATES+AND+CHINA+THIRD+EDITION&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The last days of the late, great State of California","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pW52uwEACAAJ&dq=The+last+days+of+the+late,+great+State+of+California&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Marketing Terms (Barron's Business Guides)","description":"More than 4,000 definitions cover all aspects of the advertising industry in \\"Dictionary of Marketing Terms\\".","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WZmyAAAAIAAJ&dq=Dictionary+of+Marketing+Terms+(Barron%27s+Business+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE CREATIVE PROCESS","description":"The Creative Process: Stories from the Arts and Sciences asks how celebrated works of art and breakthroughs in science came to be. What was the first inkling? What were the steps and missteps along the way? How was the process experienced by the creative person as it proceeded? And what are the implications for the psychology of the creative process? Each chapter focuses on a specific creative endeavor, situating the work in the context of domain, culture, and historical era. Then it traces the development of the work from what we know of its beginnings to its fulfillment. Qualitative materials interviews, notebooks, diaries, sketches, drafts, and other writings allow a story of the creative process as lived to emerge. The narratives exemplify established concepts in the psychology of creativity, propose broadening some, reveal the need for modification, and suggest new ones. Application of phenomenological frameworks illuminate the episodes in new ways as well.

In August 1776, little over a month after the Continental Congress had formally declared independence from Britain, the revolution was on the verge of a disastrous end. General George Washington found his troops outmanned and outmaneuvered at the Battle of Brooklyn. But thanks to a series of desperate charges by a single heroic regiment, famously known as the  Immortal 400,  Washington was able to evacuate his men and the nascent Continental Army lived to fight another day. In Washington s Immortals, award-winning military historian Patrick K. O Donnell brings to life the forgotten story of these remarkable men. Comprised of rich merchants, tradesmen, and free blacks, they fought not just in Brooklyn, but in key battles including Trenton, Princeton, Camden, Cowpens, Guilford Courthouse, and Yorktown, where their heroism changed the course of the war. Drawing on extensive original sources, from letters to diaries to pension applications, O Donnell pieces together the stories of these brave men their friendships, loves, defeats, and triumphs. He explores their tactics, their struggles with hostile loyalists and shortages of clothing and food, their development into an elite unit, and their dogged opponents, including British General Lord Cornwallis. Through the prism of this one unit, O Donnell tells the larger story of the Revolutionary War.  Well-written, and superbly researched . . .

LOUIS POST-DISPATCH As the 1960s drew to a close, the United States was coming apart at the seams. From August 1969 to August 1970, the nation witnessed nine thousand protests and eighty-four acts of arson or bombings at schools across the country. It was the year of the My Lai massacre investigation, the Cambodia invasion, Woodstock, and the Moratorium to End the War. The American death toll in Vietnam was approaching fifty thousand, and the ascendant counterculture was challenging nearly every aspect of American society. Witness to the Revolution, Clara Bingham s unique oral history of that tumultuous time, unveils anew that moment when America careened to the brink of a civil war at home, as it fought a long, futile war abroad. Woven together from one hundred original interviews, Witness to the Revolution provides a firsthand narrative of that period of upheaval in the words of those closest to the action the activists, organizers, radicals, and resisters who manned the barricades of what Students for a Democratic Society leader Tom Hayden called  the Great Refusal.  We meet Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground; Daniel Ellsberg, the former Defense Department employee who released the Pentagon Papers; feminist theorist Robin Morgan; actor and activist Jane Fonda; and many others whose powerful personal stories capture the essence of an era. We witness how the killing of four students at Kent State turned a straitlaced social worker into a hippie, how the civil rights movement gave birth to the women s movement, and how opposition to the war in Vietnam turned college students into prisoners, veterans into peace marchers, and intellectuals into bombers. With lessons that can be applied to our time, Witness to the Revolution is more than just a record of the death throes of the Age of Aquarius. Today, when America is once again enmeshed in racial turmoil, extended wars overseas, and distrust of the government, the insights contained in this book are more relevant than ever. Praise for Witness to the Revolution  Especially for younger generations who didn t live through it, Witness to the Revolution is a valuable and entertaining primer on a moment in American history the likes of which we may never see again.  Bryan Burrough, The Wall Street Journal  [One of the] best paperbacks of 2017 so far . . . The book is a rich tapestry of a volatile period in American history.  Time  A gripping oral history of the centrifugal social forces tearing America apart at the end of the  60s . . . This is rousing reportage from the front lines of US history.

New York Times Book Review  [An] Enthralling and brilliant chronology of the period between August 1969 and September 1970.  Buffalo News  [Bingham] captures the essence of these fourteen months through the words of movement organizers, vets, students, draft resisters, journalists, musicians, government agents, writers, and others. . . . This oral history will enable readers to see that era in a new light and with fresh sympathy for the motivations of those involved. While Bingham s is one of many retrospective looks at that period, it is one of the most immediate and personal.

The new theoretical foundation makes it possible to discuss in a new light questions of social institutions, such as the relationship between government and the market, as well as social policy goals like full employment, industrial democracy, and balanced international trade.

Chronicling the many developments in the church's life and practice since the issue of collaborative ministry first came into focus, they identify some of the myths and obstacles that hinder effective collaborative ministry and offer concrete examples of why and how collaboration is working. Their careful use of a full range of contemporary ecclesial documents helps readers concretize a sometimes nebulous understanding of collaborative ministry. And they show that effective collaboration requires both a collaborative spirituality and the specific skills such as group leadership, dealing with conflict, and learning to confront.Reminding us that \\"a non-collaborative church is a church of maintenance rather than a church of mission, \\" the authors provide an invaluable resource to enliven the church's mission and to make the vision of collaborative ministry proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council a reality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_pkOAAAACAAJ&dq=Collaboration:+Uniting+Our+Gifts+in+Ministry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Delirium","description":"Ninety-five days, and then I ll be safe.

Tuchman, Pulitzer Prizewinning author of The Guns of August, comes history through a wide-angle lens: a fascinating chronicle of Britain s long relationship with Palestine and the Middle East, from the ancient world to the twentieth century. Historically, the British were drawn to the Holy Land for two major reasons: first, to translate the Bible into English and, later, to control the road to India and access to the oil of the Middle East. With the lucidity and vividness that characterize all her work, Barbara W. Tuchman follows these twin spiritual and imperial motives the Bible and the sword to their seemingly inevitable endpoint, when Britain conquered Palestine at the conclusion of World War I. At that moment, in a gesture of significance and solemnity, the Balfour Declaration of 1917 established a British-sponsored mandate for a national home for the Jewish people. Throughout this characteristically vivid account, Tuchman demonstrates that the seeds of conflict were planted in the Middle East long before the official founding of the modern state of Israel. Praise for Bible and Sword  Tuchman is a wise and witty writer, a shrewd observer with a lively command of high drama.

The legendary schoolteacher, John Taylor Gatto, invested over 10 years of dedicated research to uncover some of the most alarming ideas and writings by the creators and advocates of mandatory attendance schooling, which show where the system came from and why it was created. He combined these facts with his personal experience as a teacher for 30 years in New York public schools, where he won many awards, including being named State Teacher of the Year twice, and has authored an all-time classic. This book was originally published in 2001, and has been printed a number of times. However, this updated version includes new essays from the author, as well as contributions from Dr. Ron Paul, David Ruenzel, and Richard Grove. This is the first of a 3 book volume which will help the reader gain a solid understanding about the American school organization and many of the hidden, yet powerful parts. In this first of set, Mr. Gatto's humble yet bold personality, mixed with humor and class, makes it an enjoyable read, despite the importance and implications of the subject.

ASHLEY MONTAGU S book possesses two great merits rarely found in current discussions of human problems. Where most writers over-simplify, he insists on the principle of multiple and interlocking causation. And where most assume that  facts will speak for themselves,  he makes it clear that facts are mere ventriloquists  dummies, and can be made to justify any course of action that appeals to the socially conditioned passions of the individuals concerned. These two truths are sufficiently obvious; but they are seldom recognized, for the good reason that they are very depressing. To recognize the first truth is to recognize the fact that there are no panaceas and that therefore most of the golden promises made by political reformers and revolutionaries are illusory. And to recognize the truth that facts do not speak for themselves, but only as man s socially conditioned passions dictate, is to recognize that our current educational processes can do very little to ameliorate the state of the world. In the language of traditional theology (so much more realistic, in many respects, than the  liberal  philosophies which replaced it), most ignorance is voluntary and depends upon acts of the conscious or subconscious will. Thus, the fallacies underlying the propaganda of racial hatred are not recognized because, as Dr. Montagu points out, most people have a desire to act aggressively, and the members of other ethnic groups are convenient victims, whom one may attack with a good conscience. This desire to act aggressively has its origins in the largely unavoidable frustrations imposed upon the individual by the processes of early education and later adjustments to the social environment. Dr. Montagu might have added that aggressiveness pays a higher dividend in emotional satisfaction than does co?peration. Co?peration may produce a mild emotional glow; but the indulgence of aggressivness can be the equivalent of a drinking bout or sexual orgy. In our industrial societies, the goodness of life is measured in terms of the number and intensity of the excitements experienced. (Popular philosophy is moulded by, and finds expression in, the advertising pages of popular magazines. Significantly enough, the word that occurs more frequently in those pages than any other is  thrill. ) Like sex and alcohol, aggressiveness can give enormous thrills. Under existing social conditions, it is therefore easy to represent aggressiveness as good. Concerning the remedies for the social diseases he has so penetratingly diagnosed, Dr. Montagu says very little, except that they will have to consist in some process of education. But what process? It is to be hoped that he will answer this question at length in another work.

She shows how a deeper engagement with history, both as individuals and in the sphere of public debate, can help us understand ourselves and the world better. But she also warns that history can be misused and lead to misunderstanding. History is used to justify religious movements and political campaigns alike. Dictators may suppress history because it undermines their ideas, agendas, or claims to absolute authority. Nationalists may tell false, one-sided, or misleading stories about the past. Political leaders might mobilize their people by telling lies. It is imperative that we have an understanding of the past and avoid these and other common traps in thinking to which many fall prey. This brilliantly reasoned work, alive with incident and figures both great and infamous, will compel us to examine history anew and skillfully illuminates why it is important to treat the past with care.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ooZDK4yXmmYC&dq=Dangerous+Games&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Compleat Turkey","description":"Presents descriptions of the various \\"turkeys\\" of contemporary life in all fields--doctors, teachers, bureaucrats, politicians--as well as comments on \\"turkeys\\" in general.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OWqwHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Compleat+Turkey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Folk Tales Children Love","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=61xvjgEACAAJ&dq=Folk+Tales+Children+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A concise exegetical grammar of New Testament Greek","description":"The digital copies of this book are available for free at First Fruits website. place.asburyseminary.edu/firstfruits","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gp9NlwEACAAJ&dq=A+concise+exegetical+grammar+of+New+Testament+Greek&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moongate: Suppressed Findings of the U.S. Space Program","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZdW5AAAACAAJ&dq=Moongate:+Suppressed+Findings+of+the+U.S.+Space+Program&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A pocket full of rye","description":"In Agatha Christie s classic, A Pocket Full of Rye, the bizarre death of a financial tycoon has Miss Marple investigating a very odd case of crime by rhyme.

The war department wanted 3,000 volunteers, and it didn't care who they were; they would be expendable, with an expected casualty rate of 85 percent. The men who took up the challenge were, in the words of one, \\"bums and cast-offs\\" with rap sheets and reputations for trouble. One war reporter described them as \\"Dead End Kids,\\" but by the end of their five-month mission, those that remained had become the legendary \\"Merrill's Marauders.\\" From award-winning historian Gavin Mortimer, Merrill's Marauders is the story of the American World War II special forces unit originally codenamed \\"Galahad,\\" which, in 1944, fought its way through 700 miles of snake-infested Burmese jungle--what Winston Churchill described as \\"the most forbidding fighting country imaginable.\\" Though their mission to disrupt Japanese supply lines and communications was ultimately successful, paving the way for the Allied conquest of Burma, the Marauders paid a terrible price for their victory. By the time they captured the crucial airfield of Myitkyina in May 1944, only 200 of the original 3,000 men remained; the rest were dead, wounded, or riddled with disease. This is the definitive nonfiction narrative of arguably the most extraordinary, but also unsung, American special forces unit in World War II.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AHNmAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Someone Else's War","description":"Based on extensive interviews with mercenaries of many nationalities, this volume reveals how white mercenaries came to play a key role in the struggle for the Congo, and how the end of the war in Vietnam coincided with the start of the war in Rhodesia, attracting a new generation of mercenary soldiers.

At the same time, the shift from 2nd generation to 3rd generation cellular technology has increased the potential data rate available to mobile users by tenfold as well as shifting data transport from circuit switched to packet data. These fundamental shifts in nature and the quantity of data available to mobile users has led to an explosion in the number of applications being developed for future digital terminal devices. Though these applications are diverse they share a common need for complex Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and in most cases benefit from the use of programmable DSPs (Digital Signal Processors). * Features contributions from experts who discuss the implementation and applications of programmable DSPs * Includes detailed introductions to speech coding, speech recognition, video and audio compression, biometric identification and their application for mobile communications devices * Discusses the alternative DSP technology which is attempting to unseat the programmable DSP from the heart of tomorrow's mobile terminals * Presents innovative new applications that are waiting to be discovered in the unique environment created when mobility meets signal processing The Application of Programmable DSPs in Mobile Communications provides an excellent overview for engineers moving into the area of mobile communications or entrepreneurs looking to understand state of the art in mobile terminals.

Through an exploration of both prior theoretical approaches, and indicators through characteristics of postmodernist fiction, this book identifies a structural framework to both understand and apply the lessons of postmodernism for the next generation. Within a growing consensus that the postmodern era has passed, this book examines the different conceptions of postmodernism and posits a meaningful definition, one which can provide the foundation for future literary expression. This theory is then applied to genre fiction, particularly detective fiction and science fiction, demonstrating that postmodernism is found in the structure, rather than questions posed about literary expression. Finally, Matthias Stephan considers post-postmodern movements, and how they can be expressed given this definition of literary postmodernism, moving forward to the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0R6VDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Yachting Cookbook","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE","description":"One of the 20th century's enduring works, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prizewinning career. The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buend a family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buend a family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America. Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel Garc a M rquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master. Alternately reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling.

From The Naval War of 1812 through his four-volume Winning of the West, Teddy Roosevelt proved himself a master historian...but one must not make the mistake of labeling him a stodgy academic. The future president was also a great outdoorsman, with such works as Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail and African Game Trails capturing his rough and ready lifestyle. Theodore Roosevelt was part Francis Parkman, part Lowell Thomas, and one hundred percent spirit of America and master of the printed page.

Most of them ended up being sanctioned by their state Bar, sued for malpractice, prosecuted, or some combination of all three. All of the cases are rich in detail, many are bizarre, and in a few the attorney's conduct is so outrageous as to stretch the reader?s credulity. Each tale is followed by comments and questions designed to explore the issues in greater depth. This diminutive but captivating volume is intended as a supplemental text for students in professional responsibility courses at American law schools. It can also be used as the foundation for an advanced seminar in ethics. It is based on the proposition that, although the rules of professional responsibility are, of course, of supreme importance, sometimes the study of them can be monotonous and dry. More important, students -- none of whom have been in law practice and most of whom have never been out in the working world -- often find it hard to believe that the rules can be so easily and egregiously broken. These real world scenarios bring the ethical quandaries faced in everyday legal practice to life. The stories come from all segments of the legal profession and make fascinating and memorable reading. No other book on the market takes this narrative approach, making this an important and unique contribution to the field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-AYzQQAACAAJ&dq=Lawyers+Crossing+Lines:+Nine+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Easy Windows 98","description":"A step-by-step tutorial shows readers how to perform many of the advanced features of the Microsoft Windows 98 operating system","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bpgDAAAACAAJ&dq=More+Easy+Windows+98&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Software Process (Trends in Software, 4)","description":"This book gathers a selection of papers presented at the 2018 International Conference on Software Process Improvement (CIMPS 2018).

In Violence in the Black Patch of Kentucky and Tennessee, Suzanne Marshall provides a thorough, engrossing depiction of the role played by violence in the development of the Black Patch culture. Violence was a key element in the white settlement of this frontier wilderness. After forcibly removing Native Americans from the region, white settlers established a tradition of violence that maintained order and morality. White male dominance over family members and black slaves was also sustained by violence. A man's mean reputation defined his identity and place within the community, instilling respect and fear among outsiders. The Civil War and the industrial revolution also helped perpetuate violence in the Black Patch. With markedly divided sympathies during the Civil War, the Black Patch inspired guerrilla warfare against citizens and slaves by renegade bands of former soldiers from both sides. Marshall's study culminates with a discussion of the Night Riders' vigilante activity during Black Patch wars that originated with this country's shift from an agricultural society to an industrial one. By focusing on the violence in this culture, Marshall provides a key to understanding both the cultural components that were unique to the area and those that were shared with other isolated rural communities. She draws extensively from oral history and ethnographic methodology as well as court records, church records, diaries, and newspapers. Anecdotes depicting folk beliefs and heroes, old-time religion, the economics of farm life, race relations, and gender roles, serve to enliven this study and enrich our understanding of a fascinating and distinctive region.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=34flu7VFcLMC&dq=Violence+in+the+Black+Patch+of+Kentucky+and+Tennessee&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marriages and Families: Intimacy, Diversity, and Strengths","description":"\\"Three distinctive themes have guided our efforts in writing this book, and they are woven throughout the text. The first is intimacy, and our focus is on how to develop and maintain close relationships.

This book is full of ideas, principles, and suggestions for building and keeping intimate relationships in your life. As a result, we hope this will be a book that you will want to keep and refer to throughout your life. The second key theme is marital and family strengths. The family strengths perspective is based on the premise that if you approach relationships from a \\"problem-oriented\\" perspective, you will find problems. If you look for strengths, you will find strengths. Growing numbers of family educators and family therapists are using this approach today, helping families recognize their own strengths and use them as a foundation for positive growth. In Chapter 1, we identify a number of strengths that have been found to be present in healthy marriages and families all over the world. Throughout the book, we show how these strengths help families provide healthy and nurturing settings that promote the growth and well-being of individual family members, better enabling them to face the challenges and solve the problems they encounter\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=us44zgEACAAJ&dq=Marriages+and+Families:+Intimacy,+Diversity,+and+Strengths&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My House Is on Fire","description":"Eleven stories look at life in modern Chile and deal with frightened children, an imprisoned doctor, and a government censor who recognizes himself as the protagonist in a subversive story","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UH6xPQAACAAJ&dq=My+House+Is+on+Fire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An American Dream","description":"In this wild battering ram of a novel, which was originally published to vast controversy in 1965, Norman Mailer creates a character who might be a fictional precursor of the philosopher-killer he would later profile in The Executioner s Song.

At least 17.7 million individuals in the United States are caregivers of an older adult with a health or functional limitation. The nation's family caregivers provide the lion's share of long-term care for our older adult population. They are also central to older adults' access to and receipt of health care and community-based social services. Yet the need to recognize and support caregivers is among the least appreciated challenges facing the aging U.S. population. Families Caring for an Aging America examines the prevalence and nature of family caregiving of older adults and the available evidence on the effectiveness of programs, supports, and other interventions designed to support family caregivers. This report also assesses and recommends policies to address the needs of family caregivers and to minimize the barriers that they encounter in trying to meet the needs of older adults.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XLTxDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We think the world of you","description":"We Think the World of You combines acute social realism and dark fantasy, and was described by J.R.

Sackler Collections","description":"The supreme art form of ancient China was the bronze ritual vessel. Kings and nobles offered food and drink to their ancestors in spectacular cast bronze containers which served to advertise the owner's wealth and power no less than his piety. Many of the bronzes eventually found their way into the tombs of their owners, where they lay undisturbed for centuries or millennia until accidental discovery or the archaeologist's spade brought them once more to light. The vast collection of Chinese bronzes formed by the late Dr. Arthur M. Sackler ranges over the entire Bronze Age. The bronzes of the Eastern Zhou period, 8th to 3rd century BC, are the subject of this third and concluding volume of the comprehensive catalogue of the collection. In a thorough and up-to-date introduction, Dr. Jenny So, Assistant Curator of Ancient Chinese Art at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, gives a detailed account of the history of Eastern Zhou bronzes. Particularly valuable is Dr. So's systematic use of the latest archaeological discoveries to trace regional and chronological developments and to study the political context in which bronzes were made and used. An especially valuable supplement to the volume is a major study of bronze bells coauthored by an archaeologist and an acoustical physicist, Professor Lothar von Falkenhausen of UCLA and Professor Thomas D. Rossing of Northern Illinois University. The Sackler Collection includes twenty-one bells, which were employed in the same offering rituals as the bronze vessels. Ninety color plates provide full documentation of the Sackler bronzes and over 560 black-and-white comparative illustrations help to set them in the context providedby archaeological research. Scholarly appendices report elemental composition data on the bronze alloys, lead-isotope ratios, and thermoluminescence dating tests of clay core material.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T52TpwAACAAJ&dq=Eastern+Zhou+Ritual+Bronzes+from+the+Arthur+M.+Sackler+Collections&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Boy: a Record of Childhood and Youth","description":"A special 75th anniversary edition of Richard Wright's powerful and unforgettable memoir, with a new foreword by John Edgar Wideman and an afterword by Malcolm Wright, the author s grandson. When it exploded onto the literary scene in 1945, Black Boy was both praised and condemned. Orville Prescott of the New York Times wrote that  if enough such books are written, if enough millions of people read them maybe, someday, in the fullness of time, there will be a greater understanding and a more true democracy.  Yet from 1975 to 1978, Black Boy was banned in schools throughout the United States for  obscenity  and  instigating hatred between the races.  Wright s once controversial, now celebrated autobiography measures the raw brutality of the Jim Crow South against the sheer desperate will it took to survive as a Black boy. Enduring poverty, hunger, fear, abuse, and hatred while growing up in the woods of Mississippi, Wright lied, stole, and raged at those around him whites indifferent, pitying, or cruel and Blacks resentful of anyone trying to rise above their circumstances. Desperate for a different way of life, he headed north, eventually arriving in Chicago, where he forged a new path and began his career as a writer. At the end of Black Boy, Wright sits poised with pencil in hand, determined to  hurl words into this darkness and wait for an echo.  Seventy-five years later, his words continue to reverberate.  To read Black Boy is to stare into the heart of darkness,  John Edgar Wideman writes in his foreword.  Not the dark heart Conrad searched for in Congo jungles but the beating heart I bear.  One of the great American memoirs, Wright s account is a poignant record of struggle and endurance a seminal literary work that illuminates our own time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1oTEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Soldier","description":"A young Russian soldier offers a harrowing chronicle of his experiences in the Chechen wars that captures the fear, chaos, hardship, drudgery, and brutality of modern warfare.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t71_vgEACAAJ&dq=One+Soldier&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Louis I.

The only known mechanism that can explain the staggering amounts of energy emitted by the innermost regions of these systems is gravitational energy release by matter falling towards a supermassive black hole --- a black hole whose mass is millions to billions of times the mass of our Sun. AGN emit radiation at all wavelengths. X-rays originating at a distance of a few times the event horizon of the black hole are the emissions closest to the black hole that we can detect; thus, X-rays directly reveal the presence of active supermassive black holes. Oftentimes, however, the supermassive black holes that lie at the centers of AGN are cocooned in gas and dust that absorb the emitted low energy X-rays and the optical and ultraviolet light, hiding the black hole from view at these wavelengths. Until recently, this low-energy absorption presented a major obstacle in observational efforts to map the accretion history of the universe. In 1999 and 2000, the launches of the Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray Observatories finally broke the impasse. The impact of these observatories on X-ray astronomy is similar to the impact that the Hubble Space Telescope had on optical astronomy. The astounding new data from these observatories have enabled astronomers to make enormous advances in their understanding of when accretion occurs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_ujSBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Diversity Advantage : A Guide to Making Diversity Work","description":"Powerful information you can put to work right away...this practical book is brimming with insights, answers, resources and tactics-to make diversity and inclusion daily practices instead of intangible concepts.

In Breaking the Sound Barrier, John Winsor clears the air by presenting evidence that some works are, in fact, objectively better than others. This is a particularly timely issue because a great deal of bad music is being performed in American concert halls right now and a great deal of good music isn't. If you believe that qualitative judgment in the arts is purely subjective, this book should persuade you to rethink your position. If, on the other hand, you think there is a genuine qualitative difference between one musical work and another, this book will provide you with relevant ammunition. Winsor defines music, presents some empirical evidence from the field of music psychology, relates that evidence to events in Western music history, and explains what works and what doesn'tyand why. He demonstrates that from the advent of notation to the present, music has, in fact, progressed and not merely changed. He then exposes some major errors in modernist and postmodernist writing that have disrupted music's progress and recommends remedial action for restoring the mainstream literary tradition. \\"This is a challenging and thought-provoking book.\\" yDiana Deutsch, Professor of Psychology, University of California, San Diego. \\"John Winsor tackles big questions about music and our perceptions, coming at them head-on.

No philosopher is more important for his careful, critical, and deeply perceptive examination of the grounds for belief in divine powers and for his sceptical accounts of the causes and consequences of religious belief, expressed most powerfully in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion and The Natural History of Religion. The Dialogues ask if belief in God can be inferred from the nature of the universe or whether it is even consistent with what we know about the universe. The Natural History of Religion investigates the origins of belief, and follows its development from harmless polytheism to dogmatic monotheism. Together they constitute the most formidable attack upon the rationality of religious belief ever mounted by a philosopher. This edition also includes Section XI of The Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding and a letter concerning the Dialogues, as well as particularly helpful critical apparatus and abstracts of the main texts, enabling the reader to locate or relocate key topics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YnsCOwAACAAJ&dq=The+Natural+History+of+Religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Resonance of Blood","description":"Blessed with astounding psychic abilities, Peter Thorne is called upon by the San Francisco Police Department to identify a series of butchered corpses mutilated beyond recognition.

In her groundbreaking exploration of silence as a significant rhetorical art, Cheryl Glenn articulates the ways in which tactical silence can be as expressive and strategic an instrument of human communication as speech itself. Drawing from linguistics, phenomenology, feminist studies, anthropology, ethnic studies, and literary analysis, Unspoken: A Rhetoric of Silence theorizes both a cartography and grammar of silence. By mapping the range of spaces silence inhabits, Glenn offers a new interpretation of its complex variations and uses. Glenn contextualizes the rhetoric of silence by focusing on selected contemporary examples. Listening to silence and voice as gendered positions, she analyzes the highly politicized silences and words of a procession of figures she refers to as ?all the President's women,  including Anita Hill, Lani Guiner, Gennifer Flowers, and Chelsea Clinton. She also turns an investigative ear to the cultural taciturnity attributed to various Native American groups?Navajo, Apache, Hopi, and Pueblo?and its true meaning. Through these examples, Glenn reinforces the rhetorical contributions of the unspoken, codifying silence as a rhetorical device with the potential to deploy, defer, and defeat power. Unspoken concludes by suggesting opportunities for further research into silence and silencing, including music, religion, deaf communities, cross-cultural communication, and the circulation of silence as a creative resource within the college classroom and for college writers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GCbAfVbN9rUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quick Guide: Garages & Carports: Step-by-Step Construction Methods","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZLUNtwAACAAJ&dq=Quick+Guide:+Garages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Journey Toward Wholeness: A Spiritual Encounter with Prostate Cancer","description":"Journey toward Wholeness is the story of Stegall's experience with prostate cancer.

It registers itself on the public consciousness, translates into politics and policy, and impels politicians to run for office and, once elected, to serve in particular ways.This is a book about opinion?not opinions. James Stimson takes the incremental, vacillating, time-trapped data points of public opinion surveys and transforms them into a conceptualization of public mood swings that can be measured and used to predict change, not just to describe it. To do so, he reaches far back in U.S. survey research and compiles the data in such a way as to allow the minutiae of attitudes toward abortion, gun control, and housing to dissolve into a portrait of national mood and change.Using sophisticated techniques of coding, statistics, and data equalization, the author has amassed an unrivaled database from which to extrapolate his findings. The results go a long way toward calibrating the folklore of political eras, and the cyclical patterns that emerge show not only the regulatory impulse of the 1960s and 1970s and the swing away from it in the 1980s; the cycles also show that we are in the midst of another major mood swing right now?what the author calls the ?unnoticed liberalism? of current American politics.Concise, suggestive, and eminently readable, Public Opinion in America is ideal for courses on public opinion, public policy, and methods, as well as for introductory courses in American government. Examples and illustrations abound, and appendixes document the measurement of policy mood from survey research marginals. This revised second edition includes updated data on public opinion and voters through the 1996 presidential election.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xWBRDwAAQBAJ&dq=Public+Opinion+In+America:+Moods,+Cycles,+And+Swings,+Second+Edition+(Transforming+American+Politics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Asheron's Call Official Strategies & Secrets","description":"Asheron's Call is the latest in an extremely popular new genre: online role-playing games.

In the absence of complete insurance markets for human capital, the decentralized equilibrium is characterized by excessive specialization. The socially optimal investment portfolio entails diversification for the reasons familiar from the CAPM. By credibly promising to protect losers ex post, the government can achieve the optimally diversified investment pattern.

In Kate Hannigan, her very first novel, Catherine Cookson introduces us to the enduring story of her most charismatic heroine. The moment he lays eyes on Kate, Dr. Rodney Prince is enchanted. He senses in this poverty-stricken patient an intelligence and warmth that's completely unexpected. His own wife, living in the oblivion of velvet cushions and lavish dinner parties, seems crude by comparison. Though they meet only briefly then retreat to their separate worlds, the image of Kate leaves an indelible mark upon his mind. Rodney knows that Kate's spirit has survived life-long suffering at the hands of men. Her father, an embittered dock worker, directed his violent rages toward Kate and her mother. At age eighteen Kate fell victim to a smooth-talking seducer and became the unwed mother of a child she later compromised her dignity to support. Such circumstances only deepen Rodney's desire to rescue Kate and overturn the codes of a society that serve to keep them apart. As the kindhearted Dr. Prince unintentionally wins over the heart of Kate's fatherless daughter, he and Kate begin to acknowledge that the gap between rich and poor might not be so great after all. Available now in the United States, Kate Hannigan remains a timeless tribute to romantic love. England's late, great Catherine Cookson has spun the unforgettable tale of a wealthy man caught in a loveless marriage, a young woman trapped in the slums, and their defiance of the mores of Edwardian society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SA5DNaZJHCQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women Writers of Traditional China: An Anthology of Poetry and Criticism","description":"The book also includes an extended section of criticism by and about women writers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xRNnU-SpDyYC&dq=Women+Writers+of+Traditional+China:+An+Anthology+of+Poetry+and+Criticism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Traditional Houses of Rural Italy","description":"An inspiring tour of the vernacular architecture of six regions","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CaiFAAAAIAAJ&dq=Traditional+Houses+of+Rural+Italy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Digital Signal Processing and Filter Design","description":"A practical and accessible guide to understanding digital signal processing Introduction to Digital Signal Processing and Filter Design was developed and fine-tuned from the author's twenty-five years of experience teaching classes in digital signal processing.

Meanwhile, her manager, P.T. Barnum, became the prototype for another figure of enduring significance: the pop culture impresario. Starting with Lind's fabled U.S. tour and winding all the way into the twenty-first century, Live Music in America surveys the ongoing impact and changing conditions of live music performance in the U.S. It covers a range of historic performances, from the Fisk Jubilee Singers expanding the sphere of African American music in the 1870s, to Benny Goodman bringing swing to Carnegie Hall in 1938, to 1952's Moondog Coronation Ball in Cleveland - arguably the first rock and roll concert - to Beyonc 's boundary-shattering performance at the 2018 Coachella festival. More than that, the book details the roles played by performers, audiences, media commentators, and a variety of live music producers (promoters, agents, sound and stage technicians) in shaping what live music means and how it has evolved. Live Music in America connects what occurs behind the scenes to what takes place on stage to highlight the ways in which live music is very deliberately produced and does not just spontaneously materialize. Along the way, author Steve Waksman uses previously unstudied archival materials to shed new light on the origins of jazz, the emergence of rock 'n' roll, and the rise of the modern music festival.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WnxrEAAAQBAJ&dq=YOUNG+MEN+WITH+UNLIMITED+CAPITAL:+The+Inside+Story+of+the+Legendary+Woodstock+Festival+by+the+Two+Who+Paid+For+It&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fragrant Vegetable","description":"A ten-year resident of China shows how to combine American vegetables with exotic oriental specialties like tofu, bamboo shoots, bean curd sheets and \\"skins\\" to easily prepare healthy and economical vegetarian dishes","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=edP6xrtELH0C&dq=The+Fragrant+Vegetable&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bluebirds Nest","description":"Birds and other forest animals help Bluebird build her nest, which readers can feel as it appears in the form of brown fuzzy strings.

It defines what excommunication is, and highlights the shameful fact that thousands of genuine Christians are either forced out of their churches by leaders, or by their own consciences. The book looks at examples from history and from both Roman Catholic and Reformed cases. Particular mention is made of John Knox's formulation, but the main aim of the book is to describe what the Bible says. Dr. Napier believes that God's word is the only measure a church should use, and so he sums up the scriptural position as the only feasible one to use. In the 1990's the Toronto Blessing took control of thousands of churches worldwide. Dr Napier was on of only 3 Christian teachers to recognize this as a false movement of God. So he led opposition to it, much to his cost. The Alpha course, so enthusiastically accepted worldwide, is the 'theologising' arm of the Toronto Blessing and charismaticism. For this reason the Alpha course has been examined by Dr. Napier, who completely obliterates its teachings as a 'false gospel'. This book is not afraid to speak out against the thousands of cases of excommunication resulting from charismatic teaching and the Toronto Blessing, which devastated authentic Christianity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T1E7mAEACAAJ&dq=The+Left+Boot+of+Fellowship:+how+people+are+forced+out+of+churches&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Garrett: 1000 years from Normandy","description":"William Garrett was born in in 1794 in South Carolina.

Elizabeth Kindall s innovative analysis of the visual experiences and social functions Huang conveyed through his oeuvre reveals an unrecognized tradition of site paintings, here labeled geo-narratives, that recount specific journeys and create meaning in the paintings. Kindall shows how Huang created these geo-narratives by drawing upon the Suzhou place-painting tradition, as well as the encoded experiences of southwestern sites discussed in historical gazetteers and personal travel records, and the geography of the sites themselves. Ultimately these works were intended to create personas and fulfill specific social purposes among the educated class during the Ming-Qing transition. Some of Huang s paintings of the southwest, together with his travel records, became part of a campaign to attain the socially generated title of Filial Son, whereas others served private functions. This definitive study elucidates the context for Huang Xiangjian s painting and identifies geo-narrative as a distinct landscape-painting tradition lauded for its naturalistic immediacy, experiential topography, and dramatic narratives of moral persuasion, class identification, and biographical commemoration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K3vnDwAAQBAJ&dq=Guizhou+Province,+Second+Edition+(Odyssey+Illustrated+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Israeli Hebrew for Speakers of English (Book 1)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jkchAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Straw Man","description":"The author takes a skeptic's look at many commonly held beliefs about dog behavior and training.

A searing, post-apocalyptic novel about a father and son's fight to survive, this \\"tale of survival and the miracle of goodness only adds to McCarthy's stature as a living master.

Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food and each other. The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, \\"each the other's world entire,\\" are sustained by love.

To begin, one must distinguish among three separate but interrelated uses of the term \\"public address\\" -- as practice, theory, and criticism. The essays in this volume represent landmarks in the literal sense of that term -- they are marks on the intellectual landscape that indicate where scholars and ideas have passed, and in that passing left a mark for future generations. It is appropriate to revisit the landmarks that have set public address off as a field of study and it allows readers to remember the struggles that have led to the current situation. Most of the authors of the following chapters are deceased, but their ideas live on -- transformed, adapted, modified, rejected, and reborn. The scholarly dialectic continues. What constitutes a study in public address, how best to approach rhetorical texts, which analytical tools are required for the job, how best to balance text with context and what role ought theory to play in the conduct or outcome of critical inquiry -- these questions live on. To answer them at all is to engender debate and that is how it should be if the intellectual vitality of public address is to be maintained. The papers are a prolegomenon to such studies, for they mark where scholars have been and point the way to where they still must go.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TOjyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pride of Family : Four Generations of American Women of Color","description":" From the moment I read the words [my great-grandmother] Frances Anne Rollin wrote in Boston on January 1, 1868  The year renews its birth today with all its hopes and sorrows  she became my beacon, the foremother who would finally share with me our collective past . . .

American Apartheid shows how the black ghetto was created by whites during the first half of the twentieth century in order to isolate growing urban black populations. It goes on to show that, despite the Fair Housing Act of 1968, segregation is perpetuated today through an interlocking set of individual actions, institutional practices, and governmental policies. In some urban areas the degree of black segregation is so intense and occurs in so many dimensions simultaneously that it amounts to  hypersegregation.  Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton demonstrate that this systematic segregation of African Americans leads inexorably to the creation of underclass communities during periods of economic downturn. Under conditions of extreme segregation, any increase in the overall rate of black poverty yields a marked increase in the geographic concentration of indigence and the deterioration of social and economic conditions in black communities. As ghetto residents adapt to this increasingly harsh environment under a climate of racial isolation, they evolve attitudes, behaviors, and practices that further marginalize their neighborhoods and undermine their chances of success in mainstream American society. This book is a sober challenge to those who argue that race is of declining significance in the United States today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S2zsDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Death of Hope (Star Wars: Jedi Apprentice, Book 15)","description":"Part of the Star Wars, Jedi Apprentice series, this book features the young Obi-Wan Kenobi and his adventures as an apprentice in the Jedi tradition.

Martinez was on a routine patrol when the Humvee he was driving hit an antitank mine in Iraq, resulting in severe injuries and burns on his face and more than one-third of his body. Out of that tragedy came an improbable journey of inspiration, motivation, and dreams come true. In Full of Heart, Martinez shares his story in intimate detail, from his upbringing in the American South and his time in the Army to his recovery and the indomitable spirit that has made him an inspiration to countless fans. J.R. Martinez always had a strong spirit. Raised in Bossier City, Louisiana, and then Hope, Arkansas, by a single mother from El Salvador, he was well known at school for his good looks and his smart mouth. At seventeen, showing an early determination and drive that would become one of his trademark qualities, J.R. convinced his mom to move to Dalton, Georgia, where he believed he would have a better chance of being recruited to play college football. His positive attitude earned him a spot on a competitive high school football squad, but when his college dreams collapsed, he turned to the U.S. Army. A few months later, he found himself serving in Iraq. When J.R. s humvee hit a mine and exploded just one month into his deployment he was immediately evacuated to a San Antonio medical center, where he spent the next thirty-four months in grueling recovery. Seeing his disfigured face for the first time after the accident threw him into a crushing period of confusion and anger. His spirits were low, until he was asked to speak to another young burn victim. J.R. realized how valuable and gratifying it was to share his experiences with other patients and listen to theirs. He d found a calling. His fellow soldiers, along with the local and then national media, soon latched onto J.R. s spirit and strength. His resilience, optimism, and charm were also noted by Hollywood and scored him roles on All My Children and Dancing with the Stars, where he was the season thirteen champion. Today, J.R. tours the country sharing his story and his lessons for overcoming challenges and embracing hope, lessons that abound in this book.

You might naturally assume that the problem is one of memory (i.e., remembering the answers to the test), but the real problem is what I call the Situation Effect. In laymen terms, our intelligence is composed of two halves, the first being genetic, the second being environmental (e.g., diet, sleep, sociability, etc.), and these two halves come together to form our current situation. Therefore, effects on either of these halves can help make or break our grades. The only way to improve your situation is to learn how to make your brain happy and comfortable, because when youre sad or stressed you will not function as well. In fact, some people are physically disfigured to a certain degree because they endured so much trial. In this state of mind, motor skills are frustrated and do not function like they should. Also, because of provoking anxiety, ability to fight disease is infringed. Above all, your focus, drive to succeed, and mental activity are all incredibly bankrupt. When theyre bad enough, it feels like they dont even exist. Therefore, if you keep yourself as happy as possible you will study more effectively.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LfcaI_QIRQkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Opening to God","description":"Prayer is not merely something we do; prayer is what God does in us.

Named for a heroic World War I tank driver, it took the threat of global war in 1940 to kick-start its construction. Soon Camp Roberts had a capacity to house and train 23,000 men. During the war, almost half a million men trained here. Row upon row of wooden buildings, replete with churches, stores, a hospital, and an amphitheater where A-list stars performed, made it a mobilized city of 45,000 at its peak. In 1946, it became a ghost town overnight. Revived during the Korean and Vietnam conflicts, it passed into National Guard control in 1971. However, all branches of the military continue to train here, and the camp has renewed relevance for troops bound for the Middle East.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Bw4l_Lx2PmwC&dq=Camp+Roberts+(Images+of+America:+California)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old MacDonald's Musical Farm","description":"Press the red circle on the cover to sing along to the melody of \\"Old MacDonald Had a Farm.\\" Each page of this waterproof little book shows a different animal on the farm along with the lyrics to the song.

Similar to the author's once held view, it seems most people think you must be quite smart to work in the Automobile Industry. This is not the story the author tells; the industry thrives despite the proliferation of \\"idiots\\" throughout its ranks. The author offers up several \\"Common Sense Principles,\\" and then proceeds to illustrate many examples where \\"Idiots\\" ignored or were ignorant of these principles resulting in increased costs to the corporation and other havoc. \\"Common Sense\\" is shown to be uncommon. Common questions about automobiles are answered: Why can't I find a good mechanic? Why it is not covered on my new car warranty? What happened to the 100 mpg carburetor? Should I buy a hybrid vehicle? How will future cars be powered? Common popular beliefs are dispelled: More education means you're smarter. The smartest people work for the government. You have to be smart to get a patent. Hybrid vehicles always get better gas mileage. Chrysler research projects are exposed. Can a rubber band power a car?
