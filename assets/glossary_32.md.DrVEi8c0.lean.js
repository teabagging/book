On a sunny day in May 1940, the French army sent out the cavalry against the invading German army s panzer tanks. Unsurprisingly, the French were routed. Twenty-six-year-old Claude Simon was among the French forces. As they retreated, he saw his captain shot off his horse by a German sniper. This is the primal scene to which Simon returns repeatedly in his fiction and nowhere so powerfully as in his most famous novel The Flanders Road. Here Simon s own memories overlap with those of his central character, Georges, whose captain, a distant relative, dies a similar death. Georges reviews the circumstances and sense or senselessness of that death, first in the company of a fellow prisoner in a POW camp and then some years later in the course of an ever more erotically charged visit to the captain s widow, Corinne. As he does, other stories emerge: Corinne s prewar affair with the jockey Igl sia, who would become the captain s orderly; the possible suicide of an eighteenth-century ancestor, whose grim portrait loomed large in Georges s childhood home; Georges s learned father, whose books are no help against barbarism. The great question throughout, the question that must be urgently asked even as it remains unanswerable, is whether fiction can confront and respond to the trauma of history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ahpOEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Flanders+Road&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1001 Activities for Children","description":"Simple activities to help a child explore the wonders of nature, the imagination, the senses, art, crafts, music and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d_F_DzJTM-4C&dq=1001+Activities+for+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself QuarkXPress : Version 4 (Teach Yourself)","description":"Combining his skills as a software trainer with his experience as a graphic designer, Christopher Lumgair introduces the essentials of the world's most popular desktop publishing software.

The early 1960s saw American auto manufacturers desperately trying to sell cars to the emerging baby-boom market. Chevrolet attained some success with its sporty Corvair Monza. Ford responded first with a sportier Falcon, then with its grand-slam, home-run pony car, the Mustang. At first, Chevrolet hesitated to abandon the technologically advanced Corvair, but when it finally entered the pony car market in 1967, its new Camaro instantly became one of the most iconic cars of the classic muscle-car era. When muscle cars went dormant for a generation, it was once again the classic pony cars that jump-started American performance. The battle that raged between Camaro and Mustang in the 1980s rejuvenated the US auto industry's interest in high-performance muscle cars. The Camaro lost its way in the 1990s, with Chevrolet pursuing technological advances and Ford pursuing classic American muscle. As was the case in the 1960s, Ford's muscular pony car trounced Chevrolet's technologically advanced sporty car in the race that mattered most: showroom sales. The Mustang thrived while the Camaro left the scene. Fortunately, that departure was only temporary. Chevrolet introduced a twenty-first-century Camaro in 2010, and it has become one of Chevrolet's most popular models. With stunning photography from author Mike Mueller and never-before-seen archival photography from partner General Motors, Camaro: Fifty Years of Chevy Performance chronicles the Camaro's rich history, from the early attempts to reach the youth market in the 1960s, through the potent and turbulent years of the classic muscle-car era, the resurgence of muscle in the 1980s, the sad decline of the 1990s, and the triumphant rebirth of the new car in this new millennium.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gtxiDQAAQBAJ&dq=Camaro+(Motorbooks+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tantrum","description":"If you are the parent of a toddler or preschooler, chances are you know a thing or two about tantrums.

A Los Angeles Times Best Book of the Year and a New York Times Notable Book Cipriano Algor, an elderly potter, lives with his daughter Marta and her husband Mar?al in a small village on the outskirts of The Center, an imposing complex of shops, apartments, and offices. Mar?al works there as a security guard, and Cipriano drives him to work each day before delivering his own humble pots and jugs. On one such trip, he is told not to make any more deliveries. People prefer plastic, apparently. Unwilling to give up his craft, Cipriano tries his hand at making ceramic dolls. Astonishingly, The Center places an order for hundreds, and Cipriano and Marta set to work until the order is cancelled and the penniless trio must move from the village into The Center. When mysterious sounds of digging emerge from beneath their new apartment, Cipriano and Mar?al investigate; what they find transforms the family s life, in a novel that is both  irrepressibly funny  (The Christian Science Monitor) and a  triumph  (The Washington Post Book World).  The struggle of the individual against bureaucracy and anonymity is one of the great subjects of modern literature, and Saramago is often matched with Kafka as one of its premier exponents.

The work is an epic sea story of Captain Ahab's voyage in pursuit of Moby Dick, a great white whale. A contemporary commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891, its reputation rose during the twentieth century. D.H. Lawrence called it \\"the greatest book of the sea ever written.\\" Jorge Luis Borges praised the style: \\"Unforgettable phrases abound.\\" Today it is considered one of the Great American Novels and a leading work of American Romanticism. The opening line, \\"Call me Ishmael,\\" is one of the most recognizable opening lines in Western literature. Ishmael then narrates the voyage of the whaleship Pequod, commanded by Captain Ahab. Ahab has one purpose: revenge on Moby Dick, a ferocious, enigmatic white whale which on a previous voyage destroyed Ahab's ship and severed his leg at the knee. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and the process of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. Melville uses a wide range of styles and literary devices ranging from lists and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9lNoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nothing But The Best Sex & The Supper Club","description":"Can you find love online?

Before the text even discusses the process of developing a research question, the authors introduce the reader to what it means to make an inference and the different challenges that social scientists face when confronting this task. Only with this ultimate goal in mind will students be able to ask appropriate questions, conduct fruitful literature reviews, select and execute the proper research design, and critically evaluate the work of others. The authors' primary goal is to teach students to critically evaluate their own research designs and others  and analyze the extent to which they overcome the classic challenges to making inference: internal and external validity concerns, omitted variable bias, endogeneity, measurement, sampling, and case selection errors, and poor research questions or theory. As such, students will not only be better able to conduct political science research, but they will also be more savvy consumers of the constant flow of causal assertions that they confront in scholarship, in the media, and in conversations with others. Three themes run through Barakso, Sabet, and Schaffner s text: minimizing classic research problems to making valid inferences, effective presentation of research results, and the nonlinear nature of the research process. Throughout their academic years and later in their professional careers, students will need to effectively convey various bits of information. Presentation skills gleaned from this text will benefit students for a lifetime, whether they continue in academia or in a professional career. Several distinctive features make this book noteworthy: A common set of examples threaded throughout the text give students a common ground across chapters and expose them to a broad range of subfields in the discipline. Box features throughout the book illustrate the nonlinear, \\"non-textbook\\" reality of research, demonstrate the often false inferences and poor social science in the way the popular press covers politics, and encourage students to think about ethical issues at various stages of the research process.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kk9JAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At Preschool with Teddy Bear (Teddy Bear Board Book)","description":"In this version of the classic jump rope rhyme, Teddy Bear invites readers to bend down low, touch their toes, jump up high, and touch the sky.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wqLKygAACAAJ&dq=At+Preschool+with+Teddy+Bear+(Teddy+Bear+Board+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Happy Ending: The Selected Writings of Mike Topp","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mQwiPQAACAAJ&dq=Happy+Ending:+The+Selected+Writings+of+Mike+Topp&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Brave Old Army Team: The Cheating Scandal that Rocked the Nation: West Point, 1951","description":"This provocative book tells the amazing story of how winning at all costs became a way of life in intercollegiate football as played by West Point; how cheating to maintain academic proficiency for football players was seen as desirable to further the academy's winning tradition.

Anderson's idea of \`nationality inflation' provides a valuable new perspective on these topics.

A leading anthropologist investigates Why do men behave the way they do? Is it their male brains? Surging testosterone? From vulgar locker-room talk to mansplaining to sexual harassment, society is too quick to explain male behavior in terms of biology. In Are Men Animals?, anthropologist Matthew Gutmann argues that predatory male behavior is in no way inevitable. Men behave the way they do because culture permits it, not because biology demands it. To prove this, he embarks on a global investigation of masculinity. Exploring everything from the gender-bending politics of American college campuses to the marriage markets of Shanghai and the women-only subway cars of Mexico City, Gutmann shows just how complicated masculinity can be. The result isn't just a new way to think about manhood. It's a guide to a better life, for all of us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YLSXDwAAQBAJ&dq=Men+and+Other+Mammals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"His Last Bow: Some Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes (Collected Works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle)","description":"'His Last Bow', the title story of this collection, tells how Sherlock Holmes is brought out of retirement to help the Government fight the German threat at the approach of the First World War.

Drawing on the experiences and concerns of social movements created by marginalized and excluded groups, Iris Marion Young shows how democratic theorists fail to consider institutional arrangements for including people not culturally identified with white European male norms of reason and respectability. Basing her vision of the good society on the differentiated, culturally plural network of contemporary urban life, she argues for a principle of group representation in democratic publics and for group-differentiated policies. Danielle Allen s incisive foreword contextualizes Young s work and explains how debates surrounding social justice have changed since and been transformed by the original publication of the book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZXxIEAAAQBAJ&dq=Justice+and+the+Politics+of+Difference&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Spanish Cooking","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Seductions of Rice","description":"The James Beard award-winning authors of Hot Sour Salty Sweet explore the subtly exquisite pleasure of rice with 200 recipes from around the world.

Tolkien \\"cults\\" have sprung up to debate the reality and mythology of Middle Earth, Hobbits, Elves, and the power of magic rings. And yet, surprisingly little is known about the personal life of the creator of Middle Earth. This man, who was embarrassed by his success, lived most of his life as an Oxford scholar in the surrounds of a cloistered academic community. As a child in South Africa, Tolkien was kidnapped by a native and taken into the bush. As a youngster in the English industrial city of Birmingham, Tolkien was raised by a Catholic priest. And as a young adult, Tolkien lived through the bloody horror of the trenches of World War I. How these experiences fired his imagination is just one of the areas that Daniel Grotta tries to uncover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4j4eAQAAIAAJ&dq=Biography+of+J.+R.+R.+Tolkien:+Architect+of+Middle-Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lee and Grant: A Dual Biography","description":"A biography of the two gifted Civil War commanders from a New York Timesbestselling author:  A great story . . . History at its best  (Publishers Weekly). Their names are forever linked in the history of the Civil War, but Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant could not have been more dissimilar. Lee came from a world of Southern gentility and aristocratic privilege while Grant had coarser, more common roots in the Midwest. As a young officer trained in the classic mold, Lee graduated from West Point at the top of his class and served with distinction in the MexicanAmerican War. Grant s early military career was undistinguished and marred by rumors of drunkenness. As commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, Lee s early victories demoralized the Union Army and cemented his reputation as a brilliant tactician. Meanwhile, Grant struggled mightily to reach the top of the Union command chain. His iron will eventually helped turn the tide of the war, however, and in April 1864, President Abraham Lincoln gave Grant command of all Union forces. A year later, he accepted Lee s surrender at the Appomattox Court House. With brilliance and deep feeling, New York Timesbestselling author Gene Smith brings the Civil War era to vivid life and tells the dramatic story of two remarkable men as they rise to glory and reckon with the bitter aftermath of the bloodiest conflict in American history.

In 1817, the first British envoy to meet the king of the Asante of West Africa was dazzled by his reception. A group of 5,000 Asante soldiers, many wearing immense caps topped with three foot eagle feathers and gold ram's horns, engulfed him with a \\"zeal bordering on phrensy,\\" shooting muskets into the air. The envoy was escorted, as no fewer than 100 bands played, to the Asante king's palace and greeted by a tremendous throng of 30,000 noblemen and soldiers, bedecked with so much gold that his party had to avert their eyes to avoid the blinding glare. Some Asante elders wore gold ornaments so massive they had to be supported by attendants. But a criminal being lead to his execution - hands tied, ears severed, knives thrust through his cheeks and shoulder blades - was also paraded before them as a warning of what would befall malefactors. This first encounter set the stage for one of the longest and fiercest wars in all the European conquest of Africa. At its height, the Asante empire, on the Gold Coast of Africa in present-day Ghana, comprised three million people and had its own highly sophisticated social, political, and military institutions. Armed with European firearms, the tenacious and disciplined Asante army inflicted heavy casualties on advancing British troops, in some cases defeating them. They won the respect and admiration of British commanders, and displayed a unique willingness to adapt their traditional military tactics to counter superior British technology. Even well after a British fort had been established in Kumase, the Asante capital, the indigenous culture stubbornly resisted Europeanization, as long as the \\"golden stool,\\" the sacred repository of royal power, remained in Asante hands. It was only after an entire century of fighting that resistance ultimately ceased.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Tkm5UZJz8z0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contemporary African Politics","description":"Looking at protests from Senegal to Kenya, Lisa Mueller shows how cross-class coalitions fuel contemporary African protests across the continent.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jeRfDwAAQBAJ&dq=Contemporary+African+Politics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The throne of Saturn; a novel of space and politics.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=60_mugAACAAJ&dq=The+throne+of+Saturn%3B+a+novel+of+space+and+politics.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"North of Slavery: The Negro In the Free States 1790-1860","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EfK4tQEACAAJ&dq=North+of+Slavery:+The+Negro+In+the+Free+States+1790-1860&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boy Scouts of America : The Official Handbook for Boys (Reprint of Original 1911 Edition)","description":"Enjoy this high-quality Doublebit Legacy reprint of the first 1911 edition of the Scout Handbook For Boys, the first \\"official\\" handbook issued for scouts in the U.S.A.

They travel opulently by cruise ship to Ensenada and survive a rocky trip through Baja California, only to be shocked when they arrive in San Felipe. Their beachfront property is, indeed, on the beach, but the  structure  is a cement slab and the Airstream trailer their uncle parked on the property in the early 1960s!

In the 1960s, the Peruvian people had their first real chance to make a democratic choice between continuation of the country's open-economy orientation or change, & they chose change. Using this as his starting point, Sheahan explains how their choice was not provoked by any economic crisis but by other major influences. The majority of Peruvians, he shows, were seeking objectives more fundamental than economic growth. They were, with conflicting visions but with many good reasons, \\"searching for a better society.\\" While positive accomplishments have been important, enough went wrong to lead Peru back to a more market-determined economic system in 1990. Sheahan addresses the consequences of this return to the earlier economic strategy & what might be done to shape the process of development-in Peru & in Latin America more generally-toward less unfair societies. Searching for a Better Society is different from the great majority of economic studies of developing countries in its emphasis on the basic role of social dissatisfaction with the country's traditional liberal economic system & on the complexity of social goals involved in evaluation of the choice & consequences of economic policies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-8JTKvtHcM4C&dq=Searching+for+a+Better+Society:+The+Peruvian+Economy+from+1950&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Franciscan Hand-decorated Embossed Dinnerware","description":"A comprehensive guide to Fransciscan hand-decorated embossed dinnerware manufactured in the United States by Gladding, McBean & Co. from 1940 to 1984.

Wilkes s political career was rancorous, involving duels, imprisonments in the Tower of London, and the Massacre of St. George s Fields in which seven of his supporters were shot to death by government troops.

Forster's House of Fiction (Twayne's Masterwork Studies Series)","description":"In Howards End, E. M. Forster describes Edwardian England not as a golden afternoon of Empire, but as a time of conflict between nations, parties, classes, and the sexes. Forster's England is one in which a peaceful rural past encounters a frenzied urban present, the countryside is threatened by urban encroachment and pollution, intellectuals quarrel with businessmen, art vies with sport as a recreational activity, cultural tastes collide with popular tastes, entrenched male power ignores or suppresses emerging female aspirations, and laissez-faire economic attitudes are harmful to the poor and underprivileged. Such conflicts, as Alistair Duckworth demonstrates, pervade the novel's episodes, settings, conversations, and commentaries. On the publication of Howards End in 1910 Forster was recognized as a major Edwardian novelist. Forster's subtle characterizations, narrative ironies, perfectly pitched dialogues, and evocative treatment of place established him in the great tradition of the English novel of manners. Living in a fragmented society, Forster brought new depth to that tradition; he engaged the divisive issues of his time by presenting them as human encounters in domestic contexts. His perspective was that of a liberal humanist--in Howards End he obviously favors the progressive attitudes of the Schlegel women to the Social Darwinist behavior of the Wilcox men. As a realist, however, he reveals not only the relative powerlessness of benevolent intellectuals to bring about social improvement, but also their financial complicity in the system they oppose. In its critique of \\"commerce\\" and \\"culture\\" in a swiftly changing world, and in its searching exploration of sexual roles, Howards End has remarkable relevance to the present. Rather than arguing that Forster brings the novel's oppositions together to form an aesthetic whole and provide a satisfying political solution to the problems of his time, Duckworth values Howards End for its formal diversity, multiple discourses, intertextual echoes and allusions, and range of topics and themes. He combines a close reading of Forster's text with relevant biographical considerations and comparisons of Forster's techniques with those of significant predecessors such as Jane Austen and contemporaries such as Joseph Conrad and D.

His fame surpasses that of any other medieval French lyricist in spite of the modest quantity, uneven quality, and often repellent subject-matter of his work. His poems are largely autobiographical, and are rich in their descriptions of thefts, fights, nocturnal prowling, imprisonment, and exile. However, as Barbara Sargent-Baur points out, when Villon's work is good, it is very good, indeed unforgettable. His two major works are the Lais, a series of bequests in anticipation of his prudent departure from Paris, and Testament, which is about his primary topic, himself. This is the first edition of the whole of the corpus of Villon translations that utilizes a re-reading of all the manuscript sources and presenting for each poem a single-source text with all emendations accounted for. It is also the first annotated English version based on the best-text principle and respecting both Villon's meaning and his metrics. A modern edition of the French texts is presented beside the English on facing pages. In an extensive commentary, Sargent-Baur identifies the poet's literary and historical allusions, as well as place-names, legatees, and biographical data.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SPlcAAAAMAAJ&dq=Francois+Villon+Complete+Poems:+Edited+with+English+Translation+and+Commentary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The black camel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dPwOAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+black+camel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hate on Trial: The Case Against America's Most Dangerous Neo-Nazi","description":"Describes the legal battle against the leader of White Aryan Resistance after an Ethiopian student was killed by neo-Nazis in Portland, Oregon","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wpnS_AkDynIC&dq=Hate+on+Trial:+The+Case+Against+America%27s+Most+Dangerous+Neo-Nazi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Living Sea","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LQzVvgEACAAJ&dq=The+Living+Sea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hebrew-Scholarly Bible","description":"\\"Magisterial. . . .

With every encounter, we either demonstrate that we ll protect what we value or that we ll give ourselves away. Healthy boundaries preserve our integrity. Unlike defenses, which isolate us from our true selves and from those we love, boundaries filter out harm. This book provides the tools and insights needed to create boundaries so that we can allow time and energy for the things that matter and helps break down limiting defenses that stunt personal growth. Focusing on every facet of daily life from friendships and sexual relationships to dress and appearance to money, food, and psychotherapy Katherine presents case studies highlighting the ways in which individuals violate their own boundaries or let other people breach them.

Duty bound to obtain her father's consent for this match, Miss Stansbury becomes lost at sea while traveling to meet him in Egypt. But Valerian's hopes for a long and carefree bachelorhood are dashed once again when Miss Stansbury reappears after a year spent shipwrecked on a desert island.

Lincoln's work frequently appeared in popular magazines such as the Saturday Evening Post and The Delineator. Lincoln was aware of contemporary naturalist writers, such as Frank Norris and Theodore Dreiser, who used American literature to plumb the depths of human nature, but he rejected this literary exercise. Lincoln claimed that he was satisfied \\"spinning yarns\\" that made readers feel good about themselves and their neighbors. Two of his stories have been adapted to film. Lincoln was born in Brewster, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, and his mother moved the family to Chelsea, Massachusetts, a manufacturing city outside Boston, after the death of his father. Lincoln's literary career celebrating \\"old Cape Cod\\" can partly be seen as an attempt to return to an Eden from which he had been driven by family tragedy. His literary portrayal of Cape Cod can also be understood as a pre-modern haven occupied by individuals of old Yankee stock which was offered to readers as an antidote to an America that was undergoing rapid modernization, urbanization, immigration, and industrialization. Lincoln was a Republican and a Universalist. Upon becoming successful, Lincoln spent his winters in northern New Jersey, near the center of the publishing world in Manhattan, but summered in Chatham, Massachusetts. In Chatham, he lived in a shingle-style house named \\"Crosstrees\\" that was located on a bluff overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. Lincoln died in 1944, at the age of 73, in Winter Park, Florida.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s_T6jwEACAAJ&dq=Galusha+the+Magnificent&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aircraft Carriers of the World, 1914 to the Present","description":"Aircraft Carriers of the World is the first comprehensive reference work to detail in one volume the 360 plus carriers designed or projected by the world's navies.

Perverzion constructs Perfetsky's final days using a mishmash of relics, from official documents to recorded interviews to scraps of paper. Perfetsky, the personification of the Ukrainian artistic superman--he used his masterful musicianship in a collaboration with Elton John during the pop star's secret sojourn in Ukraine--is bound for Venice to participate in a seminar to save the world from absurdity. On the way he becomes a Ukrainian Orpheus descending into the decadence of the West, navigating through surrealistic adventures and no less surrealistic seminar topics as he charges head up (and pants down) toward his fate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a6xiAAAAMAAJ&dq=Perverzion+(Writings+from+an+Unbound+Europe)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret Agent Man (Man Of The Month) (Silhouette Desire)","description":"Revisit a tale of love and suspense in New York Times bestselling author Diana Palmer's SECRET AGENT MAN!

Yet this remarkable woman's sexual escapades form only a part of her own remarkable life story a story she reveals for the first time in the pages of this literary memoir, Child No More. It was a life begun in terror: Two months after her birth, young Xaviera de Vries and her mother were confined in a prison camp during the WWII Japanese occupation of Indonesia; her father, a doctor, was imprisoned in another camp. Two years later, summoned to treat a sick child, he operated on his own daughter without realizing her identity. But that story is just the start of an extraordinary memoir in which she traces her own life and sexuality as it was influenced by the example of her parents: her father, a dapper and witty Jewish psychologist and intellectual, her mother the gorgeous daughter of conventional German parents, and a target of Nazi enmity for her association with a Jew. With breathtaking but entirely characteristic frankness, Xaviera revisits how her parents' own tempestuous relationship (and her father's licentious lifestyle) shaped her own life story. As she chronicles her eventual departure for New York, her entree into the world of prostitution, and her years of international celebrity, she reveals for the first time how her parents' lives continued to entwine with her own, as she endured years of separation from her father, and even stood by her mother as she entered a fulfilling lesbian relationship in the last years of her life. Told in the utterly frank and unquenchably inquisitive voice that marks all her work yet from an entirely new and ultimately more honest perspective Child No More recounts a surprising and ultimately uplifting \\"voyage of discovery through three lives.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=euEIaHD80QEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The expression of the emotions in man and animals","description":"Published in 1872, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals was a book at the very heart of Darwin's research interests - a central pillar of his 'human' series. This book engaged some of the hardest questions in the evolution debate, and it showed the ever-cautious Darwin at his boldest. If Darwin had one goal with Expression, it was to demonstrate the power of his theories for explaining the origin of our most cherished human qualities: morality and intellect. As Darwin explained, \\"He who admits, on general grounds, that the structure and habits of all animals have been gradually evolved, will look at the whole subject of Expression in a new and interesting light.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hJ4ptIIjBVEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thoughts In Solitude","description":"Thoughtful and eloquent, as timely (or timeless) now as when it was originally published in 1956, Thoughts in Solitude addresses the pleasure of a solitary life, as well as the necessity for quiet reflection in an age when so little is private. Thomas Merton writes: \\"When society is made up of men who know no interior solitude it can no longer be held together by love: and consequently it is held together by a violent and abusive authority. But when men are violently deprived of the solitude and freedom which are their due, the society in which they live becomes putrid, it festers with servility, resentment and hate.\\" Thoughts in Solitude stands alongside The Seven Storey Mountain as one of Merton's most uring and popular works. Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk, is perhaps the foremost spiritual thinker of the twentiethcentury. His diaries, social commentary, and spiritual writings continue to be widely read after his untimely death in 1968.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=24Y_PmD0JcMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The slave power: Its character, career and probable designs : being an attempt to explain the real issues involved in the American contest","description":"First published in 1862, this clear analysis of the issues involved in the American Civil War influenced international opinion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7b1HAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Table setting guide","description":"A comprehensive guide to the dinner table covers manners, settings, tableware, history, and lore.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d6xaJWJFe1QC&dq=Table+setting+guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cool Crochet: 30 Hot, Fun Designs to Crochet and Wear","description":"A fun, colorful guide to learning the art of crochet features thirty patterns for a wide variety of projects, including skirts, halters, cardigans, dresses, and even bathing suits--with step-by-step instructions for completing each.

Though profitable, this role made Vig e Le Brun a public and controversial figure, and in 1789 it precipitated her exile. In a Europe torn by strife and revolution, she nevertheless managed to thrive as an independent, self-supporting artist, doggedly setting up studios in Rome, Naples, Venice, Milan, Vienna, St. Petersburg, and London. Long overlooked or dismissed, Vig e Le Brun s portraits now hang in the Louvre, in a room of their own, as well as in all leading art museums of the world. This gripping biography tells the story of a singularly gifted and high-spirited woman during the revolutionary era and explores the development and significance of her art. The book also recounts the public and private lives of Elisabeth Vig e Le Brun, connecting her with such personalities of her age as Catherine the Great, Napoleon, and Benjamin Franklin, and setting her experiences in the context of contemporary European politics and culture.

Both of these trends move away from any traditional discussions of nature toward discussions of socially constructed notions of sex, sexuality and gender roles. While feminists interested in social theory focus on the ways in which social institutions shape these notions, feminists interested in psychoanalytic theory focus on cultural representations of sex, sexuality and gender roles, and the ways that they affect the psyche. This collection includes selections by Simone de Beauvoir, Christine Delphy, Colette Guilluamin, Monique Wittig, Michele Le Doeuff, Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, and Helene Cixous.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mKTlwAEACAAJ&dq=French+Feminism+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A WORLD OUT OF TIME","description":"After 200 years in cryosleep, Jaybee Corbell awakens to find that his mind has been downloaded to another body and he's in servitude to a harsh future State.

Never before in my lifetime (and I have been around the block more times than I care to admit) has there been so much debate and outright disagreement about the state of our society. People are lining up on one side or another regarding immigration, climate change, jobs, the role of government, health care, terrorism, threats to democracy, reproductive rights, and the high cost of higher education. If consensus seems elusive, keep in mind that even the idea of truth is under attack, with people disagreeing not only over the facts but also whether there is such a thing as objective truth and real news. Many of us feel angry, afraid, and overwhelmed. In such a situation, what are we to do? To answer this question, we might turn for inspiration to the wisdom offered more than sixty years ago by C. Wright Mills. When we feel our lives spinning out of control, when we are caught up in changes and challenges that threaten to overwhelm us, Mills suggested that we recognize that our personal problems are rooted in social forces that are bigger than we are. By turning our attention to larger social patterns-in short, by making use of the sociological imagination-we gain a deeper understanding of what's really going on and why. Using the sociological perspective, we draw insight and also gain power because we are now confronting the source of our distress. Focusing on how society operates, we are able to join together with others to change society and, in the process, transform ourselves. For more than 150 years, sociologists have been working to better understand how society operates. As sociologists, we do not arrogantly imagine that we have all the answers, but we are confident that we have learned quite a lot that we can share with others. To our students, we offer an introduction to the fascinating and very practical study of the social world. Our invitation is to learn what we have learned and consider appropriate paths of action. After all, as we come to know our world, we have the responsibility to do all we can to improve it. Society: The Basics, Fifteenth Edition Update, provides you with a comprehensive understanding of how this world works. You will find this title informative, engaging, and even entertaining. Before you have finished the first chapter, you will discover that sociology is both enlightening and useful, and it is also a great deal of fun. Sociology is a field of study that can change the way you see the world and open the door to many new opportunities. What could be more exciting than that?\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xw_CywEACAAJ&dq=Society:+The+Basics+(6th+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Free Blacks in Norfolk, Virginia, 1790-1860: The Darker Side of Freedom (Carter G. Woodson Institute Series in Black Studies)","description":"Very few studies of free blacks have attempted to interpret the actions and events affecting them from their own perspectives. At the same time. the search for understanding the antebellum black experience in the South usually has centered on slaves. In Free Blacks in Norfolk, Virginia, 1790-1860, Tommy L. Bogger portrays lives somewhere between slavery and freedom. A free black community of skilled artisans and semi-skilled laborers emerged in Norfolk around 1800. Some free blacks earned the respect of leading white businessmen, and many enjoyed easy access to credit and steady employment. They showed no hesitation in suing recalcitrant debtors -- black or white -- and until 1805 they could count on the cooperation of court officials in helping them to collect. But from then on. free blacks experienced a steady decline in status that continued throughout the antebellum period. Legal restraints were placed on them at the same time that Norfolk's economy stagnated. and white immigrants arriving in the 1830s entered fields once monopolized by blacks. By the 1850s the free black community was sunk in hopelessness and despair. Free Blacks in Norfolk, Virginia, 1790-1860 discusses the active roles that blacks played in creating their community, contradicting prevalent images of free blacks at the mercy of whites. While previous studies of Virginia's free blacks have focused on Richmond or Petersburg, developments in Norfolk's free black community also merit analysis. Norfolk also offers the advantage of a population large enough to provide a reliable data base yet small enough to preserve the stories of individual lives. Those interested in African-American history, Virginia history, orthe South in general will find this book a valuable new resource.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T8J1QgAACAAJ&dq=Free+Blacks+in+Norfolk,+Virginia,+1790-1860:+The+Darker+Side+of+Freedom+(Carter+G.+Woodson+Institute+Series+in+Black+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breaking Boundaries","description":"On the brink of a critical moment in human history, this book presents a vision of \\"planetary stewardship\\" - a rethinking of our relationship with our planet - and plots a new course for our future. The authors reveal the full scale of the planetary emergency we face - but also how we can stabilize Earth's life-support system. The necessary change is within our power, if we act now. In 2009, scientists identified nine planetary boundaries that keep Earth stable, ranging from biodiversity to ozone. Beyond these boundaries lurk tipping points. In order to stop short of these tipping points, the 2020s must see the fastest economic transition in history. This book demonstrates how societies are reaching positive tipping points that make this transition possible: groups such as Extinction Rebellion and the schoolchildren led by Greta Thunberg demand political action; countries are committing to eliminating greenhouse gas emissions; and one tipping point has even already passed - the price of clean energy has dropped below that of fossil fuels. The story is accompanied by unique images of Earth produced by Globa?a, the world's leading visualizers of human impact.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SNBxEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Jordan and Syria (3rd ed)","description":"\\"Slices of on-the-road literary history and detail-rich travel romps with famous writers.\\" Sheila F.

According to standard historiography, British public opinion forced the Conservative government to introduce legislation stemming the flow of dark-skinned immigrants and thereby altering an expansive nationality policy that had previously allowed all British subjects free entry into the United Kingdom. Paul's extensive archival research shows, however, that the racism of ministers and senior functionaries led rather than followed public opinion. In the late 1940s, the Labour government faced a birthrate perceived to be in decline, massive economic dislocations caused by the war, a huge national debt, severe labor shortages, and the prospective loss of international preeminence. Simultaneously, it subsidized the emigration of Britons to Australia, Canada, and other parts of the Empire, recruited Irish citizens and European refugees to work in Britain, and used regulatory changes to dissuade British subjects of color from coming to the United Kingdom. Paul contends post-war concepts of citizenship were based on a contradiction between the formal definition of who had the right to enter Britain and the informal notion of who was, or could become, really British. Whitewashing Britain extends this analysis to contemporary issues, such as the fierce engagement in the Falklands War and the curtailment of citizenship options for residents of Hong Kong. Paul finds the politics of citizenship in contemporary Britain still haunted by a mixture of imperial, economic, and demographic imperatives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7lhuDwAAQBAJ&dq=Whitewashing+Britain:+Race+and+Citizenship+in+the+Postwar+Era&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Astrologically Incorrect: Unlock the Secrets of the Signs to Get What You Want When You Want!","description":"Unlike other books, which just skim the surface of the twelve Sun signs, \\"Astrologically Incorrect\\" is an entertaining and edgy guide to people management that exposes the fetishes, neuroses, and hang-ups of each and every member of the zodiac.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w6ckDwAAQBAJ&dq=Astrologically+Incorrect:+Unlock+the+Secrets+of+the+Signs+to+Get+What+You+Want+When+You+Want!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The blood knot;","description":"Blood Knot is a parable of two brothers who share a one-room shack near Port Elizabeth, South Africa: Zachariah is dark-skinned and Morris, light-skinned.

Of the more than one hundred comments Dukore has selected, fifty-nine -- more than half -- are new to today's readers. Twelve are previously unpublished, one is published in full for the first time, and forty-six appear in a collected edition of Shaw's writings for the first time since their publication in newspapers and magazines. Very early in the life of cinema, Shaw perceived that as an invention, movies would be more momentous than the printing press because they appealed to the illiterate as well as the literate, to the manual laborer at the end of an exhausting day as well as to the person with more leisure. He predicted that cinema would form people's minds and shape their conduct. He recognized that cinema's \\"colossal proportions make mediocrity compulsory\\" by leveling art and life down to the blandest morality and to the lowest common denominator of potential audiences throughout the world. By 1908, Shaw was familiar with experiments synchronizing movies and sound. When talkies arrived, he discerned that they would precipitate major changes in acting, writing, and economics. He also saw how they would affect live theatre:\\"The theatre may survive as a place where people are taught to act\\", he said in 1930, \\"but apart from that there will be nothing but 'talkies' soon\\". At that time, few people in the theatrical profession were making such prophecies, at least not in public.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HCbO-CHuC5IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of Accounting: Working Papers for Exercises and Problems Volume 1: Chapters 1-18 and Appendices A-C","description":"The text and images in this book are in grayscale.

She is soon pushed to the precipice, where betrayal and heartbreak threaten to overwhelm her, forcing her to decide what she wants from her life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-aBxEAAAQBAJ&dq=Intimacies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder in the Name of God: The Plot to Kill Yitzhak Rabin","description":"The first book to tell the complete, explosive story of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. A dramatic tale of treachery and betrayal, Murder in the Name of God investigates and recreates the historic events of November 4, 1995. On that night a twenty-five-year-old student named Yigal Amir assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, an act that abruptly changed the course of Israeli politics. Based on exhaustive research, including an exclusive interview with the assassin, Murder in the Name of God is the first book to give the full story of the people whose words and actions made Rabin's assassination inevitable: the nationalist rabbis who condemned Rabin by invoking an arcane talmudic ruling; the militant settlers and right-wing politicians who launched a sophisticated campaign of incitement against him; and the security experts who saw what was coming but failed to act. In a series of shocking revelations, the book ranges beyond Israel to expose the extent of American support--financial and ideological--for the movement that produced Rabin's killer. Far more than the tale of an assassination, Murder in the Name of God is a powerful indictment of a society's failure to examine itself honestly and to bring its own worst enemies to justice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Cdq3QgAACAAJ&dq=Murder+in+the+Name+of+God:+The+Plot+to+Kill+Yitzhak+Rabin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Esau and Jacob,","description":"Accommodates both the cosmopolitan narrative of the Jewish diaspora with traditional Jews and their culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NlR-DwAAQBAJ&dq=Esau+and+Jacob,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"QUANTUM MECHANICS FOR CHEMISTS","description":"Quantum Mechanics for Chemists is designed to provide chemistry undergraduates with a basic understanding of the principles of quantum mechanics. The text assumes some knowledge of chemical bonding and a familiarity with the qualitative aspects of molecular orbitals in molecules such as butadiene and benzene. Thus it is intended to follow a basic course in organic and/or inorganic chemistry. The approach is rather different from that adopted in most books on quantum chemistry in that the Schr dinger wave equation is introduced at a fairly late stage, after students have become familiar with the application of de Broglie-type wavefunctions to free particles and particles in a box. Likewise, the Hamiltonian operator and the concept of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are not introduced until the last two chapters of the book, where approximate solutions to the wave equation for many-electron atoms and molecules are discussed. In this way, students receive a gradual introduction to the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. Ideal for the needs of undergraduate chemistry students, Tutorial Chemistry Texts is a major series consisting of short, single topic or modular texts concentrating on the fundamental areas of chemistry taught in undergraduate science courses. Each book provides a concise account of the basic principles underlying a given subject, embodying an independent-learning philosophy and including worked examples.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_drj2Do1XfsC&dq=QUANTUM+MECHANICS+FOR+CHEMISTS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: A LINK TO THE PAST GAME SECRETS","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q9RsAAAACAAJ&dq=THE+LEGEND+OF+ZELDA:+A+LINK+TO+THE+PAST+GAME+SECRETS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tamarisk Tree","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D7ietwAACAAJ&dq=The+Tamarisk+Tree&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paul Harvey's The Rest of the Story","description":"Eighty stories feature unusual facts and anecdotes, largely forgotten or ignored, involving historical and contemporary events and personalities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zEufPwAACAAJ&dq=Paul+Harvey%27s+The+Rest+of+the+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elizabeth I: Collected Works","description":"This long-awaited and masterfully edited volume contains nearly all of the writings of Queen Elizabeth I: the clumsy letters of childhood, the early speeches of a fledgling queen, and the prayers and poetry of the monarch's later years.

Indeed, the best memories are often made of delight in silly, simple things, and the most precious moments are just that  only moments: a hug, a tickling match, a pillow fight, a surprise stop for ice cream, or a detour from the ordinary to see the stars. This collection of ideas is meant to be just that  ideas. They may make you think of even better ways to create traditions, but these are places to start. May we all hold each other a little more closely and remember  home  a little more fondly because of ordinary days made holy by the sacrament of loving.

Our books differ from most books on dog breeds because this book also provides you with a comprehensive and authoritative source of all the known predisposed hereditary health syndromes for the breed. You will find extensive references for each problem described. We also provide the breed club address for this breed and a list of laboratories and organizations that can provide professional help and information. As a small animal veterinarian, I have always been intrigued by the way dogs have been bred to fill a purpose in life and further impressed that they also tend to love performing that service. Greyhounds and other sight hounds are built for speed with aerodynamic bodies consisting of small head, deep chest, narrow waist and large leg muscles. On the other hand Dachshunds take their name from German words meaning  badger dog  and they use their long nose, long body and short legs to both track, enter and dig into badger dens. After developing a practice that catered to clients with show dogs, my interest in each breed continued to grow as I studied and observed more and more about the unique predisposition and incidence of health problems in each breed. Breeders of purebred dogs for show were a challenge and inspirational for me to research and help them with their unique health problems. Historically references to hereditary problems are scattered throughout various Veterinary medical texts and journals such as ophthalmology, neurology, gastroenterology, cardiovascular and dermatology. This book, as well as the other books and articles I have written, is researched and compiled with the intention to provide both veterinarians and dog owners with comprehensive and authoritative predisposition information under the breed name. At the date of this publication, The American Kennel Club Canine Health Foundation and the The Kennel Club of England reports over 400 known hereditary health syndromes throughout the dog kingdom. At the writing of my first book in 1983, less than 50 hereditary issues are able to be predicted and or diagnosed. Sequencing of the canine genome, DNA tests, metabolic testing including blood tests and urine testing; plus, phenotypic examinations such as radiographs, ultrasound, and CERF or OFA eye registry exams by a Board Certified Veterinary Ophthalmologist have advanced the science of breed related health and behavioral problems. This book will provide veterinarians, researchers, pet owners and breeders with a comprehensive guide to all the known problems veterinarians and dog owners should consider during pet selection and throughout each life stage of our canine friends.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v4JqBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living & Working in France 2005: A Survival Handbook (Living and Working in France)","description":"Reimagining the scholarly book as living and collaborative--not as commodified and essentialized, but in all its dynamic materiality. In this book, Janneke Adema proposes that we reimagine the scholarly book as a living and collaborative project--not as linear, bound, and fixed, but as fluid, remixed, and liquid, a space for experimentation. She presents a series of cutting-edge experiments in arts and humanities book publishing, showcasing the radical new forms that book-based scholarly work might take in the digital age. Adema's proposed alternative futures for the scholarly book go beyond such print-based assumptions as fixity, stability, the single author, originality, and copyright, reaching instead for a dynamic and emergent materiality. Adema suggests ways to unbind the book, describing experiments in scholarly book publishing with new forms of anonymous collaborative authorship, radical open access publishing, and processual, living, and remixed publications, among other practices. She doesn't cast digital as the solution and print as the problem; the problem in scholarly publishing, she argues, is not print itself, but the way print has been commodified and essentialized. Adema explores alternative, more ethical models of authorship; constructs an alternative genealogy of openness; and examines opportunities for intervention in current cultures of knowledge production. Finally, asking why it is that we cut and bind our research together at all, she examines two book publishing projects that experiment with remix and reuse and try to rethink and reperform the book-apparatus by taking responsibility for the cuts they make.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g_gLEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Woven on the Loom of Time: Stories by Enrique Anderson-Imbert (Texas Pan American Series)","description":"Argentinian scholar and writer Enrique Anderson-Imbert is familiar to many North American students for his La Literatura de Am rica Latina I and II, which are widely used in college Spanish courses. But Anderson-Imbert is also a noted creative writer, whose use of \\"magical realism\\" helped pave the way for such writers as Borges, Cort zar, S bato, and Ocampo. In this anthology, Carleton Vail and Pamela Edwards-Mondrag n have chosen stories from the period 1965 to 1985 to introduce English-speaking readers to the creative work of Enrique Anderson-Imbert. Representative stories from the collections The Cheshire Cat, The Swindler Retires, Madness Plays at Chess, Klein's Bottle, Two Women and One Juli n, and The Size of the Witches illustrate Anderson-Imbert's unique style and world view.

The range of subjects and points of view varies widely, challenging such \\"realities\\" as time and space, right and wrong, science and religion. In a prologue, Anderson-Imbert tells an imaginary reader, \\"Each one of my stories is a closed entity, brief because it has caught a single spasm of life in a single leap of fantasy. Only a reading of all my stories will reveal my world-view.\\" The reader asks, \\"And are you sure that it is worth the trouble?\\" Anderson-Imbert replies, \\"No.\\" The unexpected, ironic ending is one of the great pleasures of reading Enrique Anderson-Imbert.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Emp5CgAAQBAJ&dq=Woven+on+the+Loom+of+Time:+Stories+by+Enrique+Anderson-Imbert+(Texas+Pan+American+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Indian Princess IV (Fibre Craft, FCM446)","description":"8 stunning doilies that can be made in a day!

Controlled by the Pentagon's Special Operations Group, under the cover name \\"Studies and Observation Group\\" (SOG), it was the United States' largest and most complex covert operation since World War II. Because it was so highly classified and politically sensitive, once the war was over the story of SOG was buried deep in the vaults of the Pentagon--until Dr. Richard H. Shultz, Jr., one of the world's leading experts on SOG's activities in Southeast Asia, began his impressive investigative research and wide-ranging special interviews. The Secret War Against Hanoi is based on thousands of pages of recently declassified top-secret SOG documents, as well as interviews with sixty officers who ran SOG's covert programs and the senior officials who directed this secret war, including Robert McNamara, Walt Rostow, Richard Helms, William Colby, William Westmoreland, and Victor Krulak. It is the first-ever definitive and comprehensive account of the covert paramilitary and espionage campaign, with many eye-opening disclosures. Dr. Shultz reveals how in 1963, President Kennedy, dissatisfied with the CIA's ineffective guerrilla operations against North Vietnam, turned over operational control of the covert war to the Pentagon and demanded results. Despite Kennedy's strong directive, those results were slow in coming. United States policymakers and the senior military leadership had little interest in or understanding of special operations and resisted any expansion of the secret war. When SOG finally did get started in January 1964, under newly inaugurated President Johnson, it was constantly hobbled by the micro-management of the National Security Council, State Department, and Pentagon leadership. Despite these restraints, SOG conducted its intense secret war for eight years, through the Johnson and Nixon administrations, and managed to execute a range of operations, including the dispatch of numerous spies to North Vietnam and creation of a sophisticated triple-cross deception program: psychological warfare through a fabricated guerrilla movement, manipulation of North Vietnamese POWs and kidnapped citizens, and dirty tricks; commando raids against Hanoi's coast and navy; and operations on the Ho Chi Minh Trail to kill enemy soldiers and destroy supplies. Ultimately, the Pentagon's spies, saboteurs, and secret warriors would produce both spectacular and disastrous results. There are lessons to be learned from Washington's conduct of the secret war against Hanoi that will be valuable and valid for years to come for presidents who engage in covert special operations to meet twenty-first-century threats to vital U.S. interests.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I6ETMQAACAAJ&dq=The+Secret+War+Against+Hanoi:+Kennedy+and+Johnson%27s+Use+of+Spies,+Saboteurs,+and+Covert+Warriors+in+North+Vietnam&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"VOICES IN THE WILDERNESS","description":"American nature writers as literary artists and political catalysts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-NV2Ol3NfXMC&dq=VOICES+IN+THE+WILDERNESS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Captain From Connecticut","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dlAamgEACAAJ&dq=The+Captain+From+Connecticut&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Prophecies of Nostradamus","description":"Nostradamus began to write his prophetic verses in the city of Salon, in 1554. They are divided into ten sections called Centuries (which refers to the number of verses in each section, not to a unit of 100 years). The Centuries were published in 1555 and 1558, and have been in print continuously ever since. Nostradamus had the visions which he later recorded in verse while staring into water or flame late at night, sometimes aided by herbal stimulants, while sitting on a brass tripod. The resulting quatrains (four line verses) are oblique and elliptical, and use puns, anagrams and allegorical imagery. Most of the quatrains are open to multiple interpretations, and some make no sense whatsoever. Some of them are chilling, literal descriptions of events, giving specific or near- specific names, geographic locations, astrological configurations, and sometimes actual dates. It is this quality of both vagueness and specificity which allows each new generation to reinterpret Nostradamus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UNlQnwEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Prophecies+of+Nostradamus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Longing for Home: Reflections At Midlife","description":"In this deeply moving book of reflection and recollection, Frederick Buechner once again draws us into his deeply textured life and experience to illuminate our own understanding of home as both our place of origin and our ultimate destination. For Frederick Buechner, the meaning of home is twofold: the home we remember and the home we dream. As a word, it not only recalls the place that we grew up in and that had much to do with the people we eventually became, but also points ahead to the home that, in faith, we believe awaits us at life's end. Writing at the approach of his seventieth birthday, he describes, both in prose and in a group of poems, the one particular house that was most precious to him as a child, the books he read there, and the people he loved there. He speaks also of the lifelong search we are all engaged in to make a new home for ourselves and for our families, which is at the same time a search to find something like the wholeness and comfort of home with ourselves. As he turns his attention to our dreams of the heavenly home still to come, he sees it as both hallowing and fulfilling the charity and the peach of our original home. Writing with warmth, wisdom, and compelling eloquence, Frederick Buechner once again enables us to see more deeply into the secret places of our hearts. The Longing for Home will help to bring clarity and guidance to anyone who searches for meaning in a world that all too often seems meaningless.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rbs4e0XqQjwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Economic Basis of Ethnic Solidarity: Small Business in the Japanese American Community","description":"This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press s mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact.

It is a balanced and data-rich assessment of how far women have come and how far they still have to go. \\" Isabelle Sawhill, Urban Institute \\"Based primarily on the 1990 population census, Balancing Act reports on the current situation of American women and temporal and cross-national comparisons. Meticulously and clearly presented, the information in this book highlights changing behaviors, such as the growing incidence of childbearing to older women, and unmarried women in general, and a higher ratio of women's earnings to men's. The authors' thoughtful analysis of these and other factors involved in women's fin de si cle 'balancing act' make this an indispensable reference book and valuable classroom resource.\\"  Louise A. Tilly, Michael E. Gellert Professor of History and Sociology, The New School for Social Research In Balancing Act, authors Daphne Spain and Suzanne Bianchi draw upon multiple census and survey sources to detail the shifting conditions under which women manage their roles as mothers, wives, and breadwinners. They chronicle the progress made in education where female college enrollment now exceeds that of males and the workforce, where women have entered a wider variety of occupations and are staying on the job longer, even after becoming wives and mothers. But despite progress, lower-paying service and clerical positions remain predominantly female, and although the salary gap between men and women has shrunk, women are still paid less. As women continue to establish a greater presence outside the home, many have delayed marriage and motherhood. Marked jumps in divorce and out-of-wedlock childbirth have given rise to significant numbers of female-headed households. Married women who work contribute more significantly than ever to the financial well-being of their families, yet evidence shows that they continue to perform most household chores. Balancing Act focuses on how American women juggle the simultaneous demands of caregiving and wage earning, and compares their options to those of women in other countries. The United States is the only industrialized nation without policies to support working mothers and their families most tellingly in the absence of subsidized childcare services. Many women are forced to work in less rewarding part-time or traditionally female jobs that allow easy exit and re-entry, and as a consequence poverty is the single greatest danger facing American women. As the authors show, the risk of poverty varies significantly by race and ethnicity, with African Americans most of whose children live in mother-only families the most adversely affected. This volume contributes to the national dialogue about family policy, welfare reform, and responsibility for children by highlighting the pivotal roles women play at the intersection of family and work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dPoWAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The collector's guide to post cards","description":"Over 2,000 post cards are featured in this interesting and informative look at this popular paper collectible.

If you have a dream, then you have a destiny. In his inspiring new book, From Dream to Destiny, Robert Morris prompts you to ask yourself, How do I travel from the dream to the destiny--and what happens on the way? Each of us is given a dream by God--it's the notion that sets our hearts racing by the mere thought of it. Unfortunately, most people never see their dream come to pass, so they never fulfill the destiny that God has in store for them. Robert Morris tells readers exactly how to make their dream into the reality for which they long. Using the example of Joseph in the Old Testament, Pastor Robert shows how God gave Joseph a dream and then promptly took him through 10 character-building tests that lasted 13 years. These tests assessed Joseph's strengths and weaknesses--from pride to purity--and they are the same tests that each of us must pass before God lets us realize our dream. Find out what the tests are and if you are passing or failing them, and get ready to begin fulfilling the destiny that God has in store for you.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X2e8BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Languages of the World","description":"Unique in scope, An Introduction to the Languages of the World introduces linguistics students to the variety of world's languages.

This is the first time that a global, baseline status report on land and water resources has been made. It is based on several global spatial databases (e.g. land suitability for agriculture, land use and management, land and water degradation and depletion) for which FAO is the world-recognized data source. Topical and emerging issues on land and water are dealt with in an integrated rather than sectoral manner.

We are now entering a new business, leadership and global age, with a vision, agenda and spirit born out of the realisation that there has to be a different way of success, business and leadership. One that sets us free from traditional business thinking, and takes you, your business and your life to new levels of awareness, success and achievement. This next business age is in your hands. The Naked Leader is the antithesis to the process driven mentality that has wasted so many millions, destroyed the trust between company and employee, and enabled so many companies to at best stand completely still. The Naked Leader is a distillation of David Taylor's ideas and inspiration - ideas which have made him Europe's most sought-after speaker on leadership and personal growth. David is known as the \\"Naked Leader\\" because of his extraordinary ability to strip away uncertainty and doubt, and conclusively show that everything we need to be successful, we already have. The Naked Leader shares hundreds of life-changing actions, including: * The fastest way to make any change in your life * How to build deep and lasting rapport with anyone * The 7 most powerful questions on earth * How to change how you feel, in a single heartbeat * The structure of guaranteed success * How to be an awesome presenter * Discovering who you really are, and why you are here The Naked Leader strips away the mystery, hype and jargon, to reveal the single formula for assured success that is available to everyone. The book is a journey which can be taken from beginning to end, or joined at any stage - taking you to wherever you want to be, drawing on the very best leadership thinking around the world, finally revealing the answer to the ultimate question, \\"who are you and why are you here?\\" Taylor reveals the exact, specific actions to take to predict the future, and then shape it. As a practitioner, not a theorist, Taylor knows what works, and what does not. He shows us what to do, and exactly when to do it. No matter what your vision, challenge or present position, The Naked Leader ensures that you succeed, making your future no longer a matter of chance, but rather a matter of choice. It is powerful, and the results are amazing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7pP3CQAAQBAJ&dq=Naked+Leader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Guide to Owning Millipedes and Centipedes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cDcGAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Guide+to+Owning+Millipedes+and+Centipedes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Priest Kings of Gor","description":"\\"40th anniversary of the Gorean saga\\"--Cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6qsGmQEACAAJ&dq=Priest+Kings+of+Gor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Music for High School Band: A Selective Repertoire Guide for High School Bands & Wind Ensembles","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uAsXAgAACAAJ&dq=Best+Music+for+High+School+Band:+A+Selective+Repertoire+Guide+for+High+School+Bands&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stalingrad: The Infernal Cauldron, 1942-1943","description":"The German invasion of Russia was Hitler s biggest gamble in his quest for  Lebensraum  in the East  and it was at Stalingrad that his gamble failed. Stalingrad 1942-1943: The Infernal Cauldron is a comprehensive history of the greatest battle of World War II, a defining moment in the struggle on the Eastern Front, which has been called the Verdun of World War II. From an About.Com review of the illustrated print edition: \\"[Anthony Beevor s] Stalingrad is wholly worthy of its fame. Fortunately for publishers, there are many ways to write history and Stephen Walsh's account of Stalingrad offers a strong alternative: a military history. Walsh may cover the same ground   but his is a narrative of logistics and tactical planning, an account of where troops moved and fought, why plans were conceived and what they meant militarily. There's a large overlap between Beevor and Walsh - both include the same basic detail - but Beevor's prose is more personal   while Walsh's text considers the limits of German national power and the nature of Vernichtungschlacht warfare. Where Beevor discusses the difficulty of providing exact figures Walsh just gives them and where Beevor's writing is ceaselessly gripping Walsh is more sedate, educational and discursive. In short, these books are aimed at different audiences: anyone who likes reading will enjoy Beevor, but someone who wants the military specifics and contexts will benefit more from Walsh. Another bonus is a chapter on Army Group A and their campaign in the Caucasus, an event presumably omitted from Beevor's Stalingrad on grounds of relevance, but one which helps place the siege on context. Walsh's book is an excellent military history, but Beevor's is better suited to a broader audience: in terms of text, neither is more wrong nor right than the other, but Walsh feels like a documentary and Beevor like a feature film. It might seem unfair to constantly compare The Infernal Cauldron to Stalingrad, but I urge everyone who reads one to study the other too. No one should miss out on Beevor's style and treatment of both history and humanity, while The Infernal Cauldron is a superb, maybe even essential, companion to Stalingrad.

Yet despite the enormous changes for women in America since 1960, and despite a blizzard of books that continue to argue about women's \\"proper place,\\" there has not been a serious, definitive history of what happened -- until now. Sara M. Evans is one of our foremost historians of women in America. Her book Personal Politics is a classic that captured the origins of the modern women's movement; its successor, Born for Liberty, set the standard for sweeping histories of women. In Tidal Wave Evans again sets the standard by drawing on an extraordinary range of interviews, archives, and published sources to tell the incredible story of the past forty years in women's history. Encompassing both the so-called Second Wave of feminism's initial explosion in the 1960s and 1970s, and the Third Wave of the 1980s and 1990s, she challenges traditional interpretations at every step. She shows that the Second Wave was beset by fragmentation and infighting from the beginning; its slogan, \\"the personal is political,\\" was both a rallying cry and the seed of its self-destruction. Yet the Third Wave has been surprisingly strong, and almost all women today might be thought of as feminists -- in practice if not in name. From national events, and from leaders of institutions such as NOW and Emily's List to little-known local stories of women who simply wanted more out of their lives only to discover that they were creating a movement, Tidal Wave paints a vast canvas of a society in upheaval -- from politics to economics to popular culture to marriage and the family. Today, Evans argues, the women's movement is as alive and vital as ever, precisely because it has enjoyed such stunning success. Though not all women are comfortable with the term \\"feminist,\\" the vast majority hold jobs and enjoy previously unimaginable personal freedoms. Never before in American or world history have women experienced full and equal citizenship and opportunity. At last, the extraordinary story can be told.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5HboQ2wEcgYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Celine Dion: Let's Talk About Love","description":"Non-fans regard C line Dion as ersatz and plastic, yet to those who love her, no one could be more real, with her impoverished childhood, her (creepy) manager-husband's struggle with cancer, her knack for howling out raw emotion. There's nothing cool about C line Dion, and nothing clever. That's part of her appeal as an object of love or hatred - with most critics and committed music fans taking pleasure (or at least geeky solace) in their lofty contempt. This book documents Carl Wilson's brave and unprecedented year-long quest to find his inner C line Dion fan, and explores how we define ourselves in the light of what we call good and bad, what we love and what we hate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vOeoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE EVE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j9NnAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plautus: Casina (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics) (English and Latin Edition)","description":"Plautus' Casina is a lively and well composed farce.

They discuss the background and conventions of Roman comedy and by offering a complete metrical analysis they help the reader to appreciate the original musical structure of the play.

Clever and handsome, even ostentatious, he fitted easily into court life, despite his humble origins. However, his unpopular economic policies made him enemies and when the Duke died suddenly Suss was arrested, convicted of 'destestable abuses' and exectued in Stuttgart in an iron cage. His spectacular rise and fall inspired a media outpouring in the eighteenth century and he has been much written about subsequently. In the twentieth century two films were made about him, one British in 1934, the other German in 1940. Goebbels took an active interest in the latter. After the war its director, Veit Harlan, was tried for Crimes against Humanity for having made the film. Despite his acquittal, the film's association with the Holocaust remains controversial to this day. For almost three centuries the life of Jew Suss has been adapted, distorted and transformed. This book tells the story of these transformations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NQm8fuT5rnsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"International Conference on Natural Gas Hydrates (Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XwvEjwEACAAJ&dq=International+Conference+on+Natural+Gas+Hydrates+(Annals+of+the+New+York+Academy+of+Sciences)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Popular Mechanics Christmas Handbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=653RmgEACAAJ&dq=Popular+Mechanics+Christmas+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Merismos","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8RSAYRXAghYC&dq=The+Merismos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neurochemistry of Consciousness: Neurotransmitters in mind (Advances in Consciousness Research)","description":"This pioneering book explores in depth the role of neurotransmitters in conscious awareness.

Each novel is told from the perspective of one of the thirteen clans, intertwining with the others, and filling in missing pieces artfully as we follow battle after battle, intrigue after intrigue and the appearance of a strange artifact that falls into the hands of a solitary Toreador sculptor. Clan Novel Malkavian is the ninth novel in the series. For hundreds of years, Anatole has sought clues and answers to the riddles about the time called Gehenna, when the ancient vampires called the Antediluvians will rise and destroy all the Kindred on earth. Anatole is alternately thought mad because of his Malkavian blood or blessed by God with a true faith, but few deny that he sees and comprehends many of the mysteries of the World of Darkness. Now, as the millennium draws to a close, Anatole finds a means to finally gain the ultimate answers he desires. Through visions of an ancient Eye and a young Kindred named Leopold, Anatole seeks to forge a connection between himself and one of the few resources for answers about the great mystery of Gehenna: the very source of the coming destruction! This series is a monumental, 13-novel exploration of the forbidden world of the Kindred. What began in Clan Novel: Toreador continues here, and its ending will determine the fate of every human   and inhuman   being in the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=njiRDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Are the Light: Rediscovering the Eastern Jesus","description":"A reconciliation of Indian with Christian religious traditions that delivers a profound and inspiring vision for the renewal of Christianity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DHEHAAAACAAJ&dq=You+Are+the+Light:+Rediscovering+the+Eastern+Jesus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elsevier's Dictionary of Trees : Volume 1: North America (Elsevier's Dictionary of Trees)","description":"This dictionary will present all currently accepted generic, specific, sub-specific and variety names of trees, excluding fossil and more recently extinct taxa, hybrids and cultivars.

This book takes as its point of departure that integrating a component of sustainability into a discipline-specific course arises from an educator asking a simple question: in the coming decades, as humanity faces unprecedented challenges, what can my discipline or area of research contribute toward a better understanding of these issues? The discipline need not be future-oriented: an archaeologist, for instance, could incorporate into a course some aspects of sustainable archaeological practices in areas threatened by rapid climate change, as well as examples of sustainable or unsustainable ways of living practiced by members of the long-gone society under investigation. This book also argues that courses about sustainability need to cross disciplinary boundaries, both because of the inter-relatedness of the issues, and because students will require the ability to use interdisciplinary approaches to thrive through the multiple careers most of them will face. The contributions to this book are presented under four sections.  Sustainability as a Core Value in Education  considers the rationale for incorporating sustainability in disciplinary courses.  Teaching Sustainability in the Academic Disciplines  presents eight examples of courses from disciplines as varied as agriculture, composition, engineering, and teacher education.  Education as a Sustainable Practice  reviews how the physical environment of the classroom and the delivery of instruction need themselves to reflect the values being taught. The final section addresses the issues of leadership and long-term institutional change needed to embed sustainable practice as a core value on campus.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SmxMcPQUtHYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coppelia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vG4NmAEACAAJ&dq=Coppelia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Are Italians White?: How Race is Made in America","description":"This dazzling collection of original essays from some of the country's leading thinkers asks the rather intriguing question - Are Italians White?

Too Much to Ask focuses on the women of this pioneering generation, examining their educational strategies and experiences and exploring how social class, family upbringing, and expectations--their own and others'--prepared them to achieve in an often hostile setting. Drawing on extensive questionnaires and in-depth interviews with Black women graduates, sociologist Elizabeth Higginbotham sketches the patterns that connected and divided the women who integrated American higher education before the era of affirmative action. Although they shared educational goals, for example, family resources to help achieve those goals varied widely according to their social class. Across class lines, however, both the middle- and working-class women Higginbotham studied noted the importance of personal initiative and perseverance in helping them to combat the institutionalized racism of elite institutions and to succeed. Highlighting the actions Black women took to secure their own futures as well as the challenges they faced in achieving their goals, Too Much to Ask provides a new perspective for understanding the complexity of racial interactions in the post-civil rights era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LkgMCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Out of Control - Who's Watching Our Child Protection Agencies?","description":"48 Hours took investigative researcher Brenda Scott seriously!

Bird Flu: It's Not What You Think","description":"Book Description Unflinching, thoroughly researched, and bound to be controversial, FOWL! will change forever perceptions of environmental policy, the pharmaceutical industry and the governments role in the dissemination of public health information. A core premise of the book: how dioxins and other environmental chemicals are contributing to the toxic load in chickens, migratory birds, and humans, leading to massive death when combined with \\"bird flu\\" and other influenza viruses. However, this is far more than a book about the environment. FOWL! examines the specter of mandatory vaccination and exposes how pharmaceutical companies, chemical companies, and agribusinesses are not separate industries but function more as \\"sister enterprises,\\" working together for mutual benefit, profit, and power. Learn what the Bird Flu hype is REALLY about! From the Author \\"FOWL!\\" is an investigative report into how dioxins, POPs and other environment chemicals are contributing to illness in migratory birds, chickens and humans by making them more susceptible to the effects of influenza viruses. The avian flu scare is just the latest act in an ongoing world government drama. This book is a disclosure about betrayals on many levels. Here are a few of the truths that will be exposed: -Who wants the rural chickens dead? Who benefits from the destruction of the family farm, here and abroad? -What are the real reasons that domestic chickens and ducks are sick? -What is the connection between toxic environmental conditions and the death ofmigratory birds? -Why are human deaths associated with bird flu concentrated in Southeast Asia? -Who benefits from the manufacture of a 'pandemic vaccine'?

Although paying lip service to the Clausewitzian dictum that war and politics are two parts of a tightly knit whole, we have traditionally waged wars as great crusades divorced from political realities. Thus we have been nonplussed in the last half of the twentieth century by our involvement in limited wars waged for limited objectives. America's responsibilities as a superpower with worldwide interests forced upon us the unpleasant notion of using our armed forces as practical instruments of political policy. The reality of this notion has been difficult for many Americans to understand and accept.\\"\\" Col. Dennis M. Drew and Dr. Donald M. Snow have performed a significant service by producing a volume that places the American experience at war in its proper political context. Going further, they have also placed the American experience in a technological context and analyzed how political and technological factors influenced the conduct of American wars. In addition, they have combined all of these factors and analyzed their influences on the outcomes of our wars, what Sir Basil Liddell Hart called \\" the better state of peace,\\" which is the fundamental objective of warfare.\\"\\" One can find a number of military, political, and technological histories that address the American experience at war. However, I know of no other single volume that addresses all of these aspects in such a concise and readable fashion. But Eagle's Talons is much more than just a history of the American experience. If gaining insights about where we are going requires an understanding of where we have been, Colonel Drew and Dr. Snow provide a key to understanding how and why the United States might employ its military power in the future.\\" Sidney J.

Beginning novelists often fear that if they tell anyone their idea someone else will take it and go make millions of dollars. And so aspiring writers hold their ideas close to their vests-sometimes not even writing them down. The members of ChiLibris, all multi-published Christian novelists, remember when they had the same fear. Something they've all discovered is that it isn't the idea that is so unique-since the same basic stories are told again and again, and we never tire of hearing them. What's unique is the expression of those ideas. To show new writers that they can relax about their ideas-and to simply celebrate the diversity of their storytelling gifts-the members of ChiLibris undertook this book. Each writer made something different from the same basic idea. Each of the 21 short stories in this book uses the same five elements: THE FIRST LINE: THE WIND WAS PICKING UP.

Yet research on Berlin s past has focused on the interwar years of the Weimar Republic or the Cold War era, with much less attention to the crucial Imperial years between 1871 and 1918. Constructing Imperial Berlin is the first book to critically assess, contextualize, and frame urban and architectural photographs of that era. Berlin, as it was pronounced Germany s capital in 1871, was fraught with questions that had previously beset Paris and London. How was urban expansion and transformation to be absorbed? What was the city s understanding of its comparably short history? Given this short history, how did it embody the idea of a capital? A key theme of this book is the close interrelation of the city s rapid physical metamorphosis with repercussions on promotional and critical narratives, the emergence of groundbreaking photographic technologies, and novel forms of mass distribution. Providing a rare analysis of this significant formative era, Miriam Paeslack shows a city far more complex than the common clich s as a historical and aspiring place suggest. Imperial Berlin emerges as a modern metropolis, only half-heartedly inhibited by urban preservationist concerns and rather more akin to North American cities in their bold industrialization and competing urban expansions than to European counterparts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8GKDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prophecy viewed in respect to its distinctive nature, its special function, and proper interpretation","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mDpVAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oxford-Duden Pictorial Portuguese-English Dictionary","description":"The Oxford-Duden pictorial dictionaries provide exceptionally wide coverage of the vocabulary of everyday life.

For years now, the rival Roman generals Caesar and Pompey have engaged in a contest for world domination. Both now turn to Egypt, where Pompey plans a last desperate stand on the banks of the Nile, while Caesar's legendary encounter with queen Cleopatra will spark a romance that reverberates down the centuries. But Egypt is a treacherous land, torn apart by the murderous rivalry between the goddess-queen and her brother King Ptolemy. Into this hot-house atmosphere of intrigue and deception comes Gordianus the Finder, innocently seeking a cure for his wife Bethesda in the sacred waters of the Nile. But when his plans go awry, he finds himself engaged in an even more desperate pursuit - to prove the innocence of the son he once disowned, who stands accused of murder. The judgment of Caesar will determine the fate of Gordianus's son; the choice Caesar makes between Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy will determine the future of Rome's empire. At the center of these two dilemmas, Gordianus becomes the unwitting fulcrum that will shift the balance of history. Witness to the death throes of the old world, he is to play a critical role in the birth of the world to come. Drawing scrupulously on historical sources, this is the most ambitious novel yet in Steven Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series. Saylor presents a bold new vision of Caesar and paints a compelling and original portrait of Cleopatra, amid bloodshed, battles and storms, in a setting of Egyptian magic and mystery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-MQP5Dy40jYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ready...Start...School","description":"\\"Reaching the Goals\\" is a series of eight books designed to inform people involved in education reform, or people who want to be involved, of the myriad of programs and resources that are available from the Federal Government to support each of the National Education Goals defined in 1990.

Foiled in her bid for independence, she is exiled to her aunts' cottage in a secluded but picturesque corner of the Lake District. There she meets Philip Woodmere, a gentleman farmer as kind as he is ruggedly attractive. She warms to his lively family, so different from her own, and is drawn to his quiet strength. At the same time, she fears that if her father caught wind of a romance, he would do anything to prevent such an unequal match, without caring whom he hurt. Philip has been looking for a bride for practical reasons: to care for his numerous younger brothers and sisters. But he is moved by the mysterious lady who is living with his elderly neighbors under what he suspects is an assumed name. He senses passion beneath Catherine's elusive manner and sets out to earn her trust and love. But their chance for happiness is soon threatened by a secret from her past. THE INCORRIGIBLE LADY CATHERINE, the first in Elena Greene's \\"Three Disgraces\\" series, was originally published as a Zebra Regency. Length: 207 pages. Sensuality: kisses, one sex scene. Reviews: \\"Regency readers will no doubt enjoy this sweetly tender tale which gives further good evidence of Elena Greene's blossoming talent.\\" -- Romantic Times \\"Philip Woodmere makes a wonderful Beta hero, strong, tender, a lover of family and beauty, just the right sort of man to heal and complete a wounded heroine like Catherine. Ms. Greene paints Catherine with deep, vibrant colors to match her passionate nature, and if, sometimes, those colors weep, well so did this reader. The story gives fresh new twists to traditional Regency plotlines and introduces a well-drawn cast of characters, three of whom cry out for their own tales to be told - the notorious Lord Verwood and Catherine's two school friends. The Incorrigible Lady Catherine follows Lord Langdon's Kiss and a novella in the His Blushing Bride anthology in this author's too-short list of works. Elena Greene is a talented writer to watch for when looking for a pleasurable, meaty Regency romance.\\" -- Jane Bowers, in Romance Reviews Today \\"The Incorrigible Lady Catherine is a fun book, even if it is a bit of a guilty pleasure...Philip is a great beta hero, and it's simply impossible not to like him. He's honest about his feelings, his patience with Catherine is infinite, and he's willing to love her and believe the best of her no matter what. No jumping to conclusions for this guy, thank goodness. Somehow he pulls all of this off without coming across as a doormat. He makes a nice foil for Catherine, who is basically good hearted but makes some dumb choices...Since I liked these people, I was interested in what happened to them, and a lot happened. The book is fast-paced, with plenty of action and dialogue... I would recommend The Incorrigible Lady Catherine for Regency fans who like a plot with some action and a hero who's one of the good guys.\\" -- Blythe Barnhill, All About Romance","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tOBQkgEACAAJ&dq=The+Incorrigible+Lady+Catherine+(Zebra+Regency+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Flash Archives, Vol. 4 (DC Archive Editions)","description":"It's a Rogues Gallery parade in these tales from THE FLASH #142-150 as the Scarlet Speedster battles The Trickster Weather Wizard Mirror Master Mr Element The Reverse Flash Captain Boomerang and Captain Cold!

Kennedy. This groundbreaking number one bestseller opening the eyes of the people of the United States to the possibility that their government was involved in a cover-up of monumental proportions. In his mesmerizing book Lane explores the Warren Report's conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Lane's exhaustive investigation provides a roadmap to the body of evidence about the assassination. By interviewing witnesses throughout the country, comparing each of the Report's conclusions with its own corresponding evidence, and searching through the 26 volumes of evidence the President's Commission collected and thousands of documents found only in the National Archive in Washington, D.C., Lane truthfully investigates the assassination. Meticulously detailed, with over 4,000 citations, yet immensely compelling, Rush to Judgment is an expose that set forth cataclysmic ripples through the fabric of our nation.

But that's only their first move in a much deadlier game. In Rick Campbell's thrilling Empire Rising, Xiang Chenglei, Chinese president and party secretary, has both a problem and a plan. The problem is that China's limited supply of oil is threatening to derail its economic growth and prosperity. Having failed to win access to a greater supply diplomatically, he sets his backup plan in motion. And what is war, but diplomacy by other means? The U.S. Pacific Fleet is the major military force in the area, and when Taiwan is invaded, the fleet is sent in to repel the invading Chinese forces. The U.S. military expects it to be an easy operation, but after a decades-long, top-secret buildup, China has military capabilities far greater than the United States is aware of. With hidden batteries of long range missiles, advanced cyber warfare capabilities, and a submarine fleet wielding a secret weapon, China is able to overwhelm the American fleet. In fact, China all but wipes out the U.S. Pacific Fleet leaving them free to turn to their real objective invasion and expansion across Asia, starting with the four main islands of Japan. While the Atlantic Fleet surges westward to defend its allies and respond to the destruction of their counterparts, it falls to an unlikely alliance of three people to stop this incursion and prevent an all-but-inevitable global war. National Security Advisor Christine O'Connor has critical information, but she's trapped in Beijing; Captain Murray Wilson, commanding officer of the submarine USS Michigan must somehow infiltrate the Chinese submarine blockade; and Navy SEAL Jake Harrison must lead a strike team into the most hostile of territories with only hours to implement the most daring plan ever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NIl-BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mechanics (Addison-Wesley series in physics)","description":"This classic book enables readers to make connections between classical and modern physics -- an indispensable part of a physicist's education.

Manhein assists law enforcement officials across the country in identifying bodies and solving criminal cases. In Trail of Bones, her much-anticipated sequel to The Bone Lady, Manhein reveals the everyday realities of forensic anthropology. Going beyond the stereotypes portrayed on television, this real-life crime scene investigator unveils a gritty, exhausting, exacting, alternately rewarding and frustrating world where teamwork supersedes individual heroics and some cases unfortunately remain unsolved. A natural storyteller, Manhein provides gripping accounts of dozens of cases from her twenty-four-year career. Some of them are famous. She describes her involvement in the hunt for two serial killers who simultaneously terrorized the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, region for years; her efforts to recover the remains of the seven astronauts killed in the Columbia space shuttle crash in 2003; and her ultimately successful struggle to identify the beheaded toddler known for years as Precious Doe. Less well-known but equally compelling are cases involving the remains of a Korean War soldier buried for more than forty years and the mystery of  Mardi Gras Man,  who was wearing a string of plastic beads when his body was discovered. Manhein describes how the increased popularity of tattoos has aided her work and how forensic science has labored to expose frauds including a fake  big foot  track she examined from Louisiana's Kisatchie National Forest. She also shares ambitious plans to create a database of biological and DNA profiles of all of the state's missing and unidentified persons. Possessing both compassion and tenacity, Mary Manhein has an extraordinary gift for telling a life story through bones. Trail of Bones takes readers on an entertaining and educating walk in the shoes of this remarkable scientist who has dedicated her life to providing justice for those no longer able to speak for themselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fFDKmvSqulgC&dq=Trail+Of+Bones:+More+Cases+From+The+Files+Of+A+Forensic+Anthropologist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terms of Refuge: The Indochinese Exodus and International Response (Politics in Contemporary Asia)","description":"For half a century (ever since the Japanese invasion of 1942), much of Southeast Asia has been racked by war. In the last 20 years alone, some three million people fled their homes in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. This book is their story. It is also the story of the international community's response. Spearheading this was the United Nations agency responsible, UNHCR. It pioneered innovations like the Orderly Departure Programme, anti-piracy and rescue-at-sea efforts, and later on, ambitious reintegration projects for returnees. Today the camps in Southeast Asia are closed. Half a million people have returned home. Over two million have started new lives in the United States, Canada, Australia and France. This compelling book is the history of this modern exodus. It also takes stock and poses important questions. How did the flight of refugees and international response evolve? How do we measure the achievements and the failures of that international effort? What has been the legacy in Asia itself? And what lessons can be drawn for use in other refugee situations around the world?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_rjiOXMRd4sC&dq=Terms+of+Refuge:+The+Indochinese+Exodus+and+International+Response+(Politics+in+Contemporary+Asia)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winning Basketball for Girls","description":"Recommends conditioning exercises; discusses shooting, passing, and dribbling; and explains offensive and defensive strategies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DdVph3OOMPkC&dq=Winning+Basketball+for+Girls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sacred Symbols of Mu","description":"Occultist James Churchward was obsessed with the lost continent of Mu, home to the original human civilization, after learning of this mysterious and forgotten paradise from an Indian priest, who shared several ancient tablets written by the Naacals, the inhabitants of Mu.

Studying both the fine details of language use and the political values implicated by word choice, the contributors examine how an \\"us versus them\\" division is played out in a wide array of cultural settings. Among the groups considered are immigrants in Western Europe, African Americans, African Canadians, Mexican Natives, Jews in Austria, and Muslims in Europe and North America. Examples of everyday speech through which prejudice is conveyed include advertising, parliamentary debate, travel literature, newspaper articles, the law, autobiography, and even classroom discourse. Collectively, the chapters make a strong and original case for the values of linguistic perspective in the study of prejudice and social inequity. The Language and Politics of Exclusion demonstrates, especially to such disciplines as sociology, journalism, and communication the ways in which discourses can marginalize others. Students and professionals will gain insight into this problem and ideally, learn the self-monitoring skills necessary to prevent this from happening.

Environment and Development in a Resource-Rich Economy provides an invaluable analysis of major natural resource and environmental policy issues in the country during the 1970s and 1980s--a period of profound socioeconomic changes, rapid depletion of natural resources, and the emergence of serious air and water pollution problems. What is path-breaking about this book is its emphasis on economics as a source of concepts and methods for analyzing natural resource and environmental issues and policy responses. The authors' access to unpublished data and key decision makers makes this account of extensive, field-based research an essential reference for policy makers and researchers concerned about environmental and natural resource management--both in Malaysia and throughout the globe. The book should be of particular interest for students who hope to understand more thoroughly the economic underpinnings of natural resource and environmental management policy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N1y0AAAAIAAJ&dq=Environment+and+Development+in+a+Resource-Rich+Economy:+Malaysia+under+the+New+Economic+Policy+(Harvard+Studies+in+International+Development)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Home Baking: The Artful Mix of Flour and Traditions from Around the World","description":"The James Beard Award-winning authors offer a glorious combination of travel and recipes that explores diverse baking traditions from around the world. From savory pies to sweet buns, from crusty loaves to birthday cake, from old-world apple pie to peanut cookies to custard tarts, these recipes capture the age-old rhythm of turning simple ingredients into something wonderful to eat. HomeBaking rekindles the simple pleasure of working with your hands to feed your family. And it ratchets down the competitive demands we place on ourselves as home cooks. Because in striving for professional results we lose touch with the pleasures of the process, with the homey and imperfect, with the satisfaction of knowing that you can, as a matter of course, always have a full cookie jar or some homemade cake on hand to offer. Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid collected the recipes in HomeBaking at their source, from farmhouse kitchens in northern France to bazaars in Fez. They traveled tens of thousands of miles, to six continents, in search of everyday gems such as Taipei Coconut Buns, Welsh Cakes, Moroccan Biscotti, and Tibetan Overnight Skillet Breads. They tasted, interpreted, photographed and captured not just the recipes, but the people who made them as well. Then they took these spot-on flavors of far away and put them side by side with cherished recipes from friends and family closer to home. The result is a collection of treasures: cherry strudel from Hungary, stollen from Germany, bread pudding from Vietnam, anise crackers from Barcelona. More than two hundred recipes that resonate with the joys and flavors of everyday baking at home and around the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XH_8AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spiritual Society: What Lurks Beyond Postmodernism?","description":"In recent decades, American Christians have been subjected to a series of different worldviews, all of them hostile to biblical faith.

It pro vides a way to describe physical quantities in three-dimensional space and the way in which these quantities vary. Many topics in the physical sciences can be analysed mathematically using the techniques of vector calculus.

This book assumes no previous knowledge of vectors. However, it is assumed that the reader has a knowledge of basic calculus, including differentiation, integration and partial differentiation. Some knowledge of linear algebra is also required, particularly the concepts of matrices and determinants. The book is designed to be self-contained, so that it is suitable for a pro gramme of individual study. Each of the eight chapters introduces a new topic, and to facilitate understanding of the material, frequent reference is made to physical applications. The physical nature of the subject is clarified with over sixty diagrams, which provide an important aid to the comprehension of the new concepts. Following the introduction of each new topic, worked examples are provided. It is essential that these are studied carefully, so that a full un derstanding is developed before moving ahead.

Worlds in Miniaturebrings together researchers working across various regions, time periods and disciplines to explore the subject of miniaturisation as a material culture technique. It offers original contribution to the field of miniaturisation through its broad geographical scope, interdisciplinary approach, and deep understanding of miniatures and their diverse contexts. Beginning with an introduction by the editors, which offers one possible guide to studying and comparing miniatures, the following chapters include studies of miniature Neolithic stone circles on Exmoor, Ancient Egyptian miniature assemblages, miniaturisation under colonialism as practiced by the Makah People of Washington State, miniature surf boats from India, miniaturised contemporary tourist art of the Warao people of Venezuela, and dioramas on display in the Science Museum. Interspersing the chapters are interviews with miniature-makers, including two miniature boat-builders at the National Maritime Museum Cornwall and a freelance architectural model-maker. Professor Susanne K chler concludes the volume with a theoretical study summarising the current state of miniaturisation as a research discipline. The interdisciplinary nature of the volume makes it suitable reading for anthropologists, archaeologists, historians and artists, and for researchers in related fields across the social sciences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mb-kDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Far from the Madding Crowd","description":"Tells the story of Bathsheba Everdene, who must choose among three suitors in Wessex in the 1840s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FQn6uIxMaXEC&dq=Far+from+the+Madding+Crowd&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marvin Gaye, My Brother (Book)","description":"MARVIN GAYE MY BROTHER BIO","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=INGGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Innocent Man","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Bag I'm Taking to Grandma's","description":"In cumulative verses and rebuses a young boy and his mother have different views on how to pack a bag for a trip to Grandma's.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qW2X4asz0p4C&dq=The+Bag+I%27m+Taking+to+Grandma%27s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"20,000 Words","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WRjIhWOLft4C&dq=20,000+Words&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Second Child","description":"The serene existence of the inhabitants of picture-perfect Secret Cove is shattered by the one-hundred-year anniversary of a young woman's unspeakable act, and young Melissa Holloway becomes the unwilling receptacle for this legacy of evil","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gfhvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Second+Child&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Browning .22 caliber rifles: 1914-1984","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9e-qNAEACAAJ&dq=Browning+.22+caliber+rifles:+1914-1984&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DREAMS--DOORWAY TO EMOTIONAL HEALTH","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yqa49OtJxtsC&dq=DREAMS--DOORWAY+TO+EMOTIONAL+HEALTH&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brain Waves Through Time: 12 Principles for Understanding the Evolutio","description":"This work takes us on a journey through time and space to explore the age-old question: What makes humans unique? How have we reached our position of preeminence among all living plant and animal life, and what drove our ascent to this commanding place? The answer revolves around the very essence of what makes us distinctly human - our brains. Dr. Robert DeMoss - a gifted writer and respected psychologist - probes the deepest recesses of our brain and the vast stretches of human knowledge to weave a broad tapestry depicting the richness of human thought and behavior. From this broad canvas, he derives 12 principles that can explain the rise of humankind and the evolution of human behavior. For out of this evolution arose the only species that can contemplate on its own future, that can think about the very act of thinking, and that has built mighty civilizations - and destroyed them too.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BJ3uAAAAMAAJ&dq=Brain+Waves+Through+Time:+12+Principles+for+Understanding+the+Evolutio&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vertical Loom: Principals and Construction","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pr_sAAAACAAJ&dq=Vertical+Loom:+Principals+and+Construction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smith and other events: Stories of the Chilcotin","description":"Paul St. Pierre's witty, honest writing never fails to delight, and nor does his legendary character, Smith.

At the core of this belief is the assumption that the right to vote is firmly established. But in fact, the United States is the only major democratic nation in which the less well-off, the young, and minorities are substantially underrepresented in the electorate. Frances Fox Piven and Richard A. Cloward were key players in the long battle to reform voter registration laws that finally resulted in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (also known as the Motor Voter law). When Why Americans Don't Vote was first published in 1988, this battle was still raging, and their book was a fiery salvo. It demonstrated that the twentieth century had witnessed a concerted effort to restrict voting by immigrants and blacks through a combination of poll taxes, literacy tests, and unwieldy voter registration requirements. Why Americans Still Don't Vote brings the story up to the present. Analyzing the results of voter registration reform, and drawing compelling historical parallels, Piven and Cloward reveal why neither of the major parties has tried to appeal to the interests of the newly registered-and thus why Americans still don't vote.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iChqseXU4RIC&dq=Why+Americans+Still+Don%27t+Vote:+And+Why+Politicians+Want+It+That+Way+(New+Democracy+Forum)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tiger for Breakfast","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BShkswEACAAJ&dq=Tiger+for+Breakfast&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Error-Control Coding for Data Networks","description":"The purpose of Error-Control Coding for Data Networks is to provide an accessible and comprehensive overview of the fundamental techniques and practical applications of the error-control coding needed by students and engineers. An additional purpose of the book is to acquaint the reader with the analytical techniques used to design an error-control coding system for many new applications in data networks. Error~control coding is a field in which elegant theory was motivated by practical problems so that it often leads to important useful advances. Claude Shannon in 1948 proved the existence of error-control codes that, under suitable conditions and at rates less than channel capacity, would transmit error-free information for all practical applications. The first practical binary codes were introduced by Richard Hamming and Marcel Golay from which the drama and excitement have infused researchers and engineers in digital communication and error-control coding for more than fifty years. Nowadays, error-control codes are being used in almost all modem digital electronic systems and data networks. Not only is coding equipment being implemented to increase the energy and bandwidth efficiency of communication systems, but coding also provides innovative solutions to many related data-networking problems.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XLLSBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Handles for the Romantically Impaired","description":"Finding love.

At its peak, it has involved some $10 billion worth of unpaid wages and has affected approximately 70 percent of the workforce. Yet public protest in the country has been rather limited. The relative passivity of most Russians in the face of such desperate circumstances is a puzzle for students of both collective action and Russian politics. In Protest and the Politics of Blame, Debra Javeline shows that to understand the Russian public's reaction to wage delays, one must examine the ease or difficulty of attributing blame for the crisis. Previous studies have tried to explain the Russian response to economic hardship by focusing on the economic, organizational, psychological, cultural, and other obstacles that prevent Russians from acting collectively. Challenging the conventional wisdom by testing these alternative explanations with data from an original nationwide survey, Javeline finds that many of the alternative explanations come up short. Instead, she focuses on the need to specify blame among the dizzying number of culprits and potential problem solvers in the crisis, including Russia's central authorities, local authorities, and enterprise managers. Javeline shows that understanding causal relationships drives human behavior and that specificity in blame attribution for a problem influences whether people address that problem through protest.

Gregory H. Williams highlights six of them Martin Kippenberger, Isa Genzken, Rosemarie Trockel, Albert Oehlen, Georg Herold, and Werner B ttner who came of age in the mid-1970s in the art scenes of West Berlin, Cologne, and Hamburg. Williams argues that each employed a distinctive brand of humor that responded to the period of political apathy that followed a decade of intense political ferment in West Germany. Situating these artists between the politically motivated art of 1960s West Germany and the trends that followed German unification in 1990, Williams describes how they no longer heeded calls for a brighter future, turning to jokes, anecdotes, and linguistic play in their work instead of overt political messages. He reveals that behind these practices is a profound loss of faith in the belief that art has the force to promulgate political change, and humor enabled artists to register this changed perspective while still supporting isolated instances of critical social commentary. Providing a much-needed examination of the development of postmodernism in Germany, Permission to Laugh will appeal to scholars, curators, and critics invested in modern and contemporary German art, as well as fans of these internationally renowned artists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IvQCzPTbUFoC&dq=Nach+Kippenberger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quilts: A Beautiful History","description":"This title features 120 inspirational historic quilts drawn from a variety of museums and private collections.

The increasing awareness of rapidly decaying monuments and their rescue from loss to future generations have urged this writer to update the 1973 and 1975 editions, now unavailable and out of print. Due to the 20-year-Iong interval, extensive updating was necessary to produce this new book. The present edition concentrates on the natural material stone, as building stone, dimension stone, architectural stone, and decorative field stones. Recently, the use of stone for thin curtain walls on buildings has become fashionable. The thin slabs exposed to anew, unknown complexity of stresses, resulting in bowing of crystalline marble, has attracted much negative pUblicity. The costs of replacing white slabs of marble on entire buildings with its legal implications have led construction com panies into bankruptcy. We blame many environmental problems on acid rain. Does acid rain really accelerate stone decay that much? Stone preservation is being attempted with an ever-increasing number of chemicals applied by as many specialists to save crumbling stone. Chemists filled this need during a time of temporary job scarcity, while the general geologist missed this opportunity; he was too deeply involved in the search for fossil fuels and metals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gtvzCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abingdon Old Testament Commentary - 1 & 2 Chronicles (Abingdon Old Testament Commentaries)","description":"This study of the 'Books of Kings' unfolds with attention and sensitivity to the immense literary artistry that craft these narratives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M4gsrfF_jhQC&dq=Abingdon+Old+Testament+Commentary+-+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deforestation, Environment, and Sustainable Development: A Comparative Analysis","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ascending Shadows","description":"Across the world, people have created a movement to fight AIDS.

Now, thanks to Melvin Holli, we have a comparable survey of the \\"best\\" and \\"worst\\" mayors, covering some 730 mayors from the big-fifteen cities, from the beginning of the modern office in 1820 to the 1990s. The poll of historians, biographers, and social scientists produced a remarkably strong consensus. Who were our best mayors? The list ranges from Boston's \\"Great Mayor\\" Josiah Quincy (18231828) to New York City's Fiorello La Guardia (19341945), who is first on the all-time-best list. La Guardia, a stouthearted fireplug of a man, built modern New York, fought Murder Incorporated, read the comics to children over the air during a newspaper strike, and was a symbol of ethnic probity and honesty. Sandwiched between Quincy and La Guardia are several other outstanding mayors, including Cleveland's Tom Johnson (19011909), Pittsburgh's David Lawrence (19461959), Detroit's Hazen Pingree (18901897), and Los Angeles's Tom Bradley (19731993). Taking the first-worst prize among scoundrel mayors is Chicago's William H. \\"Big Bill\\" Thompson (19151923, 19271931), one of the most colorful mayors in the city's history, if not the most corrupt. Big Bill, also known as \\"Kaiser Bill\\" for his pro-German stand during World War I, accepted campaign funds from gangsters including Al Capone. Also among the \\"worst\\" is another Chicago mayor, Jane Byrne (19791983), the only woman on the list. Jersey City's Frank Hague (19171947) and Philadelphia's Frank Rizzo (19721980) are among the other notable rascals who have sat in city halls. The American Mayor presents complete findings of Holli's poll in jargon-free fashion. Holli explains the results of the survey, gives biographical sketches of the ten best mayors, as well as some attention to the worst, and then uses the findings of modern leadership studies to explore mayoral success and failure. He concludes with a chapter titled \\"Pathways to Power,\\" in which he reviews the New York City political milieu that produced the nation's \\"best\\" mayor, Fiorello La Guardia, and also examines the career of the nation's most successful big-city mayor, Buffalo's Grover Cleveland, the only mayor to become president of the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bBF5swEACAAJ&dq=The+American+Mayor:+The+Best&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Panoramic New York","description":"Sweeping views of magnificent bridges, skyscrapers, cityscapes, and parks, seen from original angles in beautifully lit skies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8OwOAAAACAAJ&dq=Panoramic+New+York&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Model engine-making: In theory and practice","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NJREAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Promise of Happiness","description":"The Promise of Happiness is a provocative cultural critique of the imperative to be happy. It asks what follows when we make our desires and even our own happiness conditional on the happiness of others:  I just want you to be happy ;  I m happy if you re happy.  Combining philosophy and feminist cultural studies, Sara Ahmed reveals the affective and moral work performed by the  happiness duty,  the expectation that we will be made happy by taking part in that which is deemed good, and that by being happy ourselves, we will make others happy. Ahmed maintains that happiness is a promise that directs us toward certain life choices and away from others. Happiness is promised to those willing to live their lives in the right way. Ahmed draws on the intellectual history of happiness, from classical accounts of ethics as the good life, through seventeenth-century writings on affect and the passions, eighteenth-century debates on virtue and education, and nineteenth-century utilitarianism. She engages with feminist, antiracist, and queer critics who have shown how happiness is used to justify social oppression, and how challenging oppression causes unhappiness. Reading novels and films including Mrs. Dalloway, The Well of Loneliness, Bend It Like Beckham, and Children of Men, Ahmed considers the plight of the figures who challenge and are challenged by the attribution of happiness to particular objects or social ideals: the feminist killjoy, the unhappy queer, the angry black woman, and the melancholic migrant. Through her readings she raises critical questions about the moral order imposed by the injunction to be happy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uOAPdbhSpksC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HOW YOU CAN BE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Merchant Prince","description":" Feist has a natural talent for keeping the reader turning pages.

The fierce military state of Sparta has triumphed, but passions and hate linger on. Thousands of battle-hardened veterans from both sides in the conflict remain scattered across the Greek islands, restless and dangerous-- until the young Persian prince Cyrus issues a call to arms from his base in Asia Minor. The rogue nobleman is raising an enormous mercenary army to wrest control of all of Persia, the most powerful empire on earth, from his half-brother the king. The young philosopher-warrior Xenophon, scion of a noble Athenian family and follower of Socrates, risks his father's wrath and embarks on the adventure with high hopes for glory. Joining his cousin Proxenus, the war-maddened Spartan general Clearchus, and a huge body of Cyrus' native troops, he and ten thousand Greek mercenaries depart on an astounding march of a thousand miles, across the searing desert. Their near-deadly journey culminated in a massive, bloody battle at the very threshold of Babylon-- a battle that proves disastrous for them. Their leaders are betrayed and murdered, their supply lines cut, and their route home across the desert blocked by the furious Persian king, bent on revenge. The Fates call on Xenophon to lead the devastated Greek soldiers in their escape, though he has little experience in commanding men. As the army flees toward the snowy north, its situation appears desperate. Months later, ten thousand battered, half-starved soldiers stagger out of the frozen mountains of Armenia into a small Greek trading post on the Black Sea. Their true tale of survival, and of the heroic expedition Xenophon led through the heart of an enemy empire, astonished the incredulous natives and has been the stuff of legend ever since. Michael Curtis Ford combines his expertise on fifth-century B.C. Greek warfare with explosive page-turning action to give us an epic novel of struggle and survival. Not since Steven Pressfield's Gates of Fire has any book so vividly captured the glory, beauty, and savage bloodshed that was ancient Greece.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=axP1Htp7gcIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treating The Adult Survivor Of Childhood Sexual Abuse: A Psychoanalytic Perspective","description":"Such dual roles enacted in treatment include the unseeing, uninvolved parent and the unseen, neglected child; the sadistic abuser and the helpless, enraged victim; the idealized rescuer and the entitled child; and the seducer and the seduced.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r4NHAAAAMAAJ&dq=Treating+The+Adult+Survivor+Of+Childhood+Sexual+Abuse:+A+Psychoanalytic+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Helping Your Child Sleep Through the Night","description":"Offers advice to parents on how to promote good sleeping habits in children and solve the sleeping problems from infancy to five years old","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sQovc2twYVEC&dq=Helping+Your+Child+Sleep+Through+the+Night&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Civil War Generals: An Illustrated Encyclopedia (American Civil War)","description":"A richly illustrated, comprehensive chronicle that captures the full scope ofthe nation's central war epic, this guide has personality profiles, photos ofuniforms and weapons, plus descriptions of battles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H8NWAAAAYAAJ&dq=Civil+War+Generals:+An+Illustrated+Encyclopedia+(American+Civil+War)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GOD BLESS YOU, MR.

Alia Mamdouh, winner of the Naguib Mahfouz Award in Arabic Literature, is a journalist, essayist and novelist living in exile in Paris.

Unquestionably, the best solution to the obesity problem is prevention, or at least, early intervention. There are many diet schemes that promise quick, effortless results. The only legitimate approach to dealing with childhood obesity, however, is one that stresses improved fitness rather than weight loss. SLIM DOWN is an acronym developed after years of counseling overweight children in a private pediatric office setting. The emphasis is on incorporating healthy habits as part of a child's lifestyle.

Cunningham joined his local home guard near Shelbyville, Tennessee, in late October 1861, and immediately was assimilated into a new Confederate regiment, the 41st Tennessee Infantry. Rising to senior noncommissioned-officer rank, his experiences were those of the Army of Tennessee through the next three years. He received limited military training, was captured at Fort Donelson, and spent time as a prisoner of war in Camp Morton, Indiana. After his exchange, he marched in the failed Mississippi campaign to free Vicksburg, saw action around Jackson and Raymond, at Port Hudson, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and the Atlanta and Tennessee campaigns. There, he fought with bravado at Franklin and Nashville before he deserted. Reminiscences of the 41st Tennessee: The Civil War in the West is based on his wartime diary, which he published in 1871 for his middle Tennessee market. Cunningham's military account is a refreshingly candid examination of his daily life in the Army of Tennessee. From combat and heroism to fear, cowardice, and disease, his is an unusually honest insight into the Confederacy in the West.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uMIdAQAAMAAJ&dq=Reminiscences+of+the+41st+Tennessee:+The+Civil+War+in+the+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When the Emperor Was Divine","description":"From the bestselling, award-winning author of The Buddha in the Attic, this commanding debut novel paints a portrait of the Japanese incarceration camps that is both a haunting evocation of a family in wartime and a resonant lesson for our times. On a sunny day in Berkeley, California, in 1942, a woman sees a sign in a post office window, returns to her home, and matter-of-factly begins to pack her family's possessions. Like thousands of other Japanese Americans they have been reclassified, virtually overnight, as enemy aliens and are about to be uprooted from their home and sent to a dusty incarceration camp in the Utah desert. In this lean and devastatingly evocative first novel, Julie Otsuka tells their story from five flawlessly realized points of view and conveys the exact emotional texture of their experience: the thin-walled barracks and barbed-wire fences, the omnipresent fear and loneliness, the unheralded feats of heroism. When the Emperor Was Divine is a work of enormous power that makes a shameful episode of our history as immediate as today's headlines.

A bitter story of the very first love triangle between a man, his wife, and their God First came Adam, whose fall soured His quest for absolute authority, then Noah, whose dreary sense of duty He found dull. God resolves for a third and final time to get it right, to select a vessel through whom He can direct human affairs, and to whom He can communicate directly His will. He chooses a solitary figure whose trust must be wooed, but whose faith, once secured, will surely reflect even greater glory and love. Were matters only that simple. In Only Human, Jenny Diski's brilliant and affecting retelling of the Abraham and Sarah story, God learns that no man, chosen or not, is solitary, and that the bonds forged by the human heart are resilient even to divine commandment. Diski transforms an archetypal tale of Old Testament obedience into a fierce love triangle, a test of wills over not only mankind's future, but over who will tell the story of its past.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7TqcAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ski Pioneers: Ernie Blake, His Friends, & the Making of Taos Ski Valley","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ybPqPAAACAAJ&dq=Ski+Pioneers:+Ernie+Blake,+His+Friends,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Historians In Trouble: Plagiarism, Fraud, And Politics In The Ivory Tower","description":"Historians in Trouble is investigative journalist and historian Jon Wiener s \\"incisive and entertaining\\" (New Statesman, UK) account of several of the most notorious history scandals of the last few years.

It includes references to the locations of all known speeches and interviews, and reproductions of the dust-jackets of Russell's books.

Most accounts focus on the months preceding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. By examining the years prior to the outbreak of war, Linn provides a new perspective on the complex evolution of events in the Pacific. Exhaustively researched, Guardians of Empire traces the development of U.S. defense policy in the region, concentrating on strategy, tactics, internal security, relations with local communities, and military technology. Linn challenges earlier studies which argue that army officers either ignored or denigrated the Japanese threat and remained unprepared for war. He demonstrates instead that from 1907 onward military commanders in both Washington and the Pacific were vividly aware of the danger, that they developed a series of plans to avert it, and that they in fact identified--even if they could not solve--many of the problems that would become tragically apparent on 7 December 1941.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zEOtgqPEkgwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grilling Collection","description":"Who can resist chicken or baby back ribs brushed with a sweet and spicy marinade? \\"Grilling\\" offers more than 40 recipes, including updated classic fare and exciting new ideas.

Beginning in 1789, this period of extreme political and social unrest saw the end of the French monarchy, the death of an extraordinary number of people beneath the guillotine's blade during the Terror, and the rise of Napoleon, as well as far reaching consequences still with us today, such as the enduring ideology of human rights, and decimalization. In this Very Short Introduction, William Doyle introduces the French old regime and considers how and why it collapsed. Retelling the unfolding events of the revolution, he analyses why the revolutionaries quarrelled with the king, the church and the rest of Europe, why this produced Terror, and finally how it accomplished rule by a general. Doyle also discusses how and why the revolution destroyed the age-old cultural, institutional, and social structures in France and beyond. In this new edition, Doyle includes new sections highlighting the main developments in the field since the first edition, before exploring the legacy of the revolution in the form of rationality in public affairs and responsible government.

Violence. Scandal. These are words we rarely associate with the sacred text of the Bible. Yet in this brilliant new book, Jonathan Kirsch shows that the Old Testament is filled with some of the most startling and explicit stories in all of Western literature. These tales of seduction and rape, voyeurism and exhibitionism, intermarriage and illegitimacy, assassination and murder have been suppressed by religious authorities throughout history precisely because they are so shocking. \\"You mean that's in the Bible?\\" is the common reaction of the contemporary reader to the stories that Kirsch retells and explores. In The Harlot by the Side of the Road, Kirsch recounts these suppressed and mistranslated tales in the grand storytelling tradition. Here is the tale of Dinah, the young Israelite daughter raped by a princely suitor. The price for her hand in marriage? The circumcision of every man in his kingdom. Here, too, is the story of Lot's daughters, who, when faced with the possibility that they are the last survivors on earth, must copulate with their drunken father to continue their race. And the story of Tamar, the harlot by the side of the road, who must disguise herself as a prostitute and seduce her father-in-law in order to bear the child who has been promised her. Kirsch places each story within the political and social context of its time, and delves into the latest biblical scholarship to explain why each story was originally censored. He also brings to light when and where each story was first written down, and how it found its way into the Bible. And he shows how these stories have something important to say to contemporary readers who might never pick up a Bible. Kirsch reveals that the Bible's real power lies in its unflinching lessons in human nature. And he illuminates the surprising modernity of the Bible's characters: these were, like us, people delicately balanced between their destructive and generous natures. Certain to excite controversy and ignite intellectual debate, The Harlot by the Side of the Road will undoubtedly be one of the year's most talked-about books.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=focAQMezvSYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jesus Divine Messiah","description":"Six crucial passages from the Old Testament are examined about the person and work of the future Messiah.

From her humble but proud beginnings in south Philadelphia to international vocal renown, the legendary contralto writes of triumph and adversity, of being grounded in faith and surrounded by family, and of the music that shaped her career. Anderson published My Lord, What a Morning in 1956 on the heels of her groundbreaking role as the first African American to perform at the Metropolitan Opera. In it are bittersweet reminiscences of a working-class childhood, from her first job scrubbing the neighbors' steps to the sorrow and upheaval of her father's untimely death. Here are the stories of a young girl with prodigious talent, and her warm remembrances of the teachers, managers, friends, accompanists, and fans who worked to foster it. Here is a veritable travelogue of her concerts across the globe and rare glimpses at the personal life of a woman more concerned with family than celebrity. An entire chapter devoted to the Easter concert at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939 reveals Anderson's immense respect for Eleanor Roosevelt, who resigned from the Daughters of the American Revolution when they refused to let Anderson perform at Constitution Hall. Supplanting sorrow and regret for anger and violence, Anderson demurely imparts her views on discrimination and on becoming an icon in the struggle for civil rights. With eleven photographs and a touching new foreword by Anderson's nephew, famed conductor and poet James DePreist, this new paperback edition of My Lord, What a Morning revives the classic portrait of a musical legend who was resilient in the bullying face of bigotry and gracious in the unfaltering glow of fame.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SA9_fJJcu38C&dq=My+Lord,+What+a+Morning:+an+Autobiography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Finding Time: How Corporations, Individuals, and Families Can Benefit from New Work Practices (Collection on Technology and Work)","description":"Why do Americans work so hard? Are the long hours spent at work really necessary to increase organizational productivity? Leslie A. Perlow documents the worklife of employees who assume that for their own success and the success of their organization they must put in extended hours on the job. Perlow doesn't buy it. She challenges the basic assumption that the more employees work, the better the corporation will do.For nine months, Perlow studied the work practices of a product development team of software engineers at a Fortune 500 corporation. She reports her findings in detailed stories about individual employees and in more analytic chapters. Perlow first describes the individual heroics necessary to succeed in the existing work culture. She then explains how the system of rewards perpetuates crises and continuous interruptions,while discouraging cooperation. Finally, she shows how the resulting work practices damage both organizational productivity and the quality of individuals' lives outside of work. Perlow initiated a collaborative effort to restructure the way team members worked. Managers who were involved credit the project for the rare and important on-time launch of the product the engineers were developing. In the end, Finding Time shows that it is possible to create new work practices that enable individuals to have more personal and family time while also improving the corporation's productivity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=56FSZMt5BmcC&dq=Finding+Time:+How+Corporations,+Individuals,+and+Families+Can+Benefit+from+New+Work+Practices+(Collection+on+Technology+and+Work)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society","description":"The past 30 years have seen vast changes in our attitudes toward crime. More and more of us live in gated communities; prison populations have skyrocketed; and issues such as racial profiling, community policing, and \\"zero-tolerance\\" policies dominate the headlines. How is it that our response to crime and our sense of criminal justice has come to be so dramatically reconfigured? David Garland charts the changes in crime and criminal justice in America and Britain over the past twenty-five years, showing how they have been shaped by two underlying social forces: the distinctive social organization of late modernity and the neoconservative politics that came to dominate the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Garland explains how the new policies of crime and punishment, welfare and security and the changing class, race, and gender relations that underpin them are linked to the fundamental problems of governing contemporary societies, as states, corporations, and private citizens grapple with a volatile economy and a culture that combines expanded personal freedom with relaxed social controls. It is the risky, unfixed character of modern life that underlies our accelerating concern with control and crime control in particular. It is not just crime that has changed; society has changed as well, and this transformation has reshaped criminological thought, public policy, and the cultural meaning of crime and criminals. David Garland's The Culture of Control offers a brilliant guide to this process and its still-reverberating consequences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5nbRAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reveille in Washington, 1860-1865 (The American past)","description":"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize Featuring a foreword by Battle Cry of Freedom author James McPherson A vibrant portrait of Civil War-era Washington, D.C. that is  packed and running over with the anecdotes, scandals, personalities, and tragi-comedies of the day  (The New Yorker) 1860: The American capital is sprawling, fractured, squalid, colored by patriotism and treason, and deeply divided along the political lines that will soon embroil the nation in bloody conflict. Chaotic and corrupt, the young city is populated by bellicose congressmen, Confederate conspirators, and enterprising prostitutes. Soldiers of a volunteer army swing from the dome of the Capitol, assassins stalk the avenues, and Abraham Lincoln struggles to justify his presidency as the Union heads to war. Reveille in Washington focuses on the everyday politics and preoccupations of Washington during the Civil War. From the stench of corpse-littered streets to the plunging lace on Mary Lincoln s evening gowns, Margaret Leech illuminates the city and its familiar figures among them Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, Robert E.

Told from the points of view of a twenty-year-old Pomo man named Johnny Severe, his grandmother Elba, and his mother, Iris, this intergenerational saga uncovers the secrets and traumatic events that inform each of these characters  extraordinary powers of perception. First published in 1998, Watermelon Nights remains one of the few works of fiction to illuminate the experiences of urban Native Americans and is the only one to depict the historical conditions that shape a tribe s rural-to-urban migration. As the novel opens, Johnny is trying to organize the remaining members of his displaced California tribe. At the same time, he is struggling with his own sexuality and thinking about leaving his grandmother s home for the big city. As the novel shifts perspective, tracing the controversial history of the Pomo people, we learn how the tragic events of Elba s childhood, as well as Iris s attempts to separate herself from her cultural roots, make Johnny s dilemma all the more difficult. In the end, what binds both family and tribe together is a respect albeit at times reluctant for the traditions that have withstood so many challenges. This new edition of the novel features a revised preface by the author and an afterword by Reginald Dyck, who identifies broader contexts important to our understanding of the novel, including tribal sovereignty, federal Indian policy, and the effects of historical trauma. Gritty yet rich in emotion, Watermelon Nights stands beside the works of Louise Erdrich, Stephen Graham Jones, and Tommy Orange.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oFkmEAAAQBAJ&dq=Watermelon+Nights&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feeding Your Baby (Johnson's Everyday Babycare)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gmCitwAACAAJ&dq=Feeding+Your+Baby+(Johnson%27s+Everyday+Babycare)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Guide to Used Cars 2001 (Consumer Guide Used Car Book: Complete Guide to Used Cars (Mass Market Paper))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q4FYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Complete+Guide+to+Used+Cars+2001+(Consumer+Guide+Used+Car+Book:+Complete+Guide+to+Used+Cars+(Mass+Market+Paper))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tom Cringle's Log","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AJULAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding Imperial Russia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uq6BtAEACAAJ&dq=Understanding+Imperial+Russia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simply Wonderful","description":"Family-oriented churches that welcome children and include them in their worship and programming are always faster growing and more vibrant.

He is on the hunt for The Cat, an outlaw who has been stealing goods to deliver to poor families and allegedly killed a US Marshall in the process. After a robbery and subsequent shoot out in town, Black Fox spots a young boy running from the scene and follows him, sure he is The Cat. But to his surprise, the boy turns out to be a girl! Cathleen O'Sullivan has no need for the law, especially when they refused to prosecute the man who destroyed her family. Now disguised as The Cat, she steals goods from her enemy to help the poor, and if it brings havoc to him and his bootlegging partners, then all the better. Then during a shootout, she is wounded, and captured by Black Fox. This ruggedly handsome lawman is not at all what she expected, especially when he cares for her wounds and protects her from her enemies instead of hauling her off to jail. She insists she's being framed for murder, and though Black Fox knows he should not be seduced by this spunky slip of a girl who has no respect for the law, he's torn between loving her and arresting her.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GeWfDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mrs. Washington and Horowitz, Too","description":"Feeling ignored by his children and abandoned by his friends, Samuel Horowitz, at the urging of Mrs. Washington, agrees to volunteer at a hospital. 20,000 first printing. $15,000 ad/promo.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kJa5maI2KF4C&dq=Mrs.+Washington+and+Horowitz,+Too&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An introduction to the study of stellar structure","description":"Rigorous examination of relationship between loss of energy, mass, and radius of stars in a steady state.

Is it Legal? Is it Possible?","description":"America's moral decline is not secret. An alarming number of moral and cultural problems have exploded in our country since 1960--a period when the standards of morality expressed in our laws and customs have been relaxed, abandoned, or judicially overruled. Conventional wisdom says laws cannot stem moral decline. Anyone who raises the prospect of legislation on the hot topics of our day - abortion, family issues, gay rights, euthanasia - encounters a host of objections: As long as I don't hurt anyone the government s should leave me alone.  No one should force their morals on anyone else.  You can't make people be good.  Legislating morality violates the separation of church and state.  'Legislating Morality' answers those objections and advocates a moral base for America without sacrificing religious and cultural diversity. It debunks the myth that morality can't be legislated  and amply demonstrates how liberals, moderates, and conservatives alike exploit law to promote good and curtail evil. This book boldly challenges prevailing thinking about right and wrong and about our nation's moral future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DuBKAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simply Window Treatments: All You Need to Know to Make Curtains, Shades, and Swags","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Richard Avedon: Made in France","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1tZLAQAAIAAJ&dq=Richard+Avedon:+Made+in+France&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pascal Plus Data Structures (with 3.5\\" disk)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_x8QAQAAMAAJ&dq=Pascal+Plus+Data+Structures+(with+3.5%22+disk)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real Writing: Paragraphs and Essays for College, Work, and Everyday Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oCWduAEACAAJ&dq=Real+Writing:+Paragraphs+and+Essays+for+College,+Work,+and+Everyday+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feed my sheep: A scriptural view of the Christian's responsibility to the world around him","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=teUJtwAACAAJ&dq=Feed+my+sheep:+A+scriptural+view+of+the+Christian%27s+responsibility+to+the+world+around+him&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pimsleur Instant Conversation Arabic (Eastern) [CD]","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Self-Esteem","description":"Demonstrates the role of self-esteem in psychological health and presents six action-based practices that provide a foundation for daily life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zahmByF_lqoC&dq=Self-Esteem&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What's So Spiritual about Your Gifts?

This one should fly.\\"--Publishers Weekly Friday is a secret courier and ardent lover. Employed by a man she only knows of as \\"Boss\\", she is given the most awkward and dangerous cases, which take her from New Zealand to Canada, and through the new States of America's disunion, all the way out into the stars and the new colony of Botany Bay. Thrust into one calamity after another, she uses her enhanced wits and very many skills to evade, seduce or even kill her way out of any sticky situation she finds herself in. For she is both superior and inferior to the average human. As an AP--artificial person--the best humanity has to offer has been written into Friday's DNA. Yet she is often treated like a second-class citizen--if she were ever able to claim citizenship. Her mother was the test tube and her father the knife, as the saying goes, so she has less rights than the biologically-born human, and no soul, according to the church. But in Friday Heinlein has created one of the most enlightened, warm, engaging, and humane characters in the science fiction field, gifting us a novel of female empowerment that was well ahead of its time. \\"One of Heinlein's best, which is to say one of the best in all of Science Fiction--terrific story with a superbly realized heroine and world.\\"--Poul Anderson","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XnDBzQEACAAJ&dq=Friday&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joe Blanco's Survival Street Spanish for Police Officers (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vx8fPQAACAAJ&dq=Joe+Blanco%27s+Survival+Street+Spanish+for+Police+Officers+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dilemmas of Domination: The Unmaking of the American Empire (American Empire Project)","description":"From the acclaimed globalization critic, a far-reaching analysis of America's military, economic, and political vulnerability The empire seems unassailable, but the empire is weak-and precisely because of its imperial ambitions. So argues Walden Bello's provocative new book, which systematically dissects the strategic, economic, and political dilemmas confronting America as a consequence of its quest for global domination. An award-winning development expert, Bello shows how despite the enormity of the U.S. defense budget, American forces are already overextended, a condition bound to intensify as each local \\"victory\\" breeds simmering resistance and new confrontation. He points to the empire's looming economic breakdown, the result of its gargantuan military costs, record-breaking deficits, and exploitative trade and investment relations with developing countries. On the political front, he warns of the bitter disillusionment mounting around the world in response to America's failure to champion liberal democracy. Everywhere America goes, crony capitalism, hostile coercion, and gross inequalities in income eat away at expectations of justice and inclusion. A clear and prophetic examination, Dilemmas of Domination reveals a not-too-distant future in which the empire's hidden weaknesses will yield fatal challenges to American supremacy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V-jPwAEACAAJ&dq=Dilemmas+of+Domination:+The+Unmaking+of+the+American+Empire+(American+Empire+Project)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Theft of The Countryside","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=weeMQdlN72oC&dq=The+Theft+of+The+Countryside&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The WORLD'S WORST FAIRY GODMOTHER (PAPERBACK)","description":"A hapless fairy godmother faces her toughest assignment yet: a perfect little girl whom she must teach to be normal Maybelle was only trying to help.

Her old encounters with overdrawn bank accounts and oversized ambitions in the big city have given way to a new set of challenges. The first essay, \\"Matricide,\\" opens without flinching: People who weren't there like to say that my mother died at home surrounded by loving family. This is technically true, though it was just my brother and me and he was looking at Facebook and I was reading a profile of Hillary Clinton in the December 2009 issue of Vogue. Elsewhere, she carefully weighs the decision to have children \\"I simply felt no calling to be a parent. As a role, as my role, it felt inauthentic and inorganic\\" and finds a more fulfilling path as a court-appointed advocate for foster children. In other essays, she skewers the marriage-industrial complex and recounts a harrowing near-death experience following a sudden illness. Throughout, Daum pushes back against the false sentimentality and shrink-wrapped platitudes that surround so much of contemporary American experience and considers the unspeakable thoughts many of us harbor that we might not love our parents enough, that \\"life's pleasures\\" sometimes feel more like chores, that life's ultimate lesson may be that we often learn nothing. But Daum also operates in a comic register. With perfect precision, she reveals the absurdities of the New Age search for the \\"Best Possible Experience,\\" champions the merits of cream-of mushroom-soup casserole, and gleefully recounts a quintessential \\"only-in-L.A.\\" story of playing charades at a famous person's home. Combining the piercing insight of Joan Didion with humor reminiscent of Nora Ephron's, Daum dissects our culture's most dangerous illusions, blind spots, and sentimentalities while retaining her own joy and compassion. Through it all, she dramatizes the search for an authentic self in a world where achieving an identity is never simple and never complete.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pVmYAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horses in the green valley","description":"A book about all the breeds of horses, past and present.

Physicists call the eternal, ubiquitous constancy of the laws of physics symmetry. Symmetry is the basic underlying principle that defines the laws of nature and hence controls the universe. This all-important insight is one of the great conceptual breakthroughs in modern physics and is the basis of contemporary efforts to discover a grand unified theory to explain all the laws of physics. Nobel Laureate Leon M. Lederman and physicist Christopher T. Hill explain the supremely elegant concept of symmetry and all its profound ramifications to life on Earth and the universe at large in this eloquent, accessible popular science book. They not only clearly describe concepts normally reserved only for physicists and mathematicians, but they also instill an appreciation for the profound beauty of the universe s inherent design. Central to the story of symmetry is an obscure, unpretentious, but extremely gifted German mathematician named Emmy Noether. Though still little known to the world, she impressed no less a scientist than Albert Einstein, who praised her \\"penetrating mathematical thinking.\\" In some of her earliest work she proved that the law of the conservation of energy was connected to the idea of symmetry and thus laid the mathematical groundwork for what may be the most important concept of modern physics. Lederman and Hill reveal concepts about the universe, based on Noether s work, that are largely unknown to the public and have wide-reaching implications in connection with the Big Bang, Einstein s theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, and many other areas of physics. Through ingenious analogies and illustrations, they bring these astounding notions to life. This book will open your eyes to a universe you never knew existed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e9AQ5zH13qQC&dq=Symmetry+and+the+Beautiful+Universe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Forgotten Beasts of Eld","description":"World Fantasy Award-Winner First time available in an e-book edition \\"Rich and regal.\\"  The New York Times Young Sybel, the heiress of powerful wizards, needs the company of no-one outside her gates.

Corcoran, Benjamin V. Cohen, William O. Douglas, Abe Fortas, and James Rowe-helped Franklin D. Roosevelt build the modern American state and a progressive political coalition that seemed invincible. These junior officers of the New Deal numbered among their favorite members of Congress the young Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas. For thirty years, through LBJ's own presidency, they functioned as his intimate \\"kitchen cabinet.\\"Michael Janeway grew up with an insider view of these brokers of ideas and power because his father, economist and journalist Eliot Janeway, was a member of their circle.

They were executed during the years 1975 and 1976 under the guiding light of Tatyana Grosman (to whom Fuller had been introduced by Edwin Schlossberg) at her ULAE print workshop in West Islip, Long Island. In something of a publishing innovation this trade book was brought out concurrently with a limited edition of the signed original lithographs. Michael Denneny was the editorial impresario at St. Martin's and Ronald Feldman Fine Arts handled the exhibition of the lithographs. Fuller composed the Tetrascroll between the publication of Synergetics in 1975 and Synergetics 2 in 1979. He had been frustrated by the rigid structure of the synergetics books which, despite certain advantages, he felt robbed the work of spontaneity and narrative force. To compensate for this Fuller worked feverishly on the Tetrascroll as a free-form obbligato to the synergetics books.

In 1909, he mother was hired by President Taft, who was the first president ever to allow a Black person to enter the White House. She worked in the White House until 1939. Her daughter was hired by President Hoover in 1929 and she worked there until the final days of the Eisenhower Administration in 1959. This book should be required reading for every serious student of American history. The authors were eye witnesses to some of the great events of history and offer different prospectives from that found elsewhere. For example, we learn that when Calvin Coolidge announced in 1927 that he did not intend to run for re-election, he was playing hard-to-get. He believed that the people would insist that he accept a third term of office. He expected to be drafted. He actually wanted a third term in office. Coolidge was disappointed when Herbert Hoover was nominated as he disagreed with Hoover's ideas and policies. We learn that in the last year and a half of the presidency of President Woodrow Wilson, he had to be wheeled around the White House in a wheel chair and was often engaged in \\"sickbed rambling.\\" When Franklin D. Roosevelt took office as president, he was an invalid, confined to a wheelchair. Few Americans knew this and elaborate means were devised to make it appear that Roosevelt was robust and healthy. Whenever he was to speak, railings were created beside where he was to be standing. This was done so that it would appear that FDR was walking, taking a few steps up to the speaker's podium, when in reality the handrails were holding him up and he was dragging his feet a short distance to create the illusion that he was walking. Also, Roosevelt was dependent on his mother, Sara Delano, who had all the money and controlled his finances.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KBt2AAAAMAAJ&dq=My+Thirty+Years+Backstairs+at+the+White+House&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Sell at Margins Higher Than Your Competitors: Winning Every Sale at Full Price, Rate, or Fee","description":"Praise for How to Sell at Margins Higher Than Your Competitor \\"This is the complete book for both new and experienced salespeople and business owners to learn and re-learn the essentials for success.

Dr Cullmann is an ardent protagonist of infant baptism, which is the subject of intense debate at the moment. He rightly deplores Barth's attempts to discredit the practice. On the basis of the kinship between circumcision and baptism on the one hand, and between the proselyte bath of the Jews and baptism on the other, he makes a forceful plea for the spiritual reality and legitimacy of baptizing infants. This is an essay which is packed with profound scriptural analysis; its relevance to current discussion in the Church of England is obvious' (Church Times). 'Of the merits of this essay there is little need to speak. The author is a well-known expert in matters relating to the origins of Christianity, and he has also a fine apprehension of the theological issues involved. He treats his subject under the four heads : the foundation of baptism in the work of Christ; baptism as acceptance into the body of Christ; baptism and faith; and baptism and circumcision ... Not everyone will agree entirely with the author's account of what takes place in baptism, but there can be no doubt that he is right in his general stress upon the objective character of this sacrament. We are indebted to him also for useful discussions of various texts and passages of the New Testament. It will be a surprise to some that there is even less New Testament evidence for the adult baptism of the children of believing Christians than there is for their baptism as infants. The linking of baptism with circumcision is very ably done, and in an appendix on an early baptismal formula the genuineness of Acts 8.37 is defended and the relevance of Christ's blessing of the children displayed' (The Life of Faith).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VSFUPAAACAAJ&dq=Baptism+in+the+New+Testament+(Studies+in+Biblical+Theology,+First+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walter Minion's Therapy","description":"A combination of black comedy, allegory, high adventure, and exploration of human relationships in a crazy world. Walter Minion is an archetypical retired Englishman. His life is gentle and domesticated. But gradually little stresses mount, culminating in his bizarre attempt at suicide. He is incarcerated in a mental institution where he is treated in inexplicable ways by strange characters. His enforced therapy is to undertake a voyage around the world, alone, on a small yacht. In mid-Atlantic a wondrous girl swims alongside and climbs aboard. Spray is feminine perfection, but Walter discovers that she is also weirdly unnatural. The two are caught up in a series of wild adventures as they cross oceans, make exotic landfalls and survive terrifying dangers. They encounter more people: good, evil and mad. Throughout their odyssey Spray holds out tantalising prospects of submission and erotic rapture. Walter wrestles with the emotional conflicts that ensue, and with humanity's stupidity and hatred, beauty and love. Walter's therapy sails to a surprising finale, a counterpoint of tragedy and joyful triumph. But what is reality, and what is delusion? For more information visit the book's web site: www.walterminion.com Reviews Patrick O'Connor weaves fantasy, dreams, frustrated erotic yearnings, life's experiences and sweeping knowledge of natural history, sailing and the oceans into a wonderful, inspiring and fast-moving adventure. Within this panoply he patches observations and opinions about the dumbing down world: avarice, power hunger, piracy, psychiatric quackery, clinical corruption and modern miscalled music. Tears of anger and despair bespatter those pages. These are warnings to the rest of us: keep speeding on to mankind's doom or veer sharply to restored enlightenment.

The action is non-stop and shuttles back and forth between scary-believable and rollicking good fun. I read High Treason during a six-hour plane ride and the trip went by like the snap of my fingers.   James Patterson In this pulse-pounding action thriller perfect for fans of Brad Thor and David Baldacci, Tom Locke must stop dark forces working to overthrow the president En route to the National Prayer Breakfast, the U.S. vice president s motorcade is hit in a vicious, expertly planned attack that throws Washington, DC, into chaos. Everyone assumes it s terrorists  everyone but young FBI agent Jennifer Lin. She is certain that the easy answers here are not the likely ones. . . . Half a world away, former military contractor Tom Locke has his own doubts about what happened and who did it. He suspects his former employer, Apollo Outcomes. But why would the global private military corporation orchestrate such a brutal strike on U.S. soil? Returning to DC, Locke teams with Lin and discovers that a civil war is secretly brewing in the military-contracting world. A division of one company has gone rogue, led by a power-hungry former colleague of Locke s who may have planned the attack on the vice president himself. But this man couldn t have pulled it off without help from inside the government. The VP s itinerary and route were confidential which means there must be a traitor high up in either the White House or the NSA who is leaking information. But why? And who could be pulling the strings? Radical Islamic terrorists? Or is this a new ploy by Putin to subvert American leadership? Or is someone else behind the attack? Only Locke can get to the bottom of the conspiracy and blow it apart with one bold strike before it s too late.  High Treason has brutal assassinations, shocking betrayals, even heated gun battles in the shadow of the White House. It had me breathless from the sheer audacity of its storytelling to its breakneck pacing. It s not to be missed!

Successful, accomplished, and well-financed people of all ages are moving to communities they view as choice--places distinguished by fine climate, physical beauty, abundant natural recreation resources, and minimal social problems and low crime. Towns in this elite roster include Santa Fe, Aspen, Boulder, Bozeman, Chapel Hill, East Hampton, and many others. These American boom towns, Peter Wolf writes, have grown in jobs and population at two to three times the national average. But warning signs of deterioration are already evident: overbuilding, failing natural resources, rising taxes, and traffic congestion are all taking a toll on these communities. Rapid migration can enhance or swamp America's fastest growing and most desirable communities Wolf examines the choices that people in these areas can make to both effectively accommodate growth and yet ensure their economic futures. A wise town undergoing growth will realize that what must be preserved is not the growth in-and-for itself, but the qualities which attract people in the first place. Wolf demonstrates how it is possible--even during a town's rapid expansion--to enhance the quality of residents' lives, to incorporate aesthetics and design into town evolution, to protect what is precious in nature, and to preserve the best that has already been built. Wolf concludes with a practical checklist for the residents of hot towns, allowing them to evaluate how their communities are coping with growth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zERIJ2vRChQC&dq=Hot+Towns:+The+Future+of+the+Fastest+Growing+Communities+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Primarily creativity","description":"An emphasis on creative thinking skills in the classroom necessitates providing students with open-ended assignments and encouragement as they search for new answers.

Simply put, the children of narcissist offspring of parents whose interest always towered above the most basic needs of their sons and daughters share a common belief: They believe they do not have the right to exist. The difficulties experienced by adult children of narcissists can manifest themselves in many ways: for examples, physical self-loathing that takes form of overeating, anorexia, or bulimia; a self-destructive streak that causes poor job performance and rocky personal relationships; or a struggle with the self that is perpetuated in the adult's interaction with his or her own children. These dilemmas are both common and correctable, Dr. Golomb tells us. With an empathic blend of scholarship and case studies, along with her own personal narrative of her fight for self, Dr. Golomb plumbs the depths of this problem, revealing its mysterious hold on the affairs of otherwise bright, aware, motivated, and worthy people. Trapped in the Mirror explores. the nature of the paralysis and lack of motivation so many adults feel stress and its role in exacerbating childhood wrongs why do many of our relationships seem to be \\"reruns\\" of the past how one's body image can be formed by faulty parenting how anger must be acknowledge to be overcome and, most important, how even the most traumatized self can be healed. Rooted in a profoundly humanist traditional approach, and suffused with the benefit of the latest knowledge about intrafamily relationships, Trapped in the Mirror offers more than the average self-help book; it is truly the first self-heal book for millions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4Xg3phFjdFwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Original 21 Rules of This House","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qxs2AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Original+21+Rules+of+This+House&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An agnostic's apology,: And other essays,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AKKOC-LO_XoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greenback Era: A Social and Political History of American Finance, 1865-1879","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GYT6zQEACAAJ&dq=The+Greenback+Era:+A+Social+and+Political+History+of+American+Finance,+1865-1879&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Organizing to Win: New Research on Union Strategies (Ilr Press Books)","description":"As the American labour movement mobilizes for a major resurgence through new organizing, this text presents research on union organizing strategies.

Drawn from a lifetime of frontline culture-shifting advocacy, organizing, and fighting for equal justice, State of Emergency makes Mallory s demand for change and shares the keys to effective activism both for those new to and long-committed to the defense of Black lives. From Minneapolis to Louisville, to Portland, Kenosha, and Washington, DC, America s reckoning with its unmet promises on race and class is at a boiling point not seen since the 1960s. While conversations around pathways to progress take place on social media and cable TV, history tells us that meaningful change only comes with radical legislation and boots-on-the-ground activism. Here, Mallory shares her unique personal experience building coalitions, speaking truth to power, and winning over hearts and minds in the struggle for shared prosperity and safety.

There were no mission limits for a pilot in the Pacific during World War II; unlike in Europe, you flew until it was time to go home. So it was for James  Jug  Curran, all the way from New Guinea to the Philippines with the 348th Fighter Group, the first P-47 Thunderbolt outfit in the Pacific. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Curran volunteered to try flying in the blue yonder and trained as an Army fighter pilot. He got his wish to fly the P-47 in the Pacific, going into combat in August 1943, in New Guinea, and later helping start the  Black Rams  fighter squadron. The heavy US Thunderbolts were at first curious to encounter the nimble, battle-hardened Japanese in aerial combat, but soon, the American pilots gained skill of their own and their planes proved superior. Bombers on both sides could fall to fighters, but the fighters themselves were eyeball to eyeball, best man win. Check Six! is an aviation chronicle that brings the reader into flight, then into the fight, throughout the Pacific War and back. This work, from someone who was there, captures the combat experience of our aviators in the Pacific, aided by pertinent excerpts from the official histories of units that  Jug  Curran flew with.  Jim Curran is not afraid to share his moments of fear and emotions during the air battles with his readers which gives the book an extra dimension.

Edgar Hoover reported to the Nixon White House in 1972 about the Bureau's surveillance of John Lennon, he began by explaining that Lennon was a \\"former member of the Beatles singing group.\\" When a copy of this letter arrived in response to Jon Wiener's 1981 Freedom of Information request, the entire text was withheld along with almost 200 other pages on the grounds that releasing it would endanger national security. This book tells the story of the author's remarkable fourteen-year court battle to win release of the Lennon files under the Freedom of Information Act in a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court. With the publication of Gimme Some Truth, 100 key pages of the Lennon FBI file are available complete and unexpurgated, fully annotated and presented in a \\"before and after\\" format. Lennon's file was compiled in 1972, when the war in Vietnam was at its peak, when Nixon was facing reelection, and when the \\"clever Beatle\\" was living in New York and joining up with the New Left and the anti-war movement. The Nixon administration's efforts to \\"neutralize\\" Lennon are the subject of Lennon's file. The documents are reproduced in facsimile so that readers can see all the classification stamps, marginal notes, blacked out passages and in some cases the initials of J. Edgar Hoover. The file includes lengthy reports by confidential informants detailing the daily lives of anti-war activists, memos to the White House, transcripts of TV shows on which Lennon appeared, and a proposal that Lennon be arrested by local police on drug charges. Fascinating, engrossing, at points hilarious and absurd, Gimme Some Truth documents an era when rock music seemed to have real political force and when youth culture challenged the status quo in Washington. It also delineates the ways the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations fought to preserve government secrecy, and highlights the legal strategies adopted by those who have challenged it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FPPj3e_cQIcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nature's Way: Native Wisdom for Living in Balance with the Earth","description":"Now in paperback! US bestselling author of Mother Earth Spirituality returns with a call for a spiritual awakening to create a new global culture. Beginning with the ways of the Lakota Sioux and branching outward, Sioux tribal leader Ed McGaa, known as Eagle Man, shows the error of using animals and the natural world as a whole for economic and political gain. He then offers everyday lessons and values gleaned from Nature that endure for all times and people. In this call for spiritual awakening, McGaa explains how we can create a new global culture based not on dominance over nature for economic and political gain, but on values that endure for all times and all people. Nature's Way explores Native American belief systems, oppression of Native Americans by the dominant society, the desacralisation of Nature, and the complicity of institutional religion. Taking on religion, politics, and culture, McGaa provides a template for readers  a path designed by Nature that anyone can follow. Using the lessons of eagle, bear, lion, wolf, orca, owl, tiger, buffalo, rat, deer  even the cottonwood tree, Nature's Way teaches all of us how we can overcome religious intolerance, treat women and men equally, preserve our environment, and live in peace.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OBef3CMWEYUC&dq=Nature%27s+Way:+Native+Wisdom+for+Living+in+Balance+with+the+Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Operation Iraqi Freedom: What Went Right, What Went Wrong, and Why","description":"No war has ever had the intensive media coverage of the 2003 war in Iraq, and none has ever had such monumental second-guessing. Months before the war began, domestic and international pundits painted a gloomy picture of a new Vietnam or of a nuclear Armageddon that would see Israel reduced to ruins. The war started with a brilliant series of pre-emptive bangs that shattered Iraqi leadership and seized the most valuable areas of Iraq. How did the US military machine, assumed to have insufficient air power, too few troops, and little momentum take a country the size of California within three weeks? In the 1991 victory in the Gulf War, the United States lead a much larger coalition force into a heavy air campaign followed by a lightening quick ground campaign. In the years that followed, the United States military experienced a continuing series of reductions in the national defense budget. What was left unrecorded was the incredible degree of competence with which the US military leadership managed the reduction in resources, balancing force structures against personnel requirements against procurement needs and logistic realities. Any one considering the great military victory achieved in Iraq must ask the following questions: Who was bright enough to plan to have the weapons systems in the right place at the right time? Who orchestrated this vast complex array of sophisticated military machinery-ships, submarines, missiles, armor, and soldiers-all needing fuel, ammunition and water? The answer is the much-maligned civil and military leaders of the American defense establishment, working in concert with the most advanced defense-based corporations in the world. While there were those anxious to parade the iniquities of a two-billion dollar bomber, most often failed to appreciated the genius required to conceive of, much less create a system which can use a satellite to send signals to a B-1B to program a precision guided missile to take out a Soviet T-72 tank parked in a mosque-without damaging the mosque! Admittedly, there were lapses in the Iraqi war, such as the looting of museums by members of the Ba'ath party just a day after many had declared Baghdad liberated and the raids on hospitals, another problem that could have easily been remedied by a show of U.S. presence and force. And there were technological complications as well, including the aching misfortune of death by friendly fire. The author deals with these shortcomings in a straightforward manner. Operation Iraqi Freedom: What Went Right and Why; What Went Wrong and Why gives intimate insight into the way in which the armed services, particularly the United States Air Force, managed to overcome genuine budgetary, political, and military difficulties to create the finest military force in the world, one that operated with the most extreme care to avoid collateral damage and to prevent loss of life.

Born in Montreal's West End, he turned down careers in football and baseball to become one of the greatest hockey players ever. A perennial all-star and seven-time winner of the Norris Trophy for best defence-man, he was a cornerstone of the legendary Montreal Canadiens that won five Stanley Cups in a row. Harvey's brilliant passing set the devastating Montreal attack in motion, and his consummate puck control kept the other team from scoring. Off the ice, Harvey was a rebel. He was a driving force behind an attempted players union and an outspoken critic of the hockey establishment. He was funny, irreverent, generous, and kind-hearted. He was also stubborn, hard drinking, and unpredictable. Team mates considered him a leader and friend. Management considered him a trouble-maker. Life after hockey was difficult. He battled alcoholism and manic-depression. He led a nomadic life that often worried friends and family. But he returned to the Canadiens as a scout in 1985 and was happy to be back. Many called him a tragic figure, especially after he became fatally ill with liver disease. But Harvey had no complaints. He wouldn't have changed a single day of his remarkable life. William Brown is a free-lance writer and broadcaster. His previous books, The Montreal Maroons: The Forgotten Stanley Cup Champions, and Baseball's Fabulous Montreal Royals, chronicled two cherished sports teams from the city's past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=skXEPAAACAAJ&dq=Doug:+The+Doug+Harvey+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Rare Opportunity : Your Key to A Miraculous Life","description":"A motivational book designed to empower readers to attain their dreams in life.

Holliday, D. D. S., better known as Doc Holliday, has become a legendary figure in the history of the American West. In Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait, Karen Holliday Tanner reveals the real man behind the legend. Shedding light on Holliday s early years, in a prominent Georgia family during the Civil War and Reconstruction, she examines the elements that shaped his destiny: his birth defect, the death of his mother and estrangement from his father, and the diagnosis of tuberculosis, which led to his journey west. The influence of Holliday s genteel upbringing never disappeared, but it was increasingly overshadowed by his emerging western personality. Holliday himself nurtured his image as a frontier gambler and gunman. Using previously undisclosed family documents and reminiscences as well as other primary sources, Tanner documents the true story of Doc s friendship with the Earp brothers and his run-ins with the law, including the climactic shootout at the O. K. Corral and its aftermath. This first authoritative biography of Doc Holliday should appeal both to historians of the West and to general readers who are interested in his poignant story. \\"Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait will be considered the definitive Holliday biography and will supplant all previously published works on the man s life as a complete and authoritative account.

Filippo Brunelleschi (1404-1472) started investigating the geometry of perspective in 1425. Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) and Gerard Desargues (1591-1661) independently developed the pivotal concept of the \\"point at infinity.\\" Desargues developed an alternative way of constructing perspective drawings by generalizing the use of vanishing points to include the case when these are infinitely far away. He made Euclidean geometry, where parallel lines are truly parallel, into a special case of an all-encompassing geometric system. Desargues's study on conic sections drew the attention of 16-years old Blaise Pascal and helped him formulate Pascal's theorem. The works of Gaspard Monge at the end of 18th and beginning of 19th century were important for the subsequent development of projective geometry. The work of Desargues was ignored until Michel Chasles chanced upon a handwritten copy in 1845. Meanwhile, Jean-Victor Poncelet had published the foundational treatise on projective geometry in 1822. Poncelet separated the projective properties of objects in individual class and establishing a relationship between metric and projective properties. The non-Euclidean geometries discovered shortly thereafter were eventually demonstrated to have models, such as the Klein model of hyperbolic space, relating to projective geometry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LCzAwAEACAAJ&dq=Foundations+of+projective+geometry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flower Fairies of the Countryside","description":"A collection of poems celebrating fairies and the different flowers that grow in the meadow, the woods, along hedgerows, and in country gardens.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W60bN1Of40IC&dq=Flower+Fairies+of+the+Countryside&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fatal Friendship","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WiUhAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Fatal+Friendship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nicaragua: The Chamorro Years","description":"David Close examines the impact of Violeta Chamorro's term as head of state in Nicaragua on the nation's political actors and government institutions.

Designed to be used individually or as a set, these volumes represent the first comprehensive assessment of all exploration methodologies. No other books offer the breadth of information and range of applications available in this set. The first volume, Introduction to Geophysical Formation Evaluation, is the perfect introductory reference for environmental professionals without previous training in the field. It explains the fundamentals of geophysical exploration and analysis, illuminates the underlying theories, and offers practical guidance on how to use the available methodologies. General information on material behavior, porosity, tortuosity, permeability, cores, resistivity, radioactivity, and more provides a solid foundation for more advanced studies. The second volume, Standard Methods of Geophysical Formation Evaluation builds on the basic precepts presented in the first work but can be used alone as a self-contained reference. It covers all the petroleum-oriented standard methods which, until recently, have comprised the majority of applications of geophysical formation evaluation. It also points out non-hydrocarbon uses of petroleum methods. This volume provides complete practical information and instructions on using the standard exploration and evaluation methods. It presents comprehensive, painstakingly detailed instructions for resistivity, radiation, and acoustic methods. The third volume, Non-Hydrocarbon Methods of Geophysical Formation Evaluation, discusses uses of formation evaluation in environmental science and engineering, hydrogeology, and other fields outside the petroleum industry, and demonstrates how the standard methods can be adapted to these non-hydrocarbon purposes. It presents step-by-step instructions for photon, magnetic, nuclear, and acoustic methods of exploration, and gives special attention to the analytical techniques used in non-hydrocarbon exploration. Individually, each book is a complete, stand-alone reference on an important area of this changing field. Together, the three volumes provide the most complete practical compendium available on all aspects of formation evaluation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i3kH_tVJdIsC&dq=Introduction+to+Geophysical+Formation+Evaluation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gyrene: The World War II United States Marine","description":"A look at the personal and cultural history of the American marines who fought in the South and Central Pacific during World War II","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=re1mAAAAMAAJ&dq=Gyrene:+The+World+War+II+United+States+Marine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Overture to Death","description":"A local busybody is silenced for good in this tale by  a peerless practitioner of the slightly surreal, English-village comedy-mystery  (Kirkus Reviews).

Sometimes healthy and able to attend school, other times hospitalized for weeks, Laura found solace in keeping a diary.

While the tabloids eagerly lapped up the lurid details of his parents' divorce, William lived painfully through it, suffering the embarrassment, the humiliation, and divided loyalties. He watched his father denounced on prime time television; he met the lovers. And when he was just fifteen, his beautiful, loving mother was suddenly, shocking snatched from his life forever. The nation lost its princess and its grief threatened the very future of the monarchy. What was almost forgotten in the clamor was that two small boys had lost their mother.

He has an utter determination to do the right thing and to serve his country as his grandmother has so successfully done for the last sixty years.

Saint Veneration among the Jews in Morocco, the only book in English on this topic, contains essential information about Moroccan Jewry not available anywhere else. The Hebrew edition, published by Magnes Press in 1984, has become a standard classic in the study of the history, culture, and religious practices of Moroccan Jewry. In this new English language edition, based on ten years of fieldwork, Issachar Ben-Ami provides the basic historical and ethnographic information about saint veneration. He illuminates the intricate network that connects the saints and their faithful followers, while revealing the ideological fundamentals that sustain the interrelationship and ensure ritual continuity. Using material selected from more than 1,200 testimonies collected during the course of his research, Ben-Ami describes historical and legendary types of saints, customs and beliefs related to the saints or their sanctuaries, and the practices and ceremonies that take place during or outside the hillulah, the the festival that celebrates the anniversary of the death of a saint. Two chapters are dedicated to a comparison with the cult of saints among the Muslims in Morocco as well as to the relationship between Jews and Muslims in Morocco in what concerning saint veneration. In addition, Ben-Ami has included an exhaustive list of 656 saints-25 of whom are women-as well as documentation of the burial sites and legendary stories of the saints' lives as they have been told by their followers and worshippers in Israel.

But where does this assumption come from, and is it true? In Not in Front of the Children, Marjorie Heins explores the fascinating history of  indecency  laws and other restrictions aimed at protecting youth. From Plato s argument for rigid censorship, through Victorian laws aimed at repressing libidinous thoughts, to contemporary battles over sex education in public schools and violence in the media, Heins guides us through what became, and remains, an ideological minefield.

Unfortunately, such outbursts are becoming increasingly common. These dangerous actions -known as air rage - are by far the greatest threat to the safety and security of the 1.5 billion passengers who travel annually by air. Although the number of air-rage cases continues to rise, airlines, airports, and even governmental agencies consistently underreport the scope of the problem, thus exacerbating an already volatile situation.This intensively researched book by an anonymous veteran insider of the airline industry and an experienced investigative journalist provides reliable, detailed research never before reported. The book fully explores the fundamental causes of air rage: alcohol and illegal drug abuse, mental illness, overcrowded airplanes, the economic realities of the airline business, the failure to report air-rage incidents, and the lack of consequences for perpetrators. Each point is illustrated through recounting actual air-rage incidents that the authors have collected from interviews with flight crews and passengers and/or through their Web site at www.AirRage.org.Without being alarmist in tone, this important book will make readers aware of the scope and magnitude of the air-rage problem and what might be done to solve this emerging crisis in the skies.See also Andrew Thomas's Aviation Insecurity: The New Challenges of Air Travel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Vpw49vZKJGIC&dq=Air+Rage:+Crisis+in+the+Skies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Read Derrida (How to Read)","description":"'Deconstruction is not neutral.

And as a financial services marketing specialist for over 30 years, Lucian Camp has helped develop more new and innovative financial services propositions than anyone. Now they ve put their heads together to write No Small Change, a passionate, opinionated and practical manifesto arguing that the fast-changing financial services world urgently needs to rethink the whole of its approach to marketing. Most of all, they propose that an increasingly digital, fintech-driven industry needs not just more marketing, but also better marketing to make sure it s successfully identifying consumers  real needs, and finding powerful and successful ways to engage with them. After detailing the forces of change that demand a new approach, the book then examines in 13 chapters what the key components of that new approach should look like. It takes a broad and multi-faceted perspective, exploring areas as diverse as the crisis of consumer trust, the ever-growing power of Big Data, the importance of leadership and corporate culture and the rapid advance in thinking based on Behavioural Economics. In developing these themes, the authors don t pull their punches. The book is fiercely critical of some of the industry s long-established marketing habits, providing compelling reasons why it s time to abandon the practices that have given it a bad name. Marketers will applaud, but the book is also intended for a broader audience. Thomson and Camp challenge senior management in financial firms to appreciate the real value that marketers can bring to shaping the business agenda at the highest level, and not just to label marketing with that tired old phrase  the colouring-in department.  Rich in anecdotes, comments from leading industry figures, personal experiences on the part of both authors and findings from original research, No Small Change is an entertaining and rewarding read  and, at this point in the development of financial services, a timely and important one.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D99dDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Romantic Wedding Flowers: The Complete Guide to Selecting Beautiful Flowers for Your Wedding","description":"Includes wedding flower checklist, wedding plan at a glance, space for monthly planning notes, flower availability.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qcbNAAAACAAJ&dq=Romantic+Wedding+Flowers:+The+Complete+Guide+to+Selecting+Beautiful+Flowers+for+Your+Wedding&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JUMP UP AND SAY: A Collection of Black Storytelling","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Martial Art of Horary Astrology","description":"Horary is the astrological method for answering a specific question by examining a chart drawn for the moment of the question.

Introduction Rock Creek is located 25-east of Missoula, Montana off Interstate 90. Rock Creek headwaters originate from three-Mountain Ranges. The North Fork of Rock Creek and the West Fork of Rock Creek originate from the Sapphire Mountain Range. The East Fork of Rock Creek and the Middle Fork of Rock Creek originate from the Anaconda Mountain Range and the Anaconda  Pintler Wilderness Area. The Upper Willow Creek originates from the John Long Mountains. There are numerous small streams flowing into Rock Creek on its journey north to its confluence with the Clarkfork of the Columbia River. In the 1980 s Rock Creek contained roughly 2,000 Rainbow Trout per mile of stream in the lower 28-miles of Rock Creek; from Gillies Bridge downstream to the mouth of Rock Creek. In the 1990 s the Rainbow Trout population in Rock Creek plummeted to just 300 Rainbow Trout per mile of stream. This drastic decline in the Rainbow Trout population was caused by Whirling Disease and by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks decision to halt the stocking of Hatchery Rainbow Trout into the East Fork of Rock Creek Reservoir. To this day there has been no significant increase in the Rock Creek Rainbow Trout population. However, the Native Westslope Cutthroat Trout population in Rock Creek has rebounded somewhat to fill the void of lost Rainbow Trout population. Also the non-native Brown Trout population is on the increase. The Rock Creek fishery consists of native Westslope Cutthroat Trout up to 24-inches in length, native Bull Trout up to 36-inches in length, native Mountain Whitefish up to 24-inches in length, non-native Brown Trout up to 26-inches in length, non-native Rainbow Trout up to 24-inches in length and non-native Brook Trout up to 14-inches in length.

The sensory impairment of the children meant that they were unable to learn from traditional teaching methods as they were unaware of the world around them. Our very first awareness of our surroundings and ourselves come through our senses of smell, touch, taste, sight, hearing and movement, and without them we are isolated. To benefit from the normal school curriculum, children with sensory impairment must learn to develop each of their senses, individually and in combination - a process the non-handicapped child goes through spontaneously and unconsciously. This book outlines a curriculum for each of the senses in turn, using stimuli that can be varied to suit the age of the child or young person. Demonstrating how these can be combined to create a multisensory experience and how this newly developed awareness can be integrated into the rest of the school curriculum. This book was developed from the author's work with profoundly disabled children, their sensory impairment meant that traditional teaching was unsuccessful as they were unaware of the world around them. Flo Longhorn sets out a curriculum for developing each sense, both individually and in combination, using stimuli that can be varied according to the age of the child. This book shows how these techniques can be amalgamated to create multisensory experiences and how this new awareness can be integrated into the rest of the school curriculum.Designed for teachers, and parents, of children with profound multiple handicaps combined with sensory and physical impairment this has become a classic work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0SuGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Columbus","description":"Presents an easy-to-read biography of the sailor who never fully recognized the importance of his discovery which changed history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I7N7OsRGW18C&dq=Columbus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rabelais and His World","description":"This classic work by the Russian philosopher and literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin (18951975) examines popular humor and folk culture in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

In the Symbolist movement, a symbol is not an allegory. The Belgian writer Maurice Maeterlinck defined its essence in an article that appeared on April 24, 1887, in L Art moderne. He wrote that the notion of a symbol in the Symbolist movement is the opposite of the notion of the symbol in classical usage: instead of going from the abstract to the concrete (Venus, incarnated in the statue, represents love), it goes from the concrete to the abstract, from  what is seen, heard, felt, tasted, and sensed to the evocation of the idea.  This volume attempts to give a glimpse into the power of the Symbolist movement and the nature of its fundamental and interdisciplinary role in the evolution of art and literature of the twentieth century. It records the studies of a group of scholars, who met and discussed these topics together for the first time in 2009. While illuminating the specificity of Symbolism in art, architecture and literature in different European countries, these articles also demonstrate the crucial role of French Symbolism in the development of the international Symbolist movement. The authors hope that an expanding group, a society of Art, Literature and Music in Symbolism and Decadence (ALMSD), born out of the first meeting, will continue to further this discussion at future conferences and in the printed conference proceedings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7WwnBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intermediate Microeconomics: A Modern Approach","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2AxbtAEACAAJ&dq=Intermediate+Microeconomics:+A+Modern+Approach&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Promise and the Blessing: A Historical Survey of the Old and New Testaments","description":"The Bible is a collection of writings that together tell a unified story. But exactly how do all the pieces fit together? In a single volume, The Promise and the Blessing connects the dots of the Old and New Testament books to reveal the big picture of salvation history. Organized chronologically rather than canonically, this book traces the flow of Israel s history and shows how the New Testament proceeds out of the Old. It begins with God s creation of the cosmos and the initial problem of the fall of man. Then it traces God s solutions to that problem as he selects first one man, Abraham, then his line, and then the nation of Israel to provide the Messiah. Finally, it focuses on the Messiah himself and looks at how the gospel of Jesus was spread throughout the known world. The Promise and the Blessing is easy to use and ideal for anyone who wants to understand the grand narrative of the Bible. It features numerous beautiful, full-color photos, as well as sidebars and brief, fascinating  breakouts  of supplementary information. Maps, illustrations, summaries, and insightful notes help to illuminate the text. Field-tested in the classroom, The Promise and the Blessing is designed for Old and New Testament survey classes and will provide all readers of the Bible with a better understanding of how the drama that began in Eden winds through Israel s history to its fulfillment in Jesus Christ.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LeTK79FYM6QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rescuing Christine (Harlequin Temptation)","description":"HERO TO THE RESCUE Reporter Alec O'Brian didn't believe Christine McKinley's life was in danger until his story about her led to another life-threatening \\"accident.\\" It looked as if someone really wanted to hurt her.

A Welsh Benedictine monk living at Shrewsbury Abbey in western England, Brother Cadfael spends much of his time tending the herbs and vegetables in the garden but now there s a more pressing matter. Cadfael is to serve as translator for a group of monks heading to the town of Gwytherin in Wales. The team s goal is to collect the holy remains of Saint Winifred, which Prior Robert hopes will boost the abbey s reputation, as well as his own. But when the monks arrive in Gwytherin, the town is divided over the request. When the leading opponent to disturbing the grave is found shot dead with a mysterious arrow, some believe Saint Winifred herself delivered the deadly blow.

Before CSI and Law & Order, there was Brother Cadfael,  wily veteran of the Crusades  (Los Angeles Times).

And the king whose despotic power was felt over its entire extent was an old gray wolf. Old Lobo, or the king, as the Mexicans called him, was the gigantic leader of a remarkable pack of gray wolves, that had ravaged the Currumpaw Valley for a number of years. All the shepherds and ranchmen knew him well, and, wherever he appeared with his trusty band, terror reigned supreme among the cattle, and wrath and despair among their owners. Old Lobo was a giant among wolves, and was cunning and strong in proportion to his size. His voice at night was well-known and easily distinguished from that of any of his fellows. An ordinary wolf might howl half the night about the herdsman's bivouac without attracting more than a passing notice, but when the deep roar of the old king came booming down the canon, the watcher bestirred himself and prepared to learn in the morning that fresh and serious inroads had been made among the herds.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DigqAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Tales of Nikolai Gogol Vol. 2","description":"A collection of short stories portrays life in rural Russia and satirizes Russian society","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NcjuwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Tales+of+Nikolai+Gogol+Vol.+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Supreme Court Confronts Abortion: The Briefs, Argument, and Decision in Planned Parenthood V.

Along the way, Wolman meets fellow left-handers who share his sense of kinship and help him uncover the essence of Southpaw. There is sinister Diabolos Rex, follower of the Left Hand Path; left-handed handwriting analysts; and John Evans, an amputee whose left hand was reattached to his right arm. In Japan, Wolman tees off with the National Association of Left-Handed Golfers, and seeks wisdom from a left-handed baseball legend and a world renowned biologist.

Rider Haggard examining the repercussions of the violent altercations between European explorers and the native Aztecs. Written from the perspective of a colonialist Englishman in the form of a memoir, the story chronicles the race against time in the daring quest for revenge by the narrator Thomas and his companion, the Spanish cavalier, Juan. Murder, blood-lust, the Spanish Inquisition, the Aztecs, horrifying religious rituals and love closely follow Thomas on his labyrinthine path towards total retribution. Penned by none other than President Theodore Roosevelt's favourite author, 'Montezuma's Daughter' continues to rank among the most celebrated and emblematic examples of Haggard s literary prowess. A must read for those who loved Robert Louis Stevenson's 'Treasure Island' and who are prepared to read an adventure story that will splash it out of the water. If you are a fan of the Indiana Jones series, you'll be thrilled to find out that the Allan Quatermain series has exerted a direct influence on some of the daring action highlights throughout the franchise. Henry Rider Haggard (1856-1925) was an English adventure story writer, who is credited with the establishment of the \\"lost world\\" genre. Haggard wrote a bit on social and political issues as well, but he gained literary prominence with his famous novel 'King Solomon s Mines'. Some of his other most important works include 'She: A History of Adventure', 'The People of the Mist', and 'Montezuma s Daughter'.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RHNkEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"...

He leads the lay reader through the maze of resurrection texts in a readable, even entertaining way. He has mastered an amazing quantity of ancient sources and scholarly literature, and published many highly-technical works. But here he writes simply, clearly, convincingly, in a way any intelligent reader can understand. He does not dodge issues or obscure problems with pious talk, but presses forward to the logical outcome in a way that brings the reader along with him.-James M. Robinson, Professor of Religion Emeritus, Claremont Graduate University, Director of the Nag Hammadi Project of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity; Permanent Secretary of UNESCO''s International Committee for the Nag Hammadi CodicesLuedemann''s systematic analysis of both canonical and noncanonical texts coupled with his trenchant repudiation of fuzzy theological rhetoric challenges our understandings of both Christian origins and Christianity today. His answers will by no means find universal support, but his arguments deserve the attention of any interested in the often-uneasy relationship among fact, fiction, and faith.-A.-J. Levine, E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Professor of New Testament Studies, Vanderbilt University Divinity School and Graduate Department of ReligionAlthough the resurrection is the keystone dogma of Christian belief, and Sunday churchgoers rarely if ever think to question it, scholarly research shows with the utmost clarity that from a historical standpoint Jesus was not raised from the dead. In fact, it is almost universally recognized among scholars of New Testament textual criticism that the gospel narratives describing the resurrection appearances are not reliable eyewitness accounts, but expressions of faith written by the first Christian believers long after the death of Jesus.In this thorough exegesis of the primary texts dealing with the resurrection of Jesus, New Testament expert Gerd L demann (University of G?ttingen) presents compelling evidence that shows the resurrection was not a historical event and further argues that this development leaves little, if any, basis for Christian faith as presently defined.Beginning with Paul''s testimony in 1 Cor. 15: 3-8, in which the apostle declares that Jesus has been raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, L demann systematically evaluates every reference to Jesus'' resurrection in the New Testament, as well as apocryphal literature. He examines the purpose of the text writers, the ways in which they reworked tradition, and the historical value of each account. Through this approach, he offers a reconstruction of the probable course of events as well as the circumstances surrounding Jesus'' death on the cross, the burial of his body, his reported resurrection on the third day, and subsequent appearances to various disciples.Since the historical evidence leads to the firm conclusion that Jesus'' body was not raised from the dead, L demann argues that the origin of the Easter faith must be sought in the visionary experiences of Christianity''s two leading apostles. From a modern perspective this leads to the inescapable conclusion that both primary witnesses to Jesus'' resurrection, Peter and Paul, were victims of self-deception.In conclusion, he asks whether in light of the nonhistoricity of Jesus'' resurrection, thinking people today can legitimately and in good conscience still call themselves Christians.Gerd L demann is a professor of the history and literature of early Christianity at the University of G?ttingen, Germany. Professor L demann''s published conclusions about Christianity aroused great controversy in his native Germany, where the Confederation of Protestant Churches in Lower Saxony demanded his immediate dismissal from the theological faculty of his university.

Between 1900 and 1907, she infected twenty-two New Yorkers with typhoid fever through her puddings and cakes; one of them died. Tracked down through epidemiological detective work, she was finally apprehended as she hid behind a barricade of trashcans. To protect the public's health, authorities isolated her on Manhattan's North Brother Island, where she died some thirty years later. This book tells the remarkable story of Mary Mallon--the real Typhoid Mary. Combining social history with biography, historian Judith Leavitt re-creates early-twentieth-century New York City, a world of strict class divisions and prejudice against immigrants and women. Leavitt engages the reader with the excitement of the early days of microbiology and brings to life the conflicting perspectives of journalists, public health officials, the law, and Mary Mallon herself. Leavitt's readable account illuminates dilemmas that continue to haunt us. To what degree are we willing to sacrifice individual liberty to protect the public's health? How far should we go in the age of AIDS, drug-resistant tuberculosis, and other diseases? For anyone who is concerned about the threats and quandaries posed by new epidemics, Typhoid Mary is a vivid reminder of the human side of disease and disease control.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cgDHAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Awaken to the Healer Within","description":"A potpourri of revelations and insights, touching the heart, gently nudging us to remember who we are and why we are here.

But forty years ago, Americans were experiencing the beginnings of another era--of the fevered anti-communism that came to be known as McCarthyism. During this period, the Cincinnati Reds felt compelled to rename themselves briefly the \\"Redlegs\\" to avoid confusion with the other reds, and one citizen in Indiana campaigned to have The Adventures of Robin Hood removed from library shelves because the story's subversive message encouraged robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. These developments grew out of a far-reaching anxiety over communism that characterized the McCarthy Era. Richard Fried's Nightmare in Red offers a riveting and comprehensive account of this crucial time. He traces the second Red Scare's antecedents back to the 1930s, and presents an engaging narrative about the many different people who became involved in the drama of the anti-communist fervor, from the New Deal era and World War II, through the early years of the cold war, to the peak of McCarthyism, and beyond McCarthy's censure to the decline of the House Committee on Un-American Activities in the 1960s. Along the way, we meet the familiar figures of the period--Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, and Eisenhower, the young Richard Nixon, and, of course, the Wisconsin Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. But more importantly, Fried reveals the wholesale effect of McCarthyism on the lives of thousands of ordinary people, from teachers and lawyers to college students, factory workers, and janitors. Together with coverage of such famous incidents as the ordeal of the Hollywood Ten (which led to the entertainment world's notorious blacklist) and the Alger Hiss case, Fried also portrays a wealth of little-known but telling episodes involving victims and victimizers of anti-communist politics at the state and local levels. Providing the most complete history of the rise and fall of the phenomenon known as McCarthyism, Nightmare in Red shows that it involved far more than just Joe McCarthy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pVatMuvNTsoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fair Play","description":"A REESE'S BOOK CLUB PICK \\"A hands-on, real talk guide for navigating the hot-button issues that so many families struggle with.\\"--Reese Witherspoon Tired, stressed, and in need of more help from your partner? Imagine running your household (and life!) in a new way... It started with the Sh*t I Do List. Tired of being the \\"shefault\\" parent responsible for all aspects of her busy household, Eve Rodsky counted up all the unpaid, invisible work she was doing for her family -- and then sent that list to her husband, asking for things to change. His response was... underwhelming. Rodsky realized that simply identifying the issue of unequal labor on the home front wasn't enough: She needed a solution to this universal problem. Her sanity, identity, career, and marriage depended on it. The result is Fair Play: a time- and anxiety-saving system that offers couples a completely new way to divvy up chores and responsibilities. Rodsky interviewed more than five hundred men and women from all walks of life to figure out what the invisible work in a family actually entails and how to get it all done efficiently. With four easy-to-follow rules, 100 household tasks, and a series of conversation starters for you and your partner, Fair Play helps you prioritize what's important to your family and who should take the lead on every chore from laundry to homework to dinner. \\"Winning\\" this game means rebalancing your home life, reigniting your relationship with your significant other, and reclaiming your Unicorn Space -- as in, the time to develop the skills and passions that keep you interested and interesting.

With a focus on clarifying the history and development of archaeological theory, this valuable text serves as a roadmap to the different schools of theory in archaeology, clarifying the foundations of these schools of thought, the relationships between them, and the ideas that distinguish each from the other. Students will also learn about the relationship between archaeology and cultural and political developments, the origins of New and  post-processual  archaeology, and current issues shaping the field. Written in a clear and informal style and incorporating examples, cartoons, and dialogues, this text provides an ideal introduction for students at all levels. The revised third edition has been updated with new and revised chapters and an expanded glossary and bibliography, as well as new readings to guide further study. Engages readers with informal and easy-to-understand prose, as well as examples, cartoons, and informal dialogues Prepares students to understand complex topics and current and perennial issues in the field such as epistemology, agency, and materiality in the context of archaeological practice Discusses current developments in associated disciplines New and revised chapters on the material turn, politics and other issues, and an expanded glossary and bibliography with updated reading suggestions Offers expanded coverage of materiality, cultural-historical archaeology, evolutionary theory, and the work of scholars of diverse backgrounds and specializations Engaging and illuminating, Archaeological Theory is an indispensable resource for undergraduate and graduate students in archaeology and related disciplines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ymqKDwAAQBAJ&dq=Archaeological+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft Office XP Resource Kit","description":"Microsoft Office ranks among the most pedestrian of software suites--it's in a high percentage of the world's cubicles, for sure. But there's more to Microsoft's productivity suite than what the user sees, and Office XP adds, in the form of activation-based licensing, a whole new level of intrigue to what's always been a deployment and maintenance challenge. Microsoft Office XP Resource Kit shows how to manage Office XP effectively and efficiently, emphasizing the suite's capacity for centralized management. Like all members of the Microsoft Resource Kit series, this one includes a CD-ROM containing utility software and searchable documentation.Administrators will appreciate the coverage of best practices in this book. For example, the authors advise you to use a totally clean computer as a platform for creating an image of the Office installation you want to deploy network-wide, and warn you against starting applications on that machine so as to avoid creating any user-preferences settings. Information on Registry settings also is outstanding--readers will find documentation of keys and values here that doesn't appear in any other printed volume. The utility software's pretty cool, too: Supplementary file converters, an Outlook security configurer, and Answer Wizard Builder (a tool with which you can create help documents specific to your organization) are among the goodies. --David WallTopics covered: Microsoft Office XP, explained for the benefit of people who will be installing, upgrading, customizing, and managing it across an organizational network. Installation, user management, localization, and messaging are among the kit's areas of emphasis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PCQzpW968okC&dq=Microsoft+Office+XP+Resource+Kit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A New Look At Needlepoint: The Complete Guide to Canvas Embroidery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J-V8OQAACAAJ&dq=A+New+Look+At+Needlepoint:+The+Complete+Guide+to+Canvas+Embroidery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The same fate as the poor","description":"The Same Fate as the Poor is the inspiring account of the lives of three Maryknoll Sisters who made the \\"option for the poor\\" and paid the ultimate price. In December 1980, Ita Ford and Maura Clark were two of the four churchwomen ambushed and killed by National Guard troops in El Salvador. Only a few months before, Ita Ford's best friend, Carla Piette, was drowned in a flash flood. The loss of these three lives was made more devastating by media furor and political backlash that followed the December murders. This new edition of The Same Fate as the Poor celebrates the lives of these women.

It tracks the key players and follows the salient issues in this fin de si cle event. It discovers sharp contrasts between the different approaches by journalists from major countries as each tries to fulfill culturally framed expectations and needs of their media institutions. It provides unique insights into the particular concerns of competing national media teams, by comparing them against each other, against local coverage and the official record. The context of this study is the month long period in which Hong Kong's fate as a part of China is decided in a series of ritual events. It demonstrates the contrastive values of media organisations from different cultures and shows how news worthiness is constructed in relative terms according to the cultural imperatives of the media producer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gNuMtAEACAAJ&dq=Reporting+Hong+Kong:+Foreign+Media+and+the+Handover+(Consumasian+S.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Island to Oneself","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RKQKAQAAIAAJ&dq=An+Island+to+Oneself&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pronounce It Perfectly in English","description":"ESL students, TOEFL and TOEIC test takers, and all others for whom English is a second language and who want to improve their pronunciation will find this book and compact disc combination especially instructive.

He watched his family and neighborhood shattered by trauma, and he lost his faith. One night when he was seventeen, defending himself, he killed a man. He was sentenced to life in prison with no hope of parole. But what should have been the end of his story became the beginning. Behind bars, Wilson embarked on a remarkable journey of self-improvement--reading, working out, learning languages, even starting a business. At nineteen, he sat down and wrote a list of all the things he intended to accomplish, and all the steps he'd have to take to get there. He called it his Master Plan. He revised that plan regularly and followed it religiously. Sixteen years later, it led him to an unlikely opportunity--and to a promise he has been working hard to live up to every day since. Harrowing, heartbreaking, and ultimately triumphant, The Master Plan is a memoir for this moment, proving that every person is capable of doing great things.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3TDJDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Masterplan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old School Ties (Harlequin Romance, No 3184)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Pick your job - and land it!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s4vWAAAAMAAJ&dq=Pick+your+job+-+and+land+it!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"African-American Reflections on Brazil's Racial Paradise","description":"At the turn of the twentieth century, the popular image of Brazil was that of a tropical utopia for people of color, and it was looked upon as a beacon of hope by African Americans. Reports of this racial paradise were affirmed by notable black observers until the middle of this century, when the myth began to be challenged by North American blacks whose attitudes were influenced by the civil rights movement and burgeoning black militancy. The debate continued and the myth of the racial paradise was eventually rejected as black Americans began to see the contradictions of Brazilian society as well as the dangers for people of color. David Hellwig has assembled numerous observations of race relations in Brazil from the first decade of the century through the 1980s. Originally published in newspapers and magazines, the selected commentaries are written by a wide range of African-American scholars, journalists, and educators, and are addressed to a general audience.

This book provides a sampling of civil defense publications issued by government agencies and organizations during this era. Arranged thematically, the book includes sections covering the impact and power of the atomic bomb, radioactive fallout, women and the home, the importance of being prepared, civil defense in schools, fallout shelters, evacuation plans, and, finally, the call for  peace or ... else.

Although the plans for the conquest of Yugoslavia were developed in haste, the campaign was extremely successful: in a short space of time, both Yugoslavia and Greece had fallen, accompanied by the capture of large numbers of British, Australian and New Zealand troops. The 1941 Balkan campaign was an apparently brilliant military accomplishment that demonstrated once again the superiority of the Wehrmacht, and its cutting-edge campaigning skills. This superbly detailed work details the opposing forces that took part in this campaign, documents their weapons and analyzes the effectiveness of their tactics. It explores the initial Axis campaign against Yugoslavia, the breakthrough of the Metaxas Line and advance into Macedonia and the withdrawal of Allied troops south. Detailed battlescenes depict key moments in the land, sea and air battles that took place in the Balkans, vividly bringing to life events of almost 80 years ago.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mockEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Languages of Asia and the Pacific","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qZoUAQAAIAAJ&dq=Languages+of+Asia+and+the+Pacific&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good news for marriage","description":"You ve probably heard the grim facts: Half of all marriages end in divorce.The divorce rate inside the church is the same as outside.

Four women. One family heirloom. A secret connection that will change their lives and history as they know it. Present Day: Julia Baxter s wedding veil, bequeathed to her great-grandmother by a mysterious woman on a train in the 1930s, has passed through generations of her family as a symbol of a happy marriage. But on the morning of her wedding day, something tells her that even the veil s good luck isn t enough to make her marriage last forever. Overwhelmed and panicked, she escapes to the Virgin Islands to clear her head. Meanwhile, her grandmother Babs is also feeling shaken. Still grieving the death of her beloved husband, she decides to move out of the house they once shared and into a retirement community. Though she hopes it s a new beginning, she does not expect to run into an old flame, dredging up the same complicated emotions she felt a lifetime ago. 1914: Socialite Edith Vanderbilt is struggling to manage the luxurious Biltmore Estate after the untimely death of her cherished husband. With 250 rooms to oversee and an entire village dependent on her family to stay afloat, Edith is determined to uphold the Vanderbilt legacy and prepare her free-spirited daughter Cornelia to inherit it in spite of her family s deteriorating financial situation. But Cornelia has dreams of her own. Asheville, North Carolina has always been her safe haven away from the prying eyes of the press, but as she explores more of the rapidly changing world around her, she s torn between upholding tradition and pursuing the exciting future that lies beyond Biltmore s gilded gates.

It's comforting to imagine that superstars in their fields were just born better equipped than the rest of us. When a co-worker loses 20 pounds, or a friend runs a marathon while completing a huge project at work, we assume they have more grit, more willpower, more innate talent, and above all, more motivation to see their goals through. But that's not at actually true, as popular Inc.com columnist Jeff Haden proves. \\"Motivation\\" as we know it is a myth. Motivation isn't the special sauce that we require at the beginning of any major change. In fact, motivation is a result of process, not a cause. Understanding this will change the way you approach any obstacle or big goal. Haden shows us how to reframe our thinking about the relationship of motivation to success. He meets us at our level--at the beginning of any big goal we have for our lives, a little anxious and unsure about our way forward, a little burned by self help books and strategies that have failed us in the past and offers practical advice that anyone can use to stop stalling and start working on those dreams. Haden takes the mystery out of accomplishment, proving that success isn't about spiritual awakening or a lightning bolt of inspiration --as Tony Robbins and adherents of The Secret believe--but instead, about clear and repeatable processes. Using his own advice, Haden has consistently drawn 2 million readers a month to his posts, completed a 107-mile long mountain bike race, and lost 10 pounds in a month. Success isn't for the uniquely-qualified; it's possible for any person who understands the true nature of motivation. Jeff Haden can help you transcend average and make lasting positive change in your life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GA2jDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joe Louis, My Champion","description":"It's the spring of 1937, and anticipation for the heavyweight title fight between Joe Louis and James Braddock is at a fever pitch.
