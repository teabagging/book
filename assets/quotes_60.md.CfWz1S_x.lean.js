I should have known after attempting to read Tuesday with Morrie and not finishing it twice. It is a quick read though for those of you that like to accomplish something in a day."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"What a waste of an evening. This book can be judged on several levels - all of them bad. It is poorly written, philosophically shallow, theologically trite, and only mildly amuseing. Mercifully, I got through it quickly. I would give it 0 stars if the option were available."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A friend gave me this book as a gift and several people recommended I read it seeing that they thought it was the best book they have ever read. I guess it does have some appeal if you are looking for a fuzzy feel-good read on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but if you are looking for depth, do look elsewhere. The organization of the story, going back and forth between the main protagonist's experiences in &quot;heaven&quot; and episodic flashbacks to his life before death would make for an interesting read, had the &quot;lessons&quot; that are - apparently - to be learnt in heaven not already been trodden out by other new-agey novels of questionable value or daytime shows on Lifetime. Derivative and tedious."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Never have I written a book review. I am a fan of Mitch's written work and his appearances on television. He seems genuine and draws from his experiences that enrich the sencerity of his material. This book however is in a word ridiculous. Some of the imagery that he used is borrowed from other material. The war sequence in the book reads like a very bad version of Acopcalypse Now or Platoon. The imagery of Heaven he uses is borrowed from the Robin William's misadventure, What Dreams May Come. It would be nice if an author derives his inspiration from other sources than the clearance aisle at Blockbuster. His characters are as matured and developed as a tadpole that has just been hatched. Additionally,his drunk Irish sterotyped character was really compelling. Way to push the envelope using a broken down sterotype that won't offend. The deepest insight into life offered by this book is that that sacrifice to others is necessary to live a full life. Albom, Socrates, Plato Aristotle, they all belong in the same breath. I think that Mitch was probably surprised by the amount of money that can be made by his excellent book Tuesdays with Morrie and decided to float this nonsensical half baked pseudo philosphoical book to the general population and push his retirement up another five years. Go back to covering hoops."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch was brave to write this book. I'm so glad that he did. He's given us a glimpse of what our arrival in heaven might be like and he's invoking such strong reactions from readers...love it...hate it. Interesting that most of the reviews reveal more about the reviewer than the writing itself. Reading this book challenges you to look at life from a different vantage point. Maybe some people just don't like the view. I will remember the five simple truths this book describes and I'll be happier each time I can realize one in my life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'll come out and be honest here, I didn't like the book. Not at all. I read it because it was left behind on a bookshelf of an apartment I was renting. I wouldn't have bought it for myself unless it was in a discount bin. (Which incidentally, was where the previous owner bought this copy from.)First of all a practical issue about the book: if you meet 5 people in heaven who give you information about the meaning of your life, before you can move on to the next stage of the afterlife, in order to balance up the numbers, you'd have to give your story to 5 more people. Not one, which the book implies. There'd be a huge imbalance in the numbers. But that's just a little niggling thing before I get to the meat of why I think this book is a pile of meaningless dribble.So, it's a pile of Western, feel good, white, middle class, Christian dribble. It gives you the message to put up with the problems in your life because that's what God wants of you. It's all about building character and so on. Your role in life is to sit down, be quiet and take what's given to you. For the main character, Eddie, that might be appropriate. But I think that's where a lot of people miss the message of this book. It's the 5 people that Eddie meets that are appropriate for him. And the message they give him, is just that, it's for him. Not you. Not me. Like the Chicken Soup for the Soul books (also dribble), you might read it and have 5 minutes of warm fuzzy feelings to make you feel better. But once it fades, you've still got bills to pay, children to feed and a stressful job to go to. There's no point waiting until Heaven to see if it was all worth it. If you have problems now, then deal with them now. Don't think it's all just a test from God and that's your place in the world. The meaning of life is what you make of it now. Not later. Go read something else. I suggest Mark Rowlands' The Philosopher at the End of the Universe."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is about a character Eddie, who worked as a maintenance worker in an amusement park, most of his life. He died while saving a girl and he has to meet five people in haven so that he could understand the purpose of his life. By meet the five people, he learned about important lesson on life.First lesson: All lives are interconnected directly or indirectly. The Blue Man, a man from circus, died in a car accident in order to avoid hitting young Eddie. The Blue Man who do not know Eddie, died so that Eddie could live.Second lesson: During the World War II, Eddie was shot in the leg that crippled him for his life. He was shot by his captain in order to prevent him from jumping into a burning hut. Eventually, his captain scarified his life so that his men, including Eddie, were saved. No life is wasted. The captain's life was used in return for his men's lives.Third lesson: We should forgive the past. We hurt ourselves more when we kept our anger.Fourth lesson: Life has to end but love doesn't. Although Eddie's wife died earlier, she told Eddie that her love doesn't end.Fifth lesson: The work Eddie has done seems meaningless, but he doesn't realize that through the mundane job of maintaining the equipment at the amusement park, he kept countless children visiting the park save from accident.Conclusion:All lives are interconnected. One person exists for another person and this person may exist for another one and so on. Everyone exists for someone. Everyone had its purpose here even though the things we do seems trivial.Note: This book is not as good as \\"Tuesday with Morrie\\", but the key message from this book is meaningful. I would not read it again since I have extracted the key messages."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I very much enjoyed this book as a read during vacation. It brought about thoughts about afterlife and how living every day affects the future--even when we don't know it. It allowed me to read, feel, and think."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is the best read ever. Its not only easy but it kept my attention the whole time it took me less than four hours to read on a break at school. Once i started i couldnt put it down."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book as a recommendation. No fancy advertisements, no pressure from book of the month clubs. Just a friendly recommendation of a story that someone thought I might enjoy. I thank that person for doing so.Eddie is a 83-year-old maintenance man that most would probably never see in our world these days. The type that is too unimportant to get rid of. But, as his death quickly overtakes him, we are shown how this forgotten old man was such a grand figure. It makes one think about people that they see everyday without really knowing anything about them.Anyway, we are then told how Eddie was and something about his life as it changes from birthday to birthday. Finally, we follow Eddie into heaven where five instrumental figures from his moral life appear. He is ultimately surprised at the influence he had on each of these people as they demonstrate the true value he had in their lives.When you finish this book you will find that the old maintenance man from Ruby Pier was much more than he ever gave himself credit and it makes you reflect on how all of our lives our interconnected with each other somehow. The next time you wish someone a \\"Good morning\\" or a simple \\"How are you?\\" remember that your action may have more impact than you can ever imagine. Just ask Eddie."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"First, I have to confess, this book made me cry. The main character's story is sad, and it touched my heart for unrepentant, unrealized lives of &quot;quiet desperation,&quot; those to whom many Christians never reach out. That alone should be worth the read. And unlike other reviewers, I took the &quot;Aesop's fable&quot; style to be a literary device, rather than poor writing.It also paralleled some of my own family relationships, and surely those of many others, so it also had great personal meaning for me -- as it likely will for you.The key themes are:1. Interconnected lives.2. Unrecognized value/potential.3. Human forgiveness.Point 3 is _wonderfully_ illustrated. In fact, all of the five people teach the main character about either sacrifice or forgiveness, sometimes simultaneously.I did have some problems with the implicit theology in spots: &quot;heaven is for explaining your life [to you];&quot; heaven is what you make it; an unrepentant, unrealized life of quiet service to others will get you into heaven; another human soul can elevate you to heaven. It has to be read thoughtfully, with scripture in hand, to guard against a &quot;saved by works/saved regardless&quot; takeaway.Overall, the core themes are meaningful and beautifully illustrated, if taken carefully in a Christian context. The idea that every person is worth your compassion, whether saved or sinner, is a very important lesson all Christians should internalize."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This little book by Mitch Albom, that takes only a couple hours to read will change your life.For anyone who ever wondered why they were here, what their lifes meaning was and how their life might have affected others, be prepared to understand a little better and a little clearer what your life means. You will walk around for days thinking about who the 5 people you might meet in heaven would be.It is beautifully written, without being mushy or preachy and the lessons learned here are at times quite profound. I can see where this book could very well become an instant classic, not in the sense of what we may consider the greatest literature, but instead for its truth, its meaning and its images. I beleive Mr. Albom will change lifes with this book and for that he should feel quite proud. I wouldn't mind one bit if he was one of the 5 people I met in heaven for having so affected my life with this fable he has written. Bravo!!!! . Don't miss this book, it may not affect everyone , but it will certainly touch the hearts of many readers."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'm truly surprised that so many customers have given this book negative reviews. I felt it was completely wonderful. 83 year old Eddie is a character that I adored from the first page, and I found his journey through heaven heart-warming and insightful. It's a short book, and can be read in the time it takes to watch a film; I can think of few films as worthy as your time as this little book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Bad writing and worse thinking. Sentimental, insipid, insulting, cliched. So the point of heaven is to make you feel good about yourself? Like, that's the important thing, that Eddie have strong self-esteem? What about God? What about the soul? What about other people? Nope, this is a book where Eddie dies and goes to heaven for a New Age pep talk.

This book is more like the second or third draft of a possibly good book, both in substance and style. I was disappointed because I felt that it could have been so much better.

I just finished it in less than 2 days and I must say, I have no idea what all the fuss was about. I was unimpressed, bored, not at all moved, and I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know.

His exploration of the effect we have on others in this life is wonderfully written."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book The Five People You Meet in Heaven, by Mitch Albom, is an interesting book. It is about one old mans journey through heaven and the five people he meets there. The main character is an old man named Eddie who is the maintenance worker at Ruby Pier. In the book, I like how Mitch Albom sets up the scenes. He describes them fully, giving you a good sense of what's going on. The way he describes how Eddie was feeling during the time in heaven. When he visited the first person he met in heaven. He described Eddie as feeling young and free of concern. Mitch Albom's description of the events that took place in Eddie's life was so vivid; you could almost imagine yourself there with him at his 5th birthday party or his 35th birthday. His description of the story of the days when Eddie was in the War and when Eddie met his wife and the feelings he had for her was very good in detail and depth. The way the author showed Eddie's life from his point of view showed helped me get more into the book than just to tell it from him as an authors point of view. I think The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom is a very good book and I would recomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's \\"Five People\\" paints a wonderful story of the average man's death, and I can only hope that it is true. I can only hope that I am welcomed into Heaven by five people who's lives I somehow changed for the better.

A great read for teens and adults alike, it's a wonderful inspiring story that should be REQUIRED reading for all spiritual people."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Is about an older man named Eddie who thought his life was worthless. On day he died trying to save a girl from getting crush by a roller coaster. What he didnt realize is his life didnt end, it only has just begun.When Eddie reached heaven he met five people that ment or made a difference in his life. What made me enjoy this book so much is how those five people all made a connection in his life. Like the blue man tought him how to juggle which help him escape from prison in war. This story made me realize how everything you do helpful in life makes a difference. Also it shows how people affect our lives in so many different ways and we don't even know it at that moment in time. Then when you get older things start to fall into place like a a Jigg saw puzzle. It makes me realize that our life here on earth has a purpose. Though we may not know it, but in time we realize that we have helped many people which may make a difference in your next life. Also this had similarities with a Christmas moive i watched called \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\". I like this book also cause of the ending, which tied everything together. This book kept me intrested and always wanted me to read more. I thought this book was a good story and I would advise other people to read it. if you have not already."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book really makes you think. Not just about \\"life\\" but about the people in your life. If you allow it too, this book can really change how you live. For example, one vital lesson: Anger is poison, Holding a grudge only harms yourself. Like the other morals of this book, this one presents a simple moral through a STRONG story line.. i mean a story line that will give you a chill down your spine and make you seriously want to apply the message to your life. After reading the book in everyday circumstances i think to myself, \\"how can i treat people better?... who are the people that i might be over-looking that really do a lot in my life?... what small things can i do to make my life more meaningful?...

It was about an 83 year old man named Eddie who works as a maintenance person at a carnival. When he dies on his 83rd birthday in a tragic accident trying to save a young girl from a falling cart, he meets five people in heaven who he has met once before in his lifetime. They help him figure out things about his life.My favorite part of this story was when Eddie saw the kids in the cart stuck up in the air. He gives his friend his walking cane and climbs up there to save them. I thought that it was amazing how he was strong enough to give up his cane and walk on his bad leg to go save the kids that were stuck on the ride.As this story builds to an excellent conclusion Eddie tries to figure out if on the day he died what he did was a heroic success or a devastating failure. When he finds out from the one person that he thought he would never see it is as inspirational as a glimpse of heaven itself. This book has changed the way I look at heaven and will change yours too. It will actually teach you that heaven is what your life is about. It will change everything you have ever thought about heaven and the afterlife and the meanings of our lives here on earth.I recommend that you read this very great story because once you start you may never want to stop till the end."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" by Mitch Albom, is a sweer, entertaining story. It's an amazing book to read.I like this book very much. I loved everything about this book. The story is very understanding, sweet and loving.

On his 83rd birthday, he died trying to save a girl who was standing under a ride that fell. When he went to heaven, he met five people who were an impact in his life.Once you read this book, you will be touched by this man's life and who he meets in heaven. The ending of this book it one of the most touching parts of the book. This book will put you in tears. There are surprises in this book you will enjoy.Compared to every book i've read, \\" The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is by far the best one. No book can be the same as this one. This book is very unique and not like most books. It's a one of a kind and i'm positive you will love it.This book shows you should enjoy life to the fullest. There will be people in you life who will be important to you and have an impact on your life. For example, in the book Eddie didnt ever cross his mind that he would meet 5 people who he didnt realize were an importance to him.This book was enjoyable and realistic.

I would truly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is not the most \\"intellectual\\" or \\"literary\\" sample you can find on the shelf, but why do you choose a book to read? If you choose a book just so you look smart and highly intellectual, not caring about the actual content on the pages, then go ahead and buy your intellectual literary gem. If you are like most people, however, you want a book that you will find pleasure in while you read it and one that may make you think about your own life. This is a true success of \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\". The story is compelling, it moves quickly, it touches you on a human level, and it forces you to think about your own life and your own conception of Heaven. To be honest, there are a couple elements of Albom's Heaven that do not appeal to me, but I appreciate the book's power to make me ask these questions. I am incredibly picky when it comes to books and the majority of those I begin to read do not get finished. I finished this book in one weekend, however, because it kept me locked in full time. I strongly recommend this title to anyone who wants a book that will entertain and/or inspire emotional thinking."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If you're looking for a quick feel-good book, this is it. Without a doubt, this book will keep you entertained. If you try to compare it against typical Christian theology, you will be disappointed. It is not theologically sound that way. Example - the main character swears in Heaven a few times. I'm pretty sure that would not happen. But, none the less, the book is compelling and entertaining. At times it is touching, as well.The main character is Eddie. He is in his 80's, it is his birthday, and, of course, he dies. Eddie doesn't feel like his life was worth anything. He doesn't feel like he accomplished anything or used his full potential. He meets five people in Heaven that show him otherwise.Good weekend read.

Mitch Albom is amazing, read the column, listen to the show. some of this things he says are really profound. the writing is not poor at all, I was amazed at the brilliance of it actually. this is a GOOD book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really enjoy Mitch Albom's first foray into popular literature, TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE. That book was kind of sentimental, but it was fairly well written and was from the heart. It was also a true story. I liked that book and it displayed that Albom was a writer with promise of becoming a strong literary voice on the pop literature scene.However, when his next pop novel, THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN, was released, I hesitated in reading it. It wasn't until one of my best friends bought the book for me that I finally read it.The plot is pretty straight forward. Eddie, an octogenarian, has worked at a small amusement park most of his life. From outward appearances, it seems that Eddie hasn't had a very exciting life. There doesn't seem to be anything outstanding in Eddie's life. Then, on Eddie's 83rd birthday, he does something extraordinary: he risks his life at the amusement park saving a little girl from being crushed by some falling equipment from the sky. When Eddie gains conscience, he finds himself in Heaven, except Heaven looks a lot like Ruby Pier, the amusement park Eddie worked at most of his life. But things become strange when Eddie meets a figure from his past, the Blue Man. It is the first of five people Eddie is to meet in Heaven. Each of the people changed Eddie's life in some way and they come to him one by one to show him that his life was more wonderful than he ever imagined.I can't fault the overall message of the book. Each life is important and every person is special and unique, even if we sometimes think our lives our boring and mundane. It's good to remind people of that.However, we can remind people of that without reverting to over-sentimental mush. Even ignoring the clich&eacute;s, emotional manipulation, and the fuzzy secular humanist view of the afterlife, THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN reads more like a story written by a high school student for the creative writing teacher that he has the hots for or the treatment for a sappy 1980s teen-movie instead of the novel from the same guy who wrote TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE. The plot doesn't even make that great of a story. Eddie dies, he goes to Heaven (but it appears more like Purgatory), and he meets five people there (the book title says it all--it's the literary equivalent of SNAKES ON A PLANE). That's about it. Not much happens and for a story that's intended to remind people of the significance of life and living, THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN doesn't do a very good job. The book has a positive message, but the execution is awful. Feeding the masses drivel like this isn't going to help anyone and is more a disservice to society than anything else."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I don't know if it what is called the &quot;sophomore jinx&quot; in the publishing industry is the problem here, or if Albom is a &quot;one hit wonder&quot;, but this book is truly awful. The writing is dull, forced, unimaginative. That is all too bad because I like the premise of the book, and the best thing I can say about it is that the cover synopsis does a good selling job. So much for truth in advertising."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This author is prolific in dispensing twee contrived silly tales - jam brimming with home spun chicken soup for the soul scenarios. Heart warming junk which a lot of poor souls are inspired and uplifted by.And this book does not let the formula down in fact it gets incredibly ambitious and tackles the thorny subject of why things happen in our lives. It tries to explain everything - in a neat, packaged and soupy kind of way.We have this chap who dies and in heaven meets 5 wandering souls who are brought in to explain events to him - from his life. But the reasons they give are hardly enlightening and not really worth their effort - much better had they stayed floating on the clouds and plucking their harps. Wisdom dispensed they then toddle off back to whence they came.The book made me feel a bit depressed if truth be told and it was all a little spooky.I didnt enjoy it - it taught me nothing - and was boring. But it did make me laugh out-loud - not out of the delight of revelatory insight but out of the sheer banality of it all. To think there is this old codger gaining vacuous insights into his life at this late stage was a bit of a giggle.If the author wishes to dispense wisdom then he needs to try harder because there was little of substance in these shallow witterings. To think that this book deals with issues that philosophers have struggled with for centuries makes me cringe because he comes up with nothing worth remembering. His message is \\"it all happens for a reason\\" - but fails to tell us what that reason is. Apart from saying that X happens because of Z - he fails to give the fuller picture.It really is junk.

Or did I accidently turn off a light, and the person after me, fall and brake his neck?This book had me thinking about my life, which is a very good thing to do!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'm not a religious person, but I had heard much about this book so I decided to give it a go. It was a WONDERFUL book. My Mom read it as well and also loved it. The movie wasn'tas good, but it did stick with the story. It gives a newinsite into what everyone thinks that Heaven is all about &for that alone you should read it. It shows how your actions effect people... How even the little things, strangers thatyou meet, and people that you don't even know, play and important part in your life, and vice-versa."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" and enjoyed it. I couldn't wait to get \\"5 people...\\" I read it in a few days. I thought it was very enjoyable. It wasn't filled with action or adventure but a laid back approach to life after death. There were severeal spots that jerked a few tears. (I'm a softy anyways!) I would like to think that there is a reason for everything in our lives (and death for that matter). Good story. I would definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I like this book very much. It tells the story of how all of our lives are so very much interconnected. It is excellent storytelling about the life of 83 year old Eddie, the main character of the story. Eddie learns after his death about the impact his life had on others and vice versa.This storytelling is very moving because it vividly brings home how all humans are interconnected in this world and the tremendous power that each of us has to impact the lives of others. At a time when many people feel powerless when surrounded by major world issues, it is so good to be reminded of the fact that each of us can make a difference in a big way in some of the lives around us."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I received this book as an early Christmas gift and I am truly thankful for the person who gave it to me. It is a real eye opener, showing you that people you have never even met may have had a profound effect on your life, as well as your death. A truly innovative style of writing!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is the story of 83-year-old \\"Eddie Maintenance\\", his tragic death, and the events that follow right afterwards. Before his death, which happens at the beginning of the story, you get a brief glimpse of his life and personality. After his death, Eddie is taken to heaven where he meets five people. From each of these three people he learns what type of impact he had on their lives, and visa versa, and a lesson is learned to help him to more understand his life and find meaning \\"in it all\\". In most of these lives, he finds he has had an impact more than he had imagined.This type of story can easily become preachy... but I never thought that it had. While I didn't really find much insight (there was a little) from this story, I would imagine that there are people out there that could learn something of their own lives from this story. I can imagine why many people would feel touched reading a story such as this. However, to cover all the bases, more than five people would need to be met and then this book would become rather repetitive, long, boring, and preachy. Five people was a good way to hit many of the bases and keep the story interesting.Despite the search for some self-realization, this is actually an excellent story. I love character stories, and you find a fantastic character while exploring the life of Eddie. He is easy to identify with and like. The depiction of Heaven is imaginative and interesting.Recommended, sure!! You might find things in here that I didn't, and plus, it is a great story."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Very touching and absorbing. Moving. I just can barely describe it. I was sucked in. I underlined parts that had deep meaning for me. The way he writes is NOT the way he talks on the radio... LOL His writing is lyrical and fluid and the rhythm is perfect. I didn't like Tuesdays With Morrie much, but this one is totally different. The guy is deeper than he appears on the radio waves, and this book will stick with me forever."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom has again provided the reader with a thought provoking book which is easy to read and eminently memorable. The story of Eddie's experiences, both on this Earth and in the life beyond, capture the reader's attention from beginning to end. The story of Eddie, and of the lessons he learns, is both entertaining and inspirational.A must read!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is the story of one man's journey in the afterlife. He examines his own life through five people who have been there at different points. This is a story that makes you think about how many blessings you have in your life. It makes you question, if you died tomorrow, would you have been happy with your life? A very heart warming story that made me think that dying isn't so scary after all."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was an interesting interpretation of the afterlife and the meanings behind our everyday actions. Although it was a shorter story than I anticipated it got the point across. Do not take anything in life for granted."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought the book was very good. You had to pause and think about your life. The people you encounter through out your life. And only hope is that you can do the best you possible can. It's always hard to know the right thing to do to help and not hurt people. Appreciate the life you have no matter how small, we all contribute something."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"How did I die?\\" The book, The Five People You Meet In Heaven, by Mitch Albom, is about a man named Eddie and his journey through heaven. Eddie died in an amusement park accident trying to save a girl. When he first reaches heaven, a man with blue skin tells him that he will meet five people who will explain how they changed his life. The main characters in the book are Eddie and the five people he meets in heaven, which are the Blue Man, the Captain, Ruby, Marguerite, and Tala. The settings are Ruby Pier, the Philippians, the mountains, weddings, and the ocean. This book is fictional and the theme is heaven. It is also a quick read, because it is very suspenseful. I never wanted to stop reading. In this book, heaven is a questionable and controversial topic. This book is a good read, because of the wonderful story and great writing style. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is a good book with a great ending that touched my heart. Anyone who reads this book will definitely think about their life in a whole new way."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"While the language in this book is never complex and a Ph.d is definitely not needed to understand the meaning of the book, it is filled with heartwarming stories about a man's life and how his choices in life affected others' lives as well. The story is really sweet and is still one of my favorites, maybe even partially because of its simplicity. It's a classic Mitch Albom novel and one of the few really sentimental novels that I can actually stand."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"An easy and interesting read that I thought would have a bigger ending. The message was a good one but I expected a new spin on it. I would recommend it for someone who has not been exposed to the spiritual side of the meaning life but anyone who has read other books of this kind, I would say to take a pass."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As I was reading \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\", I didn't expect the ending to make me cry. But, here I am, rolling toilet paper (since I am out of Kleenexes) off a roll, sniffling and blowing my nose.Eddie is the maintenance man at the Ruby Pier Amusement Park. He's spent nearly his whole life making sure the park rides are safe for children and adults. Yet, he feels he's accomplished nothing with his life. In fact, his life is painfully ordinary and I, as the reader, can relate all too well. Each day to Eddie is the same old same old until one day he wakes up and can't tell Tuesday from Thursday. Ugh! I think this happened to me last week!On the last day of his life, he's killed by a falling cart while trying to save a little girl from being crushed beneath it. When he awakens from death, he meets with five people whose lives he touched, no matter how fleeting, on earth. This is supposed to help him make sense of his life. It does, but what he learns is painful, even though you knew it had to happen that way in order for Eddie's life to make sense.Throughout the book I kept hoping my heaven wouldn't be like that, because Eddie had to relive some of the most painful moments of his life, and I didn't always feel the lessons learned were worth it.Initially, I didn't care for Mr. Albom's version of heaven. His is facing people from your life who in some way sacrificed something for you, bringing about feelings of guilt. Eddie didn't understand, and neither did I - at first.My version of heaven is sunshine, blue skies, white cotton clothes, tables and tables laden with food, mostly fruit, especially grapes, and walking in a beautiful garden of roses, daisies, and lilacs with those I loved the most on earth. It's a place where I'm happy, well fed, and loved. But this is my version of heaven, not necessarily the version of the person sitting next to me.What you learn in the end will surprise you as much as it does Eddie, and you'll suddenly understand that Eddie's life was more than ordinary, it was extraordinary. The people he met with, and the things he relived with them, and the lessons he took away with him suddenly make more sense than ever. I wouldn't mind this short stop on my way to blue skies and grapes, after all.The whole novel is great, but the ending is what makes \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" an amazing read, right up there with the classics."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Not a bad book, if you can get past the formula that the author is using that guarantees a made for TV movie deal."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It's a refreshing story. It opens my mind about other possibilities to be faced after death."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's \\"the five people you meet in heaven\\" is a delightful and interesting fictional piece for leisure reading. The story begins with the death of Eddie, a maintenance worker at Ruby Pier Amusement park somewhere by a \\"great gray ocean\\" and continues with Eddie's own personal journey through heaven.As for some of the comments I have seen pertaining to this work, such as \\"gutsy,\\" \\"deep,\\" \\"profound,\\" or \\"a teaching about life\\" a can't say as if I found it to meet any of those descriptions. Instead, I found it to be a relatively short, delightful fictional tale that allowed me to escape into a place where imagination sprinkled with reality can offer escape from the daily routine.Hopefully, some day, Mitch Albom will read this review and answer my question, \\"Why only five?\\""},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom once again focuses us on basic truths of life. He does it in a delightful way, telling a story of a man who thinks his life has been a waste and finds out there is much more to life than fulfilling grand goals.This book will move and delight the reader. It also will give one insights into how the normal everyday life we lead is packed with meaning."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"What a wonderful perspective on Heaven! The book takes you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions (pun intended). The story brought me back to the days of my childhood. I could almost smell the smells, and taste the tastes. The writing is masterful, and the end left me with a tear in my eye!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a very powerful book. Each chapter makes you think and think so much about your own life and the coincidences that weave through each encounter. When the character Eddie meets the five people in heaven, suddenly the reasons for all these encounters in an otherwise meaningless life unfold showing us that in every case, each life has such incredible meaning. Deepak Chopra's book Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire is essentially a sequal to this book or perhaps even a prequal because it explains those encounters on earth from the perspective of some one who already understands these incredible meanings. This is an important book and stops just short of preaching to make it thoroughly enjoyable and memorable."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Sorry, nine million satisfied readers, but in my opinion, this book is absolute junk. The opening section of the novel, in which Albom describes Eddie's last day on earth, is beautifully told and rings absolutely true. But when Eddie dies and is taken to heaven, the book turns deadly. Is there anyone on this earth who does not already know that his life has been changed by other people in ways he cannot begin to know? But this is the great revelation of The Five People You Meet in Heaven. If you are the kind of person who will be astonished to learn that your life was spared, sometimes deliberately, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes accidentally, by someone who did something you never suspected--for instance (and believe me, this is melodrama of the lowest order)by someone who kept you alive shooting you in the leg--then this book will be a revelation to you. If you believe that certain events in your life which were always inexplicable can somehow have their motives made clear to you and that these clarifications will shine a great light and in turn reconcile you to life's tragedies, bringing you to a kind of heaven of the mind--and in this book, it takes people already dead and in heaven to do it--then you will be greatly comforted. I found the entire book preposterous, sentimental and as deep as a sheet of paper. Everyone in this book is so busy saving everyone else that it astonishing that anyone ever has to suffer. Five Days is formulaic in the extreme, a kind of dime store version of Thornton Wilder The Bride of San Luis Rey (an infinitely better book). Nice to know, though, that Eddie occasionally did something wrong; he's responsible for one of his wife's great tragedies. Cliched, sentimental and downright silly--I can't understand what the fuss is about, but then I keep wanting a book to add something to what I already know."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is a sorry regurgitation of Tuesdays with Morrie. The author tries to turn the wisdom of Tuesdays with Morrie into fiction a fails miserably. In order to enjoy this book you have to be willing to accept that unrelated events in peoples lives somehow tie together when they do not. It is also the most predictable book I've ever read. Skip it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"that an author like Albom gets published? If you just loooved Tuesdays with Morrie, you will probably just loove this one too. Both books were gifts to me, and I found them void of originality, thought or anything remotely approaching profundity.Saffire's &quot;First Dissident&quot; is a great book in which he extracts original thought provoking concepts from a profound subject.Albom's uncle must be his publisher! In his books, he takes a profound subject and extracts old tired concepts with all the thought of a vain empty headed teenager."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"That one person would probably be Mitch Albom. You would be forced to read populist garbage like this offering for all eternity. Please stop the insanity! This smarmy cheesemiester is making a fortune off suckers. Even Mitch must know it is awful drivel. This is modern day snake oil. A placebo to cure your guilt without ever having to change your behavior delivered in a simplistic manner. Humanistic pre-fab religion for those who do not really believe there is a God. \\"I'm OK, you're OK\\" silliness from someone who in the past has published outright lies in his Detroit Free Press column. He couldn't even make it to a basketball game he was supposed to cover for his paper. But that didn't stop Albom from writing a human interest piece of fluff about former players attending the \\"Big Game\\". Geez, what a twit. Now there is a bastion of morality and wisdom for the masses to follow. Again, I read this book at a library so I could, unlike Albom, actually be speaking about something I experienced. Please let my mistake keep you from the same."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a book that reinforced my Christian faith, although Mitch Albom's approach to spirituality and Heaven is somewhat different from mine. What does ring home is his theme that man needs to make a difference in the world while we are here, and there is something beyond Earthly life to ground us in acts of goodness.We reap what we sow. If we reach out and give, of ourselves, our possesions, our talents, then we will be rewarded in some manner, whether in life or beyond. If we are selfish and immoral, we may pay for this later. We do not always see how it works, which is part of the mystery that Mitch exemplifies in this work. Bad things happen to good peopole, and more remarkably, very good things happen to very bad people. Why? This is a spiritual question to be pondered and not answered on Earth. It will be made known to us in the after-life. Sacrifice in this life, happiness in the next, perhaps?Anyway, Mitch is a terrific writer who has the touch for reaching out and touching people's hearts, an ability I only wish I had.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;..."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'm convinced...readers don't know a good book anymore.

The book's genre is philosophical fiction. The Five People You Meet in Heaven has sold over eleven million copies in thirty-eight territories and over thirty-five languages; it is the best selling adult hardcover novel ever. It has been adapted into a movie starring Jon Voight, and it was also the most watched TV movie of the year with 19 million viewers (Albom).The story begins when an amusement park ride goes wrong and Eddie, the 83 year- old maintenance guy dies while trying to save the little girl from the ride. From the start of the story, we see that Eddie spends most of his day and life taking care of their famous carnival the Ruby Pier. When Eddie later ascends into heaven, this is where the majority of the setting is taken place. We soon discover that while Eddie is in heaven, he learns more about his life and sees how his actions impacted people who were complete strangers or who were his loved ones.\\"There are five people you meet in heaven,\\" the Blue Man suddenly said. \\"Each of us was in your life for a reason. You many not have known the reason at the time, and that is what heaven is for. For understanding your life on earth.\\" Eddie's journey officially begins when he meets five people who have been eagerly waiting for his arrival. Some of the people he encounters, for example, are his wife Margurite who was diagnosed with a brain tumor on Eddie's thirty-ninth birthday who later passed away, \\"The Blue Man,\\" aka Joseph Corvelzchik who literally has blue skin, and the army Captain. Each person reveals to him how his life choices considerably affected their lives as well as his.No one knows what heaven is going to be like unless they have passed on. By reading this book, I was able to really think about what heaven would be like for my grandfather who recently passed away. It gave me this relieving feeling that he will be in great hands and will definitely enjoy his time there. I like the idea presented on how we are all connected to each other and each of our actions may in fact affect other people's lives whether we know it or not.This book will provide readers with feelings of happiness, heartbreak, and sadness. But in the end, when the book is finished, the way you view life will be completely changed. The Five People You Meet in Heaven will definitely change your perspectives on heaven and teach you lessons about life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was a good, fast little book.

I can't spoil it by saying any more than the author has no problem with violence towards women [a few moments of it] for the sake of saving a drunk. The author himself states in the first person [again not a spoiler] that every story can be viewed from two sides. If the Third Person met's story is viewed from the other side it stinks. It takes a totally average book and casts a sexist shadow over it...one I was not looking for so it was glaring.

Unless you share my view that Mitch has done inestimable damage to everything around him, there's no need for you to hear me further. Now that I think about it, I must admit that I've read only a small fraction of his writings. (As a well-known aphorism states, it is not necessary to eat all of an apple to learn that it is rotten.) Nevertheless, I've read enough of Mitch's writings to know that I must part company with many of my peers when it comes to understanding why it requires surprisingly little imagination to envision a future in which Mitch is free to defuse or undermine incisive critiques of his inarticulate behavior by turning them into procedural arguments about mechanisms of institutional restraint. My peers believe that he deserves exemplary punishment. While this is decidedly true, I claim we must add that he may preach hatred right after he reads this review. Let him. In the near future, I, not being one of the many lazy thought police of this world, will fight for what is right.

The carnaval is the only thing he has left because everyone one else in his life has passed away. This book unlike most others, the main character dies in the first chapter due to a tragic insident.

Really, his books are horrible. I read both of his bestsellers because they got such good reviews, but both times, I was severly disappointed. Reading an Albom book is like watching an After School Special or reading a Chicken Soup for the Soul book--he attempts to affect your emotions by using the most direct (non-creative), simple (non-intellectual) story lines, rather than being a truly creative author by making you react emotionally without having to shove the simpleton feel-good drivel down your throat. The onely good thing I can say about Albom's books--they're very short."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This novel is so bad, so over-hyped, so literally poor in its storyline, research, grammar, and literary value, I am just left astonished that anyone can write anything in its defense. For gosh sake, people, don't be taken in by this awful and crude drivel. I am just left shaking my head at the people who continue to buy this awful little nasty book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Yes, this book brought me to tears....tears of pain. It is simply among the worst, most cliched, most sophomoric pieces of writing I've ever read. Albom is terrific on The Sports Reporters but he should leave fiction to the professionals. I suffered through the entire thing, hoping, waiting in vain, for some spark, some sign that this book deserves a spot on the bestseller list. Instead, it simply proved the theory that one bestseller is all you need to insure a spot on that list forever, regardless of the crap you publish. It's so bad, it will make you angry."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a book not to be missed. It's a quick read, but will leave you with plenty to think about for a long time to come. Don't miss this book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"All I can say is that this was a very enjoyable, well written, imaginative book. I normally prefer non-fiction and although this book takes you on a journey from heaven to earth, I did not find it to be &quot;far fetched&quot; or &quot;ridiculous&quot;. As another reviewer said, you will probably be crying in the end (another sign of a good book), but it made me feel good and as soon as I finished it, I immediately offered it to my husband, mother and friend, knowing that they would love it too. It is fast moving and quick to read. The only problem is that I finished it in one day, and now I have to go buy another book. Get this one - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and my husband, who never reads books, read this one in one sitting! My son asked us to buy this book for him for Christmas. We all have enjoyed it. Most of us are hoping for answers to questions when we get to heaven and hoping that we made a difference in this life. This book reflects that and perhaps that is why it is a good read. I would recommend it for an evening of reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I, like many others, read this book, then bought 6 more for those nearest and dearest to my heart. It is so thought provoking, especially for those who have lost someone close to them or who have been looking for greater meaning in their lives. &quot;The Five People You Meet In Heaven&quot; is not a book you read just once!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"My Mom passed away a few months ago - so the title of this book caught my attention (and curiosity) right away. The book is an easy, entertaining read...as well as a comfort to anyone who has lost a loved one. I laughed and cried and found myself hoping that Mr. Albom has the inside scoop on what really happens when we reach the end of our lives!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"What an incredibly intriguing story. Mitch Albom is captivating as he tells the story of Eddie meeting people in heaven. If you have ever wondered about the hereafter, and who hasn't, this book will leave you at ease and give encouragement that all things do have a purpose.A must-read!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"By now you know the story so I won't go in to it again; however, I do want to share my experience. This book really got to my heart and soul. The first time I read it, I burst out crying at the end; not from the story but rather from the emotions it touched. The second time I read it, I cried through the entire book! The phrasing was just so beautiful that it made me cry. An example of Albom's beautiful words is as follows: &quot;Love, like rain, can nourish from above, drenching couples with a soaking joy. But sometimes, under the angry heat of life, love dries on the surface and must nourish from below, tending to its roots, keeping itself alive.&quot; You will not be sorry if you buy this book. It is one you will cherish and read again and again."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was unsure if I would enjoy reading someone else's point of view on such a personal subject, but I was delightfully amazed and enlightened. Mitch Albom painted a tasteful picture of Heaven, and the possibilities were realistic. He offered hope and a positive outlook on the subject of death. He also spun a nice tale of whom you meet and why. His point of view was refreshing. I was caught up in this &quot;easy to read, and finish quickly&quot; book. I have chosen to give this book to a few friends who are not intimidated by the thought of Heaven, and religion. I think it makes for a lovely gift."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I can see why this book is so popular. It is short and tugs on the ol' heart. That doesn't mean it isn't good, though. The story really made me gave me a lot to think about personally, just as Tuesdays with Morrie did. There is really something that anyone can relate to in the tale. This is a perfect gift because many will read it because of the length. Look for the movie soon."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is one of few that teaches lessons while it educates and entertains. It is descriptive, with a story that everyone should take the time out to read. The main character in the book, Eddie, learns life lessons from five people he meets in heaven. Those lessons he is also able to reflect upon his own life and the decisions he has made to be able to see that each decision has a ripple effect. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I've just finished reading the book and, although the ending brought me to tears, I'm not sure how I feel about it. We can all relate to the book's theme- even the most outwardly ordinary life is extraordinary inasmuch as it affects even those of whom we are unaware. But does that make this an extraordinary book? Are we, the readers, looking so desperately for answers to make sense of our lives that we heap accolades on a book which may actually be quite simple? Or is it more profound than simple? I really can't decide. I will say it was a very quick read (read it in a few hours) but I'm not sure about it's depth."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a good simple read that anyone can benefit from. On the surface it is the story of a man that fixes amusement park rides and feels he has made no contribution to the world around him. Beneath the surface it shows how the meaning of life is often found not in what we do but in how we affect those around us. Even the most casual circumstances can lead to profound changes in other people's lives.This book is not meant to be overly critical or in-depth in anyway. It is a nice simple read that should take no more than a few hours. Despite the title, it is not even specific to a religion. It is just a way to relate that it is an after life experience.Read it, you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I love classics, but I made a exception for this book. It hasn't been considered a classic yet but it will. This book gives me happiness everytime I read it. I believe that the world would be better if everyone read this book. They would then know the true meaning of heaven. I believe that's how Heaven really is, and compared to Heaven, we're in Hell. This book knows how to show people the way to Heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I absolutely love this book! I keep passing it on to friends to tell them they must read it. The author has such a wonderful perception of heaven and how the choices we make can affect us much, much later- in death. It is well written and easy to understand. I would recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I gave the book three starts because it was mediocre after all of the great reviews it has gotten. I didn't see the TV movie but from what I hear it's actually one of those rare times where the movie outshines the book. Albom is an OK writer and its a good concept but I was disappointed (especially after reading \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" which was much better). It's a quick read so go for it if you have nothing better to do."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom is a refreshing novel about life. Albom does an excellent job of making the reader question his or her views on the afterlife as well as the meaning of life itself Also, Albom discusses how the afterlife explains one's life and his or her purpose in it. In addition, the five people Albom chooses for Eddie to meet in heaven provide further insight as to why relationships are important, regardless of whether or not you know that person directly. Overall, The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a quick read, yet its unique message is different and thought-provoking and Albom has the reader hanging onto every last word, holding back the persistent tears of joy and triumph."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Loved it! Easy, short read. Uplifting and thought provoking about our lives and purposes. We have a lot to look forward to."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Quick, powerful read.

It's a cute little story, but it's short and quite pointless. It's not a bad read by any stretch, but I would have liked a more developed storyline instead of the whole book focusing on poor ol' Eddie's not-so-fascinating life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought the book was a real eye opener. I really enjoyed reading it.It makes you think about life and what you are doing here in a very different way.If you liked this book you will like his Tuesday book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It's at least short and so my two stars but Albom's attempt at writing a fable left me feeling as if I'd been manipulated. I suspect a ghost writer or a panel of them at work here. This is a study in how hype can sell any book, I suppose, and from that standpoint it deserves to be studied as a pop culture creature."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A soft read, with much imagination.But, if you want more than that, I would suggest picking up a book or two about people who have been there; i.e. 'Near-Death Experiences' such as Tiffany Snow (&quot;Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life&quot;), or the numerous research documents available through IANDS (International Association of Near-Death Studies). Imagination is fine - but this is the information age - getting a group synopsis of heaven through unrelated people with NDEs can get you a better window, without having to stretch it too much."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After having read Tuesday with Morrie a few years ago and having liked that book ALOT, this one was a disappointment."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I dislike Mitch for the fact that he came to Atlanta a couple of years ago to promote his &quot;shallow&quot; book on &quot;Tuesday With...&quot;I have a sister with Lou Gehrig's disease -in her 14th year. So Mitch comes to Atlanta to give a talk on the &quot;Tuesday&quot; book and my sister had bought a copy, the family and friends bought one and so many other ALS patients had as well.. So the HUGE effort it takes to get an ALS person to such an event was a big deal. The dinner sucked for &quot;it&quot; was a dinner for the average &quot;joe&quot; who could swallow normally. FEW people understand the ALS suffering.... And Mitch did little to communicate that idea... I sat there and listened to his &quot;self-grandiosity&quot; and was repulsed. &quot;His&quot; visit was all &quot;about his trite little expereience with ALS&quot; and not about the huge amount of work that it takes to keep an ALS person comfortable for seven days a week, twenty four hours a day....The final &quot;straw&quot; about my loathing for his self-aggrandizement was when the 8-10 ALS people all had their books, wanting an autograph. Waiting for Mitch to show up at their table, David Jayne, my sister, Susan and others and then, after his farewell, he left the building without even going over to the table of the people with ALS... I have no respect for this &quot;sportscaster&quot;. NONE!

There is no God in this book; Heaven is merely a place where one goes to get one's ego stroked, to be reassured that you are important and meaningful and necessary. God doesn't care whether you were \\"important\\" in an earthly sense.The primary reason why people enjoy this novel is because they like to think that Heaven is a place where all of their good deeds will continually be exalted by people who have no other purpose than to make them feel good about themselves.

It's a book you should have in your own personal library!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"How do I describe this book without giving it away? Let me try: A simple man, a commoner, a hard worker doesn't have much in life, nor does he ask much from life. His days are always the same, working at the amusement park, fixing rides and sharing a brief conversation with a child here and a child there. He is not your typical cute old man sitting on a park bench, but instead one who is covered in grease and intent on fixing any problem as soon as it arises, nothing is more important. Then he dies. He dies trying to save a girl caught under a broken roller coaster. Did he save her before he died? We don't know and neither does he as he walks along the path of his afterlife trying to find out what happened. He encounters many people in his afterlife. People he doesn't know or people he never expected to see again. He doesn't understand why they would be in heaven, what significance they play in his life and death. He learns, though. He learns about his mistakes, he learns about mistakes others made with him. \\"Mistakes\\" he always thought were on purpose. He learns about consequences and patterns, the reaction of an action, so to speak.Will he see his beloved wife ever again? Will she be the same? Will she want to be in his heaven? Did he save the girl under the roller coaster? Eddie harbors guilt, and he will not be able to leave peacefully until he finds out what it is, where it came from, and how he can let it go. The answers are in the book and they are insightful and beautiful.This book shows a different \\"take\\" on heaven. It is not a particularly religious or spiritual book. It is about emotions that are carried with you forever, even into the afterlife. Emotions seized and emotions that must be overcome in order to find peace and \\"live\\" forever. I love this book. None of the five people that Eddie met were people I thought he would meet. The \\"heaven\\" in this book is just like what I have imagined heaven to be like, different for every individual, a compelation of everything beautiful and comfortable that happened in his/or her life. The heaven reminded me a little of the heaven in What Dreams May Come by Richard Matteson. The devotion, dedication, and the simplicities of the character reminded me a lot of the characters in Michele Geraldi's book Calling in the Night. I hope people will read The Five People You Meet in Heaven because it is a touching story in itself and then it also makes you think and wonder and dream...about heaven. And what could be more worthy of a dream than that?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"People sometimes expect too much from a book, and this is one of those cases. I've heard some people ooze praise about this book and some people revile it like it was an insult to them, personally. I read it and I found it harmless, even touching in a few places, but not life-changing and not a masterpiece. I think that IF we survive death in some manner, it's possible we are called upon to re-examine the life we lived, and possibly it might unfold in a way like this. I was interested enough in Eddie's life story and his experiences after physical death to read this slim book through. It wasn't great but it definitely wasn't bad. (Although the scene with the children who were war victims was a little morbid and hokey, in my opinion.) I suspect most people who don't expect too much from The Five People Who Meet In Heaven, will find it a resonably appealing read if they give it a chance."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I believe the author meant well with this book, and the conclusion is very positive and uplifting. However, some of the flashbacks to the main character's experiences during WWII are very gory.

If you're sensitive to violence, skip the WWII scenes."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is genius manifested through simplicity.

I thought it was better than \\"Morrie\\"."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"These blockbusting bestsellers always grab my attention. I like to see for myself what makes people buy them. Sometimes I enjoy them very much - \\"Da Vinci Code\\", the Harry Potter and Dark Tower series, and many more. Sometimes these bestsellers are simply unreadable - I have tried Danielle Steel and Sidney Sheldon, but couldn't finish either. Well, tastes differ in each person.So, I picked up \\"The five people you meet in heaven\\" because it was a very short read, althoguh some of the people I met here on Earth - people that had read this book - told me it was simply wonderful, a blend of Paulo Coelho and Jostein Gaarder. To tell you the truth, Paulo Coelho and Jostein Gaarder are two of the worst authors I've ever come across, but I went on and read Mitch Albom anyway.This book is much better than I expected, but reading it is not the fullfilling, once-in-a-lifetime experience people promised me (of course). Eddie, the main character, is the maintenance chief of a second-rate amusement park. At the beginning of the book, he dies. He goes to heaven. As the title says, he meets five people that were, in different ways, part of his life. Mitch Albom uses these five characters to tell Eddie's life from the beginning, and explain its meaning.Albom's writing is simple and direct, but he doesn't treat his readers like idiots - like Paulo Coelho does. He is not trying to teach you something in a boring way with each sentence - like Jostein Gaarder does. He simply thought of a cute afterlife story, wrote it, and sold millions. Good for him. The story is really cute, but not original. It's never boring, but always plain. And, oh yeah, it is as corny as can be. But, all in all, nice.So, there it is. I have read it. My life has not changed forever. I'm still the same person I used to be. But \\"The five people you meet in heaven\\" is a simple, fast book. Read it. Maybe YOUR life will be changed.Grade 5.8/10"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I did not want to put this book down.

Since I have read his other book \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" , I've learnt something special from it. Anyway , this book ( The Five People You Meet in Heaven ) is written in a very interesting style. The author put the ending of the story at the beginning. And most of Eddie's life has been told by starting from his birthdays.As I travalled along with Eddie in 'heaven' , I felt at various times numb , shocked , happy , sad , afraid and nearly brought to tears. Eventhough I don't believe much in heaven but I take it as an acceptable tale about life and death , plus the fantasy view of heaven.

It is a straightforward and enjoyable story that educates by making you think about life (rather then TELLING you about life). I loved it just as much as anything else I've been recommended. It holds its own with 'Secret Life of Bees', 'Time Traveler's Wife' and 'My Fractured Life.' It's the kind of book you can read in a day and go to bed happy when you're done."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This story could be about any of us with just a little substitution of each of our life's story. This is about an 83 year old man who dies trying to save a little girl's life. Instead of going directly to heaven he meets five people who, through some connection to each other, have made a difference and have been influencial in how their lives developed. He thought his life was meaningless and yet was shown that he indeed was right where he should have been and that he had indeed been an important and needed person. Sometimes we all feel that we are not important and yet, unknown to us, there are many in this world we have touched and those who have touched and influenced us unknowingly. It is always hoped that it will be a positive and good influence. The book will touch your heart and give you faith in your place on earth.

And as some other reviewers have said in their own words, it's a refreshing, relaxing sort of book. I think it has character. I could imagine many book club members having fun while chatting about this little number. As for Eddie, I won't tell you about him or the story... you'll have to find out for yourself.

I would recommend this book highly and will read it again when life gets me down."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Maybe when I get to heaven someone will explain to me why I wasted 2 1/2 hours on this book.We are all interconnected; our lives are synchronized in ways we are unaware of. All right, very good. What does this book do with this fairly commonly-held belief? Like thousands of years of religious dogma before it, \\"The Five People\\" seeks to make people feel better about suffering by convincing them it serves a higher good.In a way, this book is a sadder, poorer-quality cousin of the movie \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\" Whereas that movie succeeds in spite of its horrible message through its charm and excellent execution, this book oscillates between mildly entertaining and extremely grating all the way up to its lame \\"you've GOT to be kidding me!\\" ending.I admit that my opinion comes from a sharp personal reaction to the story and isn't reflective of how the typical person would respond. Still, when Mitch Albom dies and goes to heaven, I hope that one of his five people is UFC light heavyweight champion Chuck Liddell, who beats him senseless for writing such a trite, pandering, and shallow book.(Also, why was his wife one of his five people? Inconsistent and purely gratuitous.)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"When I finished the last page of Mitch Albom's TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE, I knew I had to share the book with as many people as I could. I proceeded to buy 41 copies, inscribe them all to my friends and family members, hand them out, mail them --- whatever I had to do to spread the word. The book was that moving, in my opinion. So I was eagerly looking forward to THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN and I am happy to report that Albom did not disappoint me. He is a first-rate storyteller, and THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN is an imaginative, creative tale in the tradition of the best fairy tales or folklore.Eddie is a maintenance man who keeps the rides safe at the Ruby Pier amusement park. His 83rd birthday seems like any other day --- he inspects the rides, watches the people, makes pipe cleaner animals for the children. However on this day he dies unexpectedly, trying to rescue a young girl in harm's way.Eddie wakes up in heaven --- but not to the &quot;paradise garden, a place where (we) can float on clouds and laze in rivers and mountains,&quot; not the idyllic place that heaven has been described as throughout time. Eddie awakens to a series of introductions --- or reintroductions --- to five people whom he had met during his life, either in passing or at length. They each carry answers to the whys and hows of Eddie's life. With each meeting he relives in part that time of his life, but now the gaps are filled in. For maybe the first time he sees what REALLY happened. &quot;There are five people you meet in heaven,&quot; the Blue Man, Eddie's first encounter, explains. &quot;Each of us was in your life for a reason. You may not have known the reason at the time, and that is what heaven is for. For understanding your life on earth.&quot;All five are of course deceased, and they all impart knowledge of Eddie's life and life in general. For instance, the Blue Man asks, &quot;Why do people gather when others die,&quot; and his explanation is at the very core of the meaning of Albom's book: &quot;It is because the human spirit knows, deep down, that all lives intersect. That death doesn't just take someone, it misses someone else, and in the small distance between being taken and being missed lives are changed.&quot; It is insights like these that leave the reader asking, &quot;What does Mitch Albom know that we don't?&quot;What he knows is that we all seek answers. We look for meaning behind the experiences in our lives. More often than not, we never get the answers but we continue --- we plod on, happy or unhappy, fulfilled or unfulfilled, pain-free or in pain. We live. Albom doesn't pretend to offer us the answers, but he does offer us an almost Taoist interpretation of life. It is. It just is. The answers may never be revealed. And do they need to be?THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN is a beautiful story. Eddie is human and likable for his foibles, fears and faults. The writing is often lyrical and fable-like. And though the book is fiction, behind it lies Albom's lifelong love of his uncle, which lends a tenderness and intimacy to the tale on par with TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE. You'll want to share this with your friends, family, acquaintances, and even those nameless people you pass on the street who may have played a larger role in your life than you ever could have imagined.--- Reviewed by Roberta O'Hara"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I did a lot of research before buying this book.

I am a girl who enjoys a great heart-warming and touching book. However, I found myself literally rolling my eyes while reading this book! It was incredibly corny and what would be called a typical &quot;chick's book&quot;. I suppose the only reason that Tuesdays with Morrie was a lot better was because it's supposed to be a true story.

Something really awful happens on each of his birthdays (his father's death, his wife's car accident, etc.)Then when he gets to heaven he finds out from his 5 people that he caused a man's heart attack, was responsible for a 5 year old burning to death, etc.I don't care for this much negativity."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, even though it brought me to tears several times. There's no denying it, this is a heartfelt story, well written and well presented. It will remind you to cherish the time you spend on earth, and remind you to let those that are dear to you know that you love them. We all need reminders such as these every now and then.The book is dedicated to the author's uncle, who gave him his first concept of heaven. As the dedication states:\\"Everyone has an idea of heaven, as do most religions, and they should all be respected. The version represented here is only a guess, a wish, in some ways, that my uncle, and others like him-people who felt unimportant here on earth-realize, finally, how much they mattered and how they were loved.\\"The story is based on the life of one person, and explores the relationships between this person and five others, who are reunited in heaven to help this individual understand their time on earth. The concept, though simple, is extremely powerful, and most effective in helping you get to know this person, and share their growing understanding of the meaning of their life.Told in a narrative style, the story begins with a countdown of the last hour of the life of the main character. As the book explains:\\"It might seem strange to start a story with an ending. But all endings are also beginnings. We just don't know it at the time.\\"We gain further insight through snippets of birthday celebrations woven through the story as chapter introductions.The first person met in heaven explained that the greatest gift God can give you is to understand what happened in your life:\\"People think of heaven as a paradise garden, a place where they can float on clouds and laze in rivers and mountains. But scenery without solace is meaningless.\\"Five people who crossed your path before they died-some you knew, maybe some you didn't-altered your life forever, and await to illuminate an aspect of your life for you that they know about. It is further explained:\\"That there are no random acts. That we are all connected. That you can no more separate one life from another than you can separate a breeze from the wind.\\"In this book, there are many stages of heaven, and time is unmeasured. Once you've met your five advisors, and gain enlightenment, it's your turn to enlighten others, people who's paths you have crossed and changed their lives forever.The book is sprinkled with insightful messages about people, and life, and emotion. Gems such as:\\"No life is a waste. The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we are alone.\\"and:\\"Young men go to war. Sometimes because they have to, sometimes because they want to. Always, they feel they are supposed to. This comes from the sad, layered stories of life, which over the centuries have seen courage confused with picking up arms, and cowardice confused with laying them down. \\"and:\\"All parents damage their children, It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhoods completely into jagged little pieces, beyond repair.\\"build to make this book an enjoyable and thoughtful read.I would thoroughly recommend this book to those adults which may wonder about the meaning of life, or about an afterlife. It does not preach, condone nor condemn religion. It doesn't even discuss it at all. It is a book about life and death. And one man's interpretation of what heaven may be like.What is your idea of heaven?Review available at www.lotechsolutions.com/Topics/Books/"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The magic to Mitch Albom's approach is that he touches upon something that we all think about - What happens after we die? No one has definitively been able to answer the question and what Albom has done is to take the comforting reply to that question (we go to heaven), and add A Christmas Carol story-twist to it. Heaven isn't necessarily filled with rolling hills and bon-bons. It's about making sense out of your life and bringing it to its natural closure. And in many ways, Albom's way of dealing with death is quite comforting for me. I've always had a fear about dying. At one time in my life, it was about the act of dying. Would I be in a lot of pain? Would I be by myself? Would I die of natural causes? Would something horrible happen to me? Then, it proceeded to this helpless feeling of never being able to be again. I couldn't imagine not being. Not touching. Feeling. Hugging. Kissing. Smelling. Death - before, during, and after - is scary. Albom's approach isn't totally unique but it is theraputic. He has a way of making sense of it all. Also recommended: The Lovely Bones by Sebold, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I picked this book up, when I was wandering through a Border's book store, a few weeks ago. The story sounded very interesting from the information I read on the back cover, and I found it to be very captivating. I found the story to really be a parable about life, and really that is where it is effective. The story about Eddie, though it may be fiction/fantasy based, does show how people can affect your life even without you being aware of it. You don't have to believe that the premise could be true to enjoy the story. I was completely unprepared for the final person, as I am sure most readers will be. The person I expected it to be didn't appear, but rather the one person who had the most impact on his life from the day Eddie saw the person. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I do not enjoy cross country airplane flights in cramped coach seats, so I picked up \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" to help me pass the time and get my mind off my discomfort. I started it at take-off and finished it a couple of minutes before deplaning. I just couldn't put it down and I felt like I had truly taken *two* voyages - one on the plane and one with the protagonist. The first trip got me a little closer to home, the second got me a little closer to my heavenly home. Albom scores here with a touching tale that spells out the interconnectedness of mankind. The book is gripping, heartwarming, faith-promoting, and reminds us that no man is island in this life. We all have purpose in life, regardless of our station."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom has done it again. He has put together a masterpiece. A man who has spent his entire life working on an amusemnet pier fixing the rides, died trying to save a small child from an accident. He wakes up in &quot;heaven&quot; and meets five people from his past. The five of them explain why his life has not been a total loss as he assumed that it was. The five people are all conected to him in some manner. Some of the five were very important in his life and some never met him, but were still connected. The main character Eddie meets everone in different settings that they consider &quot;Heaven&quot; and why they consider it &quot;Heaven&quot;. The five of them explain various parts of his life and why things turned out like they did. The end of the book wraps up nicely and is a bit of a surprise.Mitch Albom has taken a very complex idea and explained his version of &quot;heaven&quot; in an easy to read style. The book never drags and it leaves you with a good feeling. Although it has religious connotations, it is not a book on relious beliefs. Any version of &quot;heaven&quot; can be used in place instead. Albom never lectures on beliefs, but instead focuses on Eddie and trying to answer why his life turned out like it did. Eddie represents everyone of us who ever thought about their life either not measuring up or being a failure. By showing Eddie his life through others eyes, he actually shows that the unimportant life is very important to at least a few and more likely many that we never even knew we affected. That is the true beauty of this book. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews here. I was shocked by what turned out to be a really bad read. One dimensional with uninspired and stereotypical themes. I actually was wondering whether the author was a high school student who had a family member in the publishing industry. (I've actually gotten more insight on life from a single paragraph poem... even a single page greeting card.)The main idea of the book is that a simple man dies, goes to heaven and meets the five life-altering people who help explain to him his horrible, crippled existence with an abusive father and help it \\"make sense\\" and relieve his suffering.Well if I were Eddie (the main character) and my life was as long and sufferable as his and the \\"insights\\" given to me by the five \\"guides in heaven\\" were what was offered in this book, I'd ask for the management and demand a refund.I give the same advice for this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Eddie wakes up on the morning of his 83rd birthday and goes about the day as if it were no different than any other day in the week. What Eddie doesn't know is that he is going to die that day trying to save a young girl from an amusement park ride accident.When Eddie dies, he is transplanted to heaven where he learns that he will meet 5 people who explain certain life lessons to help Eddie forgive himself, understand his life, and accept the choices he made. However, for the most part, these are not your \\"typical\\" kind of people like a mother, father, spouse, etc. They are people you may have met in passing, or perhaps were never formally introduced to her; people that unknowingly touched your life.The premise for this novel is brilliant, which is why it originally interested me. The main character Eddie is a multifaceted character, and the supporting characters add a certain richness to the novel. Essentially, the best part of this book is the plot. Albom skillfully weaves stories together to help demonstrate these life lessons to Eddie. An event that may seem insignificant to you may hold a deeper meaning for another person.My only real complaints with the novel are style and pacing. The writing style can be very simplistic almost to the point of being juvenile. But, that's mainly just a minor annoyance. I think the pacing could have been improved. The novel is very short. It's 200 pages (or at least my copy is), but it's a smaller sized book and there is a lot of formatting involved to lengthen it. I think that the stories could have been more developed, especially because Albom has such skill with interlacing common events. Nevertheless, at the same time, I got a little bored with the book sometimes. It seemed like certain descriptions and scenes were thrown more into lengthen the book (like the formatting). Presently, I think the story would have functioned better as a novelette unless Albom supplemented more relevant and interesting scenes to the book.Overall, it's a very heartwarming, yet heart-wrenching story with an interesting premise. It's certainly worth reading, and I'm sure it will give you a little perspective for your own lives. Grade: B+"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I tought this was a very excellent book. It was kind of sad, but also very heartwarming. This book is about a man named Eddie, who was the head maintenance person at Ruby Pier, who dies on his eighty-third birthday. When he goes to heaven he finds out that it is not a paradise, but an explanation of his life on earth explained to him by five people who were in his life one way or another. Who are these five people and why were they in Eddie's life? Read the book to find out. I liked this book because it had drama, it made want to read it nonstop. I didn't like it because I thought it was very sad.All in all it was a very good book though."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"...&quot;Is that all there is?&quot; Very disappointing; I am amazed at all the worship this book has inspired. Overly saccharine story and unsatsifying ending. I did like the scenes where the main character is reunited with his deceased wife, but that's not enough to recommend the book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was out of town,in a bookstore thumbing through this book, when from over my shoulder I hear &quot; you MUST buy that book&quot;. I turned to see an old friend, who added, &quot;after reading this book I stood in the shower for an hour sobbing&quot;. Of course I bought the book, loved it, and the introspection it created in my mind throughout the next week. I lent it to my boss, who was leaving to attend a family funeral; he said, &quot;this book made that experience a much more fulfilling esperience.&quot; I bought 10 for Christmas gifts, and have had positive responses from most. This a fun read that offers the reader a thoughful look at ones life, and the choices we make."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I found Albom&quot;s writing graceless and tiresome. His short, declarative sentences make for very choppy reading. The repetition gives the narrative a sing-song feeling. In reading it, I suffered through 12 of Eddie's birthdays and seven countdowns to his death. The author's so-called profound statements (i.e. ...&quot;because sons will adore their fathers through even the worst behavior&quot;.) are false and annoying to read.I find nothing to commend in this book. If I hadn't had to read it for a book club, I never would have bought it, much less finished it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As much as I love to read and can't wait to get to next book I usually pace myself. I want each word each sentence each page to allow me to become part of its world. \\"The five people you meet in heaven\\" is the very first book that broke my rule. This book is so well written it pulled me in the first moment and wouldn't allow me a second breath until the last words were read.This beautiful book touch me on a personal note, as I'm sure it will with others. Like the main character Eddie I've had the bad and good walked through life at times with blinders on, living about as if there is only my small world that is. With a large amount of irony the one thing I have believed through the years is that everyone and everything is connected in someway. I have wanted to share this opion but didn't know how or even fully understand it myself.Mr Albom's book has been a gift, helping me understand, while reflecting my belief that my world is part of a much larger picture teaches me that my world is something I don't fully control as much as one would like to believe.All I have left to write is this \\"The five people you meet in heaven\\" made me smile and we all need to smile.Thanks."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a wonderful, inspirational book. If you cannot quite bring your personal faith around to the idea of God, the book will express a shared urging that something awaits us after death...Eddie is \\"a good man.\\" Someone who has suffered terrible disappointments and setbacks, and, while not bitter, is an inward, gruff widower.When you start the book, you start eye-rolling and anticipate that Eddie will re-enact \\"It's A Wonderful Life.\\" In fact, we learn that afterlife and redemption means something more than recognition of the value of your contributions. The book teaches us that making amends is work, not an easy pleasure, that serenity means accepting not only your own deeds but also forgiving the shortcomings of others, and that it's hardest to understand our own loving impulses.Mitch Albom's other, non-fiction book, \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" was actually better for me. His writing style can veer too wildly for my too-conservative taste. Morrie's admonition to us was remarkably similar to Jesus's: \\"Love one another.\\" If Albom is trying to share a deeper iteration of this wisdom in \\"5 People,\\" it does work. I'm glad, though, that I read \\"Morrie\\" first."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book is a great idea and alot of it works. But some of the explanations, especially re.

His experiences in meeting five important people who have already passed on....brings to the forefront one's own immortality but most importantly \\"how one has lived his/her life\\".This is not a judgemental book by other people but Eddie's own experiences of his past and Eddie makes his own judgment of his passing life.Some might look at this book as \\"fluff\\" but one should go deeper into the meaning of life, the inner struggles one is sometimes forced to experience and how to overcome them. Some will experience the true meaning of their life when it comes at the end, like Eddie. To live life fully is to live in the \\"now\\" so that one does not have \\"surprises\\" at the end.This book helps us to look into our own lives and \\"see\\" and live in the \\"now\\". To let go of our past and look to the future.

I knew absolutely nothing about the author or the book before reading it. I started to read the book in the store to debate on buying it. I read until page 36 and decided it would come home with me. I brought it home and couldn't put it down, I finished it in one night.It is a well written story about a man named Eddie and his life, before and after death. It deals with his time in war, in family situations and with Love. Eddie deals with being mundane his whole life, always wanting more for himself and feeling trapped. When he gets to heaven, he five people he encounters help him work out his frustrations with life and put it in very simple terms that anyone can understand.I found this book to be captivating and almost having a pulse of its own, it was more than a book it was a reading companion."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Ok, ya'll. this is a totally awesome book. it opens your mind to one's perspective of heaven. amazing and i bought it for 20$! am i am happy i did, so if you can get it for such low prices like amazon.com offers, there is no reason you shouldn't give this book a try!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was incredible! It really shows how no matter how small or insignificant we may feel, each of us touches the life of another."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a book that had me up until I finished. I was touched by the words and thoughts. I gave copies to my chidren and wife. This book will have you talking to strangers about it, thinking about what it says and just evaluating life. My adult son and I were talking about why \\"we are put here\\" and I told him to read the book. He was also moved. Please read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book not knowing what to expect. I couldn't put it down. I thought it might be a book that tried to make up a heaven, but it was about life, love, acceptance, perspective, and forgiveness. What Eddie does after death is what we all wish we could do in life if only we could have it explained the way Eddie does. Still, it gives closure and meaning to a life, and a light into what we could do if we looked outside ourselves."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I would definitely recommend this book because it grabs your attention and it is appealing to both boys and girls. Parts of the story are gory when the author describes some scenes of war and some of it is heartwarming. This book was a page-turner because it was about a person's life. It is suspenseful by having you wonder who Eddie is going to meet next, what the character will have to him and what lesson that character will leave him with. It is a feel good book that really makes you think about your life and how people affect it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought that this was a lovely story. I believe deeply that all things and all beings are connected and that every thing - positive, negative, and neutral - that any being says or thinks or does has a ripple effect. And no matter how far removed we are from the original word or thought or deed, the ripple will at some point touch us. The gentleness or fierceness of its touch depends on, well, who's to say?For people who disparage or question or have never been introduced to the idea of interconnectedness, this book is a light introduction to a fundamental spiritual truth. A truth that is rejected by many because it seems too overwhelming and burdensome.I applaud Mr. Albom for providing a gentle doorway through which people can tentatively begin to move towards the understanding that nothing is separate from anything else. Eddie was tied to his five people in heaven, who were tied to five of their own, who were tied to five of their own, and on and on and on the web is woven through past time, present time, and future time.Well done, Mr. Albom. Thank you for this gentle doorway."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom veers into the world of fiction, and I am not sure why. First of all, let me say that I lived in Detroit for a while, and I love Mitch's radio show and columns. Without a doubt, he is an insightful commentator on the world of sports. It is always refreshing to hear or read a different take on sports.This thing is OK, he weaves together three stories: a elderly maintenance man's last day on earth, a recollection of countless birthdays linked with a true love story, and what happens when one arrives at the Pearly Gates. It is all well put together.Like a Seinfeld episode, it all comes together at the end. We understand why the man's life was important. As a sidebar, all lives are important and it is a bit depressing to hear Eddie say endlessly that his was not.If this gets to be the Hallmark Hall of Fame made for TV movie, I am certain that Jim Garner will play Eddie. Eddie was a WWII vet, who ended up in the same maintenance job as his late father. He was fortunate in finding the love of his life early, and unfortunate in losing her at age 47. When he gets to heaven he meets five people who are waiting to tell him what really happened, and what was the significance of it all.Of course, one is his late wife. But the others are a surprise. Two of them are relics of his WWII days. The other two he barely knew, but he had an impact on one, and the other had an impact on him.Personally I hope that Mitch is wrong and heaven is nothing like this. I dont think that I want to know if I accidentally killed someone or destroyed a life.All in all, not a bad read. Take it to the beach for a few hours of reflection, but dont expect any great revelations or prose for the ages."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book for my english class, and I do have to say this book is amazing. Mitch Albom has created a whole new outlook on heaven through his story telling. The imagry makes you feel like you are actually witnessing the events as Eddie (the main character) does. This book is not very long and is a good book to read in an afternoon. This book raised many questions of heaven that I have never even though about! What a great book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"With The Five People You Meet in Heaven, Mitch Albom continues his courageous exploration of uncomfortable end of life issues. In many ways, it is a sequel to Tuesdays With Morrie, in which Albom recounts his relationship with a dying teacher. In Five People You Meet in Heaven, he goes one step further, telling the story of a man looking back on his life, not during his dying days, but in the afterlife.The book is a new twist on the classic Frank Capra movie \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\". Unlike Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey, the main character of Five People You Meet In Heaven, Eddie, an amusement park mechanic, does not realize how many lives he positively touched until after he dies.With vivid brevity, Albom expertly weaves vignettes recapitulating Eddie's life from youth to age. In each story within the story, a person who Eddie helped serves as an insightful guide. As a student of World War II, I'm particularly partial to Eddie's infantry squadron leader. In addition, Eddie's relationship with his wife, and his posthumous appreciation of his father, are exceptionally moving.However, the book is somewhat contrived in that every significant event happens on Eddie's birthday. I'm also disturbed by Albom's conclusion that the stories of all people are \\"one\\". Granted, we are all part of humanity, but that doesn't necessarily make us one. Evil dictators, gangsters, and the like forfeit much of their humanity and cannot be equated with honest, decent, and compassionate people.That being said, these minor flaws do little to detract from the power of Five People You Meet In Heaven. This book is a fascinating speculation about what may lie beyond earthly existence, but more importantly, it allows us to take stock of our lives and recognize our unsung contributions to the human condition while we're still around."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This one of the most engaging, spiritual books I have read. It is written in the simplest of styles and formats, the story of Eddie, a maintenance man at a carnival who dies and transitions to the next plane of existence. Here, he meets five people who interacted with him significantly at various stages of his life - some whom he hadn't ever realized had had such important interactions with him. The insights he gains from these five people are lessons for all of us, such as:\\"That there are no random acts. That we are all connected. That you can no more separate one life from another than you can separate a breeze from the wind.\\" (p. 48)\\"Strangers... are just family you have yet to come to know.\\" (p. 49)\\"No life is a waste... The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we are alone.\\" (p. 50)Eddie had had a particularly bitter relationship with his father. As Albom's tale unfolds, Eddie comes to understand his father better.\\"All parents damage their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhoods completely into jagged little pieces, beyond repair.\\" (p. 104)This book is warmly recommended - suitable as a gift for opening into spiritual awareness.This has also been made into a film."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was an amazing book. It told the story of heaven and how people see it. In the author's point of view heaven is a great place where people find out their point on this earth. You find out people that you have hurt and even killed. It gives you a reason to look forward to life and it tells you that if you mess up there might be a reason for that mistake and that it is not all that bad.Eddie is the main character, he is a kind, loving, and caring person. He loves kids and really cares about the people that he works with. He works at Ruby Pier as the head of maintenance. His wife Ruby is a older woman that the pier is names after. She shows Eddie around heaven.Eddie dies helping people out at the pier he would never give up helping people he would eventually give his life by doing what he loved."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really liked this story. And while it may not fit the standard definition of what heaven is, it gives you something different to think about and a new perspective of what heaven might be like. I thought the author did a great job painting the sights and sounds and places in the book and really kept my attention throughout.I listened to the audiobook version of this and thought it was really well done. Many audiobooks are read by dull-sounding people in a lack-luster tone, but Erik Singer does a great job doing all the characters. I also enjoyed the background music and sound effects which many other books leave out.This audiobook is unabridged and comes in at just about 5 hours. It includes an interview with the author at the end (which is a bit on the cheesy side) and an introduction read by the author that helps to explain how he come up with the idea for the book (which was pretty interesting).I recommend this book for anyone who wants an interesting and easy to read (or listen to) story. It's not going to revolutionize your world or give you an epiphany or give you the meaning of life... but it's a good story with a simple plot and a twist on the traditional views of life after death."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a great book. Those belittling it as throwaway or lightweight are literary snobs. The reader who said it was a \\"sub two hour read\\" showed only too clearly their basis for judging a book. They rate a book by how long it takes to read or how challenging it is - as though the harder work a book is and the longer it takes to read is an authoritative indication of how good it must be! Books are meant to be enjoyed, not worn like badges of intellect. In other words they miss the point entirely. The same people only drink wine of a certain year or region, no matter whether they enjoy the taste or not. I've read many of the \\"classics\\" and enjoyed them, but I still think this is a great and very cleverly written book. It's inspirational and thought provoking. I work in financial services and can assure you there really are people in the industry who believe owning stocks and shares is more important than happy times spent with loved ones, there is nothing trite about it. It is only later in life when you grow up that you appreciate the poignancy of Albom's observations. The vast majority of people will enjoy this book, so give it a chance."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven by Mitch Albom is one of the best books I have ever read. I immediately connected with the characters in the story. I enjoyed how realistic they were, especially the main character Eddie who is an \\"Average Joe,\\" and a hard worker, who finds himself trapped in the same job as his father. Working on Ruby Pier at a Carnival Theme Park, which is the last thing that he wanted to do. But with his fathers death he took on the responsibility at a young age.When I first began reading the book it switched back to Eddie's Birthday after the point of the previous story was made. For me it was confusing, but as I read on I enjoy the format that he used. The Book flips to different chapters of Eddie's life making it interesting keeping you from getting bored with one \\"chapter\\" of his life. But in addition to making the story interesting it also helped me to develop a better understanding of where Eddie was coming form because as you read on you become familiar with the things that he has gone through.I enjoyed this book because it was well written and inspiring. It made me think about the impact I had on others lives. I would like to leave you with two quotes from his book, the vividness and power of his writing speaks for itself.\\"The Skies Clapped with thunder and the rainwater pelted them. They grabbed and flailed in the violent chop.\\"\\"Holding anger is a poison. It eats you form inside. We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade.

The book is based on the premise that &quot;our lives are more important than we actually know.&quot; I did something with this book that I've never done, cried while reading.

I had waited patiently to read it, but when I finally received it, it took me about two hours to read it.Eddie is a somewhat bitter, tired man, who at the start of the book, doesn't realize he just has an hour left to live. The book takes you through the details of the last hour of his life, and then introduces you a new idea of Heaven. In the Heaven that Eddie goes to, he meets 5 people who either touched his life or he touched theirs.

This book is the only one that has ever made me laugh and cry at the same time! There are many lessons that I have learned from this book, and shall always remember. One is to understand sacrafices and why they are made. Eddie's sacrafice was his leg instead of his life. I also learned that everything happens for a reason. Mitch Albom is an inspiring writer who has touched and changed lives to many readers around the world. Another Mitch albom book that I recommend you to read is &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; which is about death and the meaning of life. I can hardly wait for Mitch's next bestseller to come out!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a book I really couldn't put down. I felt Eddie's pain, I wanted him to be happy, I cared for him - I went thought his life with him , purely due to the eloquent and vibrant literary prowess of the author. It is a (dare I use the word) whimsical journey we all as human beings who love, who hurt, who get afraid, can share and relate. A treasure I will read again and again."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Eddie had devoted his entire life fixing rides at Ruby Pier amusement park. Though he had witnessed the vicissitude of the park and was enamored by the children to whom he brought much joy, Eddie felt trapped in a meaningless life. He had outlived his wife Marguerite, who died of brain tumor at the age of 47, and most of his family and friends. Rooted deep in his heart was an unbearable bitterness with which he intransigently held his father accountable for his loss of career, loss of freedom, and the loss of hope.On his 83rd birthday, Eddie died in a tragic accident, trying to save a little girl from a falling cart that was snapped loose from the cable. His last earthly vision consisted of two mysteriously hands resting on his body. Eddie awakened in the afterlife and learned that heaven was a place where five people who were in it explained his earthly life to him. Five people presented to him five patches of memories that were crucial in unleashing the truth of hidden connections in Eddie's life. As the story unfolded, Eddie met his lineup of five people, of whom were loved ones and distant strangers, who each taught him a lesson and words of truth that changed his life forever.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a beguiling novel that blooms with surprises as it explores a mystery only heaven can unfold. It explores the meaning of our lives on earth and how lives and their incidences overlap with those of others. It explores the boundary where fortuities become no longer fortuitous but converge with daily incidences. Heaven holds the secret that one affects the other and the other affects the next, in a circle, in a loop, in which all endings are also beginnings.2004 (22) MY"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Great visualization of the concepts that each of us create our own heaven and that no matter how small we may seem - we all touch the lives of many others throughout ours, in ways we may not even know.

I read it to be entertained--and I was. The book is an easy read which I find I need every so often. I enjoyed the book and did not find it to be preachy.

I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading fiction for its entertainment value."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book made me think about how one moment can not only change your life,but that of others as well. I, personally do not believe that I will meet five people in heaven when i die, but i was able to overlook this while reading it. The lessons that each person told could apply to anyone reading the book, and wether you're religious or not, you could probably identify with atleast one of the characters in this book. The Book leaves you to believe what you want, but it really opens your mind to what could be and the possibilities of what life after death really is. It does not push you to believe one thing, or this is right and that's wrong. I loved it.

While that was a good book to read in high school, I feel that this book really influenced me much more. I was in tears a couple of times while reading this book. All the different scenes and images are described in great detail and make the book very difficult to put down. If I didn't have other responsibilities at home, I would have finished it at one sitting. I did however, finish it very quickly and loved every moment. Usually I don't like books that shift time periods frequently, but Mitch Albom makes it work well into the storyline. I was in constant suspense at who the next person in heaven he would meet would be. And I am not even a religious person. It is just a great story: very interesting and inspirational. I think the main purpose of the book is to tell readers that during a lifetime, your actions influence a great number of people, whether or not you realize it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom is a quick and not challenging to read. About, an 83-year-old man named Eddie that is the head maintenance worker at Ruby Pier. While in the opening chapter he gets squashed by a moving roller coaster cart as he is trying to fix it. After dying he will go on a trip through out heaven. Through out the book Eddie learns from five mentors in heaven that he knew in his past life. The overall meaning of this book is that you should cherish life and not take anything for granted.

My teacher had read a little chapter or two at the start of class and most of the students couldn't wait til the next day. I would watch the movie after it, because it helps you understand more."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Everyone wonders, at some point in their lives, what happens when you die. And this is what Mitch Albom, the author of The Five People You Meet in Heaven, does. However, he goes a step further and develops the idea past hazy musings into a solid concept. This book is a refreshing, sweet, comforting and sometimes insightful story of the main character Eddie and his \`last day on earth'. Mitch Albom sneaks in five life lessons during the novel, each attached to one of the people that Eddie meets on his journey. There is the basic theme that everything happens for a reason throughout the story. Albom has found a way to effortlessly intertwine all the lives, lessons and stories in the book in such a unique way to truly get and keep the reader's attention. The story is profound but not headache worthy, not sentimental or mushy, and not sickly sweet either.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a very quick read, just being a little over 200 pages, but Mitch Albom's writing style seems to incorporate a lot into those 200 pages. The story is not 'mesmerizing' or \`fast paced' but it is a page turner. The book has lots of flashbacks, almost reminding me of a 'Scrooge' type experience for Eddie but unlike Scrooge, Eddie is missing out of the chance to go back to Earth to change anything from his past despite asking about that in Heaven. In between each chapter or so is a page or two resituating important periods in Eddie's past, ex: specific birthdays from his childhood to adulthood. Albom takes a big risk with the novel; such a story can easily turn into a sweet and preachy novel. But, for the most part, Albom's telling remains moving and is occasionally profound.Another thing he has done very well is keep his idea as religion-neutral as possible. God is mentioned a couple of times, but it is so brief it does not push away the disbelievers among us and it is so vague that it can easily be anyone's God. This is essential to the universal appeal of this book, as well as a testament to Albom's sensitivity and maturity."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Lately, heaven as been a hot topic, as Todd Burpo's Heaven is for Real has hit number one on the New York Times Best Seller list, Don Piper's memoir 90 Minutes in Heaven remains wildly successful, and Rob Bell's LOVE WINS: A Book About Heaven, Hell and the Fate of Every Person Who Ever Lived, is the talk of the spiritual town. And in that circle of books about heaven is Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven. The concept of this novel is imaginative: Eddie, a carnival mechanic, dies and upon reaching heaven meets five people who each teach him a lesson that gets him closer to understanding the purpose and meaning of his life. With the last lesson, he fully grasps why he was put on earth.My biggest problem with the book was that I didn't find it believable. I'm not sure if the culprit was its flat characters, or its simplistic plot, or its structure, or if it was the character of Eddie himself, whose portrayal I found clich&eacute;: a widowed, struggling mechanic, who has nothing going for him. Most importantly, though, I didn't feel that the author was able to make his version of heaven real. I'll admit that it was refreshing to read a picture of heaven that is different from a cloud puffed haven where beings look down on earth. But the heaven depicted by Albom, I simply couldn't picture it in my mind. Plus, none of the \\"lessons\\" were anything I hadn't heard of before.Things that worked: strong writing, an innovative and appealing idea, and a comforting concept for those of us who have recently had loved ones pass. Also touching is the idea that everyone's life, no matter what they chose to do with it, matters equally in the higher realm. The highlight of the story is when Eddie meets his wife (the fourth person), who gives him the lesson of love. She tells him that when a loved one dies, that love is still there, but it just takes a different form. \\"Memory becomes your partner,\\" she says. \\"You nurture it. You hold it. You dance with it. Life has to end. Love doesn't.\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a quick and uplifting read, so I'd still recommend it for those interested in the afterlife, existential ideas, or the mysterious inner workings of the universe."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"We each have our own vision of what heaven might be... When one is young it is always what our parents and the church says it is. As we grow older and life begins to jade our perceptions, we do what we were told never to do, and that is \\"question\\".In various discussions with peers you understand that everyone has a totally different observation of the wondrous place ranging from the sublime to hauntingly beautiful.In this book by Match Albom, Ruby Pier carnival maintenance man \\"Eddie\\" dies tragically trying in vain (or so he thinks) saving a young girl's life .He relives his own existence through five key people he meets in a heaven of their own making. A heaven that gives him a glimpse of what he MIGHT COME to expect.He relives portions of is life that helps him understand the things he missed while he was alive, the things that caused him pain that he carried until the end.As I listened to this novel, I got the feeling that the main character, Eddie was not actually in heaven, but most likely the in between place. The place where he is able to see most of the angst and misunderstandings from his childhood until his death, and what it all meant. This is largely due to this author's depiction of the fact that there are tears in heaven and it is not all sweet lullaby's and sunshine. I got the feeling that one has to go through many (if not all) of the bad as well as the good things they did in life.This may not be my favorite book about the \\"other side,\\" but it does give a lilting, interesting, and enjoyable representation of one person's thought on a place we are all afraid to speculate about it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was as good as I had heard it would be - perhaps better.

With his final breath, he feels two small hands in his - and then nothing. He awakens in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a lush Garden of Eden but a place where your earthly life is explained to you by five people who were in it. These people may have been loved ones or distant strangers. Yet each of them changed your path forever.\\"Wow! This is a powerful, wonderful book. I guess that pretty much sums it up. When I got the audio version of this book I didn't know what to expect. I had never heard of the title much less Mitch Albom. In addition, this definitely isn't something I normally enjoy. Again, WOW!Have you ever wondered what happens when you die? Most religions teach that you go to a better place. Christianity teaches you that you go to heaven where you meet God and spend eternity. But, what if heaven is what you make it? What if there are different parts of heaven? What if there are five people that are waiting for you from your past? What if each one had a lesson for you? This book doesn't try to answer these questions, but it does make you think about them.This book isn't a serious look at life after death or meant to inspire a change in you life. It is a fictional novel that though unreal, can spark some real thought. Mainly it is just what it is meant to be, entertaining.The five people that Eddie meets when he gets to heaven completely surprised me. Some I was able to guess and others took me by surprise. I don't want to give them away so I won't tell you exactly who they were, but some are the ones to be expected and others aren't.Erik Singer's narration combined with some light music and soft sound effects in the background (which in no way distract the listener); get you engrossed in this novel from the start.This is Mr. Albom's first work of fiction. Previously he wrote a true story about one of his college professors titled \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" which was nominated for an Abby Award.If I had to find something about this book that I didn't like I would be hard pressed to do so. I guess it would be the use of the line, \\"Today is Eddies birthday.\\" Again, this is just if I had to pick something that I didn't really like about this novel.This book has something for everyone. I can't place it in a specific genre because it can fit in so many. It is everything from adventure, to romance.Other titles by Mr. Albom are,TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE: AN OLD MAN, A YOUNG MAN, AND LIFE'S GREATEST LESSON (This book was nominated for an Abby award in 1999). The winner that year was the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.In my own effort to give you as much information about this book and author that I can, I have taken the liberty to include a list of awards which Mr. Albom has either been nominated for or won.Nominated:Abby (1999)Won:NoneIn my opinion, The Five People You Meet In Heaven deserves to be nominated for numerous literary awards, and I hope it is.No matter if you listen to the audio version or read this novel, The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a must have in your collection. To quote Patrick O'Kelley, this is a \\"simple book that will find good company on a shelf next to It's A Wonderful Life.\\"The end of this audio book contains an interview with Mr. Albom in which he says that he has many other ideas for fiction in his head. My response to this is for you to get them down on paper Mr. Albom. If they are as good as this one, you have nothing to worry about."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book made me re-examine my life and give myself credit for my contributions. The book is very well written and helps you find meaning in your life. I also recommend Tuesday's With Morrie, another wonderful book written by the same author."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I don't think I wasted my time reading this book, nor did I really enjoy it. Can a case of neutrality come from a book that is only lengthened by line spacing and indentations? So much more could have been written, providing more depth into the characters. It is centered on one man's life, but the despair and futility could have been captured better. In the end, nothing loss, but gained a question mark. It may provide a sense of purpose and hope for many people who are not satisfied with their life.If someone lends it to you, read it. If you have to go out and buy it, read something else. If you're bored and need an easy read, pick this up."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I just bought this book yesterday and if I didn't have a young child I would have kept reading it until I couldn't read no more.

I bought it this afternoon and read half, and could not wait for the evening so I could finish it. I grabbed my interest and kept it. It is a simple profound book, and if you let it, it will touch your heart. You might try to see things from both sides, instead of being single minded. You might try to be more kind and forgiving. You might wonder about your heaven, and the people who could be there. If anything, you'll definitely appreciate that we are all connected, somehow, and some way. I definitely recommend this book.

This was a great idea for a story ruined by his clunky, awkward writing and one-dimensional characters. Apparently he's forgotten the \\"show, don't tell\\" rule that's taught in middle school English classes."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The idea this book based upon is truly brilliant, but sadly, this book is a waste of time and money. The writing is dry and uninspired. It feels as though children's book author decided to venture into adult themes. If you have read any of the books about POW camps (Nick Rowe's \\"Five Years to Freedom\\" is outstanding), you will be put off by the preposterous fantasy Mr. Albom concocted for this book.I truly wish I could say I enjoyed this book, because the central idea is so intriguing. Unfortunately, this book fails to deliver and I cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had high expectations for this book, given that Tuesdays with Morrie was as moving as it was. The author tries sell another book to the same audience, but ends up presenting a soap-opera/cartoon of a novel as a way to engage the same subject. There is clearly a need in this day and age for writing on the meaning of life, but this was not well done at all, and it was not worth plowing through the melodrama (as someone mentioned above) to get to the several, sentence-long, semi-compelling aphorisms. I actually couldnt finish reading the book it because it was so annoyingly overdone. It seemed way too artificial to present anything real on the meaning of life.

As a reader, I regret the time I wasted. There is nothing here that is inspirational. The story is silly, but the horrible writing was the real turn off."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought this book with a great deal of anticipation. From the first page, I started to get a bad feeling about it. It is a book meant to capitalize on &quot;Morrie&quot; but it's so boring and shallow. I can't imagine how anybody would like it. It kind of turned my stomach, really, as I read on. I just had this sense of Mr. Albom thinking &quot;I can really fool them if I write this.&quot; Sad, very sad. Don't waste your money. I read a lot of books. This one went in the trash."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"While I am a fan of Mitch Albom, this book lacked originality and excitement. Albom simply relates the story of a man who meets five people in heaven that directly and indirectly affected the course of his life while on earth.There is suppossed to be a &quot;lesson&quot; each of the five people are teaching, but the lessons are preachy and forced. It appeared Albom came up with the lessons first, then forced an unbelieveable story around each one.The point of view in the book shifts around as if it is on a pogo stick. This is very distracting.The book is predictable. One can figure out who the five people are after a few pages of the book, so the element of surprise is missing.Much of the dialogue is trite and stiff. Real people do not converse like the characters in the book.Finally, the book is overpriced. Even if it was good, it is still pricy."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The reviews to date validate my reaction to this book - that you will probably love it or hate it. Forty-five people have written a review, almost exactly divided between high praise and complete scorn. Twenty-two five star ratings, a single four star rating, a single three star rating, six did not indicate complete disdain with a two star rating, and the remaining fifteen rated it one star. I rated it five stars for three reasons, first I really enjoyed it - both the content and the style. Second, I thought that the author's technique and its implementation were interesting. Third, I concluded that the author accomplished his apparent goals exceptionally well. The goal of this review is to provide enough information for potential readers of Albom's allegory to decide whether it is the sort of book that they might enjoy and from which they might derive insight; THIS DEFINITELY IS NOT A BOOK FOR EVERYONE.This is literally and nominally the story of Eddie, an 83 year old maintenance man who we meet on the birthday on which he dies in a tragic accident at Ruby Pier, the amusement park where he spent most of his life and where his father had worked before him. But it is also an allegory about what it means to be a human being and our search for meaning in our lives. The story literally starts at \\"The End\\", with the first section being a description of the moments before Eddie's death , which occurs as he tries to save a little girl who is about to be crushed by a falling cart that has come lose from one of the rides. The remainder of the book consists of flashbacks to various birthdays as mileposts in Eddie's life and a few brief intrusions of the present as life proceeds for Eddie's coworker Dominguez, but it primarily involves the journey which Eddie begins as he enters heaven. This journey involves THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN, each of whom has played a meaningful role in his life (perhaps unbeknownst to him), and each of whom has chosen to wait for him to join them in heaven in order to help him understand his earthly path. The experience of each person contains a lesson for Eddie, and the cumulative impact is to help him put his life in a context that is far different from that which he perceived during his day to day existence. As one of them tells him, heaven is so you can finally understand the past, \\"to make sense of your yesterdays\\". The story is well told, logically consistent, and arrives at a very powerful and unexpected conclusion. It contains moments of humor but is primarily bittersweet, since Eddie views himself as having lived a life of missed opportunities, lost love, and little consequence.One point of the story is that what appear to be simple situations often mask profound truths and unexpected complexity. The author manages to combine the same elements of seeming simplicity and complexity within this story. The simple language employed is yet perfectly evocative of the possibilities of heaven juxtaposed against the often mundane realities of life. Indeed, many of the diverse aspects of life are touched upon including the effect of war not only on the participants but on the noncombatants as well, parental love and expectations for their children and the meaning of friendship and the role of duty in our lives. Thus if you are interested in an allegorical tale utilizing Eddie Maintenance (the name on his work shirt and adopted by the kids who enjoyed the rides at Ruby Pier) as the means to think about life's meaning, our relationship to God, and ourrole here on Earth, I highly recommend this book. My advice would be to savor it, rather than rush through it. It is only 196 small pages of relatively large type and can be read at a single sitting, but that would not do it justice. I found that I actually enjoyed it more because I had to occasionally put it away for a while to get other tasks accomplished; then I could come back and get reacquainted with Eddie as he proceeded on his journey. Of course, one advantage of the book being so short is that if you do not enjoy it as much as I did you haven't wasted much time.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This story engaged me almost immediately.

Very moving."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a very good book but is far from the tear-jerking, soul-wrenching, eye-opening book that others say it is. If you have a modicum of self-awareness this book shouldn't hold anything that will cause you to re-evaluate your life. With that said, this is a well written if simple book by the same author of Tuesdays With Morrie. The flow of the story is well paced and keeps you interested. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others who are looking for a quick insightful read. However, don't look for psychotherapy between the covers."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"We have come to thoroughly enjoy Mitch Albom's appearances on the TV show \\"Sports Reporters\\", where he can be counted upon for unusual insight and wit. While his wildly popular book \\"The Five People\\" is hardly witty, this novella is for sure perceptive and thought provoking. About an amusement park maintenance man who loses his life at age 83 saving a little girl from sure death at the park, our hero Eddie traverses through heaven meeting five others who have been waiting for him. A couple of them he didn't even know previously show us how human lives interact and intersect in ways we would never expect. While the obvious message is that all our lives have meaning and value, often in surprising ways, Albom's delivery is all of sensitive and inspirational.While clearly the book may appeal more strongly to some than to others, and we suppose an intrinsic belief in some sort of hereafter is somewhat necessary, nonetheless the author has given us a fine contribution to modern literature -- one that causes our thought processes to reverberate long after a pleasant couple of hours of reading have elapsed. Meanwhile, those that find it awesome and uplifting may not be far off the mark."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I couldn't put this book down until I was finished.

It offers a warm picture of how we all will spend our time in heaven, and it doesn't always include those closest to us, but those who have had the most effect on us.

The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a brilliantly crafted novel which takes the reader on a journey through the highs and lows of one man's life - and the interconnecting links between 'strangers'. Teaching us that \\"...there are no strangers, only people we have yet to meet\\".A tear jerker towards the end, this novel is so well written I am excited to read more from this author.

It makes you think about your life and the people that have crossed paths within your lifetime. I could not put the book down and read it in a few days.

Albom beautifully depicts the loving relationship that Eddie and Margurite share, and when Eddie meets his wife in heaven it brought tears to my eyes. It's a must read..."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"On a recent lengthy road trip with my husband and five children, we listened to the CD audio of this book. Very quickly, I sat mesmerized not only by the story itself, but also by the truly great writing ability of the author. I was surprised and very pleased to realize, upon stopping the CD, that every single one of my kids, aged three through twelve, had been listening just as intently - they all hollered \\"turn it back on!!!!\\". We listened to the entire book on that trip and after that, every other book we'd brought with us to listen to paled in comparison. Great job, Mr. Albom! -- you have achieved a writing style that is true quality AND is entertaining to everyone!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Rarely do I feel inspired to write a review. And perhaps I am overly critical. But as a seller I saved this one to read due to its low sales rank. It is entertaining, but far from my view of what might happen. Somehow I expected that if you met five people in heaven that explained your life, the book would end with you waiting for someone to help explain their life. I guess that was suggested. I guess... Just a bit disapointed with the ending. Though it did make me re-evaluate my relationship with Mom, who has gone on, and think about those that may have had something to do with my life that I have not recognized. And of course, perhaps I will be a bit kinder to the love of my life while she is still here. Like the title of this review says. It's a good mint..........Pop"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book on the strong suggestion of a very smart friend of mine as a tool to help combat my often present thoughts of &quot;What is the point of all this? We all die, and once we have been gone for awhile, everyone forgets you and there is no sign that you ever existed - so what is all the work and striving and caring for?&quot; Although fiction, I think this book helped give something of a sense that even though people may not be able to put a name or a face to it, we all affect the people in our lives - sometimes much more profoundly than we realize - and that person goes on to affect someone or something else, and so on. So that countless years later, your influence may be strong (for good or for bad) long after you are gone. This book is especially good for police officers, paramedics, teachers, medical care and social workers and the like - people in the &quot;helping&quot; professions who often tend to wonder if all of their efforts, caring and heart really matter in the end."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As I read Mitch Albom's books, I have come to notice that he seems eager to describe the difference between life in reality and in heaven. And The Five People You Meet in Heaven is no exception; Mitch seemed to show both Eddie's birthdays he had spent and his life after death caused by the accident in his amusement park. At first, Eddie was confused to see the 5 people in heaven, wondering why he was there. Then they let him know what he didn't realize before he died. The 5 people seemed to yearn for happier times than when they had lived. Unfortunately, I'm not really sure how this story ended right now, but I believe Eddie would feel happier eventually in heaven than before his death."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had previously read Tuesdays with Morrie a couple years ago in high school so I decided I should read Mitch Albom's other books since his writing style is simple, which makes his books effortlessly to read. Just like the film, this book is beautifully and simply written. The author begins at Eddie's (the main character and also the tragic hero) death and begins with the stories of each person (out of 5 people) who he comes across in his life with and without knowing. Of course, each person comes with a special lesson. As Eddie travels on this journey, he ultimately comes to rites of passage about how his life has tied in with others. This is a great beach read, or for anytime you want to sit down, relax, and escape from reality. All in all, I would truly recommend this book to anyone of all ages!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Of all issues you could make light or entertainment of, death is no easy task.This book, in my opinion, succeeded.It's an easy, fast read that goes through the classic revisiting your life after death story. It's just very well told. It's emotional without being overwhelming or overbearing, it's light and fun, and has a simple lesson, that is to love the little things people do for each other in life. Not depressing. Not heartbreaking. A light lecture on a sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven tells the story of a man named Eddie, an 83 year old head maintenance person at an amusement park. The introduction of the story describes the setting of this amusement park. Then, the author, Mitch Albom, tells readers Eddie is just minutes away from his death. Now you may all be thinking \\"What kind of story is this, talking about death in the first paragraph?\\". Well, as the author puts it, death, what we think is the ending, is really a whole new beginning. This is certainly the case for Eddie. When he dies, he starts a whole new journey to find out his purpose in life.In the story, Eddie, like many other ordinary people, thinks that his whole life is a waste. He thinks no one has affected his life and he hasn't done so to anyone else. After his death, he pays a visit to the five people that have affected his life most, and discovers how much he really affected the earth and the people in it.Mitch Albom really delivers an eye opener with this one. For anyone who thinks they don't play a role in life, it really assures you that everyone has a purpose. With to-the-point writing, I found myself reading and reading just to find out what would happen next (which is something new for me). This book is definitely a page turner and I finished the book in a couple of days. I applaud Albom's writing style to make it quick and easy to understand, yet interesting and meaningful. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who just wants a quick read to make them feel good about themselves, or anyone who thinks they need a little reassurance."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As a high school student, reading has become something done only when a teacher assigns it. Mitch Albom's novel, The Five People You Meet in Heaven was a refreshing piece of literature that I was not forced to read. His message is something that I will carry with me for a very long time. The novel was not only a page turner, but it was meaningful reading as opposed to some of the other mindless reading that I have done in the past. It makes the reader think about the affect that they might have on a person that may have passed away, as well as the affects we might have on others before we die.By no means was it a morbid book about death or a manual to tell people how to get into heaven. The book was about a man who died on his 83rd birthday in an attempt to save the life of a young girl. When he got to heaven five people were waiting for him, so they could explain his life on earth to him. Albom also used beautiful imagery to describe Eddie's journey through earth and heaven. As I finished the book, it left me wondering who and what I may have an affect on, as well as who may have had an affect on me.I have yet to meet a person who has read this book and not had great things to say about it. I too feel as though everyone should read this book in order for them to realize that life on earth is just a small part of a big picture. The author showed this idea with great success. The Five People you Meet in Heaven, is a prime example of the saying \\"big things come in small packages\\" because within the contents of the small book, a huge massage was being portrayed.Malaika Merid"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was so wonderful - I even read it twice.

Wishful thinking in re: to what awaits us in the afterlife? Perhaps. Yet, who can deny that the \\"mysteries of life\\" are best left undiscovered. Otherwise we would all struggle to alter our destinies at every turn. We are all here for a purpose. 'Life is a journey..not a destination.' And Mitch captures that quite beautifully from start to finish. I am a better person for having read this book. And my parting wish is that others are left with the same sentiment. The world would be a better place for it. Standing ovation for Mitch Albom.

After his death you take his perspective, and encounter a scared girl, regretful old lady, blue freak, army general, and loving wife. They give him their story, showing all lives are connected. The speed of Mitch Albom's book is full of progression. There wasn't a page that I didn't have a question asked or answered, as I flew through Eddie's past. The style that Mitch Albom portrays in this book and many of his books is to give only enough information to the reader, to keep the questions flowing. The theme shown throughout the book is people effect our lives. I sensed this from Eddie and his visiters. I enjoyed this book, because I loved how calm heaven was, and seeing the trial and growth that Eddie went through by meeting five people. This book is fantasy, and is for anyone, ages 10 and up, that enjoys perceptions of heaven. It makes you wonder who your five people will be."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I enjoyed this read so very much. I recommend this book to everyone. There are many messages to be taken away from reading about Eddie's life. Things are seldom the way they appear and this rings true thru this entire story page by page. I finished it in 2 sittings.

I was supposed to read this gradually over a semester in college, but I wound up reading the entire book the first night. I simply could not put it down, it was so good. At first I did not want to read it because the title \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" creeped me out. I thought it was going to be a religious book, but it was not.

I loved this heartwarming story of unusual connections and Eddie's introduction to heaven. Albom's ideas about the afterlife in this story are believable and give hope to the reader that all things after we die turn out well. The lessons learned in this story give powerful meaning to our everyday lives. Albom's melodic tone flows through the story as he tells the life of Eddie and the five people he meets in heaven. It is a story of everlasting love, hope, and twisting conncectings that brings tears to the eyes, for generations to enjoy and embrace."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mr. Albom's interpretation of life after death is skillfully composed. Events during existence in this world for a person (specifically for Eddie, the main character) come alive and become much more meaningful when comprehended after one is dead. Each of the five people is brilliantly connected to the dead in a unique way. Their relationship with Eddie doesn't have to be a close one because every person is believed to be attached to another through coincidences. The happenings narrated of Eddie's life on earth are heartbreaking most of the time. Not in favor of a sad story, this fiction should only be reviewed as a mediocre creation but the writing style and the art of story telling by Mr. Albom are mesmerizing. Therefore, the fiction deserves an accolade for its prose."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was fun to read. My friend told me about this book and so I bought it.

Wounded as a young man in World War II, he was forced to deal having a permanent physical disability for most of his life and is quite bitter about how that fact affected subsequent events throughout over time, feeling he to give up on all of his dreams because of the war and the people he surrounded himself with upon returning home. No doubt Eddie has done a lot of self-reflecting as he has become an old man, and working most of his life at an amusement park was not what was supposed to be in store for him, though a job he took pride in and because he honestly cared about the safety of the people who came there.This story actually begins at the end of Eddie's life, after we are briefly told about who Eddie is as a person. It's his 83rd birthday and we find Eddie just going about his typical mundane work tasks like usual when all of the sudden he is called into action and dies a hero as he tries to save a little girl from being crushed by a ride in the park. After dying, Eddie awakes again in Heaven, but soon discovers that it is not the Garden of Eden like he had always believed it to be, but a place where your life is explained to you by five people who were in it. Some of the people who Eddie meets these meetings must provide a long introduction since, when Eddie was alive, he was unaware of their existence. For others there is no need for an introduction since they played a prominent role in Eddie's life. Yet all have played a significant impact in his life and also changed each other's paths as well. As Eddie meets each person, he learns how closely intertwined his life was with theirs both knowingly and unknowingly and in turn learns something more about himself. Through their stories, he finds the meaning of his own existence.I'm somewhat familiar with author Mitch Albom because of his sports writing, and because of the many good things I heard in the last few years regarding his inspirational non-fiction read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" whom several of my friends had recommended to me. With that in mind, I selected this book \\"The Five People\\" because of its interesting title and premise, and for the most part, I was not disappointed. I really enjoyed the beginning of the book leading up to the main character's death. Reading about Eddie just going about his daily routine with no clue that he was down to the last few moments of a life he seemingly had so many regrets about was gripping, really, and Albom did a good job at capturing that unique angle.Perhaps the best part of the entire book is the first couple of chapters, actually, because once Eddie meets the five people in heaven, the book is a little more along the lines \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" - somewhat cheesy and predictable in its message of reflecting and appreciating all the good right before you while you're living, though certainly much more new age with the characters, especially with how Albom describes them all being connected with Eddie and each other in some way. I actually found myself more drawn to these characters and their various relationships with each other than I was to Eddie as the book went along.\\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" certainly fits the major characteristics of what we consider today as inspirational fiction. The story's main character is someone we can identify with - both with his hopes and dreams, as well as his insecurities and regrets - and someone we see as overcoming in the end in an inspirational way (here, Eddie overcomes the doubt about a life squandered and dies a hero). While steeped in religious tones throughout - we are talking about what the Judeo-Christian concept of Heaven is like here - the book is more about a replenished soul than it is espousing specific religious points of view. The book follows a gentle narrative with few examples of anything too racy or controversial, and requires the reader to do a lot of self-reflection about his or her own life while they read it, something quite common in this genre."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I didn't buy the book, got it from the library.It was an excellent read!!!

Still, it's a book I am glad I read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book is very fresh. The author uses a unique way to continue the story. You may notice this from the first page of the book, saying \\"It might seem strange to start a story with an ending.\\"In the first chapter, author describes the events occurring one hour before Eddie (the protagonist) dies. When you flip through the pages you'll feel you are in the middle of a maze. Because the author used flashbacks to flow the story, the readers should connect all the plots together to understand what's going on. Don't worry!. A well-planned structure that the author brought in the book leads you a natural way-out from the maze as you read through.It sounds like a normal fantasy because the story takes place in heaven but, the book contains five serious lessons.

Not only was the book filled with very bad theology, it was very poorly written. The word that just kept popping in my head was contrived. The author loves to tell stories and I love a good story - but Five People wasn't a good story. The other issue that really bothered me with this book was the author's completely idiotic view of heaven - what an incredible waste of eternity! I think Albom is one of those people who just love their own work - his description of heaven changing colors...from blue to green to cotton candy...and on and on and on. It's like listening to that guy who just loves the sound of his own voice!Plus, the resolution that Albom's main character Eddie - the one who dies and goes to heaven to meet his five people - was ridiculous at best. His typical \\"now that you understand, it makes everything alright concept\\" was awful - especially the part when Eddie learns about his father. The classic \\"abandoned son of a bad father\\" is supposed to understand why his dad was such a loser - but Albom doesn't even accomplish that. Eddie's dad was a bad father - plain and simple. I just feel bad for Eddie spending his eternity in this multi-colored heaven still being separated from his father and having no closure to his life. I would suggest that a person spend their time reading a book that is preparing them for heaven like NT Wright's Justification or RC Spoul's Faith Alone instead of reading Albom's worthless story about Eddie and his miserable life that continues forever!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"An interesting take on what awaits us after death makes its claim. Great book about how the simple things are what really makes a life important. Shows the life of a simple man and how he positively (unbeknown to him) impacted the lives and people around him.

Great book for anyone who has a little hope or needs a little hope that this life and what comes after are more than what we think."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Book- \\"the five people you meet in heaven\\"==========================================Mitch Albom's \\"the five people you meet in heaven\\" is a small novel that is pretty quick and easy to read. It is an interpretation of how heaven looks like through the eyes of the main character Eddie. On the basis of five different encounters, Eddie learns the lessons of life, sacrifice, anger, love and forgiveness. The book begins with the end, a popular literary novelty. After detailing the last moments of Eddie's death, Albom then lists out how heaven looks like through Eddie's conversations with five persons: Captain, Ruby, his father, Marguerite (his wife) and a little girl by the name of Tala. From each of these characters, Eddie learned something in his death what he could not have understood in life.1) BLUE MAN: The general lesson is that any one story can be viewed from two different angles. For example, stories can be viewed either from a sad or happy angle.\\"No life is a waste. The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we are alone.\\" (Blue Man, 50)2) CAPTAIN: That's what heaven is. You get to make sense of your yesterdays. This is reflection. Eddie learned that the Captain sacrificed his life to save Eddie and the other men.\\"Sacrifice is a part of life. It's supposed to be. It's not something to regret. It's something to aspire to. Little sacrifices. Big sacrifices. A mother works so her son can go to school. A daughter moves home to take care of her sick father.\\" (Captain, 93)\\"Sometimes when you sacrifice something precious, you're not really losing it. You're just simply passing it on to someone else.\\" (Captain, 94)3) RUBY: In his conversation with Ruby, Eddie was urged to forgive his dad. \\"No one is born with anger. And when we die, the soul is freed of it. But now, here, in order to move on, you must understand why you felt what you did, and why you no longer need to feel it.\\" While in life, Eddie felt that his dad is the reason for his \\"loss of freedom, loss of career, the loss of hope.\\" (142)Holding anger is a poison. It eats you from the inside. We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade. And the harm we do, we do to ourselves.4) MARGUERITE: Eddie learned that his wife died while trying to make up to him, after feeling guilty about her unkind words to Eddie who was at the races at that time. Unfortunately, Eddie only found out the circumstances surrounding her accident only in heaven.\\"Love, like rain, can nourish from above, drenching couples with a soaking joy. But sometimes, under the angry heat of life, love dries on the surface and must nourish from below, tending to its roots, keeping itself alive.\\" (164)\\"Lost love is still love, Eddie. It takes a different form, that's all. You can't see their smile or bring them food or tousle their hair or move them around a dance floor. But when those senses weaken, another heightens. Memory. Memory becomes your partner. You nurture it. You hold it. You dance with it.........Life has to end, love doesn't.\\"5) TALA: Eddie learned that his actions during the war in the Philippines, has inflicted serious burns inflicted on this innocent girl. If forgiveness is difficult for Eddie, it comes naturally to this girl. The contrast in willingness to forgive is dramatic and stark. Little did Eddie know that this is the same girl he tried to save just before his death at the amusement park Freddy's Free Fall ride. Only then, does Eddie eventually goes 'home.'My CommentsAlbom's view of heaven is existentialist in nature. He teaches a form of appreciating what we have in life, and to learn to see with eyes of love, forgiveness and sacrifice. In order to be truly 'home,' one will need to traverse the journeys of life, sacrifice, forgiveness and love. He claims that the secrets of heaven is a form of \\"each affects the other and the other affects the next, and the world is full of stories, but the stories are all one.\\" In terms of helping us to put together broken lives, this idea is redemptive, in the sense that there is ultimate meaning in life. I will make three general observations about Albom's interpretation of heaven and the purpose of life. Firstly, Albom believes that there is a way that people can connect broken pieces of their lives together into one integrated meaning. This is optimistic, but like the Blue Man, it can also turn the other way. I question what is actually its fundamental premise for such a presupposition. Secondly, heaven is more like a resolution of questions rather than anything else. It will tend to paint heaven like a giant encyclopedia of \\"1001 answers to all the questions you ever have.\\" That makes heaven too encyclopedic for my comfort. Thirdly, the book is more 'moral' in nature rather than 'spiritual.' There is nothing wrong with it, except that it treats heaven more like a moral device than a place for eternal living. In the Bible, the idea of heaven is more than simply resolving questions. It is more than simply a place of bliss and angelic songs. It is essentially a place where God is, and in the presence of God, nothing else truly matters. Hebrews 4 gives us a glimpse of such a condition.\\"So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his.\\" (Heb 4:9-10)If Christians want to learn about heaven, the Scriptures must be one source they should never exclude. Heaven is that eternal sabbatical rest, not alone but with God in his kingdom of beings declared righteous in Christ. Otherwise, without Scripture as an anchor, there is a tendency described by John Milton, the 17th century English poet as:\\"The mind is its own place, and in itself, can make heaven of Hell, and a hell of Heaven.\\"[first published in http://yapdates.blogspot.com/2008/05/book-five-people-you-meet-in-heaven.html]"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was such a delightful book to read. Inspired by his uncle, Mitch Albom tells the story of a man leading an obscure life who died suddenly and tragically while trying to save a child. However, before he can pass on to eternity, Eddie was required to meet five people in heaven who would explain his purpose for living. With each encounter, Eddie learned as to why and how these unlikely people played a part in his life on earth. In the final encounter, Eddie was faced with the very thing that had been haunting him ever since he became a soldier during WWII.If heaven is anything like what Albom depicts then we can just imagine who we would meet. The book's message is that no matter how insignificant one's life may seem, there's a purpose and reason for it. Our life is not just one story but part of a great storyline that can never be fully told until we have completed our existence here on earth. One of my favorite line is \\"no life is a waste. The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we are alone.\\" How true that is. Yes life can be mundane, trying and just plain awful sometime, but if we could remind ourselves that there are others who share the same sentiment, perhaps we can be encouraged to keep going until the end"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Spirituality is the most important ingredient in my life. [...] I am always on the outlook for books that enhance my spirit. This one definitely did it for me in the most heartwarming way.It is a delightful fantasy that paints a picture of what it might be like to meet people on the other side. The book made me realize that those people might not be exactly who I would think them to be. It made me think about how one never knows what lives they may touch in unknown, yet significant ways.This is a sweet and sentimental tale that is guaranteed to touch your heart. I cried and I cried at the end of the book. They were tears of joy. What it did for me was to connect with loved ones within my own life who had passed on. My heart absolutely glowed after reading it.It is the kind of book that can be read in one sitting. As I recall, I didn't stop reading it until I was done. When I had finished, I felt as if my heart and soul had totally woken up. I have nothing but the highest praise for it. It was one of the best books that I read that year!Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I first read this book a couple of years ago but started reading it again last Fall to a friend with terminal cancer. Because of the geographical distance between us, I began reading the book to him over the telephone. Although sometimes we could only get through one or two chapters a week, he would often call me and ask me to read to him. The book was a much better source of reassurance to him than I could ever have been that his life had far more meaning and purpose than he realized. The reinforcement that everything happens for a reason, that there is no such thing as coincidence, that we are all a part of each others' lives, and that love is eternal, was all a great comfort to him. I finished reading the book to him at his bedside less than 48 hours before he died. Although he could not respond verbally, I know he heard the message and was comforted, as I was."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's novel begins an hour before the death of its main character, an 83-year-old maintenance worker at a boardwalk amusement park named Eddie. Eddie dies trying to rescue a small girl from a falling gondola that breaks loose from a freefall ride in a freak accident.The story is Mitch Albom's vision of Heaven, a place where the meaning of your life is explained to you by five people whose lives intersected your own, some of them in ways you might not have even noticed.It's a story of closure and a story of purpose, of making sense out of the twists and injustices of life and of finding meaning in the small interactions that happen every day.While the main plot of the story takes place in (a rather nondenominational) heaven, the book consists mosly of flashbacks, and it is in these sequences where Albom's writing really shines.His characters are complex, richly detailed, and full of hidden beauty and intensity. From the blue-skinned sideshow freak to Eddie's abusive father to his commanding officer in the war, each character has their own fascinating story to tell. Albom weaves these seamlessly into the narrative and constructs a wonderfully detailed background for the Ruby Point Amusement Park, which is the main earthly location of the story.But while Albom's vision of Eddie's life and his friends and family is brilliant, his version of heaven is dull and uninspired by comparison. There are few surprises, few answers beyond the trite \\"everything happens for a purpose\\" cliches, and Albom goes out of his way to dodge any kind of controversy. There is barely a mention of God, and certainly no discussion of any particular religious faiths.To some extent, that fits with Eddie's character. He's not particularly religious, and certainly not religious in a dogmatic way. He's the perfect character to avoid asking questions that might get readers upset and ruin the feel-good message.And it works for the most part. But Eddie still comes off as frustratingly passive, particularly for a man who was not only aggressively independent, but legitimately heroic during his life. He barely questions the five-person scenario, and noddingly accepts his five lessons, much as the author seems to expect his readers to accept them.I feel like this story falls short as a philosophical or inspirational work. Fortunately, though, it succeeds on many levels as a story thanks to the richly detailed characters and background, which keep it an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this little book on an airplane. It's simple and profound. It tells me that I need to say thank you more often so that folks I meet don't feel ignored, neglected, or of no consequence."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I just finished Tuesdays with Morrie. Now I'm in the middle of The Five People You Meet in Heaven. So far, I'm very entertained.I would recommend to all readers."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"May I just say, I loved this book. It is now my favorite book and I recommend that everyone reads it. I was recommended this book from my mother who is a literature teacher. Now, usually I do not read fiction books as I am more of a non-fiction kind of guy, but I decided to give this book a chance.The book starts out by introducing the main character, Eddie. Eddie is a maintenance man at an ocean-side pier amusement park. His job is to make sure that all the rides in the park are in good shape and are safe for the park goers to enjoy. The narrator describes how it is Eddie's last day to live on this earth and what he does on this normal workday. Little does Eddie know, one of his rides is about to break and kill Eddie. Next, Eddie experiences the trip to heaven. Once he gets there, he finds out that heaven is not like people on earth think it is. Instead, Eddie finds out that five people await him in heaven to help him understand his life on earth. Using the teachings of these people, Eddie understands that even the life of an amusement park maintenance worker is an important one.There really not many things I did not like about this book, however, I think that Albom could have done a bit of a better job describing how Earth is like without Eddie and how the world is affected by his loss.Once again, I loved this book. This book has so much to teach about life and that how one action affects more than you think it does. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is in the mood for a quick read and wants to learn about how to live their life. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'll be as brief as this small book of 196 pages. Albom has written in simple declarative prose a book that is both engaging and life-affirming. Although infected with some of the same gimmickry found in F. Scott Fitgerald's recently revived \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\\" it can be better excused by its \\"higher\\" purpose. The perspective of heaven, real or imagined, enlightens us as to what life is really all about."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is one of those simple, beautifully-written pieces that teaches us the lessons in living that we so dearly need. It's a moving account of the breadth of one whole life, that helps us to examine our own from a mature and loving perspective. Albom's novel is written in a clever entertaining way too! Bottom line, this is a great little book that helps us to find and focus on the good in ourselves so that we can create self-love, peace and meaning in our lives."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was not exactly a knock-out in my opinion, but definitely a nice solid piece of literary entertainment. Mitch Albom has a nice quality to his writing--it's concise, complete, all wrapped up in a nice coherent bundle of a book. I like that. He doesn't introduce anything radically new--the idea of what the after world might be like, or a man's discovery of the purpose/meaning of his life. It's all been done, and this book doesn't smack you with anything that makes your jaw drop in some blinding epiphany, but it's good writing and worth the read. Albom is clearly well versed in this sort of style; with his journalistic background, he doesn't waste words, he uses them like a seasoned craftsman. He creates a story that is interesting and keeps you turning the page. And though it's a fantastical work with an optimistic, tear-jerking quality, Albom doesn't betray the realism of Eddie as a character, a likely human being."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As a teenage girl, the idea of reading a book that my Mom highly recommended didn't exactly thrill me. She asked me to just give it a shot, so I picked it up... and then I could not put it down. The Five People You Meet in Heaven was a book that made me think about life in ways that I never had before. The way things fell into place, and the role the characters played took me into a whole new world of fantasy yet real meaning.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is about an 83 year old man, Eddie who is coming to the end of his life, although he is completely unaware of it. When the unthinkable happens at the same job he has been working at for over 60 years, Eddie leaves earth and travels through the fictional journey of what happens on his way to heaven.In order to get to his own heaven Eddie needs to visit five different people in their heavens. Author Mitch Albom gives each character their own heaven, their own vision of the perfect place to spend eternity. Each person that Eddie meets has something to teach him, each one has somehow affected Eddie's life in a dramatic way. Some of the people Eddie knew. Others he had never met before in his life, but they still had an impact.I would recommend Albom's book to any one who has an open mind to life. People who are willing to take a second look at life, and the chances they get would love this book. The Five People You Meet in Heaven, was an outstanding book. It showed me that everyone has connections to everyone else weather you know it or not. It opened my eyes to a whole new world of hope and opportunity."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I wasn't at all interested in reading this book. It's been a while since literary fantasy appealed to me, even if I did force myself to read some Harry Potter books just to see what all the fuss was about.How I came upon Five People and happened to read it is a story in itself so we won't go into that- it's enough to say that, with a sigh, I sat down to read it.And couldn't put it down.Scattered throughout this charming explanation for what life is truly all about are amazing insights into personalities and events. This is a book for everyone and whether or not the reader agrees with the various philosophies and musings, it would be hard to come away without having stumbled upon something new to think about. Even something profound!If you're not much of a reader the simplicity of the story and the language should appeal to you. If you're somewhat prejudiced against stories that pretend to interpret the deepest secrets of the most spiritual and invisible things, you'll still enjoy this if you can just open up your mind and let the story in."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Beautiful is the only way to describe this book. I bought it yesterday, finished it this morning. Simply but touchingly told. Perhaps 'Boy' (writing earlier today) will understand this book more as he gets older.Tolkien believed that people should not read his books until they were adults because they would lose the emotional importance of being able to connect with the story. -as a child you can't always grasp subtle meanings and half the book is lost. This is probably what happened with 'Boy'. -Try reading it again in 5 or 6 years.The simplicity of the writing should not be taken as detrimental to the book. The writing is simple so that it does not hide the meanings behind unnecessary long words. The book is simply so that it does not exclude people who are not comfortable with long words! Anybody could read this book and experience the wisdom within, not just the people who read Austen and The Canterbury Tales for fun!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The first captivating part of the book was the numerous amounts who rave about the book. I trust most peoples judgement on books, especially when almost the entire world seems to have read this book. It also has been listed as one the top five books in the Orlando Sentinel for the past couple weeks. The title alone, draws a person to stop, take a look at the book, and read more about it. Once I had read the excerpt, I was intrigued by the depth and creativity unleased in such a quaint amount of pages, and determined to complete it. I finished the book in a matter of hours, it was so good that I did nothing but read it during class, while walking, riding in the car, and didn't eat until I was done. Everything added to the completion of the book and a person's understanding. A reader was allowed to consume background information while the story was taken place. I thought it was one of the best books I have read that can appeal to all different types of readers of many ages."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven by Mitch Albom is an extrodinary book that teaches others how to live their life before they die.

As Eddie travels through heaven, he meets five people that either they had an impact on them or they him. Either way, these people were significant parts in the \\"nothing existance\\" that Eddie thought he had lived while on earth. Mitch Albom has written a wonderful nevel that has had a huge impact on the way you think about the lives you come into contact to on a regular basis. I waould say that while captivating, this particular novel would take a more sophistocated reader about ages 12 and up to finish. i would reccomend this book to anyone who ever wonders what life might mean or who loves to read and is looking for a new aspect of life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A friend of mine told me to read this book a long time ago.

If not, I give it away. Every book doesn't have to be life-changing, but if it can make me think, laugh, cry, inform me or fill an otherwise boring evening, it's done it's job for me.This book does that. Granted, I was thinking of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" meets John Edwards when I read it, but I have to admit it was a thought provoking, uplifting read. I enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Depending on your own personal beliefs, you may find this incredibly moving or a complete waste of time. I think Albom did a really fine job in not specifically catering his story to fit a single set of ideas or beliefs. By creating an overview of Eddie's life through the people he meets in heaven, he reminds readers to live each day to its fullest and that every moment counts. I thought this was a very clever way to get a message across to readers, and I think I'll remember this novel for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was disappointed in this book.

To me, it was just \\"ok.\\" I would not recommend it to a friend, and I wouldn't read it again."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book, as the title suggests is told from the perspective of the main character's afterlife. Although many of the reviewers focus on its depiction of the afterlife, this book is about so much more than that.It's actually a journey that a man takes to find meaning in what he perceived to be a mundane, lackluster existence. It is a reminder that each of us touches the lives of others, and even the least of us may affect the lives of others for bad or for good.It is sad without being maudlin. I wouldn't suggest reading it in a crowded place if you are prone to tears.Yes, it is a simple story. However, it is a story that moves with a purpose from beginning to end. It is a case where the tale is much more important than the telling.I highly recommend this to anyone who is struggling to find his or her own place in the world or who may feel that life \\"should\\" have been different. The reference to heaven should not deter people from other belief systems from reading this life affirming book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Have you ever wondered who you would meet in heaven?

When I finally got around to reading it, I was surprised at the degree with which I related to the story. I think most of us ask ourselves, at some point in our lives, whether we're really making a difference. This story helped me think about this question from a profoundly different perspective.

There are no pretentions to literary grandeur or fancy writing styles. It doesn't need them. The sweetness (that some label as saccharine) is quite touching and poignant. In a word - special.I have no doubt that this lovely little work will touch many in a positive and warm way.

Eddie, the main character is someone we all can relate to. The book did bring me to tears a few times but it was well worth it. I am going to make it a point to try to read this every few years because it gives me a kind of peace about everything when things aren't at their best. It brings me to a relaxed peaceful state where I can smile and know that even after death there is life and that one day I will be reunited with the people I've lost.I love this book. I just can't believe it took me so long to find out about it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a quaint story of Eddie, a maintenance mechanic at a seaside amusement park. Eddie has just died. This tale is his journey through the afterlife.I enjoyed &quot;The Five People...&quot; quite a bit - more than expected to say the least. I thought this would be a heavy-handed story, but was actually quite light and refreshing especially with its simple, yet powerful, message. It was amusing and fun in some parts, nostalgic and sad in others - pretty much as you might expect a trip towards heaven to be.I wasn't blown away though, as I found I wasn't particularily attached to Eddie in one way or another. And though the message appealed to me, I thought Albom had watered it down so that it would appeal to a broader audience.It's an easy read, and won't take you long. It's enjoyable, and worth the time, but by no means an amazing novel. It's good, but not great. I recommend it for a trip to the cottage, or a quiet Sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought this book was one of the best books I have ever read.

It was thin book, and that gave me the impression that the author was lazy and didn't write to a full extent. However, one day I was in Barnes and Nobles, and this book was 30 percent off. So I gave it a try, since I had nothing else to read, and because I heard some pretty good reviews about it. I was thankful I picked it off the shelf. This book is simple, but not in a thin way. The simplicity of it gives more impact than long flowing text that doesn't get you anywhere. The meaning of death and life is clear in this book, and the deepness of it will touch your heart. Human nature is captured in here, and, while reading this book, you may find something in common with Eddie. It is an entertaining and deep read, and for anyone looking for a good meaningful novel, this is it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Beautiful! The story told by Albom is one that will be read by generations.

Told with such vividness that you can see the colours, smell the air, and fell the tears. But they are not tears of the characters, they are your own."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was a wonderful read. The main theme is that everyone you meet has some effect on you and the way you will continue in life. Even what you think of as the smallest encounters with strangers may affect you in a large way. I won't go into the details of the story because that is best left for you to read and learn about as you go. This book really makes you think about your life and how you are affected by everyone in it, as well as how you affect others.At times, while reading it, I was frustrated by the lack of answers, just as the main character. I really felt like I was in his shoes. I think that is one of the things that makes this book so well loved, though, because it keeps you reading and doesn't give everything away. It makes you think. I kept hoping that the next page would provide the answers that I so sought, and while each page may have answered one question, it also brought at least two more.I truly recommend this book to everyone, young and old. It will be one that you won't forget quickly."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Based on the reviews, I knew this book would be good, but I didn't expect to be as deeply moving as it was.

I myself sometimes wonder what my life is all about and though I don't believe my haven will be like Eddies, I like the idea.

He remembered lunging. He remembered hitting the platform. He felt her two small hands in his.\\" The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a book that starts at the end. Mitch Albom has written a wonderful novel about a man who goes through life and comes to realize the reason for his being.A narrator follows Eddie's footsteps as he meets all the people in Heaven. Ruby Pier also is an important place in this book. It's where it all begins.Eddie is an eighty-two year old man working at the Ruby Pier amusement park as maintenance. He has worked there for basically all his life. On his eighty second birthday, a rollercoaster cart tragically pummels down. Eddie sacrifices himself to try to save a girl caught under the cart.The main character also happens to be my favorite character. Eddie's character showed growth through out the book. He learns to forgive and about sacrifices. All the people he meets along the way had played a significant role in Eddie's life. They're also the people who explain to Eddie the reasons for life. The theme of this book is mostly based on religion. The main character goes through five main phases of Heaven to realize the real meaning of life.I would recommend this book to basically anyone, especially the people who have really big imaginations. It really stretches it to the limit. I really enjoyed reading this book because it starts and begins differently than others.

Eddie awakens in the afterlife(where he met five people in heaven) While Eddie is in Heaven the five people come and talk to him how they were all in his life.The book is magical and interesting thought of heaven itself.I would recommend the book to people who like inspirational, magical and enchanting stories. I thought the book was interesting but I also thought is was a little confusing. I thought it was a little confusing because it kept going back to Eddies birthday then back to when he was in heaven. I didn't really get those parts byt other than that I thought it was very interesting how he met five people in heaven and the people all had to do with Eddies life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I saw this book a year ago and wanted to read it, and finally took it out of the library (sorry Amazon, but yes, the library)and I couldn't put it down. I stayed up way too late two nights in a row... but WOW what an ending! The Five People You Meet in Heaven was interesting,touching and easy reading and it certainly lived up to my expectations. This is a great book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"The Five people you meet in heaven\\" is a great book. It may contradict your view on heaven, but it is so original and imaginative that you have to like it. I like the way it shows different perspectives, like when Eddie finds out why his dad died or when he learns about the blue man's life, a person he thought was of no importance in his own life. I also like how you learned a little bit more of his history and background in every chapter. The story showed that all people have a purpose in life, even if they don't know it. Eddie felt like his life was forced on him the entire time he was living, but in the end he found out how important his life was. I think we could all learn a very important lesson from his story."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I too could not put it down as I started reading it. To the reader who only gave it one star, they need to relax. Sure, people know that their lives are changed by other people, far off occourences etc. But, this story was about a man who didn't know that, who felt he contributed to nothing in his life. Only after meeting his five people does he realize that is not the case. Again I suggest that this is a book worth reading. It's very engaging and a quick read. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a wonderful book! I truly could not put the book down. It's delightful, thought provoking, and a wonderfully written. Mitch Albom has a true gift for story-telling. I was awed by the unending love &quot;Eddie&quot; (the main character) had for his deceased wife. A high recommendation on this one!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book only took me 1 day to finish because I became so connected to each of the five people Eddie meets in Heaven after his passing. I attended a good friend's funeral yesterday and this book somehow gave me the strength to know that she is in a better place now.Not only do you feel the pain that Eddie endures in his lifetime, but you gain an understanding of how precious our time on Earth can be. Whether we realize it or not, each and every person that crosses our path will touch our lives in some way.We all ask &quot;why?&quot; things happen the way that they do. The Five People you Meet in Heaven inspires you to believe that our lives will continue to flourish long after our physical body has said goodbye.The most valuable lesson that you learn as you read the final words in The Five People you Meet in Heaven is to let your friends &amp; family know how much you love them each &amp; every day because we are never guaranteed a tomorrow.XOXOXO"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a very heartfelt and tender book with a simple message at its core: You matter. What you do matters.Eddie is a maintenance man at an amusement park on the Jersey shore. He has lived a &quot;nothing&quot; life. He dies in an accident at the park, and then his life's meaning is revealed to him. It is wonderful and moving journey. It is full of life, which is a bit ironic since the book is ostensibly about a man's death.Not all of Mitch Albom's writing clicks. Some of it veers off into treacle. Some of it is a bit cliche - &quot;He was changed forever by the war...&quot; Some of the technique falls a little flat, such as the opening where Eddie's last hour on earth is counted down. Yet I was drawn in by the message of love at the core of the story.A great book for a friend or loved one. My wife got it for me for Valentine's Day and I thought it was a gift full of love."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book on a Sunday afternoon. It was written in a way to make the reader more insightful. It allowed the reader to ponder questions such as &quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot; and &quot;Why am I here?&quot; without being too preachy. The thing I liked about the book was that there was nothing particulary special about the main character. He was an everyday guy who lead what he felt was an ordinary life. This gives the rest of us hope with the idea that even though we may not be able to see it, our lives really do touch others in ways we never thought imaginable. This is a book that will encourage you to think about your own life and the way in which you want to live the rest of it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"What a wonderful book. It is so uplifting. It caused me to step back and look at my own life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A refreshing and inspiring book about heaven as seen through the eyes of a carnival worker. It's a wonderful view of what heaven might actually be like and makes you think, &quot;perhaps heaven really isn't white puffy clouds and angels floating past, but where we lived, died and those we loved.&quot;A wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's novel is one of the greatest novels I have ever read - for the simple reason that it was not AT ALL what I expected. From reading reviews, summaries, and the title, I expected a spiritual, perhaps preachy, but still interesting book. What I got instead was one of the best symbolic and literal combination tale on the meaning of life.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is full of exciting surprises on each page. It combines the page-turning thrill of an action novel with the simplicty and beauty of a poem. You may not agree with Albom's viewpoints, and maybe you'll even think he is being preachy. But it is well worth the risk.Albom presents five main lessons (and there are many more in there) that every human I have ever met could certainly stand to learn. Had I known what I would get out of this novel, I would have paid three times the price."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a wonderfully colorful tale. The story of Eddie was emotional, and well written. The author kept you going throughout, always wondering what would happen to sorrowful character next. What little clue about himself would he learn, and he would teach it? Albom did a really great job with this book! READ IT!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I must say I had been intrigured by this book when I heard about it. I bought it yesterday and could not put it down. It is an incredible story of spirituality and forgiveness. I highly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought this book because I so enjoyed \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\", and I am not disappointed one bit. Mitch Albom has a unique style of writing that will either appeal to one or not. I feel because he is a journalist first, his writing style reflects that in that he writes short, quick, and to the point. He doesn't go into \\"over detail\\" - something I detest in books.The main character of Eddie is a man I think a lot of people will be able to relate to. He is everyman. Neither outstanding nor evil. Just.....ordinary, but likable. At the beginning of the book we know very little about Eddie, other than what he looks like and what he is experiencing that particular day.However, through the 5 people he meets in heaven, we learn just who Eddie was. And we are glad we had the opportunity to meet him. Along the way Eddie even finds out a lot of himself, and his discovery of himself through others is interesting.This is not the tissue dampening book that \\"Morrie\\" was. In fact, I closed the book happy that I had met Eddie and cheering for him in the end. This was a man that, even though I never met him, I would have liked to.For those who have strict, unforgiving boundaries of what heaven and spirituality mean, they will find this a difficult book to get through. It does not follow the normal, orthodox Christian view of what is supposed to happen to one in the afterlife. But if one is open to differing viewpoints and interesting concepts, if one likes to cheer on the \\"good guy\\", if one likes to think that good ultimately prevails then this book just might be what you're looking for. Curl up in front of a fireplace with a good cup of something warm and this book, and prepare to meet Eddie - a man not easily forgotten!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I found this book to be a quick, lovely read about the meaning of life and what each person's heaven might be. It goes far beyond the theme of \\"a one-size-fits-all\\" type of heaven as we all expect (or hope!) to experience. It rallies around the theme that we are all interconnected and that we influence the lives of people around us more than we realize.I read this book in a day and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not one that I call a \\"keeper\\", (ie., a book that stays part of my permanent library) but it is one that I'm giving as a gift to many of my friends and family because it has a message that is just too special not to share."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"and it really is one.Thanks,friend,and thanks,author.The latter DOES take a risk with his topic,and you are NOT obliged to share his speculation of our afterlife.But it does make you wonder,it feeds your thoughts and YOUR specific speculation of what might become of us when we eventually end our days on this earth.Thoughtprovoking probably best sums up this unusual book.Read and think."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was suggested to me by one of the authors I publish while I was doing a booksigning myself. I decided to purchase it because I had heard the title before. I returned to my hotel that night, opened it, and never put it back down until I was finished. A quick, easy read, this book is not one for people seeking a \\"deep book.\\" However, it gives an interesting spin on what happens to people after we die and how those we cross paths with throughout our lives all truly play a significant part in our existence. The main character is killed while trying to save a child from being hurt on an amusement park ride. Once he gets to heaven, he sees people he had almost forgotten all about and they each teach him a valuable lesson about his life. The author has an incredible imagination, one I can't help but admire, and this is a cute book (about a heavy subject--death) that most would sincerely enjoy."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'm not joking - This book truly does not end. Even after I have finished the last page, I kept recalling every detail of the chapters. Every chapter makes you think. After reading this book, I begin to pay more attention to the people and things around me, and I have learned to love and to be loved, to forgive and to let go. If Heaven really is a place like the one described by Mr. Albom, I believe death will no longer be a fear to us anymore, for we will know, we are forever loved - no matter what."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"For those of you who have read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" by the same author and liked it, you'll love this. It's a \\"to-the-heart\\" type of book describing the author's idea of heaven. It gives a unique and truly insightful viewpoint into one person's life that is sure to inspire meaningful reflection on one's own existence. You can read it in a few hours and get it for only a couple of bucks, used, so why not give it a chance?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If you read only one book this summer, this should be it. Well written and a quick read. You'll pick it up and before you know it, it is over. You'll laugh, you'll shed a few tears, and most of all, it will make you think. If you've ever been to a fair or a carnival as a child, you'll feel like you're back there. The feel-good book of the summer. It's a book that you can read over and over."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was a big disappointment and cannot even hold a flame to Tuesday's with Morrie.

My brother had this book, and I was bored one day and read it in about 2 hours. I didn't just read this book, I inhaled it.Unlike David, I don't know what &quot;type&quot; of reader category I fall into - I just love books. I love any type of good story, anything that will catch my attention and take me away to another place.This was one of those books. It was an easy-to-follow story, told very simply, but beautifully. It grabbed hold of me at the first line, and kept hanging on until the very touching end.And, as David said, the last page *is* a doozy. (And DON'T CHEAT! Wait until you get there!)This book was *awesome*...and definite must read (and I *must steal* it from my brother's library!)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"i read this book in the bath tub and loved it.

It deals with one of the questions we say to ourselves, &quot;What have I accomplished in life?&quot;, &quot;Have I made any impact on anyone's life?&quot;The five people Eddie met in heaven really took me by surprise. Only 1 out of the 5 people I expected him to meet in heaven were there. The rest took me by complete surprise which drew me further into the story. Eddie's story tells you that even the smallest things he did in life have had a huge impact on another or the sacrafices people made for him, things he took for granted, had a huge effect on the person he is today.This is a book that everyone can enjoy, even those who are non-religious. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought this was going to be a religious book but I had heard the book was good so I turned inside and read a page.

This has created a whole new perspective on life and death for me. You will never know who or what will effect your life. You don't know who may have died in order to save your life.

Extremely unique and facinating, I really enjoyed in particular the second person he met. How cool it would be if we all had this opportunity after death! The ONLY reason I didn't give five stars was disappointment with the ending ; it seemed like lots of time was devoted to the first four and a rushed, abrupt meeting with the last individual (almost as if the author bored of writing and just wanted to finish!)

It lingers long after reading, prompting much introspection. It probably merits 5 stars, but for me it wasn't quite perfect enough.The main character is an elderly, decent man that has lived a long, fairly grim, life. It is an interesting life, but, for me, his life didn't parallel real life.Generally speaking, in my experience, lives are filled with peaks and valleys, good and bad, easy and difficult, fun and not so much. This character's life is so grim, and largely depressing, that I just couldn't identify with him. I felt sorry for him, but could not really empathize.And, it was very surprising that of the 5 people in his heaven, he only knew 2 of them during his life.Still, I strongly recommend this book. It is unforgettable."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have purchased this book many times over, from the time I first read it I wanted my friends and family to read it also.

I finished the book in the hope that the conclusion would be redeeming.In the end,It left just an emply feeling...."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I usually don't like Mitch Albom's books. The fact that they're bound like oversized greeting cards, I think, is symbolic of the excessive sentimentality in his stories. This book, his first novel, is no exception.The reason why I gave it two stars instead of one is because the premise is experimental and interesting. But, Albom's sugary prose and (ugh!) dialogue nearly sent my pancreas into shock. The way the book starts, with a potentially gripping rescue of a little girl, could have sounded more fresh than it did. And the dialogue between Eddie and his wife was very over-the-top.Bottom line, if you liked &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;, then you might like this book. But I didn't, so I don't. Sorry."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"We'll never know, but I believe that if Mitch Albom had not just written the appealing &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;, this book either would not have been deemed worthy of publishing or would have sunk like a stone.Why do I say that? Let me count the ways:1) It's BORING. The main character does not engage my interest. Even his love story and his war experiences are unexciting.2) The writing is BAD. Physical descriptions seem arbitrary and superimposed on the story. The language is clunky. The sentences don't flow. I have nothing against sports writers--I read the sports pages first every day--but this fish is way out of water.3) The message of the book is the OPPOSITE OF INSPIRING. It encourages people not to change, not to stretch or grow. It seeks to reassure people that even if they live out their status quo, it's all right. They can reconcile in the afterlife their self-defeating choices, their despair, their sense of defeat, their surrender of life. The intellectul thrust of the book, like some anti-Nike, is: JUST DON'T DO IT! That is, don't worry, it's okay, it'll all work out. There's no need to struggle or work on yourself or change. It's okay to stay miserable. All I can say to that is: UGH!The success of this book tells me that a lot of people appreciate the consolation it offers for self-defeating life choices. I may be out of step with that current. So be it. Unlike Albom, my hope for humankind is that we all do not go softly into the night."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book in under 24 hours. It's amazing. Even though it's a short book, the story is still fantastic and well-written. The book starts at the end of Eddie \\"Maintenance\\"'s life, his death at the amusement park where he grew up, because as Mitch Albom writes, \\"All endings are also beginnings. We just don't know it at the time.\\" It chronicals simultaneously, his experiences in the first level of heaven--meeting five people who have influenced the purpose of his life, and what happens on earth after his death. Although the book offers little for discussions or analysis, it's generally a great story which all people can understand and it's a new take on what heaven is really like. Eddie, a man alike with \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"'s George Bailey, in that his only life aspiration was to escape his small town outside of Ruby Pier, but was tied down when his father unexpectedly passed away and he was forced to take over the job he left behind as Ruby Pier's maintenance man.Although Eddie is misunderstood by most of the people he leaves behind on Earth, he's welcomed in heaven by five people who reveal to him what his seemingly meaningless life was all about. And although Eddie appeared to leave few legacies behind him, his life becomes increasinly more inspirational once the reader gets to know his full life story.I really loved this book, even if the language was a little simplistic and the book was short. I'd recommend the book anyway, because it's well-worth the read. But most importantly, this book really made me wonder, if Mitch Albom's portrayal of heaven is correct, who are the five people that I'll meet in heaven?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"'The Five People You Meet in Heaven' I read after Mitch Albom's latest book -For One More Day. I liked 'For One More Day' much better, because I felt it had more of a cohesive story. This book, although it tried to tie everything in, actually left me confused and wondering about certain things that I think it was actually trying to solve.The first person Eddie meets in heaven is the most remarkable of the five. The meeting implies things we already know about life- we can impact people we've never met and whom we don't even know we're impacting. The second segment (with a buddy from his days in the war) is also fairly interesting in what it's trying to accomplish about the horrors of war and what it does to a person afterward. It reflects on the necessity of brutality and the aftermath of being with people in combat and never seeing (or knowing what happens to) them afterward. The third meeting is weak at best and totally leaves issues from his life with his father unresolved. The person he meets tries to explain away why his father was the way he was in life, almost to make Eddie feel bad about resenting his cruel father, and in the book Eddie buys it, but in real life, there's no way that would be enough. The segment with his wife was, I thought, very trite and not well fleshed out. I was waiting for some revelation his wife would bring concerning their lives together or...who knows? But it just lagged, and there was no real sealing up of her visit with him. I was left wondering why he met with her (other than the obvious), because aren't the five people supposed to fill you with mounds and mounds of wisdom? The last lesson was sad, but didn't really do much to tie things up either, and I felt the ending was a bit hollow. 'The Five People You Meet in Heaven' is an okay book, but it seems to be lacking something. In theory 'The Five People...' sounds nice, but I'm hoping that is not how it goes in heaven, 'cuz I'll still be thinking, \\"Where's everyone else\\", and, \\"Is that all?\\" As far as Eddie, is concerned, I don't think the five people he met in heaven-helped answer all the questions for him either. The book definitely left me wondering, \\"Is that all there is?\\""},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A dead man's search for how his life made a difference. This book can be very inspiring and forces us to think about what is to come. Like all good parables, this book teaches a lesson in an interesting and captivating way, but after I put it down I don't have much of an urge to learn more. I have been told the point and that is all you get. Further thought is not necessary. I am not trying to discourage this book or that of Tuesday's With Morrie. They are both great reads and important lessons that make wonderful gifts for families and friends, but don't expect to get that feeling that you should reread this book to get further insight. Place it in your bookcase to lend to others."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom, the main character is an old bitter man named Eddie who works at Ruby Pier, an amusement park. On his 83rd birthday he is working at the Pier, when an accident occurs that kills him. After this he moves on to heaven and encounters five people learning a new lesson from each. Through all of these people Eddie learns what the purpose of his life had been, how his destiny had panned out, and then he finally ends up in his own heaven.Albom effectively uses the structure of the book to keep the reader on the same page as Eddie, and therefore keep the reader guessing. He sets up the chapters in chronological order of both his journey through life and his journey through heaven simultaneously, which allows the reader to learn about Eddie while he is learning about the purpose of his life. This also helps the reader have the same reactions and emotions the Eddie does when he finds out certain things about his life he never knew, because we are just as surprised as he is.I felt this book was very moving, and also very clever. Albom's writing did not give away anything, and pulled at my heart in a way most books don't. While it is short, it is a very cute book and there is not much that I have to complain about. The only thing that I dislike about this book is how short it is; I couldn't put it down and after a few hours it was finished. I recommend this book to children, teenagers, adults; anyone who is looking for a good read that is moving and well-written.-Pam Horner"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After reading this book, it confirmed what I always believed in that, things happen for a reason. You never know who's lives you will touch, and that each action will cause a reaction. You should always be kind and give people the benefit of the doubt. Don't jump to conclusions about that co-worker who leaves every day at quitting time and doesn't stay a minute more. Perhaps he is going home to a sick spouse or child. Don't be so quick to judge people. It's interesting to think about who will be your personal 5 people. The answer may surprise you when indeed you will find out one day."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Now that I've gotten your attention I'll borrow a Yiddish word, \\"shmaltz\\", meaning excessive sentimentality, which accurately describes what this book really is. And, not surprisingly, I loved it. And to borrow another Yiddish word, what \\"shmuck\\" (jerk) wouldn't. I won't go into detail, as just about every other reviewer has, except to say this book is a fanciful story of what might occur in the afterlife. And unless your body is made of concrete, and your blood of vinegar, Mr. Albom's \\"The Five People....\\" will bring tears to your eyes, and hope to your heart. Go ahead, spend a couple bucks, it's better than therapy."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A very short read that I couldn't put down. I think it's a nice &quot;break&quot; and it gives you the warm fuzzies. It wasn't overly hokey or sugary. And you really like Eddie - you just can't help it. It's nice sometimes just to read something light, easy, and uplifting. If you want to smile - read the book. If you enjoy being cynical and mired in misery, this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"&quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot;. I can't recommend it enough. I read it straight through and cried all through the book, but then I cry easy. Eddie's father kind of reminded me of mine. A friend also read it, loved it, but couldn't figure out why I would cry. You will walk away from this book feeling good."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom was able to take the meaning of life and put it into a story that can inspire people. In this book, a man named Eddie, has worked in the same amusement park almost his whole life. When there is an emergency at the park, Eddie rushes to help. When he sees someone in trouble he tries to help, but he gets crushed by the ride. Eddie goes to a state of purgatory where he meets five people. They all teach him lessons and the importance of his life. This book was astonishing. I didn't want to put it down because it was so captivating.The lessons that were mentioned in the book can be applied to anyone's life now. They teach people the significance of life and that everything happens for a reason whether we like it or not. God has everything planned out for us and it will all make sense when we make it to Heaven. This book was inspirational to me. It really emphasizes the importance of life and everyone you meet.

I saved the fifth person he met for a day and then had to find out who it was. This book is an interesting and hopeful view of what happens to us after we die and before we get to Heaven. I absolutely loved this book. I love the idea of having our lives explained to us in the afterlife and the seemingly unimportant moments meaning so much to someone else. I recommend this to everyone.

I highly recommend Five People to someone looking for a quick book to read during vacation."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a touching book that follows the life of a regular Joe, Eddie. Eddie is a maintenance man at an amusement park called Ruby Pier, and the book documents significant events in his life in a very interesting sequence. The book begins with his death then flashes back to various birthdays to give background on seemingly insignificant events that changed his life in unexpected ways. During these flashbacks, the book also follows Eddie through Heaven where he meets 5 very unexpected people. Some of these are strangers and some were very close to him during his life, but they all have one thing in common: they changed Eddie's life forever. However, before Eddie died he didn't fully understand the role these people played in major events in his life. The purpose of the people that he meets in Heaven is to explain to Eddie the meaning behind his life occurrences, which he didn't truly understand until he got to Heaven. Even though he never became more than a maintenance man, he had a purpose in life and these people help him to understand that. They also help him come to terms with why certain misfortunes had been brought upon him, and how many people are connected without knowing it.Eddie faced many issues in his life including a rocky relationship with his father, gruesome experiences in war resulting in a permanently damaged leg, and the loss of his wife many years before his death. The people he meets in Heaven help bring him closure with his father and help him understand why his permanently damaged leg was a much better sacrifice than what could've happened. He also has the opportunity for his wife to explain how each person has a different Heaven and how each of these is determined. Eddie also gets the chance to understand the meaning behind his simple life as a maintenance man.Mitch Albom does an incredible job of creating a touching book that any average person could identify with. Most books that try to be soulful and deep end up being unrealistic for the average reader to identify with; for example, they include some desperate tragedy and the victims trying recovery. However, The Five People You Meet in Heaven succeeds in bringing meaning to the average person's life. Although it is obviously just a belief, the idea that you meet five people in Heaven that significantly changed your life without you knowing is fascinating. It is also somewhat reassuring to think that when it's all over you will find closure and discover deeper meaning of your life. Although the book does give spiritual insight about the afterlife, it is in no way a very religious book; regardless of religion and faith, this book would be a good read for anyone.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is fairly simplistically written. It's short and a very easy read - this makes it a must for every person to read because there is no excuse that it's too tedious or time consuming! It also should appeal to most age groups - it makes the reader think about what's really important in life and how a very seemingly simple life could mean so much. The descriptions that Albom offers for what Eddie is seeing in Heaven are vague - this allows the readers to imagine his Heaven as they might imagine their own, allowing them to personalize their idea of Heaven and consider the meaning behind their lives. I would highly recommend The Five People You Meet in Heaven if you're looking for a quick, easy read guaranteed to put you in a better mood and get you thinking about what really matters in your life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It's hard to avoid the cliche &quot;I couldn't put this book down&quot; when discussing this book, because it is the absolute truth.This is the story of Eddie, a seemingly insignificant man who feels trapped in a meaningless life. But Mitch Albom's message is that no one is truly insignificant or meaningless, because every action we take or do not take affects those around us, like ripples in a pool.On his 83rd birthday, Eddie dies in an accident while trying to save a little girl from a falling cart at a broken amusement park ride. Eddie then enters the afterlife, where he meets five people who explain to him the impact he had on their lives, and in so doing they help him understand the meaning of his own life.I found the brilliance of this concise book to be in the contrast between the simplicity of the parable and the profound impact of the author's message. Through Eddie, we learn that our own lives are part of the great web of all existence, and therefore deeply meaningful and important. So although the book is on the one hand about death, I found it quite uplifting because no matter how small or insignificant we may occasionally feel, there are important unseen connections that we make with others every day.This book left me emotionally stunned, quite frankly, as my little part in the bigger picture was suddenly made clearer to me. Perhaps, just perhaps, a clearer understanding of the role we play in the lives of those around us can inspire us to treat each person, and each moment, as special.I highly recommend this book. It is both entertaining and thought-provoking. I whizzed through it the first time; forgoing sleep, food, and life in general until I finished. I am looking forward to reading it again."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I am really disappointed because my friends really talked this book up. I keep waiting for this to get better, but it isn't. I have 100 pages to go, but am not impressed - it is just so Bridges and Cheese. I am glad I didn't buy it. There is such a plethora of good and sustaining literature out there, I just don't understand how books like this get on the best seller list other than it is short and I guess the majority of people don't get introspective about their lives so therefore need books like this and the Cheese book to show them what is right in front of their faces. It bothers me when I have wasted my valuable reading time on a book like this.One point for the dedication. The best part of the book is the dedication to his uncle. My suggestion is to pick up the book in the store, and read the dedication standing there, and look at the picture in the back, but don't buy the book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I received a copy of this book for Christmas. I thought the premise was superb, and had very high expectations since I had enjoyed Albom's previous work. Unfortunately, I did not connect with the lead character. While extremely inventive connections tied the vignettes together, the characters were unengaging. I am most amazed by those readers who were crying by the end of this story. This book did not arouse emotion of that sort in me. The book does warrant a read, if for nothing more than the framework."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The magic to Mitch Albom's approach is that he touches upon something that we all think about - What happens after we die? No one has definitively been able to answer the question and what Albom has done is to take the comforting reply to that question (we go to heaven), and add A Christmas Carol story-twist to it. Heaven isn't necessarily filled with rolling hills and bon-bons. It's about making sense out of your life and bringing it to its natural closure.And in many ways, Albom's way of dealing with death is quite comforting for me. I've always had a fear about dying. At one time in my life, it was about the act of dying. Would I be in a lot of pain? Would I be by myself? Would I die of natural causes? Would something horrible happen to me? Then, it proceeded to this helpless feeling of never being able to be again. I couldn't imagine not being. Not touching. Feeling. Hugging. Kissing. Smelling. Death - before, during, and after - is scary. Albom's approach isn't totally unique but it is theraputic. He has a way of making sense of it all.I want to get into some specifics about the hardcover version. The book is very short - only 198 pages. While you might be tempted to speed through it...please don't. Savor it. Take it in parts. Read it slowly. The words will glide over your eyes naturally. It's going to be one of those books that you read over and over again. A Beautiful book! Two other titles I recommend are --- Tuesdays with Morrie, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez. Wonderful, strangely moving books! Happy Holidays everyone! Stay Warm!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Now, I love to read, but only so much. It says a lot when a book has me reading all night after I buy it just because I felt like I needed to. The book, for a series of a few conversations and flashbacks, is strangely moving and gripping... fully of shocking, depressing, and wonderful moments.Mitch Albom basically creates a concept of heaven where you speak with people whom you affected or were affected by to gain the full understanding of your life (in the book, the main character is a veteran who spends the rest of his life working in as an amusement park handyman/repairman) and all it's up's and down's.DEFINITELY worth a read no matter what kind of books you usually enjoy."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved this book. It was a touching journey of life after death and an interesting new way to look at Heaven. I loved the characters. I just wish it had been 'The 10 People You Meet in Heaven'. I didn't want it to end.Mitch Albom has another winner."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie,&quot; Mitch Albom passed along lessons from a man facing death. In his first novel, &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven,&quot; Albom speculates on what may happen after death, and shows how our lives here on Earth are intertwined in ways we may not imagine.Eddie felt trapped in a life he didn't choose, spending much of his life as the &quot;ride man,&quot; at Ruby Pier amusement park--just like his father. On his 83rd birthday, Eddie dies trying to save a little girl. Did he save her? That's the first thing Eddie wants to know, but before he can learn the little girl's fate, he first encounters five people whose lives intersected with his.This story is a reminder of the impact our actions have, often unintentionally and unknowingly, on our lives and the lives of people we may never have known. Albom's novel shows that there is meaning and purpose in even the most mudane of lives.Albom has said that the character of Eddie was inspired by his Uncle Eddie, a man who felt he hadn't achieved much in life. Perhaps Uncle Eddie knew how much he influenced and inspired his nephew, but if he didn't know in life, I'm certain a copy of this book has made it to heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As we stumble along in life, we often choose to spend much less of our time considering death. Who could blame us? Death is inevitable; an inescapable fate that all living things must face, but it embodies a large portion of what we do not understand. The question of why looms over our heads, and no amount of theorizing, philosophizing, or proselytizing has ever brought about a universally satisfactory answer.Mitch Albom offers his own interpretation. After you die, you go to heaven, and in heaven, you speak with five people who will reveal to you the meaning of your life-- not the meaning of life, but of your own specifically.There are lessons to take from those that the protagonist learns of himself. Some of these lessons may apply to others in some way, or some may seem to be irrelevant and disintegrate when applied to the real world. Nevertheless, the story provides a warm and comforting fantasy at the heart of which our own fears are highlighted.Albom's prose is quick and concise, yet soft and yielding when called upon. He approaches the story with a sort of humility and serenity that gives the book an endearing quality. Of course, pardon the cliche, we are given a storybook fantasy ending and left to ponder our own importance in every life we touch, whether we realize the breadth of our influence or not.For some, this book might highlight the greatness of some distant ideology or fantasy, but to me, this book was nothing more than a story of humanity. It was a story that beckons us to step into our own spotlight and consider how, for better or worse, we can make a difference in life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I originally read \\"The Five People you Meet In Heaven\\", a spiritual fiction book written by Mitch Albom (also the author of \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\") three or four years ago. I was in Blockbuster last week returning a movie and \\"shelf shopping\\" (my term for actually entering a store with no intention of buying, and not just looking in the window) when I saw that there was also a movie based on the book. The movie was made in 2004, yet I had never heard about it. I decided to not only rent the movie, but I also read the book again as I still had it on my book shelf.The book was much as I remembered it, and every time you do something twice you seem to learn more the second time that you do it. This is a story about Eddie, an elderly carnival maintenance man who dies in an accident at an amusement park called Ruby Pier, where he works. He is killed trying to save a little girl from being crushed by a falling cart from one of the rides. He then finds himself in heaven and he begins a journey, meeting five people from his life on earth. This is not a journey as we would imagine it, like a holiday vacation. It is more like a transference from one spiritual place to another, with flashbacks of Eddie's life replayed along the way.The five people that Eddie meets had all played a role in his life, although that role isn't clearly understood by Eddie. Some of the people he didn't even know and only one could answer the question he really wanted an answer to - did he save the little girl from being crushed before he died? He also feels that his life was worthless, and that he was trapped in a dead end job by circumstances beyond his control. Each person he meets is also dead, and they have been waiting for Eddie to come along so they can teach him that his life wasn't worthless. All five people had also died from some sort of connection with Eddie, and this becomes apparent to him as their lives are explained.The last person Eddie meets is a small Philippine girl, whom Eddie had inadvertently killed while serving in the Armed Forces overseas. It is this girl who \\"rescued\\" him before he died and had brought him safely to heaven. She also tells him whether or not he succeeded in saving the little girl, and shows him that his \\"dead end job\\" as a maintenance worker was responsible for keeping countless children safe. Eddie sees all of these children in heaven, and their children and their children's children. He finally realizes that his life wasn't worthless and that although each of us may think that what we do doesn't matter, it does affect someone else, somewhere eventually. He is also taught that we are all connected to each other through our own stories.The second time reading this book, and now watching the movie, reinforces my belief that everything happens for a reason. Eddie meets the blue man and his army captain, and both of these men had died so he could live. He meets his wife, and although they weren't able to have children, the children Eddie saved everyday more than made up for that. The former owner of Ruby Pier also told Eddie an important story concerning his father, which allowed Eddie to finally forgive him for all the things he had done to Eddie. Finally, the young Philippine girl shows Eddie that even she can forgive him. She leads him to his heaven, where he will wait to meet someone still on earth who has yet to die, and he can then pass on the valuable lessons he learned in heaven.From reading the book and watching the movie, I think people can stop and consider what they do in this life, before we get to heaven to find out. Some of the seemingly insignificant things that we do can make a profound difference in the lives of others. I feel that if we learn this lesson while we are still here, the world will be a much happier place to be. Take a moment each day to pause and consider how your actions (or lack of action) could affect another. Are you polite and courteous to strangers? Do you throw that small piece of trash on the ground, thinking no one will notice? If you are not giving 100% at your job, do you settle for \\"that's good enough\\"? Do you smile when you are with those closest to you and tell them that you love them?I will leave you with this thought. Every little thing that we do doesn't make \\"A\\" difference, it makes \\"ALL\\" the difference.Laughter and love,Rick Fess"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book does the things I require in a great book. 1.

But in his death he meets five people and what they have to teach him is that in life nothing happens by chance it is all connected. That your meaning of life isn't always Gods meaning. This was a very good read. It really draws you in and has you think about your actions and the action of others and the effects it has on ones life.Very enlightening and a great for group discussions."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and do recommend it to others.I have often found myself asking why this and why that in my life. This book provided comfort that even those things that we don't understand have a meaning in our lives. Although this mantra has been said before, it was nice to have examples how all of the \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" of the main character's life tied together.Granted it is a bit predictable, and mushy as some of the reviews state. That being said, a good predicatable mushy book was exactly what I needed for this subject matter."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is the sort of book that I can read through in one sitting. I think doing so makes it easier to really immerse yourself in the book - decrease the number of outside distractions and really focus in on the writing - which I think is important when you're dealing with a somewhat somber topic (a.k.a. death). Typically with books about death or dying, the takeaway focuses on a sort of Carpe Diem/make the most of what you have theme. In The Five People You Meet In Heaven, Mitch Albom instead focuses more on looking back - appreciating the people who came into your life and understanding how they changed you.I've always been drawn to this book first and foremost because of it's extremely unique take on the subject of the afterlife. I still don't quite have that topic figured out in my mind, so it's nice to think about it with a different perspective. I also really love that each section (or stage of heaven) teaches you something. In the book, these lessons are used to usher Eddie through the various stages of his afterlife, but I also think that people would benefit from applying the concepts to their everyday lives. Super cheesey, I know, but you have to admit that there's a little merit to the lessons.Acknowledge the strange balance of give and take in the world, and come to accept that sometimes terrible things happen to really good people. Make sacrifices for the ones you love and try to forgive those who have hurt you. And most importantly, learn to appreciate not what you have, but who you have, for it is the relationships you develop that get you through the bumpy, yet wonderful road we call life. And once again, I'm left in a puddle of tears. I love this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Do we all know what exactly will happen when we die? I don't think so. In the book \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" a lot of interesting things happen. This unique book starts at the end instead of the beginning. So it is basically rewinding throughout the entire story. Personally I would give this book a 5 out of 5 stars.My book is about a man named Eddie. Throughout the story Eddie is growing older. It starts at his fifth birthday. He got a vanilla cake with blue wax candles. It is very vivid and descriptive. Eddies father wasn't the nicest man alive. He was labeled as abusive in eddies eyes. Along all the years his father was abusive. Eddie would often find himself terrified or the man.Eddie was a fun and energetic little boy as a young age. As he grows older he gets grumpier. Especially after the love of his life falls into a coma. These teenagers were dared to throw glass bottles onto oncoming traffic. Well once they decided to do it, they threw the bottle and it hit Eddies love, Marguerites car. It unfortunately mad her crash pretty bad. It threw her into a coma but, amazingly she survived. As she grew older she developed cancer. It killed her at the young age of 47. That was when Eddie basically just crashed. His depressed stage eventually caught up with him and it showed on the effects on his body. He looked 10 years older. He was intimidating to most people. This book describes his whole experience.

Albom's stories changed my perspective in a dark time in my life - they gave me the courage to be myself. That in itself was a priceless gift. I hope you'll find something inspiring in them as well.I've recently re-read \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" and it's been an absolute joy. I had completely forgotten the story, so it feels all new again.The writing is clear and to the point, without unnecessary details, but oh so much meaning packed into each gesture. Amazing stories don't have to be an overtly visual experience; they can be envisioned in the readers mind and this book dose so wonderfully. I love that each seemingly simply revelation is actually a much grander life lesson, epiphany worthy if fully realized by the reader and characters alike."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was the first book by Mitch Albom in which I had read and I could not put it down. It's like you are there in every scene of the story. the story line captures your heart and makes you to constantly want to read what's next."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Jacob SchallerMs. PorterEnglish 10February 29, 2012Book ReviewI have recently read the book, The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom. This was one of the best books I have ever read. This book can make you examine your whole life, and see what is truly important. The book is dedicated to the author's uncle, who gave him his first concept of heaven. The dedication in the beginning of the book is:\\"Everyone has an idea of heaven, as do most religions, and they should all be respected. The version represented here is only a guess, a wish, in some ways, that my uncle, and others like him--people who felt unimportant here on earth--realize, finally, how much they mattered and how they were loved.\\"The book opens out with a countdown of the time the main character, Eddie, has to live. Eddie is a hobbled, angry, old man who works at an amusement park. After his death, he begins to learn the true meaning of his life when he confronts five people in heaven from his past. There are moments he needs to relive and others he never even knew happened. These are somewhat shocking and breathtaking for both Eddie and the reader.In this book, there are many stages of heaven, and it's where time is unmeasured. Once you've met your five advisors, and gain enlightenment, it's your turn to enlighten others, people whose paths you have crossed and changed their lives forever. Eddie started this book a grumpy old man, but at the end he is at peace with the world and he comes to realize:\\"That there are no random acts. That we are all connected. That you can no more separate one life from another than you can separate a breeze from the wind.\\"This book is truly inspirational. Whether you believe in Heaven or not, this book is definitely highly recommended. It makes you wonder how your life has impacted another and who those five people are that you could meet in Heaven. This is probably my favorite Mitch Albom book and I hope you enjoy it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After reading this book, I came away having a bit of a pleasant, upbeat view on life. The absolutely inoffensive, but positive view of the afterlife, I suppose might have been a nice fiction for some (and it was indeed very nice), but upon further reflection I got nothing from this book. The afterglow of the positive experience was nice, but I didn't grow from reading this novel. I didn't realize another way of thinking, understand something better, or even learn anything; all that I got was a short-lived positive afterglow.Some may not expect so much from a novel, and, if you don't, then by all means read &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot;. Afterwards, this book FELT like a novel that was made merely to be a bestseller. I can't really see anyone really commiting to Albom's view of &quot;heaven&quot;, but instead see it as an inoffensive medium in which the author can present what is meant to be a soulful life story. This is the book's weakness: it takes absolutely NO chances, but instead is bland. I don't mean bland as in poor writing (for the style was satisfactory), but in ideas. There is no real groundbreaking theological speculation, but merely passing references to an afterlife which could be a part of any religion. In conclusion, this book's weakness is it's friendliness. It is like an evening out with friends, pleasant at the time, but unimportant and forgettable past the next week."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In my opinion, this is a feel-good book. It's a fast read and leaves you with a peaceful feeling. I'm the kind of person who often wonders what life is all about and can worry whether or not my time on Earth is going to make a difference. Sometimes it seems that good people die young for no apparent reason and that life is not always fair.It helps to put these questionable things into perspective and helps you to stop the worrying and the wondering and to &quot;Let Go and Let God&quot;. All of our answers will be given to us when we die and, therefore, we should not dwell on it during our lifetime. When one of our loved ones dies unexpectedly or too young for our personal comfort it helps us to realize that it's not necessarily a bad thing. Although we may feel earthly pain, frustration and maybe even anger, the death should be viewed as just one piece of a giant puzzle that is being put together in a preplanned manner. We have no control over certain things and in order to enjoy our lives to the fullest extent possible we need to accept it and wait for our answers which will be given to us in due time.If we waste time dwelling on the &quot;why's&quot; and the &quot;why nots&quot; we will be disappointed in the end when we finally realize that it all makes sense and we should have just gone with the flow the whole time. Although some days it may feel that my job or my simple life are not that important in the grand scheme of things, this book opened my eyes and told me that I do make a difference and that all things are entwined and meant to be."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"All I have to say is WOW! The entire time I was reading it, I kept thinking it needs to be made into a movie, and I hope it does! I am in high school and although this is a short book, I was hooked and couldn't stop reading it. My mom was reading the book and then my dad picked it up to read it too (which is pretty rare). My dad actually finished before my mom. Anyway they both suggested that I read it, and I wasn't hesitant, but didn't know when I would find time (through homework, church activites...). I started reading it one night and when I got home from school the next day, I had to finish it!The amazing this about this book is that it really makes you think about your own life. You ask yourself questions such as (without giving events away), &quot;Who do I need to forgive?&quot;, &quot;Has my life been spared at the expense of someone else?&quot;, &quot;Who's life have I affected?&quot;, &quot;Who's life has affected me?&quot;, and most importantly, &quot;Who would I meet in heaven?&quot;. Some people may not like this kind of a book, but I would still highly recomend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I am very happy that I picked up this book on a Saturday afternoon and read it through the day and finished it on Sunday. I thought the book was very well written. I do think the uncle's picture should have been in the front of book or on the cover. He reminded me of my father. I thought the story line was different and important to read as that I have lost many close family members. I hope the deceased members of my family have had similar ventures in heaven meeting people that they knew and didn't know but found out why their lives were important to people around them. I will read more books from this author just to find out what he will have to say next."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Only a master storyteller, could weave such an intriguing story. Well written and deeply thought-provoking...Mitch Albom not only draws the reader in, but in his subtle manner, also succeeds in raising one's level of 'conscious,' as this story challenges the casual reader to think deeply and profoundly...about this journey, we call 'life.'A wonderful book that deserves its rightful place on everyone's 'Must Read' List."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The old of trap of high expectations doomed this book. As a follow up to &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;, this was a big let down. The idea of 5 people in heaven waiting for each of us is somewhat interesting, but disapppointing in the telling. I anticipated something more as I began each person's part but never achieved the wonderful I expected."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"But that's really about all it is. Depressing, emotionally empty, self imposed guilt is what the main character, Eddy tries to come to terms with. But in Eddy's heaven, there are five strange people. That's all. Five people (one of whom is blue, one is a very angry GI from World War 2) who serve only to reinforce Eddy's emptiness until all of a sudden, Eddy finds 'satisfaction' in knowing that his meaningless life had meaning to someone else. And the meaning Eddy found was totally focused on the past-the life he just left. So the underlying point of the book subtly implies that the point of heaven is to put relevance to our lives here.In otherwords, Heaven is nothing more than an extended session to try to find meaning to this life. Sorry folks, if you can't find meaning or purpose of life on earth, you ain't going to find it in Heaven either.I found out, from the Very Reliable Source, that the purpose of life here on Earth is to put the perspective on the meaningfulness of Heaven. This book just reminds me of how so often we want to put Heaven on our own terms."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The 5 People is a wonderful book, but so many people just focus on their own lessons they learned, which makes for an interesting story, but I am always looking for more - how does this apply to me? Do I have to have an NDE and come back, so I can tell others what heaven is about? I liked Tiffany Snow's book better, she had an NDE, and goes on to tell about the ripple effect of our actions. I'm not saying The 5 People is a bad book, really, but I guess I was just expecting more than a fairy tale."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If you are looking for something to make you think, to make you laugh, to make you cry... keep looking. If you have even once thought about why you are here and for what purpose (higher or otherwise), then you don't need to read this book. Depth-free zone."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"For a light reminder of life's spiritual mirror, The Five People You Meet in Heaven represents a great introduction into the world of spirituality, and life after death, and how our lives all have a purpose. When you are ready to go deeper, read the near-death, purpose stories by Betty Eadie (embraced by the light), Tiffany Snow (psychic gifts), or John Edward (crossing over). These highlight the deeper Spiritual things. Indulge yourself! Continue on the path to be a higher intelligence in the universe! The world needs it, doesn't it?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is just that, melancholic. A gentle sadness embraces you from beginning to end. And as you travel through Eddie's (the main character) one-dimensional life and afterlife your mind will automatically veer towards your own retrospect. This book will ignite a train of thought that will help you deeply reflect on your life and those key people who influenced you at decisive turns of events.Mitch Albom has written a wonderful story that will bring hope, joy, sadness, and a desire for closure with past-unreconciled events. The writing itself is not so much mind-blowing, as it's soothing. This book has given \\"afterlife\\" a brand new meaning, which somehow most religions have failed to embark. Since afterlife is such a gray area, philosophically speaking, I would take Mitch Albom's heaven against any other version of it. Reading this book I felt that it wouldn't be so bad to die if five people on the other side were waiting to give me meaning over most-often bizarre ways of earthly developments.The message is right on target. The tone is right on target. We need more books like this one in the melee of dark literature that has usurped our lives. We spend most of our lives trying to create a heaven here on earth. Very seldom do we realize that a healthy dose of meaningful closure and understanding is what heaven is about.I would like to recommend this book to anybody. I can't recommend it highly enough. If you want to spark positive energy within yourself, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\", will be an incredible catalyst."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Like many people already expressed in their reviews, I felt this book was positive and uplifting. Though the title talks about heaven, there are no particular religious views. It just describes the 5 people a man meets upon his death, and learns about his life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a compelling story about a fictional character that I thought was for real. I had read Albom's other book, Tuesdays, and was caught. Reading this book makes you realize that there is hope for the hereafter and that we can be a light in people's lives without even knowing it. I loved it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As I am going through the potential cancer diagnostic for my dad, this book has given us all in my family the soothing and peace we need in such a tough moment. In a nutshell, the author of \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" tells us that no life is a waste. No matter how it ends. The only time wasted is the one thinking we are alone, as he says in the words of the Blue Man, one of the five people \\"Eddie\\" (the main character) meets as he goes through his early stages in heaven.I must admit I had a rough time getting over the first 30-40 pages. I just couldn't get myself to read it. But once Eddie meets the first person, you cannot avoid being engaged. Having finished the book the same day I learned about the possibility of my dad having cancer can only mean that certain things are meant to be encountered at certain moments and only then. Indeed, like Albom writes, nothing is random: everything happens for a reason.I only wish this book can give you the same peace it gave to me, my mom and my dad."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"By the time Eddie dies, he is lonely and has morphed into a bitter old man, plagued, as many these days are, by his lack of accomplishments. Thus spawns an interesting premise that in heaven five people whose lives you have affected come to explain the point of it all. With each person Eddie meets, a part of his life is revealed, even if he does not appreciate its significance at the time. What is most impressive is the consistency in which these revelations become known. Clearly, the last person provides the resolution, bringing together the snatches of stories we get along the way, and can be seen as the most important. However, the book does not rush through the first four just to fill out the pages in between. Each one really does bring an element in - their own unique perspective on Eddie's life. Even though the book generates a lot of curiosity in its story and delivers a satisfying read, it does not quite do enough to make it groundbreaking."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I highly recommend \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" to anyone interested in imaginative, emotional, and inspirational stories. Although some parts of the book border on the melodramatic, Mitch Albom is generally successful at creating a memorable story about an ordinary man who, despite his \\"common\\" life, leaves an indelible mark on the world he was a part of and the many lives he unknowingly touched. A truly lovely read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'm truly surprised that so many customers have given this book negative reviews. I felt it was completely wonderful. 83 year old Eddie is a character that I adored from the first page, and I found his journey through heaven heart-warming and insightful. It's a short book, and can be read in the time it takes to watch a film; I can think of few films as worthy as your time as this little book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After seeing this book on the bestseller lists for awhile, I thought I would give it a go....I liked the idea of this book, that a man who felt his life on earth was meaningless and didn't have any defination of anything great- dies during a selfless act of kindness for a little girl. He-goes to heaven and encounters 5 different people, some have complete relevance in his life, some in a very strange and obscure way they are relative to his life.This book was sort of on the idea of a few books,and movie- A Wonderful Life- in the movie Jimmy Stewart gets a chance to view thru an Angel the lives that he has changed because he was born. This book describes the five lives that Eddie touched and how he didn't even realize that he did.This book also reminded me of ... A Christmas Carol, again, a spirit comes to Ebeneezer Scrooge, and he revisits his life and the people that he has touched thru the years.I am not saying this book was completely like either of these books, but it had a hint of them for ME when I was reading it.It was enjoyable, it was thought provoking to think who would MY five people be- and I did enjoy it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought the first couple of chapters were good in developing a story about an interesting character, but halfway through the book, it got a little cheesy and formulaic. At this point it seemed like every person Eddie met in heaven was someone he wound up accidentally killing and that this was some way to acknowledge it and get rid of his guilt.I liked Albom's books about Morrie much better. I think he writes well with a lot of meaning when the story is about someone or something in real life rather than something he made up."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I just finished the book, and really wanted to write my review before I lost the feelings that it evoked in me.The story was not like I had expected. I half expected it to be weepy and sad all the way through, which was not the case. I wouldn't call it upbeat, per se, but it certainly wasn't depressing.For a small book (196 pages, but the book itself is rather tiny), this one packs the punch of a much larger novel. The characters feel real, and important, and the glimpse into the psyche of the main character cuts deep, and is extremely well written.I cried very hard at the end, but then, I knew I would. But, the book deserved my tears, the story moved me, and the author is definitely someone that I will look forward to reading in the very near future.Get the book. Read it. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As one who has dealt with the loss of several close relatives in recent months, this book was a great help to me. I enjoyed the ease with which one can read this book as the story line is well presented and easy to follow. You really get a good sense of Eddie and know that his life, even though he may not have thought so, mattered. Everyone matters! But this book just goes to show that you never know who you touch and how you affect other's lives....this is a great book and I am glad I read it. It helped me to deal with some great sadness at losing my relatives."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"We go through our same routine day after day...some dreams attained, but most deferred. How many people live lives of quiet desperation? They look at their circumstances and ask what is the meaning of existence. Most people's lives will never change the world, or will they?This book is a simple and touching reflection on a life lived. It shows how seemingly minor human interactions can have major consequences; and that every life event, good or bad, has meaning and purpose when you can put it in perspective.I felt such a burst of warmth when I finished the story. This book made me feel hopeful and positive about meaning of life.I highly recommend this book, particularly if you liked The Celestine Prophecy or The Alchemist."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Great literature invariably draws the reader in and invites him to think, to make comparisons between what he is reading and how it compares to ones own life and thoughts, to weigh in on whether there is agreement or disagreement. Story telling, on the other hand may be as simple as watching the latest brainless sitcom on television.So where does \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" by Mitch Albom fall out? After reading the book my opinion--and obviously opinion is as different as fingerprints--is that Albom's book firmly fits the former and not the latter.The book tells the story of a good man who lives a full life but doesn't know it. He feels shortchanged and, following his death, wonders what it all might of meant. The five people he meets help him to accept life as it was and to find some closure for the future. Some of the five are individuals he remembers some are mere phantoms that passed by without leaving much of an impression on him--or so he believes. Each teaches a lesson (and, yes, each lesson has applicability to every life) and clarifies how his interaction impacted life.I hesitate to say more because Albom's book is written in such a way as to make it an entirely different statement and experience for each reader. My memories, feelings and experience are markedly different from yours and Albom's story struck chords with me that simply won't be the same for you.Don't try to compare this one to \\"A Christmas Carol\\" (there is no opportunity here as Scrooge had to go back and make amends). Don't compare it to \\"It's a wonderful Life\\" (this really isn't a story about how a life made life wonderful for his peers). Some have compared it to Homer's Odyssey. This is a stretch because, again, our hero here is not trying to get back to his former life.Instead Albom, I believe, in \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" makes a simple statement: one life touches so many others, both known and unknown, in a variety of ways. Often we like to think that we are alone here and that an action today has no impact on anyone else. Instead Albom poses questions about how a boy's simple act of retrieving a ball from the street might result in an ultimate consequence for an unknown passer by.I did not find Albom's book to be preachy in any sense. Instead the author seems to simply state that a life lived has its wonders and consequences and when it's over it's over. Or is it? \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" does offer the interesting scenario of a newcomer becoming a player in the unfolding drama of Heaven's next arrival.Don't look for answers about what Heaven might actually be. I don't think Albom in his work was trying to offer anything new to the established canon of accepted Christian scripture. Rather enjoy a very interesting story about one man's view of what might be. And if you're not interested in a thoughtful, introspective ride, there's always Seinfeld reruns.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"First of all, I must make mention of how impressed I am by Mitch Albom's first foray into fiction. I did not expect what I found in this book. All too many short novellas seem to be flooding the market of late--disguised (and priced) as full novels. They tend to be pasty, feel-good schlock. The vast majority of readers seem satisfied with this dreadful staus quo. For those of us who seek more The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a pleasant surprise.Albom is a born storyteller. Being a native of Southeastern Michigan, I have known this for years. I grew up reading Mitch's excellent columns in The Detroit Free Press (though I still prefer my hometown paper--The Ann Arbor News). Mitch's great storytelling ability is on full display in The Five People You Meet in Heaven.In this book Albom proves that he can rise above the ranks of the mere storytellers. The thing that shocked me about this book was how well written it is. Mitch catches the language, tone and heart of this story in beautifully spare prose. We can forgive him if he sometimes veers toward the sentimental. His story, centered on one man's viewing of his life from the perspective of heaven, is necessarily nostalgic and emotional.As a story I find The Five People You Meet in Heaven compelling. Yet, I do think God lingers too much in the background. I believe in and know a personal God. Albom's God is way too aloof for my taste. His version of heaven perfectly expresses the love of one's neighbor but leaves out the part about loving God with all of one's heart, mind, soul, and strength. Without this perfect love, humanity will always fall and fail at loving one another.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is an impressive fictional debut for a very talented writer. The story is gripping even if it is found lacking in other ways. I give it my recommendation.If you end up liking this book I also highly recommend The Great Divorce by C.S. Lewis. If you are more adventurous still, other great books in the Literature of Heaven and Hell are: The Bible (I prefer the English Standard Version), The Epic of Gilgamesh, Homer's Odyssey (trans. Robert Fagles), The Aeneid by Virgil (trans Robert Fitzgerald), and Dante's Divine Comedy (trans. John Ciardi). Dive in!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Reading this book was similar to watching a slow movie that had a decent enough ending to make it worth your money and time.There was nothing flagrantly bad about this book but not one I would recommend. Upon any mystery element to the story, the author was too quick to offer up a perfect explaination leaving you nothing to really look forward to later on. I think the problem was that the book was too short and the one mystery in the book that lingers does not have a powerful enough answer to have made the wait worthwhile."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch's latest book is amazing. I'm going to have to stop reading his books on trips - it's embarrassing for a 46-year-old man to start sniffling sitting alone on an airplane. But his book is that good. It touches you, it reaches you, and it tells a story, parts of which that nearly all of us have lived. Though I love Mitch's work in the Detriot Free Press and on the Sports Reporters on ESPN, I hope he keeps writing this type of material, because I can use this kind of inspiration every now and then. Well done, Mr. Albom."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Today is Eddie's birthday... This line has caused me to reflect on several of my birthdays and to realize that with each passing year they become less and less of an event.Eddie is a maintenance man at an amusement park who thought his life had no meaning and that he made no impact on anybody. Five people appear to Eddie immediately after his death and prove him wrong.After reading this book, I began to wonder what five people I would meet in Heaven (or wherever I end up). Perhaps a co-worker I don't really care for, perhaps a best friend from years past, or the person I accidentally cut off in traffic this morning.This book has caused me to re-examine my daily interactions with people and to wonder how those interations have impacted both of us. Have I made a difference in anybody's life without even knowing it? Do the people who made a difference in my life know they did?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Albom's book, although a secular view of Heaven, is possibly one of the most beautiful ideas presented in years. This book is timeless and will be enjoyed for generations! Albom writes poingantly the details of Eddie's encounter with his precious wife and her lesson for him &quot;take the bitter with the sweet,&quot; as he travels through that &quot;pocket&quot; of Heaven. The five different people and pockets in Heaven don't just contain happy, golden, sweet little lessons. Eddie receives some difficult information during his travels in Heaven which leave you wondering until the very end if Eddie did in fact save the little girl or not. It could have been either way which I found captivating. You travel through this life on earth and you don't always know the effect your encounters have on the lives you touch or paths you cross and sadly enough, every cause does have an effect. Mitch Albom did a steller job on this beautiful book and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.

Though he did his job meticulously and everyone kind of knew Eddie, adults never took him seriously. Children seem to like him but even Eddie when he became an octogenarian reflecting back on his life felt he achieved zero. Eddie recently died trying to save a little girl.Eddie regains consciousness in heaven. Five people, one at a time, shows him the positive impact of his life on others. Though in terms of major impact, his deeds may seem small, Eddie begins to understand the essence of God's gift of life to mankind. Humanity consists of a vast series of interconnecting networks that mesh the lives of everyone. No matter how minute, that iota of caring impacts people even those outside your sphere and Eddie clearly cared.This is a strong modern day parable that reminds readers that everyone counts even Eleanor Rigby. Using a seemingly nonentity to bring his message across, Mitch Albom paints a simply stupendous story that no person is left behind as we live as an interconnected and overlapping links on this planet. Everybody has plenty to offer and should be encouraged to do so.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Lester JueanBook Review\\"The five people you meet in heaven,\\" was written by Mitch Albom, He also wrote another book called the \\"Tuesdays with Morrie.\\" Every chapter and page in this book is very interesting to readers. Albom gives a colorful prospective on life after the death of his character Eddie. Eddie was an 83 year old man who worked at an amusement park. However, he also served in the military and was considered a wounded war veteran. When I was reading the book, it felt like I watching a real life story of a person. It felt so real, could not put the book down.Eddie had lived near Ruby Pier all of his life. Furthermore, he fully enjoys his job fixing rides at a seaside amusement park. Eddie likes what he does because his father had worked similar job like that before. At the age of 83, Eddie died in a tragic amusement park accident. After that Eddie happily went up to heaven and met five people who described his earthly life. The first person Eddie met in heaven told Eddie that \\"this is the greatest gift God can give: to understand what happened in your life. To have it explained.\\" What really amazed me about this story is that when Eddie went to heaven and his friends were telling him what he had done, he did not appreciate his life. He thought his life on earth was meaningless.He felt he could have done more to help people. In this book Albom presents the situation was a real life story. Albom is an excellent writer whose words have the power to consume your mind into right book. The description and the sweet secrete will satisfy your desire, and the message will have you talking about it for days. I recommend you give this book a worthwhile chance."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Maybe I was looking for some great words of wisdom. A story to make me laugh and cry and to teach some of life's great lessons. What I got was a story about a man who died and met 5 people in heaven. They each had a lesson for him and the lessons weren't even worth savoring. I like Mitch Albom on the radio and I guess that I should read Tuesdays with Morrie. But this book just didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was unable to put this book down. The pages flew by like there was no stopping them. Mitch Albom did a great job of making you think of the way you impact others' lives, and vise versa. He shows that the small details can change a whole life.Albom's version of heaven is an interesting one. The thought exposes you to different possibilities that you never would have considered had you not read this book. The plot of The Five People You Meet In Heaven isn't very concrete but if you sit and think about it, you can come up with a few.One thing that I would like to see changed about the book is the fact that it is a bit short. I think that Mitch Albom could have gone into greater detail with the characters and the lessons than he did. I understood everything that he was trying to get across, but sometimes he could have went deeper. Don't get me wrong, for a quick read this is an excellent choice. It is not, however, a good choice for someone who is looking for length.To people who are considering reading this book, I would recommend it. It puts thoughts in your head and opens you up to new ideas. Even though it is a bit short, if you like it, you will know what kind of book to look for next time your looking for a good read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is one of those books that you can't put down once you start it. It's a great book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If you liked Tuesdays With Morrie then you will love this book! It grabbed me right from the beginning and I could not put it down. Trust me, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"i liked this book. there's no need to try and read too much into it or call it preachy. it's only preachy if you feel like you're in need of preaching to. for me, it only reinforces the notion that one should make the most out of life. this book had a whole lot of heart, more than i can say for most people."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I enjoyed this book. It made me pause and reflect on my daily interactions with family, friends and co-workers. We don't realize the impact a small gesture or comment can make in another person's life. Eddie, the main character, didn't feel he accomplished much during his life, but realized his purpose after meeting each friend in heaven. I would recommend this book...a short heartwarming read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"First off, allow me to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Tuesdays With Morrie and consider it, without question, to be one of my all-time favorites. That being said, Albom's 2nd offering can neither compare, nor supplement, Morrie. So, please, do yourself a big favor and do not go into this one thinking it will be on the same level of profundity. It's not.Having issued my caveat, allow me to say now that this short, yet poignant, novella, makes for a most enjoyable and thought-provoking read. Do you tell your loved ones how much they really mean to you? Do you possess a genuine love of mankind or are you corrupted by the increasingly pervasive cynicism that unfortunately seems to be the order of the day? When you die, what positive impact will you have made on others from your days on Earth? No, my friends, this is not Dr. Phil. It's Mitch Albom. And it's a book that provokes these and many other timeless questions. It is also, indubitably, in this humble reviewers opinion, a book that should be added to your wish list - today.&quot;Strangers,&quot; the Blue Man said, &quot;are just family you have yet to come to know.&quot;"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book causes you to review your own life (and wonder whom the people greeting you will be)! It has a wonderful message."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is an amazing story. I came across it by chance while browsing the books on Amazon, and got hooked when I read some of the sample pages. I am very happy I bought this book. It's quick reading, I read it in about three hours. But for such a short book, it's very meaningful. The author illustrates the important lessons of life in a very subtle way. You don't realize the beauty of what he is writing about until the very end, when it all comes together to show that every life has a meaning, even though we don't always understand that meaning. I recommend this book very highly."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is an excellent book. It is somewhat difficult to explain but it is a very unique and inspiring view of heaven. The end is particularly inspiring. Keep a box of tissues handy. This book is a weeper."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have not finished the book yet but I am loving it so much. Every word is written with such care, I can visualize everything so well and I really like this idea. Although I'm eager to read the rest, I will also be sad not to have more of it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book in a matter of hours. This book gives another possibility of the afterlife. It makes you examine the impact that even the most mundane activity,or most innocent mistake, could have, or have had on people you know and don't know. It supports the oppinion that, (what may be considered), an average person, who've had, (what may be considered), an average life, can have a profound impact on others , without necessarily being a Ghandi or King."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The most inspiring book I have ever read. It is not spiritual, Not preachy, it's just a story. Just because the word &quot;Heaven&quot; is in the title doesn't mean it is intended to be anything more than just a story. And a beautiful story it is. It makes you think about people in a whole new light.I sent a copy to a dear friend in Alabama and it was so wonderful to know she and I were reading it together while on opposite ends of the country.It changed me and I know for the better. And as for my friend, Mindy, it has become one of her most treasured posessions, and I am honored to have been the one to send it to her.Thank you, Mr. Albom, for inspiring me to be a better person."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book is good but the interview with the author at the end really takes away from the story. If you read or listen to the book, stop when you get to the interview."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I must admit that I read this book because of its sales rank, and also because I read the author's another book, &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie.&quot; I read &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie,&quot; because of its sales rank, and its overall favorable reviews, and because a very close friend of mine read it. My impression: both books and the author are way over-rated.I more or less agree with another reviewer, Dr J E Robinson's view that this is an either you love it and you may even cry while reading it type of book, or you may, just like me, have no feeling/reaction to it. First, I don't find the author a good story teller. Obviously, he tried hard to be one, but in my opinion, he failed. This book can be written in half its length without losing anything except some revenues, as the book is much shorter. Second, the whole story reflects only the author's view/interpretation/inspiration of what life is about. And I find some of his views quite shallow.My guess is, for those who are really really touched by this book, probably they might have shared one or some experience of the story's character, Eddie's. Overall, I can believe that this story is written by a college freshman as a term paper."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, thinking that it would be profound and full of wisdom. What I found was a short book with five extremely vague lessons that were forgotten by the next page. The concept of the story was an excellent one but it was simplistic and did not adequately cover the life lessons. On finishing the book I was left feeling disappointed at the sheer lack of depth."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I received this book as a gift from an aunt, during Christmas 2003. I had seen it on the shelves of bookstores, and while I was intrigued I wasn't going to shell out the money for it. I'm glad I didn't, and I'm sorry she did.The book follows Eddie, who has recently died, and his journey in heaven. As the title says, there are 5 People you meet in Heaven -- hate to ruin it for anyone, but we all get 5 different people. Yep. So if you were hoping to talk to Marilyn Monroe, JFL or George Washington, chances are you will be out of luck.So, these 5 people show Eddie things that affected his life. And we're supposed to go along with the reasons the people give us. At the end, Eddie comes to a great realization that is about 100 pages overdue.Seriously, if you were going to read this I would pick something else. If you're looking to be depressed and sad, pick up the 9/11 Commission instead. If you're looking for interesting check out George Carlin's book. Whatever you do, do not read this schlock. It's rudimentary, elementary and boring. If I could have give it 0 stars, I would have."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I would like to reiterate that the book's title and plot are very good at pulling the reader in, but not only are the events in the book predictable but very poorly written, the character development is very damp. One passage in particular displays his writing style which seemed to me like he was listing off details over and over instead of getting a taste for all sides of &quot;Eddie&quot;&quot;He used a cane to get around. his face was broad and craggy from the sun, with salty whiskers and a lower jaw that protruded slightly, making him look prouder than he felt. He kept a cigarette behind his left ear and a ring of keys hooked to his belt. He wore rubber-soled shoes. He wore an old linen cap. His pale brown uniform suggested a workingman, and a workingman he was.&quot;There you can see he is constantly saying he kept a, His face was, he wore, he wore, he was a....Its very constipated writing.In the first chapter alone I was very tempted to just skip a bunch of pages while the author kept saying 30 minutes until his death, 25 minutes...I got it, he's going to die. Albom tried to write his book out of time sequence which usually works well for Donnie Darko and all of Quentin Tarantino's films. But this is boring! Eddie is a typical old guy who works maintennance at a park who is bothered by supposedly typical teenagers who seem more to me like Nelson's friends from the Simpsons.Though I have more cons than pros for this book, the overall spiritual message of the book is very useful I'll admit, but if you're out to sell a novel, there's ways you have to write it to pull in an audience."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"While easy-to-read and not poorly written, Mitch Albom's latest effort, The Five People You Meet in Heaven, is simply a twist on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol and has a difficult time standing up against the classic. The main character, and deceased, Eddie, is initiated into heaven by visiting with five folks whose lives were touched or whose lives touched him. Strangers and loved ones alike appear to show Eddie the meaning of the life that he lived and to explain how we are all interconnected. Unfortunately, the tone of this book is spiritually stunted and although the book takes place in &quot;heaven,&quot; Albom is not brave enough to identify Eddie's own spiritual identity and/or beliefs nor does the reader ever see or meet a divine creator or being. Instead, Albom hits the reader over the head with his earthly &quot;insights&quot; which are rote and predictable - be good, find joy, don't underestimate yourself, blah, blah, blah. Perhaps this would make a nice, short, morality play for pre-teens but it is not a book that will change anyone's life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"this book is the first book i have ever fully read all the way threw because all the other books werent as good most the way threw so i didnt read them but this one was alot better so i started reading more more and it got better and better the farther i got in to the book so if any one out there desides to read this book i think u will enjoy it alot because it explains alot and it is not hard to understand. If it wazs up to me i would et the whole world read it because it would help alot of people understand many things plus maybe this might help u threw your life and help you understand the things that might be rong in your life. So read this book it is the best book i have ever read and i will read it a million times before i get bored of it but if u read this book i think you will love it. And if you dont believe me then here i will tell you a short part of the story..there is a man named eddie who was from the army. he hasd alter on got old and he owned his own carnival but one day something went rong and he went to save a little girl form getting crushed by one of the rides because something went rong with one of them and it had flipped up side down and it started to fall so he ran and jumped to the little girl shoved her out of the way and he got crushed and went to heaven and met the first man u meet in heaven a blue but very strange man."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book seems to feed off of the novel that proceeded it Lovely Bones.

Just head down to Borders if you are that interested in it and you will have it knocked out in about an hour."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This Book was great. I really enjoyed it. never put it downI will read more books by this author. he is brilliant."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have to agree with almost everything in the last review - if this is heaven, I'll stay here. I was very disappointed with this book. I didn't finish it feeling uplifted but rather blah. The only reason I can think of for the books' popularity is the success of the authors' first book. Go rent the movie &quot;Always&quot; instead - that will get you crying and soaring at the same time!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This books reads in just a couple of hours. The author had the courage to only keep in the books what's needed to make it a good compelling story. It felt like an adult fairy tale."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom opened eyes and warmed hearts with his first novel, Tuesdays with Morrie. Now with his second novel, Albom further explores spiritual curiosities.Eddie's job at an amusement park is taking its toll on him. After many long years fixing the rides and maintaining the park he is left feeling like his life's work from a young boy to old age is meaningless and feels unfulfilled.Then one day on his eighty-third birthday Eddie is killed tragically during a heroic rescue of a little girl falling from a cart on a ride. When Eddie awakens he realizes he is no longer among the living and that heaven is nothing like he thought it to be.The people Eddie meets in heaven explore his life with him, opening his eyes to see how even though certain people didn't seem significant to him, Eddie played a major role in their lives.Through them, Eddie realizes his life wasn't so meaningless after all. Albom's exploration of the afterlife is written with such imagination and creativity.This is a wonderful story that will invoke so much emotion from readers. Albom has a warm and magical writing style that will comfort his readers and leave them feeling fulfilled by his words."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If I based my rating only on this being an interesting and well-written story, I would give it a five. However, the scenerio presented in this book contradicts my concept of heaven in that I believe there will be no anger, fear or pain in heaven. The main character, Eddie seemed to experience all of these. The author does present some compelling thoughts. It may well be that we will at some point understand the influence our life has had on others as well as the impact of another life on our own. At any rate I agree that this easy-to-read book could provide an inspiration to anyone who reads it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"For Christians hoping that Mitch Albom's version of heaven will at least slightly resemble the heaven that the Bible tells us to hope for, don't get your hopes up. This book is a clever idea of what heaven would be if it were entirely \\"self-focused\\". AKA, don't worry, God won't get in our way of fun once we're up there. It's all about us. After much enjoying, Tuesdays with Morrie, I was very dissapointed. But, I am a biased Christian who looks foward to the heaven described in the Bible, not in a novella."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I found almost nothing about this book convincing: the characters were largely stereotypical and the author's lessons seemed calculated to appeal to a mass audience, rather than based on any honest, life-earned wisdom. Phrases like, \\"Every life has one true-love snapshot\\" may strike us as sweet, but they are neither wise nor true."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After the disappointing read of &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; [which I found self centered, the book had very little to do with Morrie, but everything about the author], I was willing to give him a second chance, when I heard about &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot;. After all, what a wonderful topic! Unfortunately Mr. Albomtook this great idea and turned it into a disaster. Instead of a positive experience, it was filled with negativity and darkness. I'm sorry folks, but Mr. Albom should stick to his sports writing.Obviously his spiritual side needs nurturing."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As much as I loved Tuesdays With Morrie, I can not bring myself to love this story. I think Mitch Albom had the right idea. I think the message is noble and true. But instead of being uplifting and intelligent the whole book seemed naive and awkward. Not much rang true in the plotting and the material just was not up to standard. i think the plot made for a very good short story. Something that people can enjoy and appreciate, but the novella form is way too long for what Albom had in mind.I felt like this was a pretty shallow exploration of mortality, ethics, spiritual maturity and the basic lessons of life. Maybe I was expecting way too much, but it seems to me that Mitch missed Morrie more than he knows."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After reading &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; I thought great things of this author. Unfortunately I was very dissapointed in &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot;. I had a difficult time getting through this one due to its slow pace and boring content. This could have been a great book, but the author missed the boat here. Read &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; and leave this one on the shelf."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People you Meet in Heaven is an extraordinary novel with several thought provoking scenes and several \\"lessons\\" which make you consider your life and purpose. Eddie is 83, working as a Maintenance man at the local Ruby Pier Amusement Park. After a tragic incident at the park that kills him, Eddie transforms into many \\"stages\\" in his life in heaven. Surprisingly, each person he meets had some way in his life whether he knew them or remembered them. Each individual reminds Eddie of the importance in life and the universal idea that we are all connected in various ways. With all the lessons the five individuals teach, Eddie's understanding of life, family, strength and love is finally complete.The Five People by far is the best novel I have ever read. The ending of the novel leaves you wanting more and at the same time, its last pages makes one wonder about some of the things we take for granted. Mitch is an amazing writer who uniquely crafts Eddie's life between chapters of lessons and birthdays. Each year we learn something new about our selves that maybe someday in heaven, we will understand. This novel teaches you that in life you may not comprehend everything; you aren't supposed to. Life happens in weird ways sometimes, but we must live it to understand it. This book is highly enlightening and inspirational; I would recommend this novel to anyone and hope everyone purchases this amazing book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"What a wonderful premise ( imagine whom we might be able to meet once departed) and catchy title. It created Much expectation for this reader. However, this book dissapointed me. I expected to feel inspiration and encouragment for living after reading this book. I did not, my reaction was -yeah.., well..so what!We meet 5 people from his life (loosly), one is even unknown to him! Their messages to Eddie seem pointless and I wonder if they actually meant more to the messengers than to our main character . The first messenger actually tells Eddie that Eddie (at age 7 or there about) was the cause of this man's death!I would have preferred Eddie to have had a near death encounter and then go on to live an enlightened , inspired life. Instead the message I sensed was-** some people die ,our lives go on, it might be you next time, it might not, life Suc*s, but oh, your life does matter*-I found the whole book anti-climactic after the title. Seems to me this was really a mediocre short story, about a man that thought his life was mediocre and sadly, heaven seemed mediocre for him too."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book was just ok. I was longing for a &quot;hard to put down&quot; book, but this certainly was not it. I kept going through it thinking that the next chapter or the next person he meets will be better, maybe have a good lesson to teach, say something that will really make you think. But it never really happened. The parts that were the best were when he spoke of his wife and the true love that they had."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom begins with the last hour of the life of a man named Eddie-strange, but fresh and intriguing to begin a story with an end. When Eddie dies he goes to heaven where he meets five important people that either impacted him or were impacted by him while he was alive. The five people are there to teach him some kind of lesson and explain why some experiences happened during his lifetime. This book explores events in Eddie's life that are similar to many peoples today-a neglecting father, illness and death of loved ones, fighting in the war, depression-and I think that his emotions are easily portrayed because of that. This book was very well written because it ventured into areas that are not touched often. The afterlife is an unknown and curious thing that almost every human being wonders about some time or another, and this book reveals one of those versions never to have been suggested before. It says that no matter what happens to us, everything affects someone else and all of our experiences are connected together-\\"The world is full of stories, but the stories are all one,\\" says Albom."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"&quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; did not make me cry but it did make me smile a lot. I read this book in November.This book is written in a way that nothing is long and drawn out. Descriptions are very vivid and clear, there is no room to get bored and lost in the words.The idea behind the story is one that we all might cling to; at the same time, it is not completely what we might wish for. I would expect a more predictable version of this book to include five people who you dearly love and miss; however, that is not the path this book takes. You do not come away thinking, &quot;wow, I can't wait to get there and see them again.&quot;There are some great images in this book. One of my favorites is:&quot;The unspoken blame for this never found a resting place - it simply moved like a shadow from husband to wife. Marguerite went quiet for a long time. Eddie lost himself in work. The shadow took a place at their table and they ate in its presence, amid the lonely clanking of forks and plates.&quot;"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"We never know whose life we will impact. Will it be positive or negative? How will we know? When, if ever will we know? Mitch does a fabulous job of showing us how our actions and decisions just might possibly affect others in ways we may never know. Just to be safe, be kind to others."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had hoped this book would tell of how ordinary people make a difference to others in positive ways that they may never know about until they die. So I was surprised to see that the majority of the book is NOT positive - it seems like Eddie has had just as much (or more) negative influence as positive on the majority of the five people he meets. I also found it odd that he could experience so much physical discomfort in heaven. While I agree with the idea of a life review once you reach the Other Side, I sure hope it is nothing like this ! Eddie is a sympathetic character, and the author is a good writer, but overall, this book did not inspire me."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book really grabbed me from page one. I was pulled right into the drama of this one man's life... and death. This is a short insightful little gem of a book. It is real. This could be about my own uncle or grandfather. I loved it and especially enjoyed how Albom depicts heaven as a place where the meaning of your life is explained to you... that even when you feel you have wasted your time on Earth... you really haven't because you inadvertently have affected the lives of everyone you ever come in contact with.I am passing this book on to my mom, and a few more friends after that. It is well worth your time to read this book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had been given a gift certificate and looked at everything for weeks. Nothing grabbed me. Nothing begged me to read it. And then one night I found this book. It sat on the shelf very innocent and yet there was something about it that made me just have to have it. And so my journey began.I was hooked from the moment I read the first chapter. All I wanted to do was read and find out more about Eddie and more about the people he touched. The premise of the book was very creative and Mr. Albom was able to pull it off with ease. Reading the book flowed much like the rides at the amusement park where Eddie worked. You see heaven and then a twist or a turn of the rollercoaster cart and you look at Eddie's birthdays. Amazing.But probably the most amazing thing about this book is the depth of such a simple life. This is a book that makes you think while you are reading it, but it goes way beyond that; it makes you think long after you have finished it. I feel a sense of connectedness that I did not feel before - hokey, maybe, but, nonetheless true.If you read nothing else this year, read this book. It surely will change your perspective on life and make you think."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Sometimes I wish the book's title were \\"The Ten People You Meet in Heaven.\\" I just could not get enough of the wisdom imparted to us through the characters Eddie meets in Heaven. Eddie, the protagonist, represents each and every one of us. Up to his last moment on earth, Eddie had not managed to put together the different \\"interwoven threads\\" defining his life and events that transpired in it and that shaped his character. During his orientation to Heaven, Eddie gets to experience and converse with five different people who had some form of interaction (directly and indirectly) with Eddie during the course of his life. Through these conversations, Eddie is able to better appreciate events and learns to accept his previous life.In life, we all have questions with no answers. We all wonder why God has taken this man young. \\"He was a good young man. Why did God take him so soon?\\" - we say. There are answers to all these questions. It's just that we are not ready to understand them yet. God will eventually reveal to us answers and we will learn at some point in our life (here on earth or in Heaven) why these things had to happen.This books rejuvenates faith, gives hope, and reminds us that our lives on earth should be closely cherished. We need and have to make ourselves available for others because we do not belong to ourselves."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book after I stumbled upon it in a used bookstore. I had read Albom's other book, which I also recommend; however, The Five People You Meet in Heaven blew Tuesdays with Morrie out of the water. It was flawless. I read majority of the book in one day. I just couldn't put it down. I love Albom's style of switching between flashbacks and the present, which never gets confusing.I don't want to go into any kind of summary about the book, because I don't want to spoil it for anyone - so I'll leave you with my STRONG recommendation to read The Five People You Meet in Heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"there are no words to describe this book. you simply must read it. i borrowed it from a friend and after i returned it i ran out and bought it. then i bought another copy for my boyfriend, and then another copy for my dad. i love this book so much that when i'm done reading it, i start back at the beginning and read it again. it's changed my perspective on my life here on earth, and my visions of the after life. i love this book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After reading other reviews about this book I decided to purchase it as an extra to help me qualify for the free super saver shipping!

It really makes you think about how you live your life and who YOUR five people you meet in Heaven will be!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\`The Five People You Meet in Heaven' is one of those books that offers a spiritual message tied up in a captivating and well written story, much like \`Way of the Peaceful Warrior' by Dan Millman or \`The Alchemist' by Paulo Coelho. This book follows Eddie, an amusement park maintenance man, after he dies, goes to heaven and meets five people who have had a profound impact on his life. Many of them changed the way his life unfolded and yet he often isn't aware of the impact these various people actually had until it is explained to him. Each of these 5 people are introduced sequentially and after each story unfolds you are shown, along with Eddie, the lessons to be garnered from each person and experience. This book in no way feels preachy or contrived and manages to explore some timeless spiritual themes from within an engrossing story. You could easily read this for the story alone and not try to get anything else from it; the fact that you can is a happy bonus. This is a short, well written and touching little book and makes for couple of days positive reading. Well worth a look if you enjoyed the other books mentioned above or if you like easy to read, yet thoroughly beautiful books.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is an amazing book. It is easy to read and it makes you think about your own life. Mitch Alom is a very creative writer and he takes you to the very place and time that he is writing about. You can almost see the sights and even the smells that he is describing. It is a very intriguing book to read and I feel everyone should read this book at least once in their lifes."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is fiction. It is simple, sad, sweet... maybe even too neatly wrapped for a lot of people.... There's nothing special about the main character. That's kind of the point. The author was going for ordinary with a lowercase o. He asked himself questions along the lines of what if an ordinary person, who thought nothing about their insignificant little lives, got to heaven and found out that something they did changed the course of someone else's life? Basic premise, all lives intersect in many ways.If you try to read too deeply into the book, you'll probably have religious issues with this presentation of heaven, but I view it like any fiction story. There are nice observations about people if you want something deep from the book, but it's not meant to be a religious commentary on life.Enjoy the story for what it is. BTW, I heard the audiobook. It's a great story to have read aloud to you."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a short read and very nice. I found it to be soothing somehow. I guess it's because there are those times when you feel you just don't make a difference and this little book fictionally illustrates they ways you might. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If you looking for a quick easy read that's mildly interesting, then this book is a good choice. It's all about the pebble that hits the pond, that creates the ripples, that collide with other ripples and forms our lives of chance. The tone is a little too mellow dramatic though, but it is fiction, so who knows. The best part is the ending, how it ties the story up into a nice little package of grace."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought this book was very good. Mitch Albom the Author of \\"the five people you meet in heaven\\" kept the book so interesting- I didn't want to put it down.There is a meaning in this book. You don't want to miss out on purchasing this book .This Is a must read book makes a person wonder."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book I read over my summer was The Five People You Meet In Heaven by Mitch Albom. The book was about an old man named Eddie who died who died and went to heaven. This book was a great book.The Five People You Meet In Heaven has a great storyline and many great events. Throughout the book when Eddie goes to heaven he has a lot of flashbacks mainly to his birthdays. The past events make everything make sense and have many reasons to why things happen throughout the book. The book also keeps you guessing on what's about to happen next and it keeps you real interested.When Eddie goes to heaven he is very confused. He meets the first person that he is supposed to meet in heaven. When he gets to heaven his body is more loose and in shape he can move more easily and even run. Which was a big change because before he died he was very old and could barely walk. The place he is in was were he lived most of his life but it looked the way it did when he was a kid.He walks around for a while and goes into a theater he went to when he was a kid. When he got in there he saw his first person. He was a blue man. The blue man explains to Eddie about how he meets five people in heaven. He also tells Eddie why he feels like the way he was when he was a kid and why the environment is the way it was when he was a kid. He tells Eddie that the five people he will meet all played a role in Eddie's life even if he didn't know them. Throughout his journey in heaven Eddie learns many secrets about his life and why he was a live.I thought The Five People You Meet In Heaven was an excellent book. It keeps you very interested and makes you want to keep reading and never stop."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was deeply touched by this simple yet delicately-woven story.Mitch Albom writes well because he uses simple words to speak to general public's minds. He does not try to play the word game; rather, he worked hard not to use difficult words which he feels will block the story. Therefore, the story itself is a seamless flow and the reading process for readers is as smooth as the story itself.Yet, the author throws in his observation or philosophy at readers at the right time. They all look effortless and yet are very powerful. For example, at the very beginning of the book, the author cleverly creates suspense by first describing what Eddie was doing and commenting, \\"Had he known his death was imminent, he might have gone somewhere else. Instead, he did what we all do. He went about his dull routine as if all the days in the world were still to come.\\"Even the Blue Man is able to say something very philosophical yet not absurd to his role: \\"People often belittle the place where they were born. But heaven can be found in the most unlikely corners.\\"And enlightening sentences like these uttered by the Captain surely makes the readers think: \\"Dying? Not the end of everything. We think it is. But what happens on earth is only the beginning.\\"In addition, I almost applauded when I read these words stated from Ruby's mouth: \\"Things that happen before you are born still affect you. And people who come before your time affect you as well. We move through places every day that would never have been if not for those who came before us. Our workplaces, where we spend so much time--we often think they began with our arrival. That's not true.\\"Expressions like the fore-mentioned are numerous. I am enchanted by Mitch Albom's imagination and wisdom.If there is any clich&eacute;, I feel that the author could have been put more efforts to depict the general father-and-son relationship. I can understand that Eddie was struggling with the relationship with is father. The author uses the Blue Man to strengthen this kind of impression and help the many readers who feel like to improve their relationships, and the Blue Man, therefore, would say something like \\"Fathers can ruin their sons, and I was, in a fashion, ruined after that.\\" This obvious empathy is, in my opinion, a little too shallow.Another too general statement is as follows: \\"All parents damage their children.\\" Again, I can not understand why the author wants to play up the false statement. Even though it is written to serve as a contrast to what Eddie finally understand, it is still a quick sensational remark, which could have been rewritten in a more convincing tone."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom is a hero in my eyes. This book was one I could not stop listening to. I purchased the cassette tape version so my mother who is legally blind could listen to it too. She loved the story also. Thanks Mitch, I will be looking out for your other books on tape so that mom and I can continue to enjoy your writings!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Better titled \\"The Five People *Eddie* meets in Heaven,\\" this delightful book tells the story of an elderly carnival maintenance worker whose death in a tragic accident forces him to relive painful moments of his life. Naturally, since he is dead, the pain all occurs in Heaven, and takes the form of an in-depth life review administered by five people whose paths crossed Eddie's, whether he knew it or not.As a Catholic, I am familiar with the notion that the afterlife begins with a purgation of sin. In this book, author Mitch Albom stretches this concept of Purgatory to allow Eddie to learn of the meaning of otherwise inexplicable events in his life. Why did his father's untimely death and a war wound unite to stick him in a dead-end job at the fairground? Why did an almost palpable sadness hover around Eddie after his days fighting in the Pacific? Why did his father not speak to him in his last years? The five people Eddie meets help him understand the stories of those around him, helping him to make sense of his own life and thereby rid himself of old guilt and sense of worthlessness.Narrator Erik Singer does a nice job of giving each character a distinctive voice: from the light Bronx accent of Eddie and his friends, to the Romanian accent of his father, to the southern accent of the Captain. The CD set starts and ends with conversations and interviews by Albom himself. A quibble is that while Albom wrote the book in a way that allowed the reader to imagine the seaside amusement park to exist anywhere along the eastern or western US seaboards, the narrator's Bronx accent fixed the story firmly in New York. No matter.\\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" is full of hope and longing and answered prayers. The Heaven it depicts is not a theological one, but a psychological one. And if (as Christian theology dictates) our bodies are integral to whom we are , and if our minds arise in some sense from those bodies, then a psychological understanding of who we are and what has transpired to us ought to be part of our Heaven.A beautiful, moving, sad and uplifting book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Before I get into the review of this book I think it would be a good idea to get a few things across about myself. First off I have just gone threw a life altering event in which I almost died, nearly lost an arm and now have a skin graft stretching the entire length of my arm to remember the incident. Also, I am not a very religious person and rarely do go to church, something that I can foresee changing after my near death experience. I like many others have heard how great this book really is and held off on reading it because I was to \`busy' with my life. When I was in the hospital I made it a point to myself to stop putting this book off and read it cover to cover in one sitting. After my quick stop to the local library yesterday I set aside tonight as the night I would finally read this book, a night that I will never forget.I can honestly say that this book is something that truly touched me, something that hit home. I have read quite a few books in my short 20 years of living and this is the best without a doubt. In the 2 short hours that I read I could not help but become attached to the man Eddie as he went along his journey. I felt his pain as he relived stores and felt as though Mitch Albom put me right there with Eddie to experience everything first hand. As the first book I have read by Mitch Albom I have to say that I am extremely impressed and look forward to reading more of his work.The fifth person that Eddie did meet on his journey was the one that caught me off guard the most, the saddest of all the stories. Although the other people Eddie meets show how Eddie lived I think the last person Eddie met defines his life. With out giving away who the last person Eddie meets, I think the meeting itself shows us that life is very precious and can be taken away in an instant.As I had stated before, I checked this book out from the library and after reading the heartwarming story I fully intend to go out and purchase a copy of my own and recommend this book to everyone I know. The book really puts a picture as to what I hope heaven will be like, I'm just left wondering who my five people will be. Everyone on this earth serves a purpose no matter how small that purpose might seem in the whole scheme of things, but after today I do believe that everyone should take two hours out of the many hours we have on this earth and read this magnificent book.Brian Bowen"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I picked this book up from the library a couple of days ago after hearing good reviews about it. All in all I say it is a good book, worth the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Set aside a couple of hours and get out some kleenex. I guarantee that at least something in this book will touch everyone deeply in some way. This was a beautiful story. I would be very happy to find heaven the way it was described here--and that the history of my own life would reveal such meaning for others, both known and unknown to me."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I picked up this book soon after I lost a dear friend unexpectedly. I'm so glad I did. It gives an idea about what may happen to us after we leave our earthly life. It's not far-fetched or crazy, its simply a pleasure to read. I'm passing it on to my dear friend's grown granddaughter, who is having difficulty with her loss. She is anxious to read it and I think it will help her come to a place where she will not be filled with sorrow when she thinks of her 'Gran'."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved this book! It is inspirational. It reminds us that we should treat everyone that we come in contact with as if they are there for a reason, as if they are special. I made my husband read it when I was done and I now give this book as a gift to friends and family. I've also read Mitch Albom's \\"Tuesday's with Morrie\\" - another inspirational read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five people You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom is a fantastic book. Albom has written a fantastic story about how he believes the afterlife is like. The story is about a man named Eddie, a war veteran who and Amusement part worker who feels that his life wasn't important. His views would change as five people tell him about his accomplishments. Usually I don't give books like this a chance and really don't like this genre of books. However this is a really great book about a simple story of someone's journey to heaven. It can be confusing between chapters because there are flashbacks of his past birthdays. Thankfully those are usually short and the story picks up quickly after those are over. This book is a must for anyone who believes in an afterlife, or anyone with an imagination who loves fictional stories. If you're interested in any of those things or just want a good read, get this book, it's a must have."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"With so many reviews already in for this little gem, it's a bit hard to write something refreshing and new in a review that has not been said numerous times before.What I can say is no matter what your personal belief of the after life is, you can still digest some moral and philosophical lessons contained within this short and easy read that really points out the inter-connectedness of people. Think 6 degrees of seperation of events and people within your lives and how we both learn and teach each other at the same time, and hopefully can look back on our actions and understand a simple domino theory.The author takes are most complicated personal and emotional matters and is able to break it down into five, short, stylized lessons. Among them: sacrifice, love, compassion, etc. This may be watering it down a bit, but I beleive Mr. Albom wants to keep it simple for a reason...not just to keep the audiences attention, but to really drive home that life, and our actions, are only as complicated as week make them out to be. In the end, our most complex issues can be stripped down to these basic tennaments, and they are no diffrent from anyone else.It is through these lessons that we finally learn and understand our actions, hopefully aware the next time we have issues facing us, we realize that there are time-lasting reprocussions both seen and unseen.I also believe this book, while the title may capitalize on religious Christianity, it can actually be applied beyond that....perhaps substituing in karma, or good deeds, or self-help.It's illustrations are easy and clear, and while may seem obvious at times, its only through reading this are we reminded how often we over look the obvious cliches in life, and that they actually do have meaning."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I love this book! Have heard others complain that it doesn't \\"agree\\" with their concept of the \\"afterlife\\". Hey, it's a work of fiction! Take what you want and leave the rest. It's a great book, quick and easy read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book I read was called The Five People You Meet In Heaven, by Mitch Albom. This is one of my favorite books that I have ever read. It was amazing! As the book said, it was dedicated to Edward Beichman , Mitch Alboms uncle, who gave him his first look on heaven.The story is about a man named Eddie. He worked as a maintenance man at an amusement park named Ruby Pier, almost his entire life. This story is not like many others. It begins as Eddie is about to die , when a ride called Freddy's Free Fall collapsed on him. This book is really sad, if you're an emotional person.This book taught me many things about life. One lesson is that you should live like you were dying . And another lesson is that it is not always bad to scarify things or your self. The book had many great quotes and saying. Then I read the book it made me feel like I was actually there. I could imagine the characters really good. Because of the detailed descriptions.The book inspired me and made me think a lot about the after life, like heaven. Eddie was a good man. He sacrifice his like for this little girl before he died. Eddie really enjoyed heaven a lot more after he met these five people.The one thing I did not like about this book was the flashbacks. It confused , because every time Eddie met a person , the story line would flash back to his earlier birthday, and I got lost. I could not make a connection. The people he met were people who had either sacrificed their lives for him or he, for them.I really enjoyed this book! I recommend this book if you are looking to be moved, inspired. I was happy that I chose this book to read, and I am not the kind of person that loves reading. But now I am starting to like it, ever since this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"From the author of the bestseller Tuesdays with Morrie comes this inspirational and sincere novel about a man and his meaning in life. this story begins with the last 60 minutes of eddies life. Eddie is an old man, a war veteran who doesnt find meaning in his life of fixing rides at ruby pier. Ruby Pier was the place that eddie was raised at and grew to love.

In his last few seconds eddie felt two little hands in his, then he awoke in an otherworld. there eddie learns quickly that heaven wasnt a lovely beautiful place where all his desires came true, but a place where he would meet five different people that would explain his life on earth to him. The 5 people he met were not only people he knew or met in his life but also complete strangers that all had an impacct in his life.as each of his five people explain his life to him, eddie still desperatly wants to know if he succeeded in saving the little girl that cost him his life. he would find out the answer from someone he least expected to meet in heaven. this would truly be the moment everyone was waiting for.this book the five people you meet in heaven, by mitch albom was a real heartwarming and sentimental american fable. this book was filled with love,war,friendships, and deaths. i encourage everyone to read this because i know that a great amount of people if not everyone will love and cherish this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I finished this book in bed, on a blustery but sunny, Saturday morning in May. When I closed the book I found myself watching the summer clouds being blown over the blue sky and contemplating Heaven...who would be me MY five people? Who would I wait for?

It was so meaningful with the perfect ending. For those looking to read a great book and a short amount of time, I'd definitely recommend getting this book for your collection."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven (198 pages) by Mitch Albom is about an elderly man, by the age of 83, named Eddie risks his life for a little girl at a pier who was in the way of a crashing roller coaster. When he is awakened, he is surrounded by whiteness, and he questions himself about so many things. Eddie then soon meets five people, one after another, and lectures him about life. But what he doesn't realize is that even though he hasn't met him in real life, their decision in life affected his life as well.This book is influential because it teaches you life morals such as to sacrifice. Sometimes for your needs, sometimes for others; good or bad sacrifices, we still need to sacrifice. When I first looked at this book, I thought it was boring because of how the cover looked. But as recommended by a friend, I started to show some interest and started reading it, and every time I would stop for a break, my mind was full of questions such as \\"what if this happened?\\" \\"What will happen next?\\" \\"Who's the next person he'll meet?\\" When I was done with this book, I was astonished because how creative the author put an amazing storyline and book together. He used many descriptive adjectives to set up a visual setting in my mind as I'm reading along. In the book, Albom used a different style of writing, like one chapter he'll write about what's happening to Eddie, then another chapter, he'll have a flashback, then back to what's happening, and it repeats itself until the book is done."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The novel \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" is definitely worth reading. It beautifully describes how each and every person's life on earth,is connected to someone else's. Mitch Albom captivates his readers with powerful dialogue. He understands different aspects yet focuses on a central theme. Its not so much what the author says, but the meaning between the words , such as in life where you don't summarize one's journey on this earth just by his or her accomplishments, but the person behind the flesh. It is a great book which will appeal to all ages and will definitely leave you with a happy feeling."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"My older brother gave me this book as a christmas present, and I'm sure glad that he did. This book really is heart-warming and imaginative. It talks about how even if you don't realize it you have made a difference in the world sometime in your life. This book really is special. A+"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"When I started this book, I was saddened that it was only a shade over 100 pages. The beginning of the book started with a bang. The very original idea and the excellent writing (check this out, \\"She spun away, lost in that place where kids don't even know their feet are moving.\\") promised a good read. However, after the second person the main character met in heaven, the story became stale and uninteresting. I can see how a story like this might appeal to a certain audience, but it didn't really appeal to me.Though the story was slow, there were aspects of the story that were helpful. The five different pieces of advice that came from the five different characters in heaven are all great pieces of advice. Looking back on life, we will all probably wish we had loved more, forgiven more, sacrificed more, and cultivated better relationships. The things people focus on in our earthly lives are often very temporary. But in the light of eternity, the important parts of life are revealed. If you were staring at the story of your life from the afterlife, what changes would you make?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In the Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Album Eddie dies on his 83rd birthday in an attempt to save anothers life.

Eddie ran at her and tried saving his life but took his own life in exchange. Eddie doesn't know if he saved her or not. He goes to heaven where he will meet five people who changed his life or he changed their lives forever.This book is very interesting and i would recomend it. My favorite scene is when Eddie meets his old Army captain and he explains why Eddie is crippled. I learned that everyday sacrefices are made weather you know it or not. This book also tought me that every thing you do will have some type of influence on someone else. This book made me think of the influences I can make on peoples lives.Eddie believed heaven would be a place where angels looked down on people. He finds out heaven is a place where your life is explained."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Yes' it's a bit sappy. And going into reading \\"Five People...\\" you need to be in a right frame of mind I suppose.It depends on what you believe about the life after the one on earth. Will we be given a tour of the life we just lived? Who will show up with us? How have we been involved in their life? Did we ever see them? Talk to them? Know them at all?Perhaps if we are a teacher, we may never know how many lives we will have been a part of once the children of our class move on to lives of their own. Or if a doctor helps someone, how many others that person will have assisted. Or a writer, plummer, firefighter, police office or whatever we may have been in our lives, who did we help? do we really know just how many people we affected?So I ask again as in a way Mitch does in this book, Who'll be waiting for us?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven is one of those rare reading treasures -- a book that will stay in your memory and heart forever. Regardless of your religion, view about heaven, the meaning of life and your role in it, The Five People You Meet In Heaven will grab your attention and not let go until the last word. And, in so doing, this book will help change much, if not all, of whatever you've thought about heaven and the meaning of life on earth. Albom's narrative skills and his ability to create succinct, yet impactful dialogue for his characters demonstate a talent that is light years ahead of most other authors. The Five Years You Meet In Heaven is destined to become a classic -- and this honor will be well-deserved. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Don't read this book without a box of tissue around.

It is spirtually uplifting and kept my interest from start to finish. I highly recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" can have an entirely different meaning to different people. You can take the book for it's literary meaning about a maintenance man named Eddie who, at the time of his death and on his way to Heaven, is visited by five people who have played an integral part in his life. For those in search of deeper meaning and insight, you can take a philosophical approach to the book. As we come face to face with death, there will be those we meet in Heaven who have played an vital part in our lives; some we have known and others we have never actually met, but none-the-less they had a major impact on our lives.Now, I would certainly hope that on life's journey into Heaven, there might possibly be more than five people whom I will meet. On the other hand, there are a few I hope never to meet again because they caused me sufficient aggravation here on earth. I am currently living with cancer, so when my time here has passed and those gold elevator doors open wide, with any luck at all, those who have been a thorn in my side will be going in the opposite direction. I only hope my elevator is going in the upward direction.I preferred to take the philosophical approach to \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" and, seriously, it did make me pause and take a look at my life and the people along the way who have contributed to the person I have become today. The book is not a difficult read and has an important message for all of us, especially if you are wise enough to \\"read between the lines.\\" I found \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" to be more in-depth than this book, but both contained food for thought and Albom expresses himself in a style only he possesses."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People is a very quick read. It's an easily traversed story. The five people met are surprising in some sense, and that's good because it makes you think a little more.This is a nicely inspirational story, very well thought and clearly written. If you've ever felt like what you are doing isn't that grand plan you were destined for, this book will help you understand how interconnected we are and give you a little hope that maybe the big scheme thing isn't so necessary.It will make you feel good and sad at the same time. And that is part of being fully human. It is very much worth the read, mainly for the emotional impact it can have on you - as long as you remain open to possibility."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It makes me think about if I was in Eddie's shoes who I would run into if I went to heaven. I know I am reading a good book if it makes me cry at some point for some reason, and judging by that, The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a really good book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"The End.\\" The story starts with those two words, and in the next breath tells us that Eddie, the main character, is about to die in less than an hour. I found this opening compelling and the rest of the novel did not disappoint. Described as a parable, the story takes the premise of \\"It's a wonderful Life\\" -Is there meaning to our lives--and adds the Wise Philosopher moments that characterized \\"The Celestine Prophesy\\"--the Sage on stage tells the lesson we should learn from the presented events.I'm not usually one for such overt philosophizing and will steer clear of such writing. Mitch Albom writing talent shines as he mostly avoids these pitfalls and tells Eddie's story that is engaging and provides character depth that you sympathize with Eddie as he reviews his life like watching a 3-D movie, guided by five different people in Heaven. Eddie's revelations, sometimes painful and occasionally happy are moving, stays faithful to the overall theme that every person's life has meaning, serves a purpose whether we are aware. The sage on the stage moments by each of the five people Eddie meets does grate my nerves like finger nails on a board because the lessons are understood from the vignettes. Fortunately, Mitch Albom keeps those moments short.The storytelling flows quickly, and you'll find yourself finished before your ready. The final pages tie the story lines into a neat satisfactory manner, as should this kind of book. I highly recommend pausing and reflecting on the Sages' themes prior to reading on about the next person Eddie meets.You won't be disappointed.The audio book is worth listening to as it is one of the few that use background music to enhance the mood. The arrangements work very nicely with the narration. I was especially sucked in by the theme music for Eddie's first and only love."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I am a huge reader and this is one of my favorite books ever. I read it in one sitting. It makes you think about lives intersecting and how each story affects the other and the other affects the next. Basically, the world is full of stories, but the stories are all one. It makes you also think about death and how it doesn't just take someone; it misses someone else, and in that small distance, lives are changed. We think such things are random, but there is a balance to it. There is an excellent page of writing on what the character learned in the war. You should buy the book for that reason only. Great quote from the book: We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade. And the harm we do, we do to ourselves."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book is a relatively short but engaging read. I recommend this for anyone who enjoys a &quot;good tale&quot; but especially for those interested in spiritual and philosophical matters. The story sometimes brought me to tears. It certainly provoked thought on the &quot;meaning of life&quot; and how our mundane earthly existence might be much more important than we imagine."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'm almost embarassed by how much I liked this book. And I'll be the first one to admit that it is not for everyone.Albom has followed up the classic &quot;Tuesday's With Morrie&quot; with a parable about faith, and the impact we have on other's lives. It's part &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; part Greek myth, and part Don Miguel Rios.A very short story to begin with, Albom's use of language is so crafty that you don't realize how quickly the story of Eddie's final moments and encounters goes by...until you realize that you want more. And if you are moved by this book, you'll be thinking of your own &quot;5 People&quot; for many days after completion.To say much more would give away the joy of finding out what is so special about each of our own &quot;5&quot;. Suffice it to say that if spiritual based, new-age leaning, life affirming literature is your cup of tea, you're going to love this story."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Brilliant is the best word to describe this mesmerizing yarn of Eddie, a simple ordinary man who leads a lackluster life as a maintenance worker for an amusement park. Eddie dies suddenly at the age of 83 from a quirky accident and is transported to heaven. At first, he's disappointed that heaven isn't all he had it cut out to be. Turns out, before he can advance to a higher level and finally be free of his pain and bitterness, he must meet with five people-people who have had a significant influence on the course of events during his lifetime-events he wasn't aware of or able to comprehend at the time. Mitch Albom intertwines the heavenly encounters with flashbacks of Eddie's birthdays from his childhood years to present time and does it superbly. Read it once, then read it again. You'll appreciate the story and meaning behind it even more the second time. Brilliantly written and most deserving of its status on the top ten list, destined to be number one. You will laugh, cry and mostly think--think about what REALLY matters in life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had this book on my reading list, but after I heard Barbara Walters talking about her special on \\"Heaven,\\" I decided to finish the book Christmas Eve. There's no doubt in my mind that this story will affect all those who are lucky enough to read the book. Each person Eddie met in heaven was there for a reason. Life made sense. There was meaning. There was a purpose. No random acts. Eddie's 5th person put it in perspective as Eddie learned that his life here on earth had such an important purpose.This is something Eddie didn't expect. He thought his life was mundane and his existence didn't really matter. I believe that most people who read this book with an open mind and heart will be moved by the simplicity and genuine message in the story. It made me ponder over the situations in my life and what really matters during our existence on earth. All those things many people consider indispensable on earth are not as meaningful as compassion and love. We are all here for a reason. We all have a purpose in life. Some \\"intellectuals\\" might dismiss this little book as not possessing \\"real\\" literary value. But as we all know, precious gifts often come in small packages.What a gift Mitch Albom has given us in \\"Five People You Meet in Heaven.\\" It will certainly make readers reflect on the afterlife and what our real purpose is here on earth while we await our own journey into what lies beyond. A simple man, a simple book, a simple lesson, but a gripping and compelling story will change your thoughts on the meaning of life. It just might make us better human beings here on earth. That, in itself, is something to be praised.Nancy Draper (Author)A Burden of Silence: My Mother's Battle with AIDS"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is clearly the kind of novel I would read after a very harried week at work--and well, that's exactly when I decided to breeze through this touching little story. Yes, as others have stated, it is a simple and straight-forward narrative, but we can all relate to the very questions it poses. And it brings a sense of--at least for me-asking those very questions:What kind of life am I living? What kind of person have I been?And for this, I think this is a worth-while read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"This is a story of a man named Eddie who was shown the secret of heaven: that each life affects the other, and the other affects the next. The world is full of stories, but the stories are all one.\\" - The Five People You Meet In Heaven by Mitch AlbomA critical, abusive, alcoholic father. The nightmares--and a physical wound--courtesy of war. Infertility. A beloved wife struck down with a neurological disease. Evaporating dreams of being an engineer, replaced with a life-long job as a theme park maintenance man.Eddie feels like a loser. He was a nobody-his alcoholic father made sure of that. Working at the theme park Ruby's Pier, like his father before him, is how Eddie died and went to heaven.Author Mitch Albom wrote the script for the made-for-TV movie The Five People You Meet In Heaven, which is based on his bestselling book. The theme of this story is that no life is a waste, no matter how seemingly insignificant-and that there are no random acts, because all are connected.The profound but simple truths in this poignant story by Albom reflect the New Age themes that all is one, there are no random acts, and that peace, learning and growth face us on the Other Side.On a sunny day at Ruby's Pier, a cable system breaks down on an amusement ride, and Eddie, played by Jon Voight, tries to save a girl from death. He feels small hands in his as he tries to pull her to safety.\\"When Eddie died, he felt no pain. He experienced calm-as if every pain he experienced on Earth was washed away.\\"In heaven, Eddie is first met by a man who used to be a part of Ruby Pier's freak show-a man tinted blue by a chemical tincture he drank as a child (played by Jeff Daniels). The man of blue tells Eddie that he will meet five people in heaven, and each will share things which will be a lesson for Eddie. The part that the Blue Man played in Eddie's life was unknown until Eddie arrives in heaven: as a small boy, Eddie was playing ball in the street, and the Blue Man, driving down the same street, swerved to miss him. The Blue Man ended up dying of a heart attack, and Eddie was unaware of his part in the story.When the Blue Man shared what happen, Eddie felt badly-that the accident wasn't fair, and that it should have been him that died. The blue man replies: \\"There is no fair in life and death. If it were, no good men would die young.\\" Eddie assumes that he will now pay for his \\"sin\\" and be judged. The Blue Man dismisses this idea, almost with amusement: \\"No, no, no.\\", he says, shaking his head. In heaven, there is no judgment, but rather an opportunity to examine our lives-who we touched, the choices we made, and the consequences of those choices.Eddie is then visited by four more people, in their own unique heaven. Forgiveness is another theme of the story, and the character of Ruby tells Eddie: \\"Hatred is a curved blade. The harm we do to others, is harm we do to ourselves...no one is born with anger. It builds up over time, with the things we don't say and the things we bury. When we die, the soul is freed of it-free to see the truth.\\"The process that Eddie goes through when he dies is consistent with the case studies featured in the books Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls by hypnotherapist Dr. Michael Newton. No angry God awaits us at the gates of death, but instead, we are met with kind, loving guides and souls-eventually being ushered into a personally designed \`curriculum' for our soul's growth and edification. When Eddie meets his former military captain in his personal heaven the captain says to him: \\"Time isn't what you think it is, kid. Neither is dying.\\" Also consistent with between-life regression case histories is the ability for souls to change shape (like Eddie's wife did when he asked her to become \\"old\\" again), as well as the ability to \\"choose\\" your heaven.The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a story of redemption and personal meaning, as Eddie finally realizes that everything- even difficulties, disappointments, and deaths-happen for a reason. We're also reminded that \\"all endings are beginnings. We just don't know it at the time...\\"Throughout the story, Eddie calls himself a loser, feeling that he did not accomplish anything with his life (like going to engineering school as he planned). He felt alone, and without anything to show for his life. However, at the end of meeting the five people from his life on the Other Side, Eddie is shown the results of his everyday, \\"mundane\\" work as an amusement park maintenance man: a sea of people of every age, race, and walk of life that were kept safe over the years by his diligence:\\"All the accidents he prevented, all the people he kept safe-their children, and their children's children-are because of the things he did day after day.\\"The human search for a sense of meaning and purpose to life is a deep one. Perhaps the first thoughts of the first human were \\"Who am I? Why am I here?\\" We're still asking these questions--and desperately looking for the answer.Living in an increasingly complex and stressful era, it's tempting to think that the mundane is meaningless and that life is a random crapshoot. I was deeply moved by this story, reminded that no interpersonal interaction is by chance, and that every cruel, painful, or disappointing situation serves a higher purpose that will someday be explained. The Five People You Meet In Heaven by Mitch Albom shows that, truly, no life is a \\"waste\\", and no life is insignificant. My story is a part of your story, because all of us are connected in the web of life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It makes me laugh out loud every time I read some earnest review condemning this book to the trash -- because it's like people complaining that A Christmas Carol or It's A Wonderful Life stink as pieces of philosophy or art.

The message simple but relevant, the hero an ordinary man who never saw his life was worth anything... and who doesn't feel like that from time to time?

This is a book I want to share with everyone! Not to scare anyone away from it -- by the end of this story, I was a sobbing mess! The first four of Eddie's people give little pieces of the puzzle, profound little tidbits to help him understand more about the events in his life. But his &quot;fifth person&quot; reveals Eddie's true purpose in life, a life that Eddie felt was a &quot;nothing existence&quot; on Earth.

A truly inspiring piece of American literature that EVERYONE should read!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"To tell the truth, after reading Tuesdays with Morrie from Mitch Albom, I did have high expectations for this follow-up.And I must say that my expectations were more than surpassed by another winner from him.The interweaving of Eddie &quot;Maintenance&quot;'s various aspects of life from his childhood, teenage years, courtship, military service, marriage, middle age to old age and finally the beginning of his journey through heaven was beautifully and intricately spun in this short tale.The poetic descriptions of the various &quot;steps&quot; in heaven that Eddie traversed through in search for inner peace before his final resting destination and the 5 lessons he had to learnt brought to mind the eternal existentialistic questions of why we are here and what our life purpose is, in a quiet and non-intrusive manner. So much so that we can be prompted to examine our own lives more sympathetically.The message I got from Mitch Albom at the end was that Eddie could have been anyone of us and that we do not need to wait for our turn to meet our five people in heaven to recognise that whatever we are doing now has meaning and has purpose in wonderful and beautiful ways and that we should never allow ourselves to belittle our lives.Not quite the tearjerker as Tuesdays but Five People has certainly touched my heart and a few others in more ways than one. I hope that you will allow this beautiful book to touch yours too.Kudos to Mitch Albom and a big thank you to his uncle Eddie for being the source of inspiration for this would-be classic.God bless"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this because it was strongly urged upon my by a friend. It was a quick and painless read, but a waste of time. I will try to avoid spoilers.It is about a saintly old codger named Eddie, who in the opening chapter dies heroically at the age of 83 attempting to save a child's life. (This, BTW, is exactly how I would like to die -- heroically, at the age of 83). He finds himself in a sort of afterlife, where he must meet five former mortals (all in some way connected to his earthly life) who will explain his past life to him, so that he can understand it better. Evidently, this routine of the five-explainers is something that every departed soul must endure (hence the title seemingly addressed to the generic reader), but it is a different five for everyone. Why it should always be five -- no more and no less --is apparently just an arbitrary decision of the author.These five heavenly explainers serve as a framing device through wich the author tells us the story of Eddie's life, while still incorporating elements of Eddie's story that Eddie could not have known while alive. The revelations are often painful to Eddie. But apart from its usefulness as a non-linear storytelling device, it is hard to see the point of the purgatory that Eddie must endure, or of the phony wisdom that the explainers occasionally expound.The overall lesson and theme is that everything is connected, and (in particular) that there were connections in Eddie's life that he was unaware of while alive. He learns, for instance, that his acts have, unbeknownst to him, caused tragedy for others, and that certain of his own fortunes and misfortunes were inextricably connected to each other. (Such latter revelations apparently make it easier for him to accept his misfortunes, but why it should matter now that he has reached the afterlife and his misfortunes are history is unclear). But the author states this connectedness lesson so broadly that it rings false. It may be true, ultimately, that all things are connected. But the universe is a vast and complex place, and (except by coincidence) everything cannot be connected in a way that a mere mortal will find meaningful.Although the goal of Eddie's purgatory is a sort of enlightenment for Eddie, it does not seem to involve or require any kind of moral growth. As far as we can tell, Eddie never seems to actually done anything that the author regards as immoral. Eddie seemingly is not required to repent of anything, merely to understand. Even the tragedies Eddie learns he has unwittingly caused were not caused by any wrongdoing by Eddie, or, if his behavior was immoral, the author fails to make this clear or explain the moral rules on which his judgment was based. Indeed, it seemed to me rather unjust of these explainers to cause Eddie emotional pain by confronting him with tragedies he accidentally \\"caused\\" in the course of behavior that was not inherently wrong, and of which he is unaware until now. So even to the extent that they do inflict repentance and remorse on him (if that is the point) they are applying a skewed moral code in which right and wrong are judged on the basis of twists of fate and accidental consequences.Although Eddie seems quite the saint and martyr, as far as we can tell, this has nothing to do with his arrival in Heaven. The author heavily implies that happened to him will happen to us all. Five people will explain things to us, we will then understand why our miserable lives had to be the way they were, then (apparently) we will find eternal happiness. This is very reassuring fantasy, and perhaps explains the books popularity. But it is not morally challenging, and it is not deep.On the other hand, as relates to this life, the message seems potentially depressing and fatalistic. The moral can be read as \\"be satisfied with all your miseries, because they are a secret punishment for misdeeds you don't even know about.\\"If you want a far more insightful and morally relevant purgatory-explain-your-life tale (though one which literally takes place on Earth) try TIL WE HAVE FACES by CS Lewis."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Well, nothing against all the positive reviews, but I really did not like this book. It had all the subtlety and nuance of an afterschool special.I mean, what a great premise: a grizzled, injured war vet with a guilty conscience and a dead-end life gets a chance to re-examine his earthly existance with the aid of five heavenly guides. Wow. Unfortunately I thought the book simply failed to deliver a good story.I found it way too sweet and pat and I really could not feel like I got to know the main character at all. Every situation was cliche, and every ending was just so pat. I kept waiting for the grand insight that would make it all worthwhile, but it never came.Instead, made-for-TV quality expositions on heaven and the meaning of life. Too bad."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This hearty little 200-page book provokes the everlasting question, &quot;What happens when you die?&quot; to rise to familiarity among our thoughts once again. I have wondered where Mr. Albom was inspired to write a story such as this; with such intensity as was shown.The story tells of an old man, named Eddie, who dies trying to save a little girl from a falling ferris-wheel cart at a carnival. Eddie goes to heaven, and with the help of five seemingly non-impacting people, he relives his life, point by life-altering point and he begins to understand why he lived and what his purpose on earth was.With Mr. Albom's unique flashback technique of writing, this story comes alive within the imagination of it's readers.A wonderful and deeply intense book and I recommend it to individuals who have read and loved Mr. Albom's previous book, Tuesday's With Morrie.Many will learn to love and appreciate this book and I hope that reading this review will persuade YOU to read it as well.Thank You ... and Congratulations, Mr. Albom for writing a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After reading this book myself, I am convinced there can be only two explanations for its stellar reviews: either Mitch Albom's PR people paid someone off, or else no one actually read the book before reviewing it. I simply cannot believe that any reviewer of respectable reputation read this book and liked it.Beware, readers. The critics are lying. It is not uplifting or heartwarming; it's saccharine. It is not inspirational; it's preachy. Albom's characters are slaves to a contrived plot. The problem is, Albom is *trying* to be heartwarming, and he's *trying* to make us cry, and we can tell. The only thing worse than a manipulative tear-jerker is a would-be manipulative tear-jerker that can't even do it's job. The result is a book that reads only slightly better than a daytime soap opera. We see the wheels of the plot grinding, and we understand where Albom is trying to take his story, but he never gets there.Please don't ignore me or write me off as a heartless cynic, because I'm not. It isn't hard to tug on my heartstrings. I cry during commercials for Walt Disney World and AT&amp;T. Half the books on my shelf have tear stains splashed across their pages. I'm an emotional, romantic person, and I really wanted to like this book. But I did not shed a single tear for Eddie, or any of the other poor characters trapped inside this novel, and that's because Albom never got me to care.This novel is bad chicken soup for the soul. Spare yourself."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Great literature invariably draws the reader in and invites him to think, to make comparisons between what he is reading and how it compares to ones own life and thoughts, to weigh in on whether there is agreement or disagreement. Story telling, on the other hand may be as simple as watching the latest brainless sitcom on television.So where does &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; by Mitch Albom fall out? After reading the book my opinion--and obviously opinion is as different as fingerprints--is that Albom's book firmly fits the former and not the latter.The book tells the story of a good man who lives a full life but doesn't know it. He feels shortchanged and, following his death, wonders what it all might of meant. The five people he meets help him to accept life as it was and to find some closure for the future. Some of the five are individuals he remembers some are mere phantoms that passed by without leaving much of an impression on him--or so he believes. Each teaches a lesson (and, yes, each lesson has applicability to every life) and clarifies how his interaction impacted life.I hesitate to say more because Albom's book is written in such a way as to make it an entirely different statement and experience for each reader. My memories, feelings and experience are markedly different from yours and Albom's story struck chords with me that simply won't be the same for you.Don't try to compare this one to &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (there is no opportunity here as Scrooge had to go back and make amends). Don't compare it to &quot;It's a wonderful Life&quot; (this really isn't a story about how a life made life wonderful for his peers). Some have compared it to Homer's Odyssey. This is a stretch because, again, our hero here is not trying to get back to his former life.Instead Albom, I believe, in &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; makes a simple statement: one life touches so many others, both known and unknown, in a variety of ways. Often we like to think that we are alone here and that an action today has no impact on anyone else. Instead Albom poses questions about how a boy's simple act of retrieving a ball from the street might result in an ultimate consequence for an unknown passer by.I did not find Albom's book to be preachy in any sense. Instead the author seems to simply state that a life lived has its wonders and consequences and when it's over it's over. Or is it? &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; does offer the interesting scenario of a newcomer becoming a player in the unfolding drama of Heaven's next arrival.Don't look for answers about what Heaven might actually be. I don't think Albom in his work was trying to offer anything new to the established canon of accepted Christian scripture. Rather enjoy a very interesting story about one man's view of what might be. And if you're not interested in a thoughtful, introspective ride, there's always Seinfeld reruns.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom as taken the experiences of a man's seemingly useless life, and unwrapped a story that is a gift to each of us.His use of the language, and ability to evoke real emotions from his character AND his reader at the same time is truly amazing.I found this to be a fairly quick read, and read it in one 4 hour sitting. The Author tugs at hearstrings, provokes thought and smiles as the main character sometimes fumbles his way through a timeless heaven, discovering that in the end, his life had more meaning than he could ever imagine.Mitch Albom is going to solidify his status as a national treasure with this book.Give this book to everyone on your Christmas list!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" was a wonderful book. Even the TV version was enjoyable (Jack Lemmon - how could you go wrong)! This book is different; this fable is not believable and draws some strange conclusions (especially in regards to the father) to come to the predictable ending. For me, this book was a major disappointment. The reviews on Amazon are not indicative of how I believe most will feel upon completion of this book.My sister, who anxiously wanted to read this book after some talk show endorsement, was sadly disappointed as well. She has not read \\"Tuesdays\\" and is not eager to do so after reading this book. That is too bad.I suggest going to the store and trying to read a few chapters before buying it. I kept saying that is has to get better than this. Unfortunately it did not. My suggestion is to read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" instead and pretend that this book does not exist.

The book is great, but I don't exactly think the overall message is too meaningful. The book is about an old man named Eddie who dies in a tragic accident and arrives in heaven only to find out that he has to meet five people who were impacted by his life and explain to him why and teach him a lesson about his life. The book never mentions God or Jesus or any other dieties that would live in heaven, which I find rather puzzling.The book scores in many places, for instance Eddie's war experience is very captivating and emotionally stunning. I found the ending to be rather weak for many reasons including that there was hardly an ending at all. The book itself is also rather short and could have been a little more detailed. Overall this was a wonderful book that is sure to touch you and anyone else who reads it.

The visions of heaven from various religious traditions tap into hopes (and fears) of people past and present, but ultimately, just as the world is different for each of us, so too must heaven be. Throughout this difference, however, is a question that is perhaps one of the more universal longings in the history of humanity - the quest to find the meaning of life, and the meaning of our lives in particular. It is this longing that Mitch Albom, best known prior to this book for his wonderful writing in \`Tuesdays with Morrie'.The tale begins at the end, not the beginning. Of course, in life, every ending is a beginning of some sort. The end here is the end of Eddie's life - Eddie, a veteran who has gone through times of trouble and tragedy as well as times of joy and optimism, didn't have the life he wanted. Like most people, what Eddie wanted shifted over time, and even when he got what he wanted, it was somehow lacking, or disappointing; on the other hand, there were unexpected things.Eddie got married, but as with most marriages, it didn't always live up to the dream of the initial love. However, his wife Marguerite remained the love of Eddie's life, and she was one of the five people he met in heaven. This was his closest relationship, but not the only important relationship in his life.Perhaps drawing on the idea of six degrees of separation, there are people connected to Eddie who are companion guides in heaven that Eddie didn't even realise he was connected to. There is the Blue Man, the side-show freak at the amusement park where Eddie worked; there was the captain from his military days; there was Ruby, for whom Ruby Pier, the amusement park's location, was named; and then there is final person, one that Eddie only knew as a shadow on earth, but who has the biggest impact, and is the one whose hands offer a very touching form of salvation.Each person has insights and lessons to share with Eddie. Sometimes they reinterpret the events of Eddie's life; sometimes they simply share their sides of the story, that give a fullness to the narrative of life. This is no easy glossing over of reality - none of the characters attempt to explain how, at the heart of it, life really is fair. Indeed, the Blue Man explains in no uncertain terms that life is not fair, stating that if it were, \`no good person would ever die young.'There are issues of redemption and issues of forgiveness here, both of which are not easy to come by, nor always easy to accept. Eddie's life, like most of our lives, needs forgiveness, both in his own sense of life and action, and forgiveness for his own actions. He learns to forgive others as he learns that he himself can be forgiven. It is a powerful realisation.\`The Five People You Meet In Heaven' has a great potential to be melodramatic and cheesy - I must admit that at first, I didn't read the book out of fears of that very thing. It wasn't until I came across a book by another author (Brandon Gilvin, whose work I'd read before, who wrote a small companion to this book (together with Heather Godsey) entitled \`Wisdom from The Five People You Meet In Heaven') that I decided the book needed to be read. I am so glad that I did.Albom draws the story together in an interesting fashion. The scenes in heaven are interwoven with scenes from earth, with analysis from the people and historical narrative and internal dialogue of Eddie's life. There are also pieces that show the life around Eddie, and how sometimes it works and doesn't work. In the end, life goes on for those Eddie left behind; despite the fact that he had no relatives and no monuments or legacies to leave behind (his few remaining friends worried about who was to pay for the funeral), in fact his actions at amusement park served purposes far beyond what Eddie could have dreamed. Despite the feeling that he had lived his life in go-nowhere, do-nothing job, he has in fact fulfilled a great purpose, explained by a little girl - \`Children. You keep them safe.' His last act on earth was to save a little girl from an amusement park ride accident, but in fact, he had been doing that all along.Albom writes in parable form at times, and in sermon form at times, and in storytelling form at times. These weave together in a wonderful combination.\`On earth...when you fell asleep, you sometimes dreamed your heaven and those dreams helped to form it. But there was no reason for such dreams now.'Eddie's existence goes on, as does the rest of the life of the world, in ways that we do not have the ability to follow. In our dreams, we can envision much; in Albom's writing is the stuff of dreams."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was the most amazing book i have ever read.

Everyone should read this book regardless of whether they believe in Heaven or not."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a book that I enjoyed reading very very much. The book follows Eddie, and 83-year-old mechanic who works at a theme park. One day a new ride that takes people up a tower and then drops them before slowing to a stop breaks. Eddie saves a girl from being crushed but in the process he dies. He is met in heaven one by one by five people who tell how eddie affected or was effected in their life. The book overflows with emotional chapters and twists that perplex the reader to read forward and explains many things that happen earlier on in the book. This to me was a great read and I strongly recomend it to anyone to read.Mitch Albom is a fantastic author in my eyes just because of how good of a job he did on that book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This short and unsophisticated story is merely a set-up for the wonderfully tearful climax. However, the author conveys feelings and emotional atmosphere so well that it keeps you engaged and makes the otherwise simple characters interesting. The writing is deliberate and plain, and accessible to readers of various ages and aptitude, but never becomes corny or condescending. I loved it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book, The Five People You Meet in Heaven, is truly one of the best books I have ever read!It makes you really wonder; who are you going to meet when you go to Heaven? Will you meet anyone at all? Also, this book teaches a life lesson. How you should treat other people. The man in thias book isn't what you would call friendly. When he dies trying to save another girl's life though, everyone is proven wrong about him. I really do encourage you to read this book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Normally, I'm not drawn to works of fiction, but after reading Mitch Albom's \\"Tuesdays With Morrie,\\" and after reading all of the very positive reviews about TFPYMIH, I thought I would give this a try. It turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made about a book in years.I read the book in one afternoon for two reasons - it is a very short read, but, most importantly, it was too compelling and gripping to put down. Albom has written a brilliant interpretation about what happens to us in the afterlife, and even though it's a novel, his writing and message resonated strongly with my life and what I consider truly important. TFPYMIH is worth reading for that reason alone - any book that stops you in your tracks to think about how you are living your life is time well spent.I won't give away any plot details or how the book ends - the ending is both a surprise and a great joy. I found myself weeping during several points in this journey - I have a feeling that even the most non-emotional among us will well up inside in a few of the more powerful passages.Needless to say, I'm giving out three copies this Christmas alone, and I will probably give out many more in the years to come. Albom has written a classic, one-for-the-ages page turner. Any small, 200-page book that packs this powerful of a punch is worthy of high praise indeed. Buy it, read it and give it to friends and family to spread Albom's wonderful message."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The \\"maintenance man\\" at Ruby Pier is Eddie, an old war veteran who feels trapped and that his life is meaningless. This book actually begins with the end of Eddie's life. Eddie is going about his normal routine of maintaining the rides at Ruby Pier on his 83rd birthday when a ride goes haywire. The staff manages to save the people but the cart snaps and begins to fall at an alarming speed and right below it is a little girl. Eddie notices and, with his wounded leg from the war, he half limps half runs toward the unsuspecting girl. In desperation he jumps and tries to save her. He crashes on the metal platform and feels a stunning impact, a blinding flash of light, two small hands, then, nothing.It is here that Eddie learns that Heaven is not a world of perfection and purity, but a place where your earthly life is explained to you by the five people who had the greatest impression on your life. The first person that Eddie meets is a man he knows only by sight and refers to him a \\"the blue man\\". Eddie is soon shocked to learn that it was him that killed the blue man. Then blue man's real name is Joseph and he was an immigrant from Poland. One day when he was driving, Eddie ran into the middle of the street to fetch his ball and the driver swerved to miss the boy but because of his nerves, had a heart attack and died. The blue man then taught him his lesson, fairness. Each person he met would teach him a lesson.The second person Eddie meets is his army captain. The captain reveals to Eddie that it was he who shot him in the leg and gave him the wound in his leg. He did it because Eddie thought he saw a child in a burning building and ran in to save her. On the way to the hospital the captain had stepped out to make sure everything was safe and ended up stepping on a mine. He died but his crew was spared because of his actions. Sacrifice was the lesson Eddie learned from the captain.The third person Eddie meets is the person who the pier is named after, Ruby. She came to tell him how and the reason why his father died so he could forgive him. When he hears the details he is able to forgive his father for the hardship he went through and then learned his third lesson, forgiveness.Person number four is none other than his wife, Marguerite. She was the only person he really loved. Eddie spends a long time with her and learns his lesson of love, then leaves her to meet his fifth and final person.This person happens to be the one Eddie thought he saw in the fire in the Philippines. A little girl named Tala. He doesn't realize it at first until the little girl tells him that he burned her. She also gives Eddie his final lesson. That his life was not meaningless, but completely the opposite. He helped keep people safe.Next, the question to whether he saved the little girl at the pier is finally answered. Yes. He pushed her out of the way and saved her life. The small hands that he had felt in his the moment that he died were not her, but Tala's. She brought him to Heaven. Now the old whiskered man waits in heaven with his wife, to be one of the people that the little girl who he saved, would meet, and tell her his story. Of why she lived and what she lived for. To learn that each person affects one another. And why he died and she was spared.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interest in one person's perspective of where we go after death and what is waiting for us."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"On Eddies 80th bithday, he is working at Ruby Peir where there is an accident. A little girl was about to be cushed by a falling cart and eddie rushed to save her. In the process of trying to save her Eddie is killed. Now Eddie is in heaven. The first person Eddie meets in heaven is the blue man. He was in a side show act on the peir when Eddie was just a little boy. One day Eddie was playing when his ball rolled into the street in front of the blue mans car. the blue man died that day because of Eddie and his ball, but Eddie never knew it. The second person Eddie meets in heaven is the captain. Eddie and the captain were POW'S together in world war two. When they escaped from their imprisonment, they seet the city on fire.

She tells Eddie that even though he didnt save hers, he saved another life. The little girl on the Peir. Eddie realizes that everything in his happened for a reson, and he was able to be at peace in heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It's hard not to be intrigued by the first twenty pages or so of this book. Although Eddie (the protagonist) is an elderly man Albom manages to make the inevitability of his approaching death compelling and dramatically charged. Then he dies and the drama ends. Albom's heaven isn't a very exciting place. It's not a soothing place either. Basically heaven is a place where people go to work out their issues. So if you can't afford a therapist now, don't sweat it-God's got you covered in the afterlife.Eddie definitely has issues. He's basically a moderately depressed average Jo with a good heart. As a general rule I prefer literary characters to be flawed-it's what makes them believable. The problem I had with Eddie is that I didn't find him interesting. One of the wonderful things about literature is that you can make otherwise average people fascinating. Not so with Eddie. And unlike many other reviewers I didn't find this book to be all that inspiring or spiritually uplifting.In fairness, I may not be the intended target market for this book. I've read a few reviewers who wrote that their Christian beliefs prevented them from fully appreciating this novel. I find that interesting because the first thing I thought while reading this was that I might be more appreciative of the storyline if I were a Christian. But by the time I had finished I had come to believe that the five people you meet in heaven is not so much about God or heaven as it is about the personal and secular ideologies the author has about life, sacrifice and repentance. I don't think Albom and I see eye to eye on these points but judging from his sales I'm the one in the minority. I also think this book would speak to those who worry that they have settled for a life that is unfulfilling and unimpressive. It's a common concern and if it's yours then perhaps you'll find this book to be reassuring.What I did like about the book was the prose themselves. Albom writes with simplicity and poetry which is a hard balance for many other authors. He vividly describes his settings and characters without ever getting too wordy or flowery. For that reason alone it might be worth picking up."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was very touching. It allows you to think about and realize just how every life could possibly be connected. Things that happen in our lives, no matter how minor they seem to us, could directly and majorly affect other people's lives. It is a very quick read because you just do not want to put it down. I regret that I waited so long to read this book!! I recommend it for everyone!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"My almost 14-year old daughter bought this book for me last night because she loved it when she read it last year for one of her classes. I was so touched that I wanted to show her that I was anxious to read it that I began reading it last night, right after she brought it home. I finished it this morning, and have to say that it is one of those books that I will never forget. If I were to find fault in it I would wag my finger at the cliches; but in doing so I think would be wrong to the spirit and heart of this story. I have never read anything by Albom before but I will be looking up his \\"...Morrie\\" novel at the local library. His idea of heaven is fanciful in a way but also a very meaningful interpretation. A lovely fable that could be read and appreciated more than once."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book will leave you feeling one thing for sure, every person you come in contact with throughout your life, has a purpose. The old cliche of \\"everything happens for a reason\\" is apparent in this book. You may not know who you touch for a very long time, as Eddie finds out in this story.No, it is not the greatest book I have ever read, however, it is a nice escape from this real world full of such terrible things. QUICK to read, even for those with \\"no time\\" at all."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" and expected even more from this book. Sadly, it was a let down. It's worth reading and poses some thought-provoking ideas, but it wasn't as \\"soul-full\\" as I'd hoped. Naturally, I was near tears when Eddie meets his 5th person -- only a robot wouldn't be. I suppose any book which deals with the topic of heaven will nearly always set itself up to be accused of \\"missing something\\", and this one is no exception: what's missing is us."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this one very quickly (but it's not a terribly long novel anyhow). Without being \\"preachy,\\" there is still a bit too much \\"preaching\\" in this one. Its about this guy who dies, and supposedly there are 5 people you meet when you first arrive in Heaven. They are there to teach you lessons about your life, and help you come to terms with your own life. A decent read, but I felt let down in the end because it didn't really surprise me or anything."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a fast-read that goes through and teaches life lessons. It was a good book, with simplistic writing, and easy concepts to understand. It makes you think on how the world works and who you have affected in your life. This book was emotional at times, and really got you into the book. The reason I rated this book a four because the book lacked excitement in some parts of the story where I just got bored and tired of reading, but overall it was a good book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I think everyone should read this book. Mitch Albom respects all religions in his heart warming story of an old man that die's to save a little girl from death. When Eddie dies he meets five people that were part of his life. Some he knew very well and the others he never met, but had a connection to his life. Eddie feels that his life was wasted, but the five people he meets show him the truth about life and the true meaning. I plan to read over and over again. It is one of my all time favorite books! Thank you Mitch Albom! I hope you enjoy his book as much as I have."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I will never go without another one of Albom's books if, for nothing else, his style of writing. The back &amp; forth from past to present is beautifully executed in both The Five People &amp; Tuesday's. The Five People is an alluring fiction of what could be, and one that stays with you and leaves you buzzing long after you've marked your page for the day. The story of Eddie's life told in a new sort of retrospect is wonderfully entertaining... a story I would reccomend for anyone interested in a little leisurely reading!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I got this book as a gift before I went on a trip, and I started and finished it on the plane. It is a really compelling story about what the events in your life actually mean. Eddie (the main character) is shown that his life wasn't meaningless, and that his action affected more people than he ever knew. He was also shown that his perception of the important people in his life was so limited. There was much more to them than he ever knew. I highly reccommend this book. It is one of those stories that forces you to think about your own life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book just before I was to have major surgery. Tuesdays with Morrie was so compelling in a time that needed closure from the passing of my Bubby. The five people you meet in heaven was the second chapter I needed to endure my most heatbreaking experince. My husband is dying of cancer and couldn't be with me in the hospital. He choose to read this book and was sobbing all the way through. We all know a &quot;Eddie&quot;. To think he was able to have the honor of making sense of his life when he died was such a blessing to him and all who shared in his pain and sorrow. I truely would recommend this book to anyone who has ever doubted lifes lessons. What a gift!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Totally uncomplicated - very easy to read - I could not put it down. It has changed the way I &quot;see&quot; things. Lots of subtle lessons in this little book! Michael Albom has a unique way of getting your attention - and initiating a soul search."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"a tale of anamolous convention that molests the notion of unequivical sanctimonious congruity, but does so with a passion that nearly eclipses that wondrous and loving book titled &quot;what life is all about&quot; by MO. both, though entirely different, reach and strike at the heart of the human condition. if you don't own both correct your err now."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought ten copies of this book and gave them as gifts. A wonderful thing to share and spread around. Thank You Mitch Albom!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was excited to read this book because I was so touched by Albom's first book, Tuesdays With Maurie. It was a quick read and held my attention, but it wasn't nearly as moving as my first experience with his writing.I would recommend this book, but if you haven't read Tuesdays With Maurie, definitely read that book first."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought this book was magnificent. We all wonder what Heaven is like and Mitch Albom does a great job of painting a mental picture for his readers. It took me 6 hours to complete this book beacuse I did not want to put it down! I highly reccommend it to anyone who is interested, I promise you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The five people you meet in heaven are the five who will confirm your fears and validate your being.Eddie, head of maintenance at Ruby Pier, a bit of a coward, a bit of a hero, is drawn to the heaven of five others who teach him his place in the universe. His life and death are not quite as unremarkable as he surmised. Eddie, who fixed rides at an aging amusement park, sees his life as wasted opportunity. Eddie, who loved and lost, and grew bitter with age, has to learn about life from the eyes of others.This is a profoundly wise and sweet fable. The message is at least as old as John Donne who proclaimed that \\"any man's death diminishes me, for I am involved in mankind.\\" But unlike Donne's Meditation XVII Albom's short novel flickers in lifelike motion like a silent movie across a silver screen. In Eddie's life, we can see Anyman and in Anyman's we can see ourselves."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I think Mitch had a great deal of pressure on him after writing &quot;Tuesdays with Morie&quot;. He had quite an act to follow and was not successful at it. I got the impression that he was trying to write &quot;It's a wonderful Life&quot; with different characters. I cannot believe people are saying that it was a tear jerker. I thought the ending was very hokey and I left with the feeling that his life was the way he pictured it, worthless. I kept thinking there would be some great revelation. There was none. The whole book was a disappointment. The best thing about it was it was over quickly!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of my college-age daughter. It was excellent! Fast paced enough so that I was able to read it in one night's sitting, it was light but included depths of passion, joy, remorse, and a few surprises. This view of \\"heaven\\" presents a different perspective than what Christianity teaches us to expect, but it provides an explanation for the journey that is life. I came away from this book with a feeling of peace and the understanding that nothing happens by chance. There is a plan! I recommend this book to anyone who is faced with the impending death of a loved one."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really enjoyed this book - Mr. Albom gives us a unique view of Heaven, and really inspired me to think about who I would meet in Heaven and what their message would be about my life. We read this book for book club, and it inspired great discussion about life and death, what the purpose of our lives are, and what questions we would want answered when our lives are over.Quick read, and very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"WOW!!! Where to start...hmm lets start off by how well the story was made. This story is by far the best book read up to date! It has a wonderful plot about this old man that dies and goes to heaven and before he meets each of the five people, there is a flash back when he was younger, and yet somehow it relates to that person dying. But it is not always the old mans fault. This book is a mix of a little comedy, some mystery, and some tragedy. It's a perfectly blended in together. It has the reader wanting to keep reading because it is so interesting and want to find out how the person in heaven relates to the flash back. It is not a thriller or suspenseful book but the average readers will love this book, GUARANTEED this is an awesome book, props to Mitch Albom"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Although this is not the kind of books I am used to reading (I prefer higher literature rather than self-improvement books) I must admit that this book is really good in its gender. In the beginning, when you read the title you start thinking about who the five people you meet in heaven will be, and into your mind come your parents or relatives, your friends who are gone, maybe your ex boss, etc. But in this book things are quite different: the person in question meets some people whom he doesn't even know he ever met! The idea of the book is to show you how the things you do or the decisions you make in your life affect not only the people close to you but even people you don't know, and in some cases they are affected drastically. Let's take for example, if you crash your car not only you are affected but maybe the drivers who were around you or the passer-bies were affected too, (even if you didn't crash against them!) In the book, these are the people that the man meets and they show him the consequences of his actions.This is a nice book to make you think about the things you have done in your life and if you feel like reading something light, this is a good book to choose."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is very good book to read in a couple of hours. I had learned about the book through family and had to wait for my turn for it to come around to me. I found it very enjoyable and didn't put it down until I was finished. It is a book that young and old will enjoy."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"What if heaven is not what we think it should be? In the Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom Eddie is shown a different heaven. Eddie has had a life of tragedy and he is now reliving it, both the good and bad parts with the people who impacted it most. But, why is heaven set up this way?The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a realistic fiction book told by a narrator and set in heaven. This is a quick read with a theme of triumph.I enjoyed this piece of reading because the imagery of heaven is artistic. For example, trees shoot from the ground and release some of Eddie's pain in a stage of heaven. I had no dislikes with this book because Mitch Albom wrote it strongly.My reaction to the book is heavy with emotion because Eddie had a sad life, but he is now in wonderful eternal life. I felt a great connection with all of Mitch Albom's characters and his crafty style of writing. I recommend this book to middle school readers who can handle an emotional script. Read the Five People You Meet in Heaven and become enlightened on what heaven truly is!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"On the advice of my sister, and most anyone else who had read this I almost felt compelled to pick it up. It was good advice.Eddie is the head maintenance worker at the Ruby Pier. This is a life that he deeply despises; he blames his father, his war wound, and himself for never leaving the pier... for doing nothing with his life. Eddie dies at the pier, but his real journey begins after his death, in heaven. Here he meets five people each of whom has been waiting for Eddie to help him understand why he lived his life and how no one's life is truly wasted.I enjoyed the book greatly, and even though I liked Tuesday's With Morrie better, the lessons that Eddie learns in heaven hit home as well. It would be a shame to let this one pass, it's a quality story with a lot of imagination and it's a quick read too."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Some people criticize the author for this book, but he states at the very beginning that it is simply his view of heaven. I started reading this book with the outlook that I'm simply delving into the mind of the author, and getting to see how he thinks his afterlife will turn out. And from that point of view, it is a very good read. The plot is clever, and I believe it is very realistic. It is about 5 people who somehow, someway touched Eddie's life, whether he realized it or not at the time. Some of them he doesn't even know, but they had a profound impact on his life, so he gets to go visit each of these people in their individual heavens: the places that are perfect to them. He then learns a lesson from each of them before proceeding to his own version of heaven, where he will wait for someone to come to him and learn a lesson regarding how he affected their life. This may not be how many people think heaven will be, but this is how Mitch Albom thinks it will be. So he wrote a book about it, and I think anyone who has a few hours to spare, and would like to read another person's interesting view on the afterlife, should read this book. You do not need to be religious to read it. I consider myself to be an agnostic and I still enjoyed this book and the lessons it taught and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read the book, saw the Hallmark movie and found both good. Although it has a sense of something between \\"What dreams may come\\" in which self realization of an almost \\"boring\\" life is that no matter how wortless we think we are, our human contact has always a positive influence on other people.The four stars is because for a book, is better than the picture evoking images as you read though, but is not five stars as you sometimes feel the \\"too fantasy\\" part (how good is a moral if you don't feel it can apply to normal life?)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was a very emotional read. I recommend this book to anyone who reads the traditional heaven and hell books. This is NOT an angel and white clouds book. This book edures so many things and so many personal events in one mans life. It holds and renders the confusion of the meaning in this mans life. Albom made this book so detailed that you feel as if you are sitting in the background just watching the story unravel. Eddie was a very confused individual, and a very depressed individual, which all comes to an end. This is the greatest book that I have ever read on heaven. I believe that you would too. There are no disappointmnts, although the style is completely different."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Thought provoking and insightful, as well as witty and creative. I also suggest the book, The Little Guide To Happiness."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I picked up this book during a trip to Boston. I stopped by a store in the Airport and it caught my eye. I was not able to stop reading this book. It is fantasic. I love the way the book ends. I did not think it was going to end that way, totally caught me off guard. Everyone should read this book...especially those who are still unsure why there are here...Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This story delivers what it promises. It's easy to read, and not recommended by me for people who are in search of a challenge. This simple, easy to read book, took me less than an evening to complete. First of all, I believe the plot was a little weak in most of the book and stronger in other places. In some chapters, the author seemed to just ramble on. Here is the a short outline of the book. A man (Eddie) passes a way, and learns a valuable lesson from five people he meets in heaven. He finds that heaven is not just a lush garden, but five people who affected your life and they explain the meaning of your life. I found myself getting lost some parts, and getting bored in others. It seemed to even out to become just at a rating of OK, because I found the book a precious lesson to learn by all people. As I have said before, this book is not recommended by me for people who enjoy challenging novels. It wasn't as thought-provoking as I imagined."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"An acquaintance of mine suggested I read &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; just a few weeks after my father unexpectedly passed away, at much too young an age. I bought it and began reading and thought my emotions were still too raw and put it away. However, being on a much-needed break in Miami, what is one to do when the rains come? So, I picked it back up and could not put it down. While it's true that this is just one persons perspective on where we might be once we are gone from this world, I personally took great comfort in an image of where my dad may be now and who he may be with.In short, I found it to be a blessing. I felt much more at peace with dad's sudden death."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"Why am I here?\\" Eddie, the head maintenance worker at Ruby Point Amusement Park asked himself over and over again.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a book you won't want to put down! The book starts out at the end of Eddie's life and continues as the author counts down Eddie's last few minutes on Earth.Although Eddie seemed like an ordinary man with an ordinary job, when reviewing his life we come to realize that it was anything but ordinary! Along his adventure, Eddie meets five people in heaven who have contributed to his life in many ways. Many of these people were complete strangers, but in one way or another they were connected to him. The main purpose of the five people that Eddie meets in heaven is to teach him about his life. Each person teaches one lesson, many of which turn out to be very surprising!The main characters in The Five People You Meet in Heaven are extremely memorable. They have distinctive qualities and faults that many people will be able to relate to.What I found so interesting about the book is how Albom starts in the beginning with the first chapter titled \\"The End\\", explaining the end of Eddie's life. He then alternates times of Eddie's life throughout the book from when he was young, to when he died at an old age and went to heaven. Although the book contains a handful of slow parts, most of it is a fast read! The author uses descriptive words to bring you into the story and you feel like you're actually in the scene with the characters.This book is inspirational and wonderful for people ages 12 and up... I strongly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's parable is not a book that is overly big on characters, plot or analysis. It does not use difficult vocabulary or attempt to give you an in-depth plot description, but what it does it synthesize a person's account of heaven into five chapters. A creative concept for a novel, it achieves its point mainly through its simplicity.What is the point? Well, the point revealed will be different for each individual. My perception of the novel, in it essence, is that the past effects our future and that we, in some odd or unique way, are all connected with those around us whether we realize it or not. Ultimately, all events and people have an essential role in our lives, and that there is something better out there for us if we can address our issues in life.Eddie, the book's protagonist, is a maintenance worker for an amusement park and gets into an accident that claims his life. He can't remember all the details of his last moments, but we follow Eddie into heaven where he, one by one, encounters five people from his past. These people were not necessarily the closest ones to him in life, but they all played a significant role in his being here. Within each of these people there is a message revealed that Eddie uncovers, a lesson about life and the relationships that he had in life. There is a progression from the first to the fifth person, and Eddie becomes closer to Heaven as he understands more and more with each story.The difficult aspect of such a book is in expressing a message or lesson without becoming a lecture. Albom teeters on this edge, but I think he does a commendable job in keeping the situations and people involved in Eddie's life the focal point of the novel, as well as the descriptions and sensations that Eddie feels on his journey to Heaven. He tells the story, and lets the reader decide. For this reason some will like it, and others will want to put it down after a few pages. Personally, I thought it was a uniquely inspiring story and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I enjoyed this book. I did not read any reviews prior to reading it, so I had no preconceived ideas about it. I liked that the people in heaven got to pick what their heaven was. Everyone got to be where they wanted to be and do what they wanted to do. It is a light read, with a reminder that all lives matter."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Albom's book is touching and moving and similar in style to Tuesday's With Morrie. The book takes you through someone's life using a trip to Heaven after their recent death as the vehicle to introduce you to the characters and events. You either like Albom's writing style and abilities or you do not. It's not for everyone (as with many popular books, the reviews on this are all over the place). His work is analogous with the Hallmark or Disney Channels on tv. It's a bit schlocky and designed to pull at the heart-strings, but it's well-written for what it is. If you are willing to use this book to get you to look at yourself and your life from another perspective, you will find value in it. If you are simply looking for a good story, you will likely be disappointed."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was excited to read this book b/c it's been given so much praise, but I was so disappointed. It's a semi-sweet book which, from start to finish, was superficial. Superficial is fine if a book is entertaining as it goes on, but this was just sort of a dull story in my opinion. I can appreciate Albom's idea of this man's journey to heaven, but his version pretty cliche and trite. I was excited to read this, but was really let down...sad."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Don't let the title mislead you. Although this book describes what a man named Eddie experiences in heaven after his death, the story itself is more about Eddie's life than his after-life. Read it as the story of how an ordinary man's life touched and changed the lives of others in relatively extraordinary ways. It's a super-quick read, and if you like literature that falls on the more touchy-feely side, you'll like this."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This unusual, original story about his Uncle Eddie may change some things the reader has ever thought about the afterlife, and the meaning of our daily lives. In the dedication to Edward Beitchman, he writes \\"Everyone has an idea of heaven, as do most religons, and they should all be respected. The version represented here is only a guess, a wish, in some ways, that my uncle and others like him, people who felt unimportant here on earth, realize how much they mattered and how they were loved.\\"In this memoir of sorts, heaven is not presented as a Garden of Eden but a place were a person's earthly life is explained by those who affected it the most. \\"These people may have been loved ones or distant strangers; yet each changed the path you took forever and left a lasting impact. \\"Love, like rain, can nourish from above, drenching couples with a soaking joy. But sometimes, under the angry heat of life, love dries on the surface and must nourish from below, tending to its roots, keeping itself alive.\\"First, Eddie meets the Blue Man who is there to tell his story, which will become part of his. All five crossed his path before he died and they altered it forever. He shows that Heaven can be found in the most unlikely corners. Then he meets the Captain who had been his commanding officer in the army. He's there to help Eddie relive some of his war experiences, telling him \\"A soldier reaches a point and then he can't go anymore. Sometimes, it's in the middle of the night.\\" As it was for Eddie's father.\\"All parents damage their children. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhoods into jagged little pieces, beyond repair. He hated his father because of the neglect; \\"he was hell on me when I was a kid, and he was worse when I got older.\\" His father died alone as he rose from his sick bed, staggered across the room, raised the window and leaned out, calling the names of his wife, Eddie and brother Joe, and Mickey. All is knew is that they were out there somewhere and he wanted them to know of his guilt and regret. There was his father, a tough old war-horse, \\"trying to crawl out a window.\\"When he spoke about his father to his wife, Marguerite, she recalled the many nights he had spent outraged at the man. Eddie told her he had now made \\"things square.\\" There is a photo of Uncle Eddie on his 80th birthday. Written by the author of TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE, he is the sports journalist for the Detroit Free Press and has written books about 'The American Dream,' basketball, and \\"Gone to the Dogs.\\" This is a delightful remembrance and the best gift he could have given."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If you are human, you will cry -- and be human."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is too amazing .

I thought at first that it would be a book that appealed to older generations, but it's great for all ages. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After a long day I was standing in a bookstore in the Atlanta Airport staring at this slim novel, which as of this writing is in its seventeenth printing, after spending forever on the best seller list. So I relented, parted with $19.95 plus tax, and boarded my plane.The good news is I finished the book before the plane landed. The better news is they were serving adult beverages, without which I could never have muddled through this one.Basically its about a guy who works maitenance at an old fashioned boardwalk amusement park for his entire life. After some heavy handed foreshadowing, he dies, thinking he has lead atotally useless existence. Then, in the afterlife he meets five people who set out to convince him otherwise. Three of them knew him, one didnt, and the fifth, was someone he believed had been a mirage. Shock of shocks, after he concludes these conversations, he realizes his life may have had meaning after all. This gets him ready for the next stage of the afterlife, which has to be more heavenly than the pain he experiences in the pages of this book.This effort, Albom's first book after the deadly \\"Tuesdays With Morrie,\\" gives the term \\"trite\\" a bad connotation. If you think of a blending of \\"Tuesdays..,\\" \\"The Greatest Generation,\\" and sprinkle it with three cups of saccharine, you will get some clue about this insipid, unoriginal opus. Mercifully, it is short. Now if I can only find someone dumb enough to give it to."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Growing up in the Detroit area, you would be hard pressed to not know Mitch Albom. Mitch has brought a great deal of joy to many peoples lives over the age of 70. From his radio show, columns in the Detroit Free Press, to Tuesday's with Morrie Mitch one word can sum up Mitch...Arrogance. Whether it is the controversy involving his dealings with the University of Michigan's basketball team, or a stern lecture about what is right on his horrible radio show, Mitch knows it all. Just ask him he will tell it like it is. This book is no exception. Mitch's style of writing is similar to something you would expect from a first time author. Very basic and lacking in creativity. Do yourself a favor avoid Mitch at all costs. Those that come contact with his radio show, columns or books usually become incensed with rage. That is unless you are a putz like him."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is a waste of time and money. It is too obvious, doesn't add any real lesson.

Just maybe."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Enlightened people dispel the darkness around them. They live more prosperously, with less stress, consider every difficulty an opportunity, and are open to new learning. This time of year is the perfect time to look over the past year and ask yourself the important questions: \\"Did I take time to grow spiritually, bettering myself with reading and stimulating conversations? Am I continuing to answer the questions that really matter? Did I share whatever good things I found with others, to encourage them in their quest?\\" We are all candles, and sometimes I have felt my flame only softly glowing, instead of brightly radiant.I am now house-bound and not able to get around. If it wasn't for reading and personal growth, and the ability to share and participate with others through the phone and internet about the things I am learning, I would go nuts! For me, books are a key to happiness. There are many people in my situation who feel life is not worth living anymore. I have seen that spiritual health, and being in service to others in some way (even if just by sharing good information) is the key to balancing whatever else is happening in your life. That's why I am sharing some of my personal favorites with you (I'll try to keep you updated as I read new ones), words that helped me heal and fan my flame bright again! I also placed this particular review under one of the books I have read and appreciated.1. The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom (how even the little things we do can affect changes in people's lives, and by doing them, affects ours too)2. Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life by Tiffany Snow (tools and training to access our God-Spots for supernatural gifts, has great stories about healing, afterlife, NDEs, helping FBI on 9-11, etc)3. The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life by Twyla Tharp (helps to ease the fears of facing a blank beginning and opening the mind to new possibilities)4. The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle (accessing the deepest self by living in the present time)5. 500 Low-Carb Recipes by Dana Carpender (actually good tasting recipes that will help you keep your physical balance, at least after the holidays!)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The title of Mitch Albom's new book sounds interesting enough and could be developed into a great story; but I couldn't find it here. The author skirmishes into the lives and histories of five people whom 'Maintenance Man Eddie' may or may not have known; but doesn't do anything to improve the main character'sunderstanding of his pitiful and worthless life. I found thebook to be depressing to read. The only positive thing I tookaway was the brief time it took to read. It would have been amistake to invest more time or money. (David in Roanoke, Va.)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"i just love his writing style. i can't seem to put the book down without wondering what is happening in the next chapter, especially towards the end. he's got an amazing way of playing with chronology, yet not confusing the reader. i agree that this is not top-notch literature, but definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something to read that will actually touch your heart. i know it did mine, like \\"tuesday's with morrie\\" did."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was very good. I started reading it as a time passer, and highly enjoyed it. This book made me think. Maybe some won't like it, but it truly lifts your sprits! The only problem was that at some parts it was hard to follow, but you will be able to pick it back up. I highly recommend this book. It was very awesome!!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People you Meet in Heaven is superb story telling. I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. Albom's interpretation of the afterlife and necessary lessons to be taken from this world to the next is inspiring. Eddie, our hero, is so likable and average. He represents every man/woman. Very moving tale."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Simply put: This is a simple book, on a simple theme, with simple characters. And, it that is why it simply works."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is a must read for the holidays. Mitch is a thoughtful author along the lines of Rudyard Kippling. I can't wait for his next book. His books are like precious gems.I recommend for the holidays, get Mitch's book; in addition, get Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices, by John Allen, and the Christmas Train. These three books will truly get you in the holiday spirit."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I found this a fantastic little tale, not necessarily of The Way Things Might Be in the Afterlife (although it does present an interesting thesis on that), but of how we are all connected to one another in some way.The story is earnest to the point of corniness sometimes, but really does reveal some basic truths: everyone matters, no matter how mundane his life might seem to him; love is never lost even when the loved one is lost; we should always try to be fully aware of how we affect one another's lives; and forgiveness is a gift we give not only to others, but to ourselves.I found myself thinking that this little story really wasn't much, that it didn't deserve the hype. Then I let it sink in, and it sort of inhabited all my cells and my whole psyche. Reading it was pleasurable, but the delayed effects were even nicer."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Ok. I teared up five times at least during the course of reading this book (which took 2 days because I'm a college student who has an essay due otherwise it would've only taken 3 hours). This is significant because I almost never get emotional to that extent when I read or watch something. There's something about this book that made me react in this way, and I'll try to explain.Even though the main character is 84 years old, you are with him as he takes a trip through his life, and you are easily touched by what he has gone through. Eddie feels like a real person, and all his pain, thoughts and emotions become yours as you read. The five people he meets all had something to do with his life, and the lessons they teach him are lessons we as human beings should take to heart as well: we are all connected in some way, and you never know who will affect your life or whose life you will (or already have) affect.This book is not cheesy or corny in any way, and it doesn't get philosophical - it is warm, heart-felt, genuine, and although it is overwhelmingly sad, you will find many uplifting moments. The book is optimistic, if you open your heart to it. I got interested in this book after I saw the movie based on it. I really recommend the movie too. It helped make the book more real to me, as I could picture the characters interacting and speaking to each other as they did in the movie. Very short read but at the same time an incredible experience. Five People You Meet in Heaven is now one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"My brother handed me this book this past Xmas w/ the inscription, \\"I hope you're one of my five.\\" I still get choked up when I think about that, but w/ that said this book addresses the idea of Heaven as a place where your life's explained to you by people you knew the most or least, but each of whom had a large impact on it in some way.Mr. Mitch Albom cleverly writes an emotionally endearing book which allows one to think, \\"Who do I want to explain my life to me when I'm done w/ my time here?\\" Great book and an extremely fast read.Four stars because it's the type of book which you feel ends too quickly. Otherwise a 5."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I just came across this book by accident during one of my many bookstore trips. This is by far the very best book I have ever read. It will make you think and re-evaluate alot of the ways you treat others.

Like so many other readers, I loved this book. I found it profound, compelling, and deeply meaningful. I dislike preachy, moralistic, religious writing, and Albom has succeeded in simply and skillfully conveying important truths without sinking into that trap. A beautiful story beautifully told, well worth reading again."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Eddie dies in an amusement park that he's worked in since his teens. A ride begins to crash and he tires to save a little girl from being crushed and he dies. The book continues with him going through heaven where he meets five people who explain his life to him. Everything he did or does is all tied in with everything and everybody. This is a phenomenal book that I would recommend to anybody."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I love when I finish a book- but its premise carries with me throughout the next few days. I started and finished this book yesterday- and since have thought about nothing but my life and all the people in it. Good thoughts, though.I ordered this book a very long time ago, but never got around to reading it. My boyfriend is away on business- and I needed something to do. Once an avid reader, I have not done much lately. I noticed this book, still brand-new on my shelf. It caught my eye, once again, as it had when I first ordered it.Upon reading the first few pages, I instantly warmed up to our hero, Eddie- and knew that I would not rest until I finshed the book. Ther story was wonderfully written, and the imagery was equally there- a constant picture painted in my mind as Eddie travelled through five different heavens of the five people he met there.The book was a quick read for me, but nonetheless very thought provoking- and I think I even cried once. I did not stop reading- not for a drink, not for a snack, not for a nap or even a bathroom break. It kept me reading from cover to cover until the last page was read.Hands down, the best book I have read in a long time. Thanks, Mitch- I think I am once again bit by the reading bug."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"But i didn't give it a 5 star. It had it's moment, and i won't lie and say i didn't cry, but some of the people he met just didn't seem appropriate... you're dead, there are 5 people you meet that you most affected, and you have to wonder are these really the important ones?But i do agree that the end makes it all worthwhile.Just don't have unrealistic expectations, and you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I don't read many books for the simple fact that I find them boring and a waste of time. This book however, was a major exception. At first I wasn't looking forward to it because it was an assignment, but after I started reading it, I was truly captivated. I didn't want to put the book down. I read it walking to and from class, while eating, walking home from the bus, and while brushing my teeth.I really liked this book and thought it had many inspirational, and meaningful ideas in it. Mitch Albom is an indredible writer and I really like his idea of Heaven.I also liked the ending. I was overwhelmed with emotion during that whole last chapter. I read the book a while ago, but still rave to everyone about it. If you have not read this book, you should, it might change the way you think about life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really liked this book. I liked how all of the characters were different, yet somehow connected. There was a lot of variety in the people Eddie met - it went from total strangers to his own wife. I liked how it flashed back to earth from heaven, and to all of Eddie's birthdays. That broke up the story a little bit, and gave your mind time to think about everything that had happened. The different images of heaven for various people was another cool thing. It made me wonder where my heaven would be, and who would be in it with me.The best part was when Eddie finally arrived at his heaven in Ruby Pier with Marguerite. I could really feel his love for her throughout the book. After he left her heaven, I couldn't imagine them not being together. It was a perfect way to end all of Eddie's experiences and a perfect ending to the book.The characters were very vivid to me. I could feel their pain, sorrow, and happiness. Eddie was especially real to me. Again, the diversity of them all really helped keep the book exciting, as you waited to see who the next person would be. Also, I really related to the theme of the book. It made me think about my life and the people in it. All of the lessons that Eddie learned from his five people were valuable in his life and in everyone else's. I realize that everyone's connected, and the theme helped me to better understand my own life. I find that I pay more attention now to little things that maybe wouldn't have mattered to me before I read this book. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I own (or should say owed) this book. It helped me see things in a healthier perspective.

Unfortunately, I found the movie to be far better than the book, which is something I normally never ever say. But, the way Mitch Albom writes really bothered me. I can't put my finger on it just yet, but I really didn't enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed the movie."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I knew this would be good, and it was great. If you have extra time, read it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"First of all, I loved Albom's book \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\". This is a truly inspirational book about lesson on life and death and the struggles of an old man suffering from an incurable disease. An excellent read! However, I absolutely hated the other book \\"Five People you Meet in Heaven\\". I thought it would be a great sequel from the same author and purchased it. I got mislead by the many wonderful reviews from others. Big mistake!!! This book truly sucks!! It is distressing, depressing and downright scary beyond imagination. I cannot imagine \\"heaven\\" to be a miserable place where you get to relive all the mishaps and bad fortunes of your life. Neither can I imagine that after dying, you have to experience and relive your own decay and sufferings. How come you have to endure a lot more of the same earthly crap in \\"heaven\\" after dying? Why did Albom's character, Eddie, have to get continued punishment in \\"heaven\\" after having lived a miserable life on earth??? How can some reviewers find that fact inspirational? How can that help you to understand your shortcomings on earth? How can all the extra suffering in the afterlife help you to make sense of your previous life? I had nightmares for several days after reading the book. If that is what awaits us in (Albom's) \\"heaven\\", I'd rather stay here!. Fortunately, nobody knows what the afterlife is like. I'm not a religious person, but I imagine or hope, that the after life is a more soothing place. A more confortable place where the newcomers are welcome in compassion and unconditional love for what they ARE (or were), regardless of what they DID or HAD. Not a gigantic courthouse where you get condemned and punished (like in Albom's proposal), but a place where you can find serenity and peace, at last! Yes, this review contains spoilers. Read the book and get to your own conclusions. If you decide not to read it afterall, congratulations! You just saved a buck on a peace of junk."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Kept my attention. Just a little too weird for me.

I have recently had a great loss, however, and dug the book out of my closet to read with no expectations except that I thought it might help me or, at least, it couldn't possibly make things worse. I read it in two days and enjoyed it very much. It is a nicely written, uncomplicated story, plainly told, and, perhaps, has given me a little hope and comfort. This is a book for those who are suffering the agony of grief and looking for anything that will, even briefly, \\"make it better\\"."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was a fun book to read.

No, not just your friends and family. What about the people you pass on the street, or the people who you just never kept in touch with? I never did, but now after reading this book I have to wonder.The main character, Eddie, is a mechanic at a seaside amusement park with a wounded knee that changed his life ever since it happened. Stuck living the life he always wanted to avoid he wonders what his purpose is. When he dies trying to save a little girl from a crashing ride he gets to Heaven to find not what he had expected. Heaven, Eddie finds, is an answer to all of his life questions explained to him by five people he knew or didn't in his life before. Although he didn't know some of them, they had just as big an impact on Eddie's life. While Eddie's life is both happy and sad Eddie begins to realize the things that he had never thought to be true of the people that had surrounded him on earth.My favorite part of the book was when Eddie was reunited with his wife in Heaven. The author unleashes Eddie's longing love for his wife. It shows how Eddie felt when he was young and in love. From this part you are able to understand why Eddie was so sad living without her.The Five People you Meet in Heaven is all about the answer one man receives to the question all people ask, \\"Why am I here?\\" This book makes you think about your life. It's a quick read but it has a long after taste if you know what I mean. It definitely made me think.I really enjoyed this book. The author lets you really get to know the character more and more as the story unravels. And because it shows you what the main character, Eddie, had become after his life, the author makes you wonder how he became that way. I wouldn't change anything about this book even if I could. Mitch Albom, the author, used the perfect amount of detail to set the scenery and mood you need to imagine what is happening without over doing it. He makes you think about the way you treat the people in your life and what five people you will meet in Heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'm sure this book has something good to say, however I could not get past page 63. This book seemed as though it was written by a 10 year old, even the characters were boring. Although these are not the words in the book, I actually read a page that was written like this:The dog jumped over the fence.The cat jumped over the fence.The mouse jumped over the fence.The kangaroo jumped over the fence.The cow jumped over the fence.The moose jumped over the fence.I couldn't take it anymore. It was too boring to proceed to the end.Since the book is so short it should be read quickly, unfortunately it so boring that you have to labor on each page just to get to the end.Bad, Bad, BAD!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; was sanctimonious drivel but this preachy, sappy, appallingly badly-written rubbish beggars belief. How on earth do writers like Albom get their worthless stuff published when so many better writers struggle for years? What alarms me most is that I suspect Albom himself is taken in by his guru-like persona and that we might be in line for some more of his potted wisdom before long. Blech!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"No wonder Albom didn't want his own newspaper to run the review of this book. Once again he makes a strained appeal to the largest audience possible. It's bad enough to get his holier-than-thou column every Sunday [I thought he was a sports writer anyway] but to market it should be criminal."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In ordering this book, I made the mistake in thinking that I would learn something about Which five people you meet in Heaven and why.Instead, it was a story about a veteran and people he met in his life.

The writing is slow, and stunted. The plot is cliche, without any real twists or turns. Within the first two sentences I could see exactly how this book would turn out. A man dies, realizes he was important to the world, and has his soul redeemed.This is pulp trash, meant to be read once and tossed at the bottom of the pile.

Albom does a great job with simplistic philosophy without overstating religious belief. His details make the book an amazingly visual journey. If you enjoy this, also look into The Alchemist."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It's a very very good book that makes you think about the things that you have done in your life and the people you have met. It also makes you wonder who you will meet in heaven once you're dead.I couldn't help it but it made me cry. I highly recommend it. The quotes are also fascinating.My favorite quotes are:\\"Sometimes when you sacrifice something precious, you're not really losing it. You're just passing it on to someone else\\"\\"All parents damage their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhood completely into jagged little pieces, beyond repair.\\""},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"this book left me in a whirl of thoughts upon finishing it. even days later i would be standing on line at the supermarket and would wonder who my five poeple were, and whom would i choose to say back for. i kept wondering if someone had done something for me, save my life, died for me, helped make my day better without me knowing. this novel is not meant to be straight foward and no questions asked. it is supposed to leave you questioning everything that happens to you and the resoning for it.just like tuesdays with morrie- albom writes about the fear of death and how overcoming this fear is one of the pillars to living and dying alike. needless to say this book is worth every star i gave it- and then some. it is a quick, easy, fast paced and simply structured in order to be read and understood by every type of audience. the chapters are structured to be small and to fit in time to reflect on what just happened and why, or to leave time to put the book down (even though i highly doubt you will want to). i sent this book to one of my friends before he started his first year in the marines- and directly after he finished his strenuous training (to say the least) in boot camp. he called me on Christmas day to say what a wonderful book and to admit (rather quietly) that he cried throughout a good portion of the book-- and for the record this guy is he-man of all he-men and never would let down his man-o-steel-man masculine guard. all in all this book is wonderful and is really worth it. it also makes a great gift and i would know...."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was on my highschool Summer reading list. Picking it up, I expected it to be a bland, easily forgettable lecture on life after death. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.The story is quite original, and it only begins when the Main character, Eddie, dies at 83 at his job at the Ruby pier. The five people he meets in heaven are either people he never recalled crossing paths with or people whom he can't live happily without. But either way, he has changed each of their lives completely, at times not even realizing it.The author, Mitch Albom, is very talented, I must say. He is vivid and descriptive using as little amount of text as possible. This keeps the story from dragging on and on and on...while still keeping it to a profound level.Overall, a memorable read!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Five People was a reasonably good, light read. Albom tries a bit too hard to leave his message throughout the book. It was a bit predictable, but still had stories that I will remember."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Eddie, a maintance worker at Ruby Pier, has a tragic death. After his death, he arrives in heaven where he is told by the first person he meets, that in total he will meet five people.

ONe thing is for certain though each person had a signifcance in his life and they will teach or tell Eddie something new.

This book gives people who are looking for a meaning in their live an idea of where to find it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Many other reviewers have taken great care to completely rehash the plot of this book verbatim. Rather than taking this approach to the review, I feel I should make some general points about why I enjoyed this book and why others did not enjoy the book. I find those who did not enjoy the book are in the minority. One must keep in mind that this book is fiction. Heaven is probably not actually like this, but the book is not meant to define Heaven. Instead, it is written to make us think. Whether we realize it or not, we affect many people during our lives. We hurt people, and we may indirectly or directly cause death. However, we also have a positive effect on people. In Albom's scenario, the main character Eddie meets five people who's life he affected before he can gain admission to Heaven. Through this process, he is cleansed of the burdens of failed Earthly relationships and is able to understand why things happened in his life.It is really a very beautiful story that causes the reader to ponder who his/her five people might be. The one flaw I found in the story was the main character's relationship with his father. While the author claims the conflict is resolved, I disagree since he never was able to face his father directly. Some degree of question about the relationship with his father seems to linger. I would have liked to have seen the writer's vision beyond the five people he met, though I suppose that goes beyond the necessary plot. Some have argued that this book is \\"fluff\\". I would argue that a good book makes a person think, and this book made me think."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of my all-time favorite books! After reading it, I bought several more copies and gave them to friends and family as gifts - everyone I've talked to thoroughly enjoyed it.Without getting into too much detail, this book is about an old carnival worker who has had quite a difficult life. Just before he's ready to retire, he gets killed trying to save a little girls life - and he doesn't know, until the end, whether or not he succeeded. He feels as if his life was a waste - a TOTAL waste unless he had saved the girls life.After death, he meets 5 people in \\"Heaven\\" - learning a bit about the true impact of his life from each. Each person shows him how he effected his/her life - for better or for worse.We can learn from this book that each and every one of us does have an impact - positive or negative - on many more people on this earth than we could ever imagine. In many cases, our effects can be felt by people we have never even met. An interesting thought to ponder!Overall, this is an excellent book, and a very quick read (it can be finished in one sitting). Quite frankly, I would recommend it everyone!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This magical gem is a must-read for anyone who has ever been in love, or lost a loved one, or tried to imagine what happens when we die. It will haunt you with its vivid flights of fantasy, deep characters, and unusual story, and it may even remind you of dreams you may have had. Mitch Albom gives us a wonderfully hopeful look at finding personal meaning in our routine daily lives and at maybe even getting a second chance at actions we deeply regret.Some passages are pure poetry and you will want to highlight them to read again and again: \\"Love, like rain, can nourish from above, drenching couples with a soaking joy. But sometimes, under the angry heat of life, love dries on the surface and must nourish from below, tending to its roots, keeping itself alive.\\"Whatever your thoughts on life and death, religious or not, you will find every page a pure joy to read.

Our lives are touched by others and we touch other's lives in ways we cannot imagine. Mitch never says it, but I think the lesson is to act with a kind heart. I have the book on CD and have listened to it multiple times with profound enjoyment."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"While this is an incredibly popular book, by an incredibly popular author, I have to say, I found it less than incredible. That is not to say that it was not worth the read, that I gained nothing from it, but it was certainly not a life-changing novella.An intriguing concept, written in a mostly heart-felt way, but it fell short of a mind-blowing experience. I felt like I was being manipulated as a reader, and I can understand that there was a strong point to the story, I think that some of the writing was taken to unnecessary extremes. Perhaps a sequel I might be interested in picking up would be the (five) people Eddie has impacted, and what lessons he passes on to them."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A heart-warming tale of the love, its power to heal, to reach out across worlds, and the interconnectedness of life. Its brevity is a positive, though at the expense of lightly sketched characters.Eddie is old, 83 (or 84?) years old, and about to die while trying to save a little girl in an accident at the amusement park where he works. After his death, he goes to heaven - a very deliberately non-denominational heaven, where he meets five people, each of whom were touched by him or whom he touched during their lives, and who explain that to him. One story in the book traces Eddie's life from a youngster to his days as a soldier in the War, another about his actual experiences in Heaven and the tales of the people he meets there, and a third one that is brief and that sort of describes life down below without Eddie.The underlying theme is one of the power of love, its ability to reach out across even worlds, and the redeeming power that it has. Some sections will tug at the heartstrings, for sure. Eddie's relationship with his father, complex and multi-layered, is one of the highlights of the book. Eddie's father himself is described sympathetically, and finally as a father - perhaps in terms that appeal to the sons (or daughters) in most of us.Similar stories have been done for many years, the most notable in my opinion being Charles Dickens' \\"The Annotated Christmas Carol: A Christmas Carol in Prose (The Annotated Books)\\" and the movie, \\"It's a Wonderful Life (60th Anniversary Edition)\\".The book is short and you can read it in one sitting. That is a strength of the book because it does not snuff out the message underneath layers of possibly overdone prose. On the other hand, this brevity comes at the expense of characters that do not feel as strongly etched as they could have been, and plots that do feel they could have been better explored and sketched. A longer book may have done better justice to the plot, but that is by no means certain. This short book works."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is the best book I have read in a very long time. I couldn't stop thinking about thos 5 people and the role they played in that mans life.

I have suggested this book to several of my friends and they all loved it as well."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book in 2 days and I am going to reread it. It was so good that I couldn't put it down, you owe it to yourself to read this one. Perhaps you will be one of my five people that I meet in Heaven!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved this book. It gave me another perspective on what Heaven could be and it opened my mind to the possibility of it being far different than what I imagined. The book was interesting and a real page turner. The bummer of the whole thing was I saw the movie before I read that book and I imagined Eddie to look like Jon Voight. It was okay but seeing the movie before reading the book sort of took away from the imagination. It was a minor thing and I enjoyed the book tremendously.If you liked Tuesdays with Morrie, you'll probably like this, too. They are very different but like Morrie, it makes you stop and think."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this shortly after my mom died, and I must say, it was very therapeutic, even if it were just fiction. It really made me consider death differently; that she was okay...in a better place. Later, I offered it to a friend who'd also lost a parent, and she felt the same way. It really helped her through the entire ordeal.I can't thank Albom enough for that. I've been a fan of his since his early sports writing days. I've read all his books thus far. Considering what I'd just said, you can only imagine how much I enjoyed: For One More Day. My mom died of a massive heart attack, so I never got a chance to say good-bye, let alone make amends. I'd give anything 'for one more day' with her. =/~Chad Clegg - Author of: The Domino Effect"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book makes you think about your own life, and the afterlife.

It is the message of the holiday favorite,It's a Wonderful Life (60th Anniversary Edition). Only this telling delves deeper into many philosophical questions concerning life. It follows a man who has died and must pass through 5 people (as everybody does in heaven) who explain the meaning to his life. What seemed pointless and a waste to him is revealed to be poetic justice with rich meaning. Yes, it is sappy and emotional. But the story is gripping and the writing style is an enjoyable and rich telling. An emotional but worthwhile tale in lovely pros. Very well done."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I became a big fan of Mitch Albom's books after coming across this book purely by hap stance. I was at local book story a week after my dad died feeling really down when I was walking through the aisles of the store heading towards my usually genre section when I glanced over and saw the title of this book on an end cap display. I read the brief synopsis on the inside cover and was interested, so I brought it, once I started reading it I couldn't put it down and read the entire book in one day.After reading the book it gave me a little bit of comfort as to my father's passing and perhaps what his spiritual journey would intel in the after life. It was neither preachy or favorable to one particular religions belief but more an assurance for those in this life that even in death as in life we are still irrevocably connected to our love ones that have passed on and whether we know or believe it or not we all have a responsibility to those we love and even those we don't know in this life and that one small act of kindness no matter how insignificant it means to us can mean the world and beyond to someone else."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I appreciated this story a lot more after re-reading it. It does, at first, seem as sappy as many reviewers have said, but on a second look, the author does convey some strong ideas well. Behind every person that we brush past--sometimes without noticing--is a story. The main character, Eddie, of course, is the kind of gruff, broken old man that nobody notices, but we see he was once a war hero who ended up trapped in a dead end because of his duty to country and family.Along those lines, I thought the two most impressive of Eddie's \\"five people,\\" were the Blue Man and Ruby, primarily because he didn't know either one of them. The Blue Man's story is a tragic one--reduced to being a freak and basically losing his human dignity. Ruby reminds Eddie that the run-down amusement park in which he wastes his life was once a somebody's grand dream.The choice of a broken-down amusent park, which seemed pretty bizarre as a setting, I guess was a good choice. Both the workers and customers would be the kind of people you don't stop to give a second thought.While I appreciate the story more, I still find the ending a bit cheesy and tacked on. Albom has made a good case that we're all interconnected in many ways we don't realize, why ruin that good observation by giving Eddie's life some overarching purpose that, basically, sounds more like an amusement park safety commercial? Likewise, he goes a little bit overboard with the interconnections--like Ruby's grandson's key?Anyway, worth reading and thinking about at least parts of this story."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The lessons from this book can help us to live our life with more connection to self and others. We don't have to wait until we die to recognize that we can live with meaning in the here and now."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have to agree with the comparisons others have made between 'Five People...' and \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". Both stories follow similar paths, as their main characters are shown that they did in fact make a difference, in spite of their doubts. And both stories progress slowly but steadily from uncertain beginnings to incredibly poignant finishes.I really wasn't expecting Eddie's meeting with 'Five' to turn out the way it did...but Tala made a good story into a great one!As with 'Tuesdays with Morrie', I had a few little quibbles with the story, but they really aren't that important. This is a worthwhile follow-up to 'Morrie', and perhaps a sign that Albom can work on fleshing out ideas and characters, and develop a talent for writing prose that can rank with the best of his sports articles."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was surprisingly enjoyable book. Eddie is in his eighties when he is suddenly killed in a fairground accident. His life has never amounted to much. He has worked most of his life looking after rides on a fairground pier. His T. Shirt bears the name - Eddie Maintenance. That has become his identity.He finds himself in heaven where he meets five people who made a significant impact on his life. He comes across those he has loved and hated together with those he has never met - but who have been affected by him. He learns that nothing is insignificant or unimportant.This is a very short and easy read. It is certainly manageable in one sitting. It is thought provoking and often moving, certainly in its conclusion."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's works first became mainstream with TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE, a modern classic that was later made into a TV movie starring Hank Azaria. This could be his best effort yet, and its time on the New York Times bestseller list is evidence.It's amazing how such a small book can have such a large meaning. When you read the synopsis on the cover, you have an idea of what the book is truly about...or so you think. It follows a man named Eddie and \\"begins at the end\\" with his death while attempting to save a little girl at an amusement park. The rest is explained both by Amazon and in the rest of the reviews. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the true meaning isn't what you're lead to believe it is. This isn't about death or the afterlife...it's about life. It's about right now. Every action has an effect, perhaps on you, perhaps on those around you, whether you realize it or intend it or not. Every story is connected in one larger scheme that we're not fully aware of.As a result, this book leaves you feeling different than what you felt before you read it. Sure it requires some abstract thought to fully delve into the meaning of what Albom is trying to say, but it becomes progressively more clear as Eddie meets his five people. Each person teaches him a lesson, and the puzzle is complete when he understands the purpose of his life. The reader is left with a gift that isn't usually given when a book is read: a new outlook at life. You never truly know what effect you have on people, positive or negative, intentional or accidental, regardless of how small of an act it may seem to be. It makes you think twice before railing someone for something petty, and allows you to consider a nice word for someone you'd normally ignore. You just never know.While it may not seem so now, this book could very well go down as one of the best of the last 25 years. It's difficult to sum up the high points and the reading experience in a few words...intelligent, thought-provoking, warmhearted, well-written...but there is one word that sums it up perhaps better than any.Brilliant."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'm truly surprised that so many customers have given this book negative reviews. I felt it was completely wonderful. 83 year old Eddie is a character that I adored from the first page, and I found his journey through heaven heart-warming and insightful. The movie was enjoyable. I bought this book for a Christmas present, too."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Gift them away as Christmas Gifts!The greatness of this \\"STORY\\" is that it is simple. No big words, no pretentious lesson hidden secretly for the academic snobs. Puh-leez!o.k. o.k. I cried at that scene where he loses the wife again in heaven alright? Thank God my baby was fast asleep. I'd hate him to think how much of a \\"girly-man\\" I am. I haven't cried like that in a long time for a movie (made for TV nonetheless).One thing irks me though... but its minor. I was afraid they were going to do the whole speak the native tounge deal. I am fluent in that language (tagalog), All I am saying is, that whole scene where the last guide is explaining her gift, would have played out better for \\"ME\\" in written form. It felt fake. I just have to get a hold of a book.Bottomline: I wish I get to encounter more of these Lifebooks(as I like to refer to them). Simple, sweet, and screams some semblance of truth the majority can read and understand - and digest. Some of us need inspiration, some of us need hope. And some of us just need simple validation."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"My mother suggested I read this book so I borrowed it.When I was finished,I went back to the beginning and started over.MaybeI'm a big softy,but there were times I was in tears reading it.I'm not a religious person by any stretch.But no tale has ever moved me like this one."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is thought provoking and instpirational and can easily be finished in one sitting. Don't mistake it for something that leans toward any particular religion and don't for a second think of it as a chick-book just because you first saw a woman reading it. The story is riveting, with a wonderful use of images and \\"heaven\\" concepts to draw you in, but it is also very personal. The ending, although a little startling, provides a sense of closure we can only hope for when we reach our own personal heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A touching eye-opener for all, that each day we live, our live in some way, small or big, touches the life of another. The contact we make with each other even in passing, will have a longlasting effect. One that we are likely to be reminded of in the future. By then, it will be impossible to undue, so the book compels us to be cognizant of the lines we draw in the sand. A soothing bed-time read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read a review of this book in the Wall Street Journal, of all places, and decided to read it based on that. It is a very quick read, not a \\"great book\\", but certainly made me think about the people whose lives we cross and how we might affect them. A book that makes you think can't be a waste of reading. Some parts of it are indeed saccarine and maudlin but the basic premise keeps me thinking. I would recommend it maybe when it comes out in paperback, or getting it from the library."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This little book is a fast and fine read. It is short, but deals with one of the modern world's biggest taboos, death.Eddie dies at the age of 83, after having lived a life he is not sure was anything at all, a life he thinks did not have any impact on anyone. After his death he is confronted with 5 different people who all have a story to tell about their own lives. These stories all include some lesson for Eddie, getting him ready to find peace and go to heaven. There is a wonderful light tone in this book, even though Eddie and the people he meets in heaven all have their sorrows and sad lifestories. In fact, the meaning of their stories is to tell Eddie and also us, the readers, that no life is ever a wasted life, and no matter how unimportant one feels, we all have an impact on someone else's life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a phenomenal book, whose only shortcoming might be due to its tremendous strength. Author Mitch Albom has cemented his reputation as a compelling story-teller as he creates a fantasy wherein everyone who dies meets five people in Heaven who explain the meaning of the individual's life. These five people may be known to the deceased, or not, but they each have a connection with the person who has passed on. In this case, it is Eddie, a crippled war veteran who lives out his life as a carnival maintenance worker, a life he believes he wasted. Of the five people Eddie meets, he only knows two, but all five add to his understanding of the value of his life. It would be unfair for me to tell you who the five are, but you will certainly be surprised by the fifth. Knowing in advance who the five are and what they have to tell Eddie would ruin the book for most readers, therefore I am at a loss to understand why or how they can make this story into a movie, which is now in the planning stages. I know that I, after reading this book, would have no interest in seeing the movie. It would seem the only way they could make the movie interesting to those who have read the book would be to create a new person to meet another five people in Heaven. This could be done, because the concept that Albom has invented of everyone meeting five people as they enter Heaven could lead to a whole series of similar tales. Albom does such a terrific job making the fable seem so real and keeping the emotions at a very high level, that I was let down by the suddenness of the ending. I expected more, though I don't have any idea what that more could be. Eddie's life is resolved, so it isn't that. Maybe I was looking for a resolution to my own existence or a moral from this fable. Maybe I just didn't want this short book to end."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's book, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" was, in my opinion just average. I enjoyed specific aspects of the book, like ensuring that we forgive one another and that the people we meet in this lifetime, or the one's that proceeded us have a profound effect on our lives. I thought that was very thought provoking. However, with that said, I was looking for more of Albom's take on Heaven and what his interpretation of what it will be like. I would recommend the book to others. Again, an average read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a self development book that makes you think about the effect you have - unknowingly - on other people's lives. 'The Five People You Meet In Heaven' was written by Mitch Albom, author of the international bestseller 'Tuesdays With Morrie'. Whether you believe in heaven or not, it is interesting to read how the author portrays what happens after death and what his take is on the meaning of life.On the SurfaceEddie is a 'maintenance man' at an amusement park. The book starts with a count-down to Eddie's death, over the course of an hour, and what he did in that time as he went about his job in that park not realising that it would be for the last time.On dying in an accident at that amusement park, Eddie goes on a journey of self discovery, meeting five important people in heaven. Each of them was in his life for a specific reason - some only momentarily. And every one of the five was affected by Eddie's life in a profound way. Eddie sees them once more in heaven as they each have something to teach him.In between each chapter or so is a page or two recounting important periods in Eddie's past, e.g., specific birthdays from his childhood to adulthood. From the point of view of this self development book review, it is interesting how the two stories work in conjunction with each other.The Underlying MessageMany people believe that during the course of their life several people come into it and make a difference to them. This book makes you look at life the other way round. Who are the people that YOU touch without you actually realising? What is the impact that YOU make on others without your knowledge?Sometimes the effect is instantaneous, dramatic and you know about it straight away. At other times it is so subtle that you may not realise how you changed that person's life till many years later, if at all!Eddie had always thought that his mundane life and job were not of any use to others. By the time he meets the \`fifth person in heaven' he fully realises just how many lives he had touched and helped.Also, he learns that each person had played a significant role in helping him to live to the exact point that he did. In other words, each person had prevented him from dying at earlier points in his life.There are phrases and sentences throughout that make you think twice, such as:* \\"Sometimes when you sacrifice something precious, you're not really losing it. You're just passing it on to someone else.\\"* \\"But the running boy is inside every man, no matter how old he gets.\\"* \\"Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers.\\"The Questions it makes you considerThe book also addresses a question that most people ask at some point: \\"What happens after death?\\" The author suggests one answer, which initially comes across as quite light hearted but does make you think more deeply about it all.When the author talks about death he does it in the way a child would bring it up, i.e., it is just one of those things that happen. And the way the story unfolds, you get an insight into his way of covering the answers to Man's longstanding curiosity about the afterlife, reincarnation, etc.The story also makes you consider other interesting issues such as:* Will the very next person you come in contact with change the course of your life forever?* Have you (unknowingly) totally changed the course of someone's life?In SummaryAs you read this self development book you do feel somewhat in the grip of the story, not wanting to put it down until you figure out who 'The Five People You Meet In Heaven' are, and why. Overall, the story gives an interesting slant on the meaning of life and what happens after death. It is worth a read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Yes this is novel but there is truth in his words. Page 104 All Parents Damage their Children. How badly were you damaged?

It was like drinking a warm cup of hot cocoa and really hit the spot of that warm cheesy, heartwarming; feel-good we all need sometimes. I am also not religious in any way but still enjoyed the message written within the pages of this little book.Eddie has to meet with five people who were connected in his life in order to move on. The five people he meets are people who were very important in his life but were people he hardly met or only slightly knew.The book makes you realize how our lives intertwine and affect one another in ways we may not realize. It makes you realize that no life is ever truly meaningless."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As a teenager, it's hard for me to find books that I'm interested in. My mom suggested me this book and once I opened it up, I didn't want to put it down. It's such a great perspective on a topic such as after life. Albom captures great emotion with the connections he shows in each person being met. Mitch Albom's books are all great, but this and For One More Day are my 2 favorite books of all time. I highly recommend this book being read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have to admit, this is one of those books that brings tears to my eyes when I read it. While not one I originally expected to like, this book did touch me and is a very engaging read.Its his birthday, and Eddie is about to die. He doesn't know its coming of course. He works like normal, repairing and maintaining the carnival rides of Ruby Pier. But something is going to go wrong that day, and he is going to die. He'll know it instantly, the light feeling he gets when leaving the earthly realm will help clue him in. But what he discovers in heaven is not what he expected. You see, Eddie is going to meet five people. These five people will help him discover what has shaped his life, and why things have happened the way they did. Each of their stories will touch him profoundly.There are really minimal characters in this book because it is about Eddie exploring his life. His family makes appearances, but we see them more through his eyes than most others. And of course there are the five, but in order to not spoil the book by revealing their identities. Suffice to say they were well chosen and really add to the book.The writing is easy to read although somewhat haphazard at times. We bounce back and forth between the present where Eddie has died, his experiences in heaven, and his past which mostly occurs on his birthdays. He also gets to experience other parts of the past in heaven as well. Despite this, the book is still easily understandable. It is also very touching. I wasn't kidding when I said before that some parts brought tears to my eyes. There are some descriptive scenes of violence, but overall the book is largely unoffensive.I strongly recommend this book. It has a lot of depth and is one of my favorites. I actually haven't read anything else by Albom yet, but I look forward to doing so.The Five People You Meet in HeavenCopyright 2003196 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2010"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have already read several of Mitch Albom's books, but so far, this is one of my favorites. I've read it twice, and given it to three friends for gifts.It's something I've always wondered about personally,and never thought anyone else did, as well."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is a wonderful read and a classic part of any bookshelf. It was first given to me when my close friend died. It was both comforting and inspirational. It is the story of a man who dies at an amusement park while trying to save a little girl from a rollercoaster malfunction. When he dies he meets five people from his past that played various important roles in his life. During the course of his conversations with these people he learns who they were and how they impacted his life. This helps him to understand the whole story behind different events and helps him to understand how we are all connected. It helps him to redefine the way that he saw things in his life so that he could understand why things happened the way they did. It is a wonderful book that helps the reader to realize that there is always more to the story than what we realize, and that we always play a part in the lives of other people. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a great story!

It represents a choice we have in the after life and it also explores the character Eddie who dies during a freak carnival accidentIn The Five People You Meet in Heaven,Eddie is, in fact, dead. His job now is to meet the five spirits waiting to help him make peace with his time on Earth. Mitch Albom's vision of heaven, the newly dead connect with spirits who help them make the transition to the afterlife. Most people would expect to meet long-lost friends or relatives, but in Albom's view, it is strangers who can best enlighten us.Eddie comes to accept the situation and cast a shadow over the rest of his life. In the book's most affecting moment, Eddie sees that his decades as a lowly maintenance worker served a nobler purpose than he ever imagined.Mitch Album presents a imagery that is distinctive about choices in life. He examines both the afterlife and the present. The book is not a new exmination of a topic. Its a revelation of what happens when you have given choices in life. The book is a mix of what one might experience in the afterlife and what life is before you die. I woiuld recommend the book for individuals who are particularly exploring life meaning. I believe we all are in the process of understanding ourselves and life.Mitch Album says it through Eddie, Jesus says it through the scripture. &quot;I am the way the truth and the light&quot; No man commeth to the father but by me&quot;"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I enjoyed the book. I can't rave about it but I found it to be an enjoyable, if short, read.Parts of the book are very touching. For example, when Eddie meets his fourth person I began to tear up (thinking about what I would do when I reach that stage in my life). Other parts are just strange. I'm still trying to figure out why Eddie meets his first person.The fifth person Eddie met was a surprise to me. Not because he met that person but because of the bearing that meeting has on a conversation Eddie has earlier in the book (with his second person).To me, the book ended rather abruptly. I didn't get a good sense of completeness or resolution. Almost as if the writer didn't know how to end the story."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is a thought provoking story of an embittered 83 year old war veteran who searches for the meaning of his life in heaven. This is accomplished through compelling interactions in the afterlife with five persons who impacted his life on earth.The book is slightly reminiscent of the Jimmy Stewart classic film, \\"It's a wonderful life\\". Albom's portrayal of Eddie gives the reader a character that we can all connect to and identify with. Eddie's interactions with the five people in heaven teach the larger meanings of life and leave the reader deeply reflective through these profound lessons.Albom's writing is descriptive from the outset providing the opportunity to become immersed in the story and eras of Eddie's life. It is a fast read. I never put it down from the time I started."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch's first effort at fiction is a masterpiece.I just finished the book, and once I got started, I could not put it down! My wife is also reading the book and we are finding it has created a lot of meaningful conversation in our marriage. :) The book is an easy read, it is marvelously descriptive and paints the picture Albom intended with unconditional positive regard for the human condition and the good that is present in all of us. I hope Mitch wins many awards for this book. Like Mitch, I am currently writing fiction for the first time. Writing is tough and big successes are to be applauded. If my effort at fiction is half as good, it will be a huge personal and professional success.Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of &quot;Our Brown Eyed Boy&quot;"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The good intention of &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; is to show that ordinary people are capable of extraordinary things. Unfortunately, the novel doesn't make an entirely convincing case.The novel--Mitch Albom's follow-up to his acclaimed &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;--introduces us to Eddie, an 83-year-old amusement park maintenance man, shortly before he dies. When a malfunctioning park ride inadvertently kills Eddie, he quietly, painlessly ascends to Heaven, where he meets the persons referenced in the book's title.Eddie recognizes some of those people instantly; others are strangers who seem only vaguely connected to Eddie's life. The point of these encounters will be obvious to anyone familiar with &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; or &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;: all of our actions, however minor they seem, have profound impacts on everyone around us.Some of the book's imagery is very striking and memorable. The trouble is that the book doesn't always succeed in its intended sense of uplift. Suffice to say that some of Eddie's encounters seem to exist solely to give him guilt trips about actions which unintentionally caused pain to other people.And the book's concept of Heaven is a very strange one. Eddie travels through metaphorical situations from his past in order to meet others who have also died. The way the book explains it, these dead people have waited in Heaven for Eddie's death for years, for the sole purpose of meeting Eddie, delivering a message to him, and then moving on. The result, to paraphrase the Talking Heads song, is that Albom's Heaven is a place where nothing much happens.&quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; is a relatively painless read, and most readers would probably welcome its message of every human life being purposeful. But ironically, what Albom's Heaven most resembles is the celestial law room of Albert Brooks' comedy &quot;Defending Your Life,&quot; where afterlifers have to justify their lives on Earth as though pleading a court case--not a terribly hopeful message."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The premise is that most of our pain and suffering is due to lack of knowledge, and that knowledge will be given us upon our death. In heaven we will learn one life lesson from each of five people.I found the story quite enjoyable. The characters held my interest, though to my taste they could've been more rounded out.However, two things didn't sit right with me.First, to a substantial degree, the story seems intended to ease our fears about death; to comfort us and give a happy version about what happens when we die.Second, the lessons themselves are mostly disappointing. One lesson is outstanding! If only more people could truly understand this and make an effort to incorporate it into our lives. The other four, while there may be some truth in them, are little more than comforting beliefs.Bottom line: If you can buy into the premise, this book may lift your spirits a bit, and there ain't nothin' wrong with that. But if you're looking for more substance, at best this book could be a starting point to get you thinking about your life.In the end, it doesn't quite live up to its promise."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I finished this 196-page book in two days; I couldn't put it down. The book begins at the end (the end of Eddie's life), but this is appropriate because, as the book notes, death is not the end of life, merely the end of your life on earth and your transition into something more wonderful. Throughout the book, we are given glimpses of past birthdays that Eddie experienced, and occasionaly brought back into the days that follow Eddie's death.What struck me most about this book was its portrayal of death and Heaven and an afterlife. The five people you meet in Heaven are people who directly or indirectly had an influence on your life, or on whose lives you had an influence. Most importantly,it reminds us that all of our lives are connected in some way, which is an excellent point to ponder.I am one of those people who is afraid of death, but this book gave me some inner peace that I feel will help me be more able to accept this inevitable event.I strongly recommend this book to everyone, whether you are religious or not.My copy is already circulating among friends and family."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book has to have been one of the best I've read in years. I started reading it early one Sunday afternoon, and after the first three chapeters, I knew I would not be able to do anything else until I was done. Everyone I know who has read it had the same experience. I have since spent much time contemplating the meaning to my life and who I have effected, and contrary to some reviews, I have not idea who I will meet there. I will give this book as a present to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was one of the best, if not the best book i have ever read! This book really makes you think about what it might be like in heaven. It gives you an outside look on life. It might give you a reason to help other people. This book gave a great idea of heaven, and how peoples lifes kind of \\"inter twine\\" with other peoples life. I could go on and on about this book but I dont want to give to much of this great book away!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"the book traces the last couple of minutes of Eddie's life and his journey to heaven in which he met 5 ppl who he had met in his life. it is almost like reading the christmas carole 5 times. it was not a bad book, but at times i find the pace it was going is very slow."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I've seen so many conflicting reviews on this book that it's rediculous. I liked this book. It moved me to tears a few time (this coming from someone who has trouble with emotions) and caused me to forgive a friend who had wronged me. I don't see how it is trite, but maybe that's just me. I read this book shortly after reading a 900 page novel, so maybe the relaxation of it caused me to like it more, I don't know. All I know is that I would recommend this book to anyone, no matter what your beliefs. I personally don't beleve in heaven or god, or even an afterlife for that matter, but I still read this book and liked it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After weeping my way through Tuesdays with Morrie, I looked forward to Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven. (I actually saw the Made for TV version first and then read the book.) Albom has a way of telling a story very well in relatively few words. Perhaps this comes from his years of writing sports articles for the printed news media.The story of Eddie's life and the people whose lives he touched, and who profoundly touched his, was interesting enough, but it is the end of the story that makes this story great. It is not until then that the genius of this work becomes evident. It is then that the reader reflects on all that came before and gains a true appreciation of the story Albom tells. May we all learn from it.Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was very powerful. I am 13 and i believe that if you can read than you should this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I first read Albom's Tuesdays with Morrie, which I thought was good, but not great. So I didn't expect a whole lot from Five People but it turned out to be one of the most unique and beautifully written books I have read in a while. It is a quick read, easy to get through in a single evening, and is entertaining to the last page. The main character is a gruff old man, who isn't all that likable at first, but turns out to be someone who is truly unforgettable with a heart of gold.Bottom Line: The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a book that you should read if only to see what all the fuss is about. You won't be disappointed by Albom's imaginative story about love and life lessons that don't stop just because you're dead."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is awesome. Its not only writen to make you think, but its fun. I couldn't put it down. I read it within 24 hours."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After quickly scanning the reviews, it appears that most people think that Mr. Albom's book is either \\"pure magic\\" or \\"pure rubbish.\\" I probably wouldn't have bought the book with my own money, but a friend gave me a copy as a gift, so I thought I owed it to her to give Mr. Albom a fair shake. Now that I have read the book, I believe that the truth lies somewhere in the middle. While Mr. Albom tells a decent story and the pace moves quickly, he falls victim to oversentimentality. The story overall made me emphathize with the main character and his own mistaken belief that his life was a less than valiant effort. It did not inspire me to change how I look at the world. Perhaps my own worldview is grounded differently from those who loved this book. Perhaps I am more forgiving the readers who trashed Mr. Albom's efforts. If you enjoyed \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" the odds are good that you won't consider \\"Five People\\" a waste of time, but I couldn't walk away from the book without thinking that it didn't represent Mr. Albom's best effort."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had to read this book for my tenth grade English class. I don't enjoy reading, but this book I couldn't put down. I read it in almost every class, even while the teachers were teaching, since I find some of them kind of boring! \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is a well-written novel. Eddie was the main character in this novel. He was an ordinary guy, who worked at the same place everyday, lived in the same apartment since he was a young boy, and did his same routine everyday. He thought his life wasn't very important until his death, when he met five people who made him realize that he was wrong. His life was an important part in history, and everyone else's, too. He learned many things that he thought of as not really important, or didn't really think twice about, were more important to other people. It made me think of how my life is affecting others. I strongly recommend reading this book because it makes you think that there is really life after death and you shouldn't be afraid of what is coming next."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"to the more critical reviewers, i think they take themself too seriously...perhaps mediocre, failed people in life who constantly over-critisize other's efforts in reflection of their own miscomings. The book was simple, but uplifting. An easy read that should have the reader thinking idealistically over their own life and really what meanings it may have. Perhaps we have too much self interest, especially as americans, that we forget the entire scope and revelation of life...how we touch others we know and others we dont."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Sure as some reviewers have said the book is simplistic and somewhat simple. But, DUH, isn't \\"the Christmas Carol\\" by Charles Dickens also somewhat simplistic and simple? And don't the majority of us love and retell that story year after year?What I got out of this little book were the five lessions from each person Eddie encountered in heaven. These are lessons and thoughts we can apply to our daily lives. Just like the lessons and thoughts Scrooge learned to apply to his life.Take this book on face value. It is a fable, a parable similiar to an Aesop fable.ENJOY and avoid being critical."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was great. You really take something away from this book. Teaches you a great lesson without feeling down. I recomend everyone read this."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom creates a masterful book about the afterlife of a war vet, Eddie, who dies while trying to save a small girl at the amusement park where he does maintenance. The book takes you through the five people who Eddie meets on his way to heaven to help him understand the purpose of his life. While Eddie believes that his life has had no purpose, he is slowly with each person he meets, shown why his life turned out the way it did. From issues with his father, to the lose of his wife, Eddie learns how each event and life experience influenced his life. While Eddie knows some of the people he meets on his journey, others he has never met. However, they were touched or touched his life in some way which he had never realized.I found that this book was hard to put down. The concept that people you never know affect your life but you never know it makes you think. An old man who dies with no family and no money, he has a story to tell and Eddie's story could be his. It's worth the time to sit back, relax and learn about the life of Eddie the maintenance guy."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought this book because I loved Tuesdays with Morrie, the author's first book. Morrie, an elderly college professor, stricken with a Lou Gherig's disease gave his best till the end. Morrie is an inspiration to us all and his memory lives on.The Five people You Meet in Heaven basically asks us to say what we need to say to those we love and respect. A simple message, not nearly as touching as the message in the author's first book.I recommend Optimal Thinking-How To Be Your Best Self to obtain the simple thinking style that Morrie used to make the most of every situation -- including his darkest moments. I recommend The Five People with the proviso that you do not have the same expectations that you had from reading Morrie."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's first book was great. This, on the otherhand was not. There were no nuggets of wisdom and thus it is a different book than Tuesdays With Morrie. It is similar to Lovely Bones in a sense as it is only one's &quot;interpretation&quot; of the afterlife. I think we all may be judging Albom based on the type of book Tuesdays was and Five People was in a different vein by far.As for a read - it is one you can devour in one sitting; a plane ride, an extended wait anywhere. It's not deeply thought provoking but it is some lightly interesting bubblegum for the mind."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"All I can say is that when you're done with this book you'll know all you want to know about the five people you meet in heaven!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I won't go into a synopsis of the story. Others have already done that for you here. I will say that, based on some of the unfavorable reviews I've read, I was a bit skeptical about this book. Nevertheless I read it and am very glad that I did!Honestly, after reading the negative reviews posted here, I wondered if I'd read the same book. True, the author does choose simple, direct language, but I did not find it monotonous or poorly written at all - far from it. And, no, the idea is not entirely unique - everyone has seen \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" but then, must something be wholly original for it to be worthwhile? Is not such a simple and yet profound statement worth reiterating in a fresh, new way? For me it was. I found it a truly inspiring, soul-satisfying read.Granted, opinions being as diverse as the people that have them, some may find the story a bit too sophomoric for their tastes. But, on the other hand, some may find that it forever changes the way they look at life - and that is no small feat. But don't take my word for it. Read it and decide for yourself. And who knows, despite the flak, you just might love it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book makes us look at the way we live your lives and the opportunities we have to express our gratitude to those who support our journey. It is nicely written, offers some wisdom and is an entertaining read. I recommend it! Because we become what we think about, I absolutely recommend Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self by Dr. Rosalene Glickman if you are interested in making the most of every situation and bringing out the best in other people. It is a superb read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"dumbest book i ever read. he's a one hit wonder who should have stopped with 'tuesdays'."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Well, I finally got around to reading this and was not all that surprised that it did not at all live up to the hype. Giving it 5 stars is a joke. 4 stars maybe, if it somehow spoke to you at a time when you needed it. 3 and under is more appropriate in my opinion.It was not a horrible book. Not everyone may like Albom's style, but if you can get past that (or rather, if you like his style), it's ok for recreational literature. The reading is easy, and thankfully it goes quick. But rather than find it inspirational or uplifting, I found it rather dry and depressing.And despite attempts to defend it, it very much IS like A Christmas Carol, It's a Wonderful Life.... but then what is really original these days? Most things have been done.Many times when I don't like a best-selling book, I assume it was me who just didn't get it this time around. But based on the reviews I am reading here, I can see that's not entirely the case. Review after review I keep reading that it's \\"about the after life and what happens after you die\\" or some such similar nonsense. It absolutely is NOT about that. It's really about how one life, though it may seem pointless and plain, touches other lives in a way that may not be immediately obvious.The \\"heaven\\" aspect just serves as a creative back drop, which I did feel was somewhat creative. But it had nothing to do with trying to make a religious statement or anything close to that.I really get the impression that many (I am sure not ALL) of the people who gave this book such high marks are probably not avid readers or have not been exposed to much to the extent that they would see this as being really good or really original. Unfortunately, it's neither. It's got a couple of sappy parts and a lot cliches, that makes for an OK story, but not one that deserves the praise it got."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is the story of Eddie's death and the five people he meets in heaven.It's a bit simple but I found it enjoyable. I liked the story, the characters and the way the story is told. It's not magnificent but it was good and moving and easy to read.More like a nice little snack of a book, rather than a meal."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Unlike most other books these days, the \\"Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" begins at the end of a man's life and is a touching and cleverly written prediction on life after death. The imagination of Mitch Albom is peaked in this book on his perspective on life after death.Although the title might hint that this book might have some spiritual and religious ties, the book has little reference to religion. This book was written for people of all religions, ethnics and cultures, simply to allow readers to have a thoughtful, creative glimpse of the after life.Known to most people as simply \\"Eddie,\\" the beginning pages begins with the countdown of Eddie's remaining hours on Earth as he works at the ocean-side amusement park named Ruby Pier. After a fatal accident with one of the rides, Eddie is sent to a fascinating Heaven where he meets five people who he has affected in life, and in turn, they all attempt to fulfill the gaps and questions about his life.Similarly to many of the inspirational, life-changing books these days, each chapter is littered with clich&eacute; lines and some chapters may seem preacher like. However, Mitch Albom breaks it down into the simplest of words instead of stretching it out, making it easy to read and enjoyable to readers of all ages.The book is creatively written, jumping between three different story lines all circling around Eddie's death. Chronologically written, Eddie's journey through Heaven is punctuated by his memories of the past and what was happening on Earth at the same time.As the story progresses, readers are revealed the deeper side of Eddie's seemingly boring character. His past is brought up as Albom draws out the past and Eddie's character is continually developed through the people he meets and his memories with them. The book moves through five surprisingly different people, yet at the same time ties together the life of Eddie.I think that for those that are looking for something very easy and simple to read, this would be a perfect book. Short and sweet, it is packed with moving words from a clever, creative writer. If your looking for something more mysterious or action packed, this might not be your number one choice.Compared to the other three books I've read from Mitch Albom (\\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" and \\"For One More Day\\") I think this was the best out of the three. The author portrays a stunning and addicting perspective of Heaven and will leave the reader wanting Heaven to be exactly like this. As simple and thin as it may seem, this book seems to me as something that could be read and enjoyed from generation to generation. It leaves you reflecting on your own life and ultimately made me cherish life a little more."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"My son has to read this for school over the summer, saw it on the floor, picked it up and read it in about 2 hours. This is a fantastic book about how we choose our own attitude about the events that occur in our lives. This is well done, easy to read and makes its point spot on. Should be required for anyone down on their luck to remind them that they can change it themselves.

It was an easy ready and I could not put it down. It gives you something to think about as you go about your daily life. We all have a purpose here, no matter how small we think ours may be.We do touch people each and every day in our attitude and actions. It is just as easy to make them be kind actions and not have to be first in line or have something more important to do then the the person beside us. We all must remember there is something bigger in this life besides us. Great book and relaxing read!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was the most depressing, horrible, miserable, ridiculous etc., etc., book I have ever had the misfortune to read. So presumably if you live a sad, bitter, painful and lonely life on earth, then eventually you will find out the reasons why - or some unbelievable drivel as to why and then - JOY, up to heaven to meet the celestial being who deemed that this was your lot. I would trade this fairy tale \\"everlasting\\" life for a few good years here below. Don't waste your time on this rubbish."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a book you can't put down until it's over. One of the few books I won't loan out (in case I don't get it back) but will glady buy for anyone. Makes you really think about life in a different way, Mitch Albom is one of the great writers of our time."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It's a feeling of life. What you wonder, but without the feeling that you have to pick a religion. It's just life with a little mix of folk, involve with people, a little of chicken soup for the soul, and a little enjoyment. No, let's not put Jesus and the bible in this. Nope, just a thought of the what ifs in life after. Good read that's all. Got me a little teary too."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It's a small book and a quick read. And it will stay in your mind for a week. I then bought copies for my friends for lite summer reading. Each book also came wrapped with a little kleenex container.Take it, read it, and wonder who your 5 people will be, and then again,wonder who the people are that have YOU in their 5."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read the hardback copy of this book several years ago. I enjoyed the book very much and it really makes you think about the choices in your life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It was one of those books where you couldn't put it down. I had to finish the book the moment I picked it up. I would've put 5 but the ending was pretty lame. There really wasn't any conclusion and you're left wondering what will happen to the main character. I liked it, but not enough to strongly recommend it to someone."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Just the mere thought of going to heaven and meeting up with 5 people from your earthly life and seeing them again is phenomimanl in itself. But to have each person explain to you why specific events took place in your life, things that the charater had been bitter over. The talks with each person opens his eyes and he is a better man due to his confrontations. It really makes one wonder if that is the way it is in heaven and wouldn't be amazing if it were. To have someone explain events that you never understood yet that took place in your life. Highly recommend. One of the best books I have read in years."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"My standard of comparison in this review of &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; is the book &quot;What Dreams May Come.&quot; TFPYMiH is not a complex book, and does not purvey an especially complex philosophy of life and death--and this is not a topic which requires a great deal of complexity. If you want complexity (to the point of being needlessly baroque), then read WDMC for its rather narcisstic view of heaven. Dollar for dollar, you'll do better with &quot;The Five People.&quot; Albom stays on target the entire time, and very few words are wasted. Keep in mind, however, that this is a fairy tale, and that Eddie is Everyman, so if it seems at first that he is overburdened with misfortune, bear with the author for awhile. Albom's point is not to write a biography--his point is to teach a lesson.Albom doesn't use a lot of ten-dollar words, but Eddie's not a ten-dollar word kind of guy, and when did those ever make for good reading anyway?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was an excellant book! Very inspirational and a terrific reminder that everyone of us can make a difference."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book definitely paled in comparison to Tuesdays with Morrie. It was a very quick read. It starts off at the end, when the main character dies. It then leads you through the 5 people he meets in heaven, different people who have affected his life in some way. Throught the book, you learn more about the main character with flashbacks to his various birthdays beginning at his childhood."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN is a parable of eternal proportions. Almost seamlessly, it weaves together three stories, all told about the same man: 83-year-old Eddie. Eddie is a wounded war veteran, an old man who has lived, in his mind, an uninspired life. His job is fixing rides at the seaside Ruby Point Amusement Park. On his 83rd birthday, a tragic accident kills him as he tries to save a little girl from a falling cart. He awakes in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a destination. It's a place where your life is explained to you by five people, some of whom you knew, others who may have been strangers.Eddie's world is traced through his tragic final moments, his funeral, and the ensuing days as friends clean out his apartment and adjust to life without him. In alternating sections, there are flash backs to Eddie's birthdays, telling his life story as a kind of progress report over candles and cake each year. In the third and last thread of the novel, Eddie eneters heaven where he encounters five pivotal figures from his life. Each person has been waiting for him in heaven, and each life and death was woven into Eddie's own in ways he never suspected. Each soul has a story to tell, a secret to reveal, and a lesson to share. Through them Eddie understands the meaning of his own life even as his arrival brings closure to theirs. One by one, from childhood to soldier to old age, Eddie's five people revisit their connections to him on earth, showing him the mysteries of his &quot;meaningless&quot; life, and revealing the haunting secret behind the eternal question: &quot;Why was I here?&quot;"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom has done it again. His writing style is both inspiring and easy to read. The Five People You Meet In Heaven was a wonderful book! It inspires us to reflect on our life and the impact we have on those around us. If you are looking for a playful and relaxing read, get this book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a really good book...Mitch hit a homerun again with this one, as with &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;. You will love the way he keeps you guessing as Eddie meets each person on his adventure in Heaven. Makes you wonder which 5 people are waiting up there for you :) Loved this book...thanks Mitch!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A beautiful story told by piecing together other stories viewed from many angles. The story is well planned, every chapter has a perfect transition to the next. It made me finished the book in 2 days, I couldn't put it down... And this is coming from somebody who doesn't like to read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom has created a uniquely quaint and compelling story in the Five People You Meet in Heaven. The story is light and touching at the same time. Never did I feel bogged down in the story, nor did Albom ever become to heavy handed in telling us how we were supposed to feel.Although the story included sections almost cliche, and some transitions were seemingly a little rough, I found the read to be refreshing and uplifting. I was impressed that Albom never pushed us to come to any sort of conclusion, nor became overtly preachy. He just showed us an honest man, Eddie and his honest emotions as he enters heaven and begins meeting people who have touched his life in someway, sometimes in ways that he never knew about until he met them for the first time there in heaven.For a good light read, I recommend The Five People You Meet in Heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom writes what I feel to be one of the best works of fiction I have read in quite some time. The book follows Eddie in his journey through the afterlife after a sudden tragic accident. He encounters five people that made an impact on his life and each one offers a lesson. I painted quite a picture in my head with this book and was even moved to tears at a few parts. The thing I really liked though was that it wasn't just a sappy story about life and love but offered lots of philosophy on life and what lies beyond. It really is an amazing book that left me thinking long after I put it down which was one thing I did not do from page 1 to 196. I recomend this book because I believe everyone can take something positive from this story."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had recently read THE ALCHEMIST - looking for a book that would take me somewhere and - personally - prove cathartic.While I wasn't at all impressed with that book, THE FIVE PEOPLE... proved to be such a book. The moments after death, a life in review - and the people that have an impact and effect on a life are so often never revealed or recognized. Not while alive, anway. Albom's book proposes that five of these people will be there for you in heaven.Eddie (main character) has expectations of who may be among the five, after having met his first person - but still, cannot always know who these people will be. The book's language runs clean and brief - without becoming bogged down on a lot of religious/spiritual speculations about the nature of heaven or life itself.I took a lot out of THE FIVE PEOPLE... - and, as I see from other reviews I am not alone in this, it left me wondering who would be among the folks I'd meet in heaven. And who would I be waiting for in turn."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is one of the most beautiful, soulful books I've read in a long time. Well-paced yet unforced, it asks, in very simple language, some of the most profound questions connected with being alive. It follows Eddie, a self-sacrificing war veteran in his journey from this world to the next -- and in doing so, comes to re-examine his so-called 'meaningless' life. There were parts of this books that brought me openly to tears. I recommend this wonderful book highly!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If I could have given this book a ten I would have. This was an absolutely incredible book. Although it is only 200 pages or so, it had the depth and character development of a book twice it's length. I can't say enough about this book. You can easily read it in one day and it is so worth it. This is quite possibly the best book I have ever read. It is absolutely amazing! If you haven't read it already, YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Heaven. You lounge contently on delicate gossamer clouds, get rained on by glistening yellow rays of sunshine, and listen to the celestial voices of angels singing you softly into a deep and flawless sleep. This is the classic view of heaven. Mitch Albom, however, has a different dream of this utopia.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a story that begins with the end. Eddie was an indifferent , routine-driven lonely old man. He arrove to work at the noisy Ruby Pier Amusement Park on his eighty-third birthday, ready but less than willing to perform maintenance on thrilling roller coaster rides. Animated voices of children, and the enthusiastic voices of their parents roared through the Pier. Eddie had been listening to these noises for almost seven decades now, so he knew -- when the excitement was suddenly hushed -- that something was terribly wrong.A malfunction with a ride sent Eddie running, risking his life to save a small helpless child. This petite and happy little blonde was one of the many children who looked up to him as a sort of carnival god. \\"Eddie Main-ten-ance,\\" they called him; He was the man who made such fascinating pipe cleaner animals. His old hands connected firmly with hers, and -- The end.Eddie woke up in heaven, and proceeded to meet five individuals that had a striding influence on his walk of life. Throughout his journey, Eddie slowly began to understand. He learned all about certain elements in his life, from five different perspectives. Everything made sense now -- the brutal war, his father's progressive alcoholism, his wife's life story. At one point in The Five People You Meet In Heaven, Albom writes, \\"Strangers are really family that we haven't met yet.\\" Eddie's journey supports this thesis on life, making an uplifting story and an excellent read.Mitch Albom's words literally flow off the page. I dove right into the story and was completely engulfed until I read the last words. The syntax and language are simple, but still very effective. People of all ages will be satisfied with this moving and inspirational novel.There are many lessons taught in this book, and Albom does a great job enforcing them. I now believe that everyone and everything is connected in some way; For Eddie's story is so realistic and rational. You'll never know all the people who's lives you've changed, and that makes the idea of meeting them in heaven sound like such fun. It's something to look forward to and hope for. Albom tells us that eventually, fate will explain itself. In Eddie's case, this happens not until he's in heaven.Mitch Albom's books are nationwide bestsellers. If you like this book, you'll also love Tuesdays With Morrie. It's very inspirational, and also touching, like Eddie's story. But as for a novel practically guaranteed to make you smile, The Five People You Meet In Heaven is undeniably it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After reading this book you will never forget it. You will never forget the thought provoking lessons, the vivid imagery, Eddie's realistic fears, and most of all the five people Eddie meets in heaven. Eddie led a life of fear and despair. It is not until Eddie reaches heaven that he understands it all. Each of the five people Eddie meets in heaven shows and explains to him the connection they had on earth.There are many Eddie's in the world. When tragedy strikes or we encounter pitfalls, we often wonder why and let the mysteries of despair consume of lives. Many people do not pursue their dreams because of fear. Many people do not forgive because of pride. Many people always ask why me instead of why not me. This book shows that everything does happen for a reason...no matter how good or bad. We all have a purpose but Eddie did not understand his until he was in heaven. If you are in search of a book that will inspire you and vividly take you to a place we've all wondered about...read this book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"One more wonderful book by Mitch Albom. His style is simply fascinating, taking you back in times of Eddie, relating it to what and why of life's little happenings. Thought provoking.. His adaptation of what the journey onto heaven is very pleasing. A wonderful book to read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had to force myself to get past the first chapter of this book. The author's tries too hard to develop a unique style (movie-like) to move the reader from one place in time to another. The shifts end up being very abrupt and annoying.I couldn't get myself to connect with the main character and his life. The passages about the people he met in heaven could have been better written. I was easy reading with a good overall message but that is about it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I picked up this book at the library this week because I recongized the author and it looked like a short read. This was such a wonderful little book. It was very insightful and emotional. I did finish reading the book in one evening, but my only regret is that I didn't have a box of tissues beside me for the last half of the book. This is a great read and the author provides a different view of what heaven is like."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is my first encounter with Albom and I hope to have others. The tale is simply told but so engrossing I read it in one sitting--just couldn't put it down. It has more to do with life and its complexities than with the afterlife and is quite profound in its observations about our relationships with others,even the most seemingly random ones. And what we may not realize about them at the time. Absolutely stunning and a masterful achievement--a welcome change from the generally dreary state of fiction-writing in our time."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Lovely tale of life and purpose.

It was interesting but since I had just lost my Mother and baby brother I was probably looking for answers for myself about them so this book kind of disappointed me. I think others will like this book if they are not seeking an answer like I was. It is an interesting read and well written and holds your interest til the end. I recommend it for just a quick pleasure read but not really comfort for hurting people who just lost a loved one."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"My take on the book is it is from the prespective of other people whom the protagnaist meet in life. Many times we meet poeple whom we treat with little signifance and I believe the point of the book is that all people are of importance. Sometimes it is the insignificant folk who affect our lives and make it worse or for the better"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A fast nice read with good character development.

It was funny, it was sad but it held by attention all the way thru."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book wasn't what I expected it to be, but it was an interesting story on life & death. The story tells about a man's life as a maintenance worker for an amusement park. They story jumps back in time to different milestones in his life up until his death. When he dies and goes to Heaven, he meets 5 different people from his past that all played significant roles in his life OR that he was a significant part of their death. It was an easy reading story that kept my interest. It's not the typical story about dying & going to Heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book makes you step back and examine your own life which is somewhat uncommon in today's literary world. How you may have impacted the life of someone else without even knowing it... how our lives all interwine with one another. A short and quick read with a long-lasting impact. I enjoyed this so much that I went out and bought several copies to give as Christmas presents. Definitely a tear-jerker."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It was just a disappointment after Tuesdays With Morrie. The book was ok, but a bit reminiscent of A Christmas Carol and Its a Wonderful Life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is overhyped. The subject is interesting and should be a delight for the readers imagination. Unfortunately the author was not; the accounts were uninspiring and very predictable."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"My husband bought this book for me for Christmas. I read and finished this dynamic and amazingly wonderful book this morning. I would do the book harm if I tried to summarize the eloquence of the characters, the situations and the aspects of Heaven that I have never before encountered. &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; had me thinking (and crying) about who has touched my life or whose life I have changed just by going about and living. I am a high school English teacher and this book will be high on my list of recommendations. What a fabulous literary and life achievement!!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought this book as soon as it was on the market because not only do I love Albom's previous work, I usually like stories that have a spiritual angle. I seem to be the minority from the reviews, but I was really disappointed. Although very easy to read, I kept hoping the book would get better or touch me in some way. I just didn't enjoy the book and found the message off base for me personally."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a wonderful book about how a seemingly simple life affects so many others.

And if you like this book, pick up &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; by Mitch Albom as well."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved the concept of entering heaven and finding out what purpose your life had on earth. I couldn't help but feel sad for Eddie who just didn't &quot;get it&quot; while on earth, but this book showed that every life has meaning. An easy read, I finished in just a few hours and it has stayed with me.

Alot of lessons throughout this book. I will read it again and give to my friends to read.also like the earlier reviewer I also recommend Nightmares Echo"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book has so much in common with MY FRACTURED LIFE (Rikki Lee Travolta). It deals with death, tragedy, and searching for meaning in the lives that have been lived and how a man can have affected others without even knowing it. My Fractured Life is one of my favorite books and I bought THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN (Mitch Albom) based upon reviews that said they were similar. Glad I bought it. If you like one you're guaranteed to like the other."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom has touched people's hearts with his latest endearing book, The Five People You Meet In Heaven. I absolutely loved this book and could not put it down.The premise of the book is that people we meet in our lives are put into our lives for a reason, although we may not understand that reason at that time. The purpose of heaven then, is to understand one's life on earth.\\"People think of heaven as a paradise garden a place where they can float on clouds and laze in rivers and mountains. But scenery without solace is meaningless. This is the greatest gift God can give you: to understand what happened in your life. To have it explained. It is the place you have been searching for.\\" Albom reminds us throughout this wonderful tale, that there are no random acts, that we all are indeed connected. The circle is never ending.The story is seen through Eddie's eyes - the maintenance worker at Ruby's Pier, who dies trying to save a little girl from a crashing carnival ride. The five significant people in Eddie's life leave Eddie a bit baffled in the beginning, but further on into the story the meaning is very clear and illuminating for Eddie, as for the reader. The messages are timeless for the reader, but more importantly, healing and bringing a sense of serenity for Eddie, once he understands the significance of it all. After all, people *are* put into our lives for a reason.This book is wonderfully wise and the serenity and insight contained within will warm one's heart. This book is a departure from Tuesdays With Morrie, yet just as beautifully written, filled with the same heartfelt insight and compassion. Readers will fall in love with Eddie, just as they did with Morrie.This is book is a definite winner and one will be left thinking and contemplating their own lives afterwards, for days to come. I know I did! I cannot recommend this book highly enough!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously due to it's content and the wonderful way the story took me in and changed me. I love books like this! That make me feel like a better person for having read it. I was moved deeply by the journey and by the time I met person number five, I was in need of tissues and was grateful for the out come of the story. Beautiful book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Don't let the title steer you away! Mitch Albom's Five People You Meet in Heaven isn't an in-your-face sermon; it's simply the journey a man goes through after he dies on his 83rd birthday while trying to save a girl on a falling amusement ride on the Ruby Pier.Eddie, a WWII veteran with a titanium-filled knee, has worked at the Ruby Pier since he was a teenager working for his father. Eddie and his wife, Marguerite, live a happy a life until his 39th birthday, when Marguerite gets into a bad car accident and is taken to the hospital for a few months. Once she is released, they are able to spend a few more shaky but happy years until she dies of a brain tumor.Upon his death, Eddie meets his first visitor: Joseph Corvelzchik, better known as \\"The Blue Man,\\" whose life was greatly affected by Eddie when he was a young boy playing with a ball in the middle of the street.Eddie then meet's his second visitor, \\"The Captain\\"--Eddie's commanding officer during WWII. The Captain tells Eddie the importance of sacrifices by highlighting the Captain's promise to \\"never leave a man behind,\\" a promise which once saved Eddie's life.Afterwards, Eddie meets a woman who has played a enormous role in his life without ever actually entering it: Ruby. Her husband, Emile, built the amusement park RUBY Pier, the place Eddie has worked his entire life at. During a fire at the pier, Emile is injured and taken to the hospital where he meet's Eddie's father shortly before he dies: from this, Ruby teaches Eddie the importance of forgiveness.Eddie's fourth person to meet is Marguerite, his wife, who talks to him about their love in hopes of bringing him to terms about its importance.His fifth and final visitor is a girl named Tala. She died in a fire the Philippines while Eddie and his fellow captives tried to escape from the enemy. Tala explains to Eddie that he has saved more lives than he realizes and was extremely useful throughout his entire life. Eddie is able to redeem himself from Tala's appearance after bathing her in a pond.This book really opened my eyes to the many different ways we affect people every single day--no matter where we are or what we do. Mitch Albom is a fantastic writer and I found myself flipping pages at record speed. This is a book for anyone and everyone, I highly recommend this to all."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book a few years ago now. While I was having a hard time dealing with life, my mother handed me \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\". In one night I read it from cover to cover, through its entirety I was sobbing. The contents of this book force you to analyze life differently, it has the incredible ability to alter your entire perception, and turn your world upside down. But it requires a philosophical type of personality to fully appreciate this book. This book had such a profound impact on my life, and without it, I wouldn't be where I am today. It will forever be my all-time favorite."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I am in college and to read another book aside from my reading load would be too much. So, I just downloaded this book on my ipod and took it on vacation with me. I listened to it while on the beach and it was the perfect setting! Even though I have my own beliefs in what happens after death and perhaps in heaven, this story gave a interesting alternative - to have people that were in your life or touched you in some way explain what your life was about and perhaps those around you too. This is the first time I've ever written a review but I liked this book so much I felt I must let everyone know it was a good read (or listen)!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was caught up in it's pages from the very beginning. Mitch Albom is a very good author. I also fell in love with his book \\"Tuesday's with Morrie\\" after my high school history teacher read it to our whole class a few years back. He definitely knows how to put a precious life into a brilliantly charming page turner."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is really a classic book. The story is too great to give away, but the book is so well written that it's an experience, and a deeply meaningful one. I usually don't read fiction, however this book is beyond fiction, it's really a reality that has become, at least in my mind, a literary masterpiece that is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Although you might expect to pick up this book and find a religious point of view of what heaven is really like; you find a real shock, that this book is for everyone. The book has a real complex story line and bit hard to follow at first, but after reading you really start to understand that this book gives a slight hope that we will all have our life explained to us someday. This phenomonal book is recommended for all readers except young children because some war stories are too grotesque."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a great read about life, fate, following predetermined paths, the mystery of people and the role they play in your life and the difficulty of breaking free from inherited responsibility.The main character, Eddie, is portrayed as a disgruntled old man who lost his one and only love years ago and finds himself trapped in a meaningless life. The book gives a glimpse of Eddie's youthful life filled with optimism and adventure. He so longed to break free and set a new course for his life that he joined the army only to find himself back to the seaside amusement park that he hoped to escape from. Eddie's circumstances in life effectively change him from an optimistic youth to an embittered old man.The majority of the novel takes place after Eddie passes away due to a fatal accident while he was trying to save a little girl's life. At the end of his life Eddie feels two little hands in his and then he awakens in the afterlife. The intrigue continues as we are introduced to five people who, unbeknownst to Eddie, were responsible for changing his path in life.Each of the five people Eddie met help him answer outstanding questions about his destiny, his father and illuminate the mysteries of Eddie's life on earth. Still none of them provide Eddie with the answer to the question he is most anxious about, namely was he successful in saving the little girl's life?The novel concludes with a message to us all. Your life does make a difference. The book is both inspirational and uplifting and proves that the persons we love and learn the most from stay with us forever and that the connections we make transcend all barriers."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"&lt;u>The Five People You Meet in Heaven&lt;/u> is not what you might think as you pick it up off the shelf. It's not an overly religious book; it doesn't try to shove any kind belief down your throat. No, &lt;u>The Five People You Meet in Heaven&lt;/u> is a wonderfully written book that shares with you the author's idea of what heaven might be like.While the writing of the story is not would I would call deep, the meaning behind the words is. If you have ever contemplated the meaning of life-not the generic \\"Why did God put us here?\\" but the specific: \\"Why am I here? Why do I exist?\\"-then you will find the book not only entertaining but thought-provoking.The story opens with its main character, a man named Eddie who has spent his life working as the head of maintenance for a boardwalk carnival, on the day he dies. Once he reaches heaven, he is met by the first of his five people (everyone has their own set of five). Without going too deeply into the story, we learn that each of the people he will meet touched his life in some way. While he may never have met them, their lives affected his in some monumental way.Mr. Albom did a splendid job of weaving the tale together, jumping back and forth between Eddie's past and his encounters in heaven. The concept that the first thing that happens when you reach heaven is learn what purpose your life served is beautiful and somehow comforting. Countless people drift through their lives, wondering everyday what their purpose is and why they were born. While the book offers no real answers, it is still uplifting and gives us a glimmer of hope that, one day, it will all be explained to us."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Whether your religious or not, and if you are generally interested in your life, this book is a must read. Albom, by telling the life and after-life of a Carnival worker named Eddie, shows the reader how all of us facing the struggle under the sun are connected. The novelette is a short read, but packs quite a punch and is sure to keep a smile on your face. I suggest reading this novelette after and before reading larger novels, for the reason that it will provide you motivation to conquere your next endeavor in the literary arts.Peace"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I enjoyed this book. Perhaps I was attracted to the subject matter at this time because my dear mother died earlier this year -- a momentous, life-altering event at any age. The author portrays an imaginative, hopeful concept of heaven. I love the idea that heaven includes the opportunity to learn from others whose lives we have touched, in order to heal old wounds and gain insight into the &quot;big picture&quot; of our lives. I found the story enjoyable and comforting -- just what I need during this time of grief."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a great book, I highly recommend that you read this. It is a touching story, if you have ever lost a loved one this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought this book was a fun read, but not a masterpiece. Granted, the author took advantage of his &quot;poetic license&quot; and made a lot of logical leaps, but works of fiction should not be criticized for logic, and neither should faith.As far as some positive aspects are concerned, the language flowed well, dialogues were fun, the set up of the book with Eddie's various birthdays was original. Have fun with it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"'The 5 People you Meet in Heaven' is a story you won't forget for a very long time. A heart-warming story about death if there can possibly be such a thing. This book is a convincing example of how God has a plan for ouor lives and and uses us to intercede in the lives of others. It's a page turner and you won't stop reading until you're done."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Eddie is the head of maintenance for the local carnival &quot;RUBY PIER&quot;.

He hasn't been able to run since the war. Eddie meets five people along the way. Five people who made difference in his life.When you die who do you think you will meet along the way? This book will make you stop &amp; think about &quot;HEAVEN&quot;."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If you're looking for a good afterlife fantasy that is neither overly sentimental nor religiously bombastic, then I think you'll really enjoy this novel.While within the heaven of each of his antagonists, the protagonist Eddie -- who's led a &quot;meaningless&quot; life -- comes to appreciate that his earthly actions have had a ripple effect that he could not have predicted.Particularly moving, in my opinion, was the opening tale about the man with the blue skin; it is the most succinct example of the novel's theme.Particularly gruesome, in my opinion, was the author's description of war; the effect is necessary, however, to convey the physical and mental abuse inflicted upon soldiers in battle.Particularly enjoyable, in my opinion, was the author's technique of using subtle plots twists; these give the reader brief &quot;aha&quot; moments throughout the book.In a climate where New Age spirituality and fundamentalist Christianity are engaged in an appalling conflict to brainwash the reading public, this book stands out as an example of level-headed literature which, I think, is quite ironic for a fantasy."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book has an incredible story line with life learned lessons you conquer in life. Albom captures the feelings with an old, lonely, maintenence man after he dies in the effort to save a girl from a carnival ride accident. He is then on a journey to meet 5 special people in heaven. The 5 people are not the 5 Eddie expects to meet, but people that have touched and played an important role in his life. Each person explains how they know Eddie and teach him his life lesson. In the end, Eddie reflects on his life and finds the perfect heaven. I sincerely enjoyed the various people Eddie met and how they were connected by the tiny bit. The book expresses that everyone is connected to your life somehow and will reflect in the future."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved the concept of this book and felt that it deserved five stars for this alone. I would not have missed reading this book for anything.I also accidentally happen to see his uncle's picture located at the end of the book, before I started reading and I'm so glad that I did. I feel that it should be placed at the beginning of the book because after viewing the man, I felt an even greater attachment to him.There are characters in this book that are just brilliant, such as the &quot;Blue Man.&quot; What creativity in describing him!Some of the characters though, just didn't seem as developed...as though he had a deadline that didn't allow him to expound upon them.I suggested this novel to my sibling who emailed me, &quot; I think I'd rather be surprised over my Welcoming Committee. &quot; Not me! I immediately started thinking about the 5 people I will meet in heaven. I have to say, my dog was right there at the top.Mitch - a wonderful tribute to your Uncle!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"All I can say is this book went with me everywhere for 48 hours!!

Thumbs up to Albom!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book in one sitting, thats how good it was! It makes you think of how we are capable of influencing and changing the course of life for others. It also makes one evaluate their life and see that no matter what we do, we are capable of touching others.This is my first Albom book and look forward to reading more of his works."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is wonderful it makes you appreciate life more. And it shows you that everyone you meet is affected by you in some way or another. I have read all of Mitch Albom books and I am a big fan of his writing. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's \\"The Five people you meet in Heaven\\" may seem to be based on major spiritual connotations when one first glances at the title. The novel is much more about one's journey in life, and the people that you touch along the way than the final destination. I was not able to put this book down and in saying that; I also must state that it made me also reflect upon my life a bit. Any book that makes me appreciate the friendships I have and to never take for granted the ones I may have not been so open to, be worth a pat on the back. The story is about a man named Eddie who works at the Carnival. His life perhaps seems mundane to many, including him. He is in his later years and often reflects back to what paths led him back to this particular job at the pier that he knew all those years ago. Albom is able to paint a poetic and humanistic experience with the characters he creates that are introduced throughout the novel. In the end it is not about Heaven, but more about the life you have on this Earth that hits home. I highly recommend it; I received this as a Christmas gift and cannot wait to make the same purchase for a special someone down the road."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a book that makes you think about life's occurrences in a new and more optimistic way. Fortunately it is a quick read, because you will not want to put it down until you have read the last page!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is one of about a dozen books that has a permanent place on my kitchen counter. At the end of a long day, I'll pull it out and get lost in Eddie's life once again.It's a quick read, but that doesn't mean it leaves your mind once the last page has turned. The story of one man and the many connections he made throughout his long life is a discussion many of us should relate to. Every day, in every way, we make connections. Every day, in some way, most of us wonder what will be left, what will be said of us, when we're gone. What have we accomplished? Whose life did we change -- for good or for bad.The storyline of Eddie's life and the people he meets is a marriage of fascinating and heart-wrenching. It's a fast read not just because it's a short book, but because an engaged reader simply cannot wait to flip the next page and the next and the next to see who else has drifted in and out of Eddie's world. The connections, which would seem so tenuous or even ridiculous if explained verbally, are cemented in Albom's hand. Only the most cynical would get to the end of this and not wonder about who their \\"five\\" are ... or in whose \\"five\\" they might be. At the end of his life, which comes as he dies doing the thankless job he's hated every day he's had it, Eddie gets his reckoning. He saves a little girl, and in the process sets off on a journey through his life and five people he affected, mostly without realizing it.There is a wonderful message here, but a reader must be willing to receive it. I was lucky enough to get this book as a gift from my husband when it first came out, so that was way before any \\"hype,\\" and other than knowing Albom as a sports columnist, I really had no expectations of what his fiction would be. I was not disappointed, and the book hasn't left the kitchen since."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I will admit, I do not read a lot of books; my reading comprehension is not the best. However, my college English instructor suggested I read this for an upcoming critical analysis of a fictional book. I am so glad he did. For a so-called non-reader of books (for the most part) this was a really easy book to read and follow. It was well-written and very moving.I was not one of those who was sobbing at the end, although I could see why one would. But this did make me think.I enjoyed it tremendously and highly recommend \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" by Mitch Albom."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I love Mitch's self-conscience, it reminds me who I am and what I shall become!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This novel surely has beautiful and delight concepts which aspire and give hopeful inspiration to the readers along with the \\"Religious\\" enlightenment. I cannot deny that I liked and enjoyed reading this book, but I also admit that it was very much similar with the \\"Tuesday with Morie\\" (Mannerism?). But it was unique that the author unfolds the story back from the present to the past. As long as this book is not long and not complicated at all, it is worth a try and you'll get more than you expect. Recommended for those who like to purify their hearts with a short and light essay written in beautiful words."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In The Five People You Meet in Heaven, Mitch Albom begins the novel with a detailed account of the last hour of Eddie's life. Eddie is an 83 year old maintenance worker at Ruby Pier who is killed trying to save a little girl from being crushed and killed by a falling ride. Eddie arrives in heaven and meets five different people who have been waiting for him. Each person was connected to Eddie's life in some way; some he knew, and some were strangers. Each one has a lesson to teach Eddie.Each person Eddie meets is in their own special place. Three of the people Eddie meets explain to Eddie how their lives are connected. Eddie knew the other two people, but they can explain some things that he doesn't know. With each person Eddie visits, we are given a flashback to different birthdays Eddie had from childhood to adult years. As the pieces of Eddie's life are put together, we see that he grew up neglected and mistreated by his father. We see how the war and his father's death changed Eddie's attitude toward life. Each person teaches Eddie a lesson before he moves on. The story ends with Eddie finally getting the answer to his question about had he saved the little girl, Annie or Amy. Then, at last, Eddie is reunited with his wife, Marguerite on the Ferris wheel.Mitch Albom writes a story about what he wishes heaven is like so that \\"people who felt unimportant here on earth-realize, finally, how much they mattered and how they were loved.\\" This story is a soul-stirring one that will make you reflect on your own life and what affect you have on others. Full of surprises, this novel keeps the reader eager to see what happens next. The reader is kept in suspense because Albom waits until the end for the fifth person Eddie meets to let the reader and Eddie know the fate of the little girl, Annie or Amy. Even if you didn't agree with Albom's guess about what heaven is like, most readers will find each lesson important to ponder."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The title captures the essence of the book. Albom does and excellent job of weaving a meaninful story around this premise. This book will challenge you to examine your own life, and possibly change how you interact with other people. I was so moved, I bought an additional copy for a friend."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is similar to \\"The Traveler's Gift\\" by Andy Andrews that came out in 2002. But The Traveler's Gift is much more inspiring book to read. I was expecting \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" to be heartwarming and uplifiting, instead it is depressing."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"i unfortunately bought this book at borders becasue it was on sale and i was intrigued by its title and the fact that it was a #1 bestseller. although the aim of this terrible author is to inspire, the only thing he succeeds at is to bore you to tears with his stark lack of originality. this book is written at a grade school level english and rehashes territories much better covered by dickens in \\"a christmas Carol\\" and movies like carpra's \\"its a wonderful live\\".i can understand why it was a #1 bestseller, it's an easy read, it's unoffensive and easily digestible, and it aspires to a murky spirituality that is very popular at the moment. so i suppose it succeeds as a well marketed product, the same way a blockbuster summer movie does, but ultimately this is a forgetable and trivial book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Having read this book shortly after reading Albom's \\"Tuesday's With Morrie\\" (which was far better and way more original) I have to say I was not very pleased with it. Every now and then I like to pick up a copy of a book from the Bestseller's List and see if it deserves all the hype it's been recieving. Sometime's it does, sometime's it doesn't, such as in this case. I thought it was a fine book for what it is, but I've seen this plot before in other books. the beginning starting at the end was interesting but again, I've seen it done before and in a better written way. It's not a bad book, it's just not what one might think it would be, given all the hype it recieved. It's similar to \\"Tuesday's With Morrie\\" but not nearly as good. I say pass it and pick up \\"Tuesday's With Morrie\\" if you haven't already read it. Just don't believe all the hype \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" has recieved."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is by no means a new type of book. The idea of what happens to us after we die has been a subject for authors many times over, however this book takes a new twist. The Five People You Meet in Heaven can seem like an extremely tough title, as if the book would weigh you down with philosophy and thought, but in the end, the book was simple.A very simple idea that in my mind could have been written better and had more engaging dialogue. The plot was fairly predictable and though I was shedding a tear at moments it was nothing more than me remembering a moment in my own life.The book only took me less than an afternoon to read and I feel like it took the author even less time to write. To me, if the book had been thought out a bit more, it would have resulted in a much more powerful novel that kept you thinking instead of reaching for a new book.I give this book three stars, because for what it is worth, the book is still good, however simple it may be. I would have rated this a lot higher had there been some more thought and substance in the characters and the plot of the book itself. Do not get me wrong, if you are looking for a simple read, this book is excellent for that. If you would like something a bit more well written, turn to another book"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"To me this book paled in comparison to Tuesday's With Morrie. Not that it wasn't good - it was. But by comparison, The Five People You Meet in Heaven wasn't quite up to par with the former. With that being said, it was still a nice little read. Eddie, an old man working at a carnival, is killed while saving a girl from a falling ride. He goes to heaven and meets his \\"Five People\\" - five individuals who have had a profound effect on his life. It is a story that makes you think and wonder - who are YOUR five people? Have you met them yet? When you meet someone, you think \\"Is this person one of my five?\\" The memories of the book stay with you long after you have turned the last page and I guess thats what a successful book is suposed to do. If so, Albom got it right again."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The five people you meet in heaven was one of the best books I have read this year. Mitch Album's story of an old man who dies and goes to heaven then meets five people who affected his life, or who's life he has affected was both heart warming and captivating. It is wonderful to see this old man who thought that his life was a waste and meaningless, find out that he has impacted so many others lives. It makes you look at your own life and wonder if you have or will have such a big impact on someone else's life and not realize it. You will grow as a person after reading this book, even if it is just for a little bit. Mitch Album has a way of touching your soul in his books."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom has been covering sports for so long, it's hard to believe that he is becoming an international celebrity for writing spiritually uplifting novels. These are not the things you associate with a long-time columnist for the Detroit Free Press, who also happens to be on ESPN quite often. But here he is.After the magnificent Tuesdays with Morrie, which was based on the true story of his meetings with his old professor who was dying of Lou Gehrig's Disease, Albom writes this book, a fable about life.It's not a big book, you can read it in less than two hours. But it's time well spent.The story concerns Eddie, an 83 year old amusement park worker. As the book begins, Eddie has about an hour to live. Within a chapter or so, Eddie dies and begins a journey meeting five people who tell him what his life was truly about. They point out that we're all connected, that strangers are really family that we haven't met yet.These five people don't seem connected at all to each other. But they each represent important parts of Eddie's life and they help him discover the things that are important to him, and to each of us.Who cares if he died virtually penniless and that he spent his life doing a job he really didn't want to do? The book talks about looking on the bright side and realizing that we are all here for a reason, and making a lot of money isn't one of those reasons.For example, Eddie and his wife did not have children, but Eddie helped so many little children throughout his life by providing them a safe place to ride and giving them animals made out of pipe cleaners to delight them.There are many twists and turns in this book, but they're all enlightening and wonderful. Albom's writing style is excellent, the words literally flow off the page. The words have stayed with me also, as they helped me reexamine the important things in my life. The really important things.True, this is a fable. But it's also one heck of a great story. Pick up a copy! Another wonderful, unlikely title I enjoyed is THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez, about a misplaced, unlucky poet hoping for romance in New York City."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Though there have been hundreds of reviews written for this novel and my review will likely be buried among those reviews never to be seen, I feel compelled to write this review anyway ...I borrowed the unabridged audio version of this book from my local library. It's a short novel told in very few audio cassettes so I thought it would be a quick easy story to listen to on my daily commute to work. Though it was completed in a few days commute, it wasn't so easy - I found myself wanting to sit in the parking lot on arrival to work to listen to more and then looked forward to listening to more of it at the end of the work day on my commute home. If you read this with book in hand, you would never want to put it down.This is the story of Eddie, chief maintenance person at Ruby Pier amusement park. He thinks his life has been a waste, that he hasn't impacted anyone. At the beginning of the story we meet the elderly Eddie, sad, lonely Eddie. He makes the rides safe for everyone, except one day something goes terribly wrong. In one last heroic act in his sad life, Eddie throws himself in front of a runaway roller coaster to save the life of a little girl who becomes caught on the track. But did he save her? Eddie's death is so sudden that he doesn't know if he saved her or not ... and neither do we.Eddie procedes on his path in heaven meeting five key people throughout this engaging, heartwrenching story. It is told in a series of flashbacks through the eyes of those five people. The story is crafted so well and so beautifully that you may wish it was longer. I listened to the last portions of the story of Eddie's life and death with more than a slight glimmer of tears in my eyes. It is such a beautiful story that it will touch your very soul and leave a mark there forever."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It is truly amazing how our lives are interwoven. Sometimes were are keenly aware of those who add a woven thread here or there and at other times the threads are added anonymously without our even being aware of them. Just the same the fabric of our lives, the tapestry that makes up who we are, is a group effort.In Mitch Albom's wonderful book, THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN, the author, I believe, is saying just that. The story tells us about Eddie, an 83-year-old amusement park maintenance man who is wrapping up his life on earth. Like many of us he feels that his life has only been just so-so. When he passes to the other side he meets five people whom he encountered while on earth and gets to see how their lives touched each other in meaningful ways.THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN isn't meant to be a preview of the hereafter as much as it is an invitation to each of us to take greater care in living, to treat those we meet a little better and to appreciate what we have while we have it.A sensational book!THE HORSEMAN"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Simply said, this is a novel written around the theme of &quot;everything happens for a reason.&quot;Each person we meet in our lives, each course of action we are involved with, each path we embark on in our journey of life happens for a reason. We are destined to do certain things, meet certain people, and experience certain challenges, from the day we are born. This book is a classical example of this notion at its best.Mitch Albom has a gift - the gift of putting in writing, the most basic, yet most crucial, lessons of life which each of us will experience to one degree or another. Just as Albom inspired us with &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie,&quot; he has continued to do so with &quot;The five people you meet in heaven.&quot;A good read... a good reminder of our purpose here on earth."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book has a beautiful story, timeless messages, and was a joy to read.

It makes you think and contemplate life. It is amazing how this book elaborates on the idea that one person's short-comings is another persons miracle (in a sense)."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I liked this book but enjoyed Mitch Albom's first best seller, Tuesdays with Maurie, a lot better. When I bought this book I was expecting to be blown away like I was with the first book but I was only mildly entertained."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a very hyped up book, but one that lives up to it. It deserves every praise it has received and then some. I read it in one night, one because it's short, but also because it is so addicting. It made me wonder, who would I meet in heaven?Eddie is a carnival worker who dies to save a little girl. Before he can find eternal happiness in heaven, he must first understand what happened in his life. To help him with this, he meets five people, some he knows all too well, some just for a brief moment, one that he has never meet before. But all have touched his life in some way and all have a lesson to teach him.What could be an overly snappy book avoids that. It is a sweet book and will leave an impact on your life. It questioned what I believed and made me think about my life. This is one of the few books that has definitely changed my life. That said, I will probably never reread it, simply because books like these never stand up to the second time."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is a nice, quick read as long as you're not looking for ground-breaking literature. It tells the story of Eddie, a man who dies and then goes to heaven to meet the five people who have had a big influence on the course of his life. It's a sweet book, with likeable characters in it. I loved the way the author connected everything together. I recommend this book for when you're looking for some light reading."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven is, in my opinion, a phenomenal book. The book is one with a small amount of pages, yet a huge message. The main character of the book Eddie struggles with many inner conflicts. He struggles with the choice he made when he was in the army and his difficult and failing relationship with his father. When Eddie was in the military he was captured and became a prisoner of war to the Vietnamese army. When he got away, towards the end of the war, his fellow soldiers along with Eddie decided to burn down all of the huts to seek revenge. While the men were burning down the buildings Eddie thought he some a figure moving inside of the hut. He didn't have enough time to check and see if someone was in there, so it haunted him for the rest of his life. Though this chapter obviously has huge significance to the reader, it also foreshadows the future... In Eddie's heaven.In the novel Eddie also deals with his father and his relationship. On earth the two have many unresolved issues that are slightly deeper than the surface. In heaven Eddie forgives his father for all of the things that came between their relationship on earth.Both of the conflicts that Eddie has in the book are somewhat resolved in heaven. Though both issues take time and effort to completely heal the bruises that each caused in Eddie's life. In heaven Eddie's issues are resolved in a twist that the reader doesn't expect.The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a great book that I would recommend to anyone who was looking for a good book to read. Some say that Mitch Albom is taking a risk by going religious in this book and being sappy; but in my opinion the book itself isn't religious, nor is it sappy. The book does, however, bring the reader many different emotions at different times. This is all of course in my opinions; to completely understand what I mean you should read Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet In Heaven!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was good and worth reading.

This book is definitely a must read for anyone who still holds on to the belief that people are generally good and that there is no greed in this capitalist world. It's a way of keeping the wool over their eyes for just a little longer. Why not snuggle down to this book while drinking your mulled wine at Christmas in front of an open fire.What most people fail to realise is that there is no impirical evidence of the existence of heaven. It a tool devised by religious institutions as a form of control. This book (probably un-wittingly) furthers the religious cause by linking the concept of heaven to the daily routine of life.There is no such thing as heaven and your life has no meaning - get over it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read through the book and found it to be predictable and amusing in a strained kind of way.

What motivates Jesus to pay for it all? Believe me when I tell you it's gonna cost him,... big time. If you want to heap infinite riches and pleasures on someone then you're likely to get very little return on your investment, even if you are god.

A beautiful book, I truly enjoyed it and have recommended it to all who will listen!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"What is the purpose of your life? You may find yourself asking this question often. This is the idea that Mitch Albom is trying to touch on in his book, The Five People You Meet in Heaven. In this beautifully written book, the author paints a different picture of heaven for us. He says that it is not just a place to float around on clouds, but a place to become enlightened with what your purpose for living was. He shows us this through the experiences of a maintenance man from an amusement park.In this story, Mitch Albom tells of the knowledge that we gain when we enter into heaven. He writes that when we reach that glorious place, before we can just float around, we must find out our purpose for life. Eddie, the maintenance man, has meetings with five people that he has come in contact with both directly and indirectly. Through these meetings, we see that all of our lives are intertwined and that we all have an effect on someone else. We learn that even if we think our lives have been a waste and are insignificant, in reality, our lives have affected many people.This book is very inspirational and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book that makes you feel good. This book takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. We experience everything from very deep sadness, to the greatest of happiness. When we hear the stories told to Eddie, we feel what he feels. The tone of this book is very similar to another of Mr. Albom's books Tuesdays with Morrie. I believe that anyone that enjoyed that book will also enjoy this one. This is a very touching, heartfelt story that will inspire and give hope to anyone who reads it.Mitch Albom did an excellent job of portraying his idea of heaven in this novel. We learn all about the character in this story, but through him, we learn things about ourselves. This book gives us a new perspective of the kingdom of heaven. We see how it is far better to be enlightened with your purpose of life than to just float around as many others perceive heaven. This book will make you want to work harder to get to heaven, and give you the motivation you need to praise God as we all should."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Eddie has a tragic death at an amusement park he has practically lived at his entire life, just to try and save a little girl separated from her parents.

What I loved about this book is that you see that through one pair of eyes, it's an innocent little tale, but through another's, it's a tragic ending. What I didn't like so much was the fact that he never got to talk to his dad in heaven. They ended with a really bad relationship, and his father never got to hear his apology he made. My favorite character was Marguerite because she is described as a really pretty girl, and her heaven is the most wonderful place I could ever be. One quote, \\"But hatred is a curved blade, and the harm we do to others we do to ourselves,\\" really got me thinking how it is so true because if you are mean to someone, you'll eventually get that meanness in return.

A freak accident occurs which kills Eddie and sends him to the heaven of five different people...each to give him a lesson he should learn about his life while he was on Earth. There he learns the most important lessons of all from his 5th person--one that shows he was a person of worth and importance.The greatest strength of this book is that it read quickly and is very easy to read. What I did not like about it is that it was unrealistic. I know Mitch Albom wanted to give an obsecure view of heaven in this book but I could never imagine that that is what heaven is really like. Plus I always read long realistically written fiction novels so it was quite different for me, but all in all I enjoyed it.

Each person had a story to tell of how Eddie impacted them or was shown the importance of the relationship to Eddie.

THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN has been on the USA Today's top 150-bestseller list since October 2, 2003. It peaked at number one. As of August 18, 2005, it ranked number 100.THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN is a third person-limited narrative about Eddie, an amusement park maintenance man who, at age 83, is literally and figuratively crushed in body and spirit.Mitch Albom did not write about Paradise, but about a Heaven where five people teach you something. Albom put Eddie in Heaven to wrestle with blame. It is a Heaven palatable for atheists and agnostics as well as believers.In truth, Albom's story is not about the afterlife. The lessons Eddie gets in Heaven are about this life, and it's a shame Eddie didn't get to read his story before he died. Eddie learns that trivial acts can have tremendous consequences, that there is no absolution for hard decisions not matter the choice, that one's legacy is intrinsically woven with threads from the legacies of our predecessors, that fabric rent asunder might not be amendable, that love is indeed the most splendid thing, and finally, unavoidably, life has its oops and zoinks.Read this one before you die."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was an overall enjoyable book to read.

Then it goes back into his life to a much earlier birthday and what was occuring then. You get a view of Eddies life from beginning to end. The book continues this way throughout the book. Each person he meets lets you understand the meaning of your life too. How we all mean something to each other and how we all touch each other's life without even realizing it.

Eddie, an old amusement ride mechanic, dies tragically while protecting a small child from a dangerous accident. Eddie embarks on an incredible journey, while his co-workers deal with the details of resolving his affairs after his death.In heaven, Eddie meets five people from his life. They explain the meaning of his life to him. Each one helps to clarify some of the misconceptions that he had about himself and others. Eddie had become a cantankerous and lonely old man, embittered by the difficult circumstances and disappointments in his life. But, through this experience he is emotionally healed as he learns that his life had purpose.If you enjoyed Albom's \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" you will not be disappointed. Albom is a talented writer who, in \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven,\\" is able to convey strong emotions without being overly sentimental.This book can be read by people of all faiths. While it is about the afterlife, it doesn't focus on who we recognize as our creator or a higher power, instead it illuminates the relationships that we have with others. It is a reminder that everyone's life has significance and that we are all connected to one another."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"What a beautifully written piece of work. Poetic yet simple and shockingly brilliant. This author has incredible instincts and a clarity for putting down exactly what he sees."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"On the surface, Eddie seems like the average guy. He fought in the war, got married, made some friends and spent most of his life repairing and maintaining the rides and Ruby's Pier, a small amusement park right on the water.The book begins with a countdown to Eddie's tragic, accidental death. He doesn't know he's going to die, so we see a simple day in the life of a seemingly simple man who has let one day bleed into the next since the horrors he witnessed at war and the death of his beloved wife, Marguerite.Then, the unthinkable happens at Eddie's park, a freefall ride car starts hanging and appears as if it is going to fall, right onto the head of a little girl! In Eddie's last moments, he lunges toward the girl, with the ride car falling fast, and the last thing he remembers are two tiny hands in his.The next thing Eddie knows, he's in heaven, but it's not in HIS heaven, but the heaven of the \\"blue man\\", a man who was once part of the freak show act at the pier when Eddie was a little boy. The Blue Man explains to Eddie that he will meet five people who will help him to understand the meaning if his life, which seemed to meaningless and insignificant to Eddie.To tell who the five people were would give away too much of the book's meaning, and the delightful anticipation while reading it, but I will say this, Eddie meets five people, some he knows, and some he doesn't know, and they show him how seemingly insignificant moments of his life, even in his darkest days, have had profound meaning and influence on the lives of others. Albom teaches Eddie, and all of us that \\"no man is an island\\" in this uplifting, magical tale.This book is a rich story, but a very quick and engaging read, easily broken up into sections, for those with little time. It's definitely a worthwhile read.Albom's vision of heaven is just one way of looking at it, but what a delightful way of looking at it it is. The most any of us can hope for is that at the end of our lives, they have had some meaning, some influence, and there is some order to the chaos of even the most seemingly senseless acts and tragedies. Albom gives us this hope, along with a refreshing and uplifting tale about love, family, loyalty and life itself."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"To put it simply, this is the only book I've ever read more than once.

Really made me think alot about life, and the people we love. It was a perfect gift, and definitely well-written, thoughtful book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is one of those books that is currently going around that is a \\"must-read\\" on many people's lists. It's a short book (197 small pages) and a quick read, but a really inspiring story. Mitch Albom, best known for Tuesdays With Morrie, is an all-around talented guy. Every so often I find his column on Jewish World Review, and every so often I see him talking sports on ESPN's The Sports Reporters. But The Five People You Meet in Heaven is not a political book, not a sports book - it's a life book.Albom delivers a strong message in a fairly simple tale. The story tells of a carnival ride worker named Eddie, who for most of his life has worked at a pier fixing rides. Eddie doesn't see this as much... he sees this as never getting anywhere, of his life never having an effect on anyone else's and as never doing anything worthwhile. When one of the carnival rides breaks, Eddie attempts to save a little girl's life, and in the process loses his own. Eddie does not know whether or not he is successful in saving the girl's life until the end of a journey that is just beginning for him... meeting his five people in Heaven.Without giving too much away in this book (because, unlike most of today's books or Dan Brown novels, you don't know exactly what is going to happen... and even though there is no dramatic twist or turn), it is one that each person must read for themselves and take away from it what they will. Personally, I see it as an affirmation that each person does matter, and that, despite what people may think about themselves, or what others think of them, no one is here without a reason. Everyone is here to do something, or to affect someone. No one knows who their five people will be... but that is what makes it interesting. How much will you affect the life of someone you barely know? Do you know how much you mean to a person that loves you?This book may not speak to everyone, and that is understandable. You've got to believe in something higher or greater in order to take away a message from it. It's a feel good tale... but you've got to get into Eddie's shoes if you want to understand where he comes from. It shouldn't be that difficult, since most people have points in their lives where they question what they are doing, what they exist for. Is it worth going out and searching for what you are here for? I don't think so. If you live your life, what you are meant to do will come to you. But that doesn't mean you should sit around all the time waiting for something to happen. There's a fine balance between over-zealousness and laziness.Reading this book will not take you a long time, but its message will stick with you for a longer time. Pick it up and read it on a rainy day, or when you've got a couple of hours to spare. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The title got me hooked but didn't deliver. Blahhh.

I thought this was one of the most touching stories I've ever read. The idea is that when you die your life is explained to you by 5 people, some you know and some you may have never met. Albom's novel shows us that we are all connected and everything we do has an impact..maybe not on our own lives but those of others. Many parts of this book were sad and depressing, especially when you read about the main characters guilt over things that happened in Vietnam and the loss of his wife. But as the 5 people in heaven reveal their stories the main character finds the answeres to all the big &quot;whys&quot; in his life.

In these conversations Eddie learns a number of valuable lessons: that, for example, no one's life is unconnected from other lives. Everyone impacts others, often unwittingly, and is impacted by others. We cannot deny our connectedness and live as if in a vacuum. Other lessons include the importance of forgiveness, since unforgivenness is a poison that eats up one's insides. Eddie also learns that making sacrifices is a part of life, and has the potential of being a wonderful thing.\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is a book that, above all else, captures the human experience on this earth.

It is a wonderful story I'd recommend to almost anyone!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a book that I think should be required reading in high school. It's a great story and really makes you think a little bit harder about your own life and a quite enjoyable read. The characters are very believable, as well as the story. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really liked this book because it gives you a lot to think about once you're done with it. Also, its very easy reading - people of all ages should be able to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It's the book you can purchase at the airport and read on your flight to wherever. This book invoked much thought on who my own five people would be, but that's the beauty of this story, every life has meaning and a reason to be. I highly recommend this story, and without giving away any of the stories within, hope that you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is small but contains a large message about life. It seems at first as a gloomy book about death and the afterlife. Its purpose becomes clear as you read on and realize that its an understanding about life....without giving to much away you come away with a refreshed idea of the role we all play in one anothers lives. This is the first book I have read by Mitch Albom and I was instantly impressed."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is very well written ... the author aims right for the soul and hits his target! Not an exciting, dramatic read, but ideal for the mood I was in when I read it. Mitch Alborn aroused feelings of peace and well-being. I highly recommend it.Betty Dravis is the author of THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY, just released in April 2005, and of MILLENNIUM BABE: THE PROPHECY."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Written in clear, spare prose, this slender tome is a pleasant little book that can easily be read in one sitting. It is a sentimental look at life and the hereafter. The book focuses on an individual named Eddie, who is the chief maintenance mechanic for the rides at a seaside amusement park called Ruby Pier. It is around him that the book revolves. Eddie is a somewhat embittered and lonely old man who tragically dies on his eighty third birthday, while trying to save a child from certain death when an amusement ride comes loose from its moorings.When he dies, Eddie meets five people in heaven. Each of them imparts a special lesson about Eddie's life. Each lesson allows him to understand the meaning of his life a little better. The five people that he meets show Eddie, and the reader, how we are all connected, and that the smallest acts can often have great impact on others, both positively and negatively. The book's bottom line message is that everyone has a purpose in life, whether or not it is readily apparent to one. It is as if there were a cosmic tapestry, with the life of one interwoven with the life of another, the threads crossing unknowingly but creating a larger picture.Although the author definitely manipulates the sensibilities of the reader, that is not necessarily a bad thing. The book, however, is somewhat predictable and, at times, a little reminiscent of a treacly Hallmark greeting card, both schmaltzy and touching. It was no surprise that the book ended up as a Hallmark Hall of Fame production and turned into a made-for-TV movie. The film is quite enjoyable, and Jon Voight is terrific in the lead role. I actually saw the film before I read the book, and the film whetted my appetite for the book. While not as good as the author's other book, \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", it is still a book that will resonate, if only because many will find its simple message comforting. Profundity, after all, may be found in simplicity."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Amazing! This book was just amazing. I started it and finished it in less than an hour. I was so caught up in it I just couldn't put it down. Talk about making you use your imagination. I could feel the heat of the boardwalk the smell of the ocean, the feel of the wind in my hair. I was there. I was right there the whole way. I have never been touched by a book like this. I have also watched the DVD, which was great, but nothing compares to a book of this magnitude. Find a nice quiet place, have a glass of ice tea, set aside some crackers or cheese for later because you won't want to move from your spot until you are done. Read it!!! You will be so glad you did and I bet it will make you think twice about what may lay ahead for you on your journey to \\"Heaven\\". I for one am looking forward to it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I only finished this book because it was required for a book club. All other members of the club considered it a waste of their time also. None of the 5 people gave any reason for the subject's existence as was the premise of the book. There was nothing in the book that made me feel better informed of anything at all. I like to be able to finish a book and feel I have been at least a little enlightened about something but there was nothing here. I won't waste my time with this author again, there are too many good books out there that have a compelling story line that entertains while enlightening the reader about something."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mr. Albom's first work, Tuesdays with Morrie, was a substantially much better book. Why?Because it was honest, straight from the gut writing, albiet not from Mr. Albom, but from Morrie.This book it is clearly evident that Albom is &quot;faking&quot; his way trying to espose meaning and purpose to those who never really had any and never will.Utterly Pedantic."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I listened to it on tape and I couldn't believe that there had been so much hype about this book. I thought it was completely contrived and ridiculous. BORING"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really don't have all that much to say other than this book is amazig. I read it in about 2 days. I wish I could meet this Eddie guy."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought this book because I thought it sounded like a good read. The first chapter or so was really great.. then I got lost. I thought it was an odd style of writing and it was hard to keep me interested. As a matter of fact, I got to where I was just skimming pages and I feel I got the jist of the book. I was let down by reading the jacket of this book. I really thought it sounded like it was going to be a great book and then .. it just sucked. It was not worth the money."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is the worst book I have read all year. I was really excited to get the book, but as I started to read it I found the plot very weak and the characters shallow. If this book were any longer I would have thrown it out. I still can't figure out what people see in this book. The message is obvious after the first person you meet in heaven. Furthermore, the message is nothing that has not been said in a hundred other (and far better) books...or films for that matter (think It's a Wonderful Life)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is a must read for everyone. It will touch you in so many ways, and each of its chapters will make you think about those who have touched your life. It will inspire you to think about how you act, love, live and treat others. An inspirational and feel good book. I now wander who my five people will might be."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Tuesdays With Morrie, and was looking forward to reading this book. I was totally disappointed with the entire experience. The anticipation was greater than the event, unfortunately."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If heaven turns out to be how Mr. Albom describes it, definitely I don't want to go to heaven. I've had many thoughts on what heaven can be, but never crossed the thought that I would have to reach heaven to fill myself with more regrets and guilts than those I left this life with. I have the conviction that we must try to become the best out of ourselves in this life, that we truly should be committed to this; but to reach heaven to meet people I never met in this life and be filled with remorse and guilt exceeds all my expectations.Having read &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;, which is definitely an inspiration of love and a 'must read' to everyone, &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; is a most discouraging one."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read &quot;Tuesdays&quot; and loved it, as many reviewers here. I bought this book based upon the depth of that previous book. Everything that &quot;Tuesdays&quot; is, this is not. The story rambles, and I just don't care enough about the characters. Like other negative reviewers, I had to throw the book out after reading about 50 pages. I don't usually discard books, but this is definitely not a &quot;keeper.&quot;"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Maybe it's just because this style of book isn't really my thing, but my main thought on finishing it was basically a big shrug. It was pleasant: an easy, fast read -- I finished the entire thing in the bookstore -- and it makes you think, albeit briefly, about how interconnected we are and what kind of life you're living. I liked the somewhat unusual structure (beginning with the main character's death), but aside from that it was mostly quite predictable.It reminded me a lot of a Hollywood feel-good comedy, actually: not too challenging, and you come out feeling vaguely touched and thoughtful. There aren't many deep points or new ideas in there. That's totally fine if you're in that mood -- I've watched many such movies and read many such books in my time -- but if you want more, you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had heard a great deal about this book and the movie. It was a nice little read, but I actually preferred reading other books to comfort my soul. Nevertheless, it has a sweet little concept about Heaven and brings focus to how interconnected we are to one another."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I couldn't have guessed how powerful an impact the CD of \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" would have on me! I had read the book a couple of times, cried a bit, but until I was put in the position of complete spectator, as it were, the whole thing didn't fully impact me! The CD at first seems a little monotone and I wondered if I would enjoy it but VERY quickly the voice of the author swept me away and the unassuming voice allowed my mind to see what was going on in the colors and hues MY MIND wanted instead of the narrator's voice coloring and flavoring the story as many audiobooks do! It was an experience that completely surprised me! The characters were more vivid, believable, visual, & human than I expected & I cried for them more because I understood them and their story. In one case I cried the harder for one character, realizing how very PERFECT, innocent and forgiving she was. Mostly, I think I realized that we all touch people's lives every day in every way. I needed that message of hope that day & probably on many others down the road! I highly recommend the audio version of this book...no matter HOW many times you've read it! :-)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is the story of a man's life described after he dies from the perspective of five people who influenced or were influenced by him. It is presented in a way that keeps the reader on the edge because unpredictable information may be presented by each one of the characters.I cannot say that it is a book full of crucial lessons about life or a book of self development. However, it is a good story told in a very original way. I enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Many people have great imaginations. In the book \\"The five people you meet in heaven\\" is a awesome book to read and enjoy if your someone with great imagination. The way Mitch Albom wrote the book you can imagine everything that's going on. From the setting to the characters. The book had a aswesome description on every character you met. You get pulled into the book and really get into the characters and get to understand them, like you know them. The plot of the story is what really got me interrested in reading the book. This plotline was like no other book i have heard of or read before.In the book I think what could have made it better is if Mitch would some up Eddie's life a little better before he dies. I know he had a flash back section after every chapter to have you understand everything that happened and why it did, but i really didn't like that. I know that we were on as much as a journey as Eddie was meeting the characters and their life story, but it would have been easyer to know more about him. Mitch, instead has us being as clueless about everything like Eddie.I would suggest this book to anyone with an imagination or who likesadventure. This book will keep you on your toes! It keeps you wanting to read more and more. I would not recommend this book to anyone who likes action packed and mystery stories. They might not enjoy the story as much as others would."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book Five People you meet in Heaven was really good. The thing I liked about the plot was that it was revealing. The plot showed me what my afterlife could possibly be about. Another thing I liked, was the characters. The main character, Eddie, was an average guy which made it easy to relate to. He had a regular life that gets explained to him.But, there were some downfalls. The thing that I didn't like about the book was that it was aimed for more adult audiences. I had some trouble understanding certain parts of the book. Also, it got dull during certain parts of the book. While I was reading the book, I got bored of reading some of it.I would suggest reading this book to students in 8th grade or higher. I think many high school students and some middle school students would enjoy reading it. But, I would not suggest younger children reading it. The book is hard to understand for anyone younger than me. They would have trouble reading it and they don't need to know about the afterlife, anyway. In conclusion, the book The Five People You Meet in Heaven was a really good book and I think you should read it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book really was not too good for me. I was actually very disappointed. While I love Mr. Albom's writing, this was just too elementary for me. I feel like it would be great for pre-teens etc. The story was very slow and I never connected with the main character. If you haven't already, skip this one and read Tuesdays with Morrie, it is wonderful."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Though it is written in the same style as \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" I found this book very enjoyable and easy to read. At the end of the day, it still makes you feel good.Ja-NaeWild Women Entrepreneurs President/Founder"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I liked the main idea about meeting five people, how they all had crossed path with Eddie somewhere, the idea that all the stories are connected and has different sides to each of them, and the lessons each of them gave. I get what the author wanted to write about.HOWEVER, the writing style just plain annoyed me. I didn't think it was necessary to repeat the same style over and over for five times with Eddie's birthday and the lesson chapters. These could have been all put together to make it a smoother reading.I watched the movie and the movie was EXCELLENT. There was none of the extra annoying repetitious of Eddie's Birthday chapters nor separate lesson chapters. It flowed really nicely (even though, it's pretty long).I would suggest that you watch the movie since it covers the entire book in a much smoother way. Also, for some reasons, reading the book was more depressing. Instead, the movie uplifted me."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is one of the greatest books I have ever read. Not because of the story but because of the manner that Mr. Albom introduces and describes Heaven. This is a book made for people who question faith and look for the answers. It will not tell you how to believe in Heaven, but give you a different perspective on what it might be like. Question this book and look into your own ideas about faith, this will give you a new way on interpreting the theory of Heaven and God."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Browsing through the bookstore, I saw this small, discreet book, pages worn and faded from so many hands touching it, and I recognized it as a New York Times Bestseller featured on Good Morning America. In this novel, the readers will be immediately fascinated just because the story starts with, \\"The End.\\" Forget the happily-ever-after part, too. The novel focuses on Ruby Pier's handyman Eddie, who seems like just the average retired janitor that every town has for one reason or the other. When he dies, it seems like this man had nothing special or remarkable happen to him or effect others around him...he was just your every-day retired war vetran looking for peace before he left. In heaven, he meets the five people whom made an impact or were impacted by Eddie's life. It seems like these people are explaining his life story to him, although Eddie thought for certain he was nobody special. It's perfect for wet monday blues or just the ending to a fairytale-like day, like a precious gem found among mud."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven, is one of the best books I have ever read. It is so interesting. I got hooked just by the title. Then I read it and it really made me think and wonder. It told me that you can't let a single day go by without doing something fun. It tied in people from where Eddie's lifetime that he has met or that had something to do with his life. They taught him life lessons like, \\"take one story viewed from two different angles.\\" I loved they all had something to do with him if it was a huge thing or just a little thing. Meeting the five people helped you get a better image on what Eddie's life was like from when he was younger until his death. This by far is my favorite book. You could read this in one day it just takes you away into the story. This is a book you can definitely read over and over because you get a different thought every time you read the book. It is a good book to help you open your mind to new things. You may wonder if you life is boring, but it really does teach you to live life to the fullest. If you are a person who thinks that there are no good books out in the world you are wrong because this book goes out to everyone. Even if you have different beliefs in religion you can read this book because it teaches you unique lessons. When I got done with this book I wanted to read it over. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who can read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"Everyone has an idea of heaven, as do most religions, and they should all be respected.\\" - Mitch AlbomI had to start off this review with that quote from Mitch Albom that's stated in the beginning about why he wrote this book. After I watched the made for TV movie that truly inspired me I went to look up reviews for the book. Some where really good and some shocked me. So I will try my best in this review.Basically, I was so inspired by the movie I had to buy the book. I didn't care what the reviews stated. I think different things inspire people in different ways. I usually do not read these types of books and I haven't the pleasure of reading Tuesdays With Morrie yet which I also hear is very inspiring. I was so happy to see the movie basically followed the book entirely.The book is about a man named Eddie. Who worked at a theme park for most of his life as did his father before him. He always thought his life didn't amount to anything and that he never did get a chance to follow his dreams. We start to follow Eddie at the end of his life. Then we flash back through his life and meet the 5 people who had connected with him through out his life. At the end of the meeting there's always a lesson to be learned.This is a very light read that any one can read in about a day. It's so inspiring to me that I have read it more than once and when I travel I tend to take it with me. Or I read it when ever I feel down and blue about myself or how things are currently going with my own life. Personally, this touches me in every way and the way I look at my own life. Even though if this isn't what heaven is about or life is about. I do hope to reconnect with people and learn what my life was about on earth."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom is a sensitive writer and \\"Five People\\" is tender, tragic, and hopeful. The story is a masterful reflection of the ironic interrelated ripples that arise in the pool of existence we all share."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I went into the reading of THE FIVE PEOPLE with my eyes wide open. You should do the same . . . If I read a book that bores me after the first few chapters, I put it aside, maybe to try again sometime. If not, I give it away. Every book doesn't have to be life-changing, but if it can make me think, laugh, cry, inform me or fill an otherwise boring evening, it's done it's job for me. This book does that. Granted, I was thinking of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" meets John Edwards when I read it, but I have to admit it was a thought provoking, uplifting read. I enjoyed it!

I found the characters to be wonderfully presented, and the book was a joy to read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a story which could have become either overly sentimental or preach-y. It did neither. It did remind me to pay attention to the impact people have on our lives, and we on theirs, every single day. I loved what this little book had to say."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a wonderful book. It tells the story of an elderly amusement park worker, Eddie, and his voyage to discover his true purpose as he travels through the steps of heaven. Eddie meets 5 people that either played an important part in his life, or who was changed by him. He finds that they are all connected in some way and that their influence affected the person that he was. Each of these people has a different lesson to teach him as he continues his journey.We learn more about Eddie's life as he looks back on his experiences, the author describes certain significant birthdays, and his coworkers reminisce about their deceased friend. After encountering the 5 people Eddie at last realizes the meaning of his life.I highly recommend reading this book! I really liked Albom's unique view of what heaven is like and the heartwarming story.It was a quick read and I believe anyone can enjoy it!:)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom is a fantastic book. Eddie is an 83-year-old man. He has worked for years as maintenance at Ruby Pier Amusement Park making sure the rides were safe for visitors. When the story begins it counts down Eddie&#8217;s life until the moment he dies. Eddie did his job very carefully. Children seemed to like him but even Eddie felt he achieved nothing. He dies trying to save a little girl. Eddie regains consciousness in heaven. Five people, show Eddie the positive impact his life has had on others. He begins to understand the real meaning of God's gift of life to mankind. For those people that have not read Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom, they will go out and buy it after reading this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Well, quite a good read is really all that needs to be said about this book. My respect goes to Albom for writting such a good descriptive book.This book deals with the afterlife-thouchy subject. But i happen to belive Albom doesn't deal too much with the religious aspect of Eddie's (the main character) journey. Which is really what the book is about, Eddie's journey through heaven and the lessons he learns.Some other reviewers have criticized this book for having a lack of difficult vocabulary. Well, Mark Twains 'Adventures of Tom Sayer' didn't incorporate difficult vocabulary, and turned out to be an American classic.The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a good, easy, nonstop, read with a several good messages."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"We all tend to look at reviews before selecting a new book to read. It is not easy to understand why The Five People You Meet in Heaven has supposedly been so popular.I tried very hard, although it is a relatively short book, I just could not get into it. I did groan and persevere in finishing it but just could not understand its appeal. It is badly written. There is a lot of repetition. It is not easy to see why these five people have been selected. It would have perhaps been more meaningful if each character selected had some symbolic significance.Looking at some four and five star reviews, one wonders whether the book so appealing to many because it is so simple. But then there are many great works of literature about ordinary people, but they are much more deeply written and give you an idea of everyone's interconnectedness written in a much better literary style.Because of its supposed appeal this book has been even published in large print- a shame as I can think so many other titles that people with sight problems would find much more worthwhile."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I appreciate having the opportunity to purchase a used copy of \\"The five people you meet in heaven\\" by Mitch Albom. There was a little wear on the cover, but the pages were in good shape and it was certainly fine for a high school freshman to use in class.Thank you."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Interestingly, I like this book more than Tuesdays with Morrie. As I stated in that review, I enjoy Mitch Albom's style - concise, clear and not overly elaborative. I found the story quite creative and was quite absorbed in the story, wanting to meet each of the character's that Eddie meets in heaven. It was interesting how Albom intersected the characters. However, as with Tuesdays with Morrie, I thought the book was overall good but not at all in the Great -- Must Read category. Yet it was a NY Times Best Seller so I guess there are many who would disagree.I would read future books by this author.Barbara Kent, authorSuccess in the Words of the Masters"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book begins with \\"the end,\\" when a man named Eddie dies. But not really, because the author says \\"all endings are also beginnings. We just don't know it at the time.\\"Through flashbacks the story of Eddie's last several hours is told as his remaining time on earth ticks away. He is fated to die in an amusement ride accident while attempting to save a young girl's life. He does not feel the impact, or know for sure whether the girl is saved not, he simply is suddenly gone.More flashbacks follow, going back to his birth, interspersed with five interviews with people who influenced his life. He knew some of the people well; others he was only vaguely aware of. The net effect is meant to be that the interviews will help him to make sense of his life before the afterlife continues.It emerges that Eddie began with hope, but suffered great sorrows (the horror of war, a debilitating wartime injury, estrangement from his father, and a tragic accident that led to the early death of his beloved wife). The net effect cause him to give up the idea of becoming an engineer and settle for a career of maintaining rides at the seaside amusement part as his father had done before him. The same routine year after year, although he is good at it, and physical decline make for a believable and rather grim picture.The things that Eddie comes to realize through the five interviews make him feel far more positive about his life - and eager for the next step, which will be an interview with someone (unidentified) who will die after he did.The story is appealing, I think, irrespective of one's religious beliefs. It certainly beats the idea of heaven as a place of perfect contentment, etc. But in offering the \\"secret of heaven\\" in the final paragraph, consider whether the author may be contradicting his own vision of the uniqueness of individual lives."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"At first I thought this book would be a bit depressing. However, I found it to be a quick, easy read that also gave me a \\"feel good\\" feeling! I truly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book shipped VERY quickly and when I needed to have it,for my son's school, it was here early. Thanks and look forward to ordering from you again."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a spiritual book, managing to take the reader on a journey through the afterlife without an obvious preachy religious stance.Eddie is an average man. In his opinion, his life adds up to nothing more than seemingly random events that have had no effect to anyone. Basically, he believes that he was born, he existed and then he died and all of it was unimportant. Upon his death, he is greeted by 5 people whose lives he touched. Through speaking to them and reliving their deaths, he learned that he did effect the universe around him.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a surprisingly uplifting, heartwarming story when you look at how much death is focused on. Through the eyes of others, Eddie learned the true meaning of his own life. The book makes you consider your own life and makes you realize that no life is ever truly meaningless. Mitch Albom has proven again how great he is at being deep without being heavy. The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a short and light look at death and what comes next."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was surprised to see that so many people wrote such mean reviews about this book. I thoght it was touching and well-written. I haven't yet read Tuesdays with Morrie, but now I want to."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have heard positive and negative comments about this book, and so I decided to do my own thinking, and experience the work myself. It is the only one by Mitch Albom I have read so far. I must say that I was pretty well pleased. At base is the belief that we are more inter-connected than we realize, as human beings. There are stories about ourselves that, if we knew them, would make us laugh with joy, or cry with deep pain. There is a \\"higher power\\", One who can see all our stories, and is able to weave them together in ways we will never comprehend on this side of life. The premise underlying this short, fine work is that what matters is concern for the important others in our lives. No one can deny the power of love. If it isn't the case that \\"God is Love\\" in Albom's excellent parable, then at least it can be said that \\"God abides in love\\". Albom doesn't describe the god who makes the heart-rending connections happen, but it is not any god who justifies human hatred.The plot is simple, the characters--those people that Eddie (central character) met in life are memorable. The god of the Heavens is a god of surprise, the kind of surprise that comes with birthdays. I liked this book as much as I liked The Shack. These two short stories, which dare to reach into the beyond where God dwells, can conceivably become classic literature, offering simple indicative advice on the way we, as humans, should go."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I am a bit surprised by the negative reviews on this book. I could not put it down, and read it in one evening. It is uniquely written, and it's value is in the perspectives about how our lives interweave, build upon one another, and affect one another in ways we cannot always imagine. I'm not sure this is how we enter heaven, as God keeps all sin and impurity out. However, who knows what the beginning process may be like. I would recommend reading it and forming your own opinions."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was amazingly life changing to me. I agree with Kenneth Yeh when he says this book makes you wonder if you have affected anyone else's life. I like how the people Eddie, the main character, meet in heaven don't even have to have any particular significance in his life. Their lives had just been drastically changed by him, and it was all unbeknownst to him. I also like the fact that every time Eddie met a new person in heaven, that person revealed more about why Eddie was the way he was. He was just an eighty-three-year old, maintenance man who was very simple and humble. He kept to himself most of his life, and didn't see the real influence he had in others lives. However, I did not like the fact that Eddie seemed to be so unaware of the people surrounding him. I understand we cannot meet and fully understand all of the people we see each day. I just thought Eddie should have put more effort into meeting the people he finds himself to be frequently around."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was exactly as described and delivered with very fast service.I was pleasantly surprised by the quickness of delivery and it was just what I expected and ordered.

This is the type of story to read often, keep the spirits up."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As a ninth grade teacher for striving students, I find that Mitch Albom's novel provides rich text at a readability level that makes this story accessible to all my students. His visual descriptions assist in creating mental images while his simplicity provides a springboard for deeper questions. The theme of \\"personal self worth\\" is universal, and as a read aloud, my students favor this book above all others. A must for teachers!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom is one of those writers that doesn't need to write an epic to get his point across. His books are relatively short but that never takes away from the content. He can jam in quite a bit of goodness into a little paper back book. This book and Tuesdays with Morrie are very poignant and must reads."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is one of those life changing books. A must read. The movie was great, to but be sure to read the book before the movie. The movie will make much more sense, if you do. A quick, easy read. You won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a story about an old man named Eddie who was the head maintenance person at an amusement park. Eddie believed he lived a go-no-where/do-nothing life. On Eddie's 83rd birthday he dies saving a little girls life. Eddie wakes up in Heaven where he encounters five people who are waiting to show him the true meaning of his life. These five people, one by one, try to show Eddie that we all live in a huge web of interlocking lives. All of our lives overlap each other and each sacrifice, no matter how small, affects others in a big way. The theme of this book is to remind us of what matters in our life while we are here on earth."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had heard that this book was excellent, but I had no idea what to expect. I had my own ideas, but it was nothing like I predicted. This tale is thoughful and elegant. It made me revel in the connectedness of all humans. Albom did an excellent job of crafting a story that will be touching for generations to come. This book isn't very long, but it is full of sentiment and lessons about how life may not seem fair, but there is always a plan. It's a must read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Well written, readable and thought provoking. I've recommended it to others. What more can I say."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book may be a bit simplistic, but if you ever think about the legacy that you leave on this earth. Read this book. Good times and bad times all mean something to you and those around even when you don't know it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book definitely was not what I was expecting. I guess I had it in my head that there was more of a religious bent to it, with more involvement of God in the grand scheme of things. Even though the storyline differed from my expectations, however, it is still an absolutely captivating read. Albom does a fantastic job of showing us his interpretation of heaven, including how our lives may interact with others of which we are not even aware.So...if you are only looking for a book that touts Christian values and the Christian view of heaven, you may be a bit disappointed. If, on the other hand, you are just looking for a good book to read that does still touch on the concept of God and heaven, this is it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book takes you on an imaginary, but possible, journey of a man after he dies. He has to meet five people that have made a difference in his life, whether he knew it or not, before he goes to heaven. Each person teaches him a lesson. They are good lessons that I hope to remember. It is a fast reading book, hard to put down. It is very well crafted and the images are conveyed in just the right way. The book is very readable to people of many ages; the text is simple and thought provoking. One of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had been wanting to read Five People for months. I got a copy from the library, read it in one night, enjoyed it during the process, but felt nothing from it the next day. I wanted more spiritual exploration, more God-seeking, but it never really was there. I read another book, Room of Marvels, with the same concept of journeying through the afterlife, and found it much more vivid, deep, and ultimately satisfying. Both books are short. I'd suggest reading both for an interesting comparison."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is my first book by Mitch Albom and will certainly not be my last. If you have ever wondered about the importance of your life, or your affect and contribution to another persons life, you must read this book!The countdown to Eddie's death was brilliant, and really made me \\"live\\" those last moments right along with him. It certainly made me realize just how suddenly our life can be cut short and how important every moment is.As Eddie meets his five people in heaven, he comes to realize how his life affected other people, some he knew, some he did not, and how seemingly insignificant moments in our life, can be life changing and or even catostrophic for someone else.I couldn't help but reflect on the poem by John Donne, \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\". Truly, no man is an island.In short, this is a MUST read!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I would highly recommend this book to anyone searching for a beautiful, life-affirming way to spend an afternoon, or evening. Mr. Albom has written a book that is a cut above and well worth your time. I could not put this book down! I recommend it 100 percent."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Is heaven more than a place? This engaging novel addresses that question by exploring the unexpected connections in all of our lives. Eddie, a wounded war veteran, now an old man, believes he has lived a meaningless life. But has he? The \\"answer\\" is found in this warm and surprisingly clever novel, written in a style that keeps you turning the page. It's not heavy philosophy, but it made me think things over. I'm very glad I read it, and I hope many others will like it just as much."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Amazing, that's just about all I can say about this book. Although I wasn't a fan of Tuesday's With Morrie I decided to try this novel after hearing several other people sing it's prasies.This book is a quick, feel good read that will have you laughing, crying and rooting for Eddie by page 2. Don't question yourself, just read it, it's that good. I have yet to come across someone who HASN'T liked it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I don't know if any book has ever had the impact that this book had on me. I was not expecting the storyline, which totally took me in a different direction of thought. I now only hope and pray that the lives I have (and have not yet) met have somehow been affected in a positive way. And all I can do is asks Gods forgeveness if not."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom is wonderful at getting to your heart and soul in The Five People You Meet in Heaven. I had never heard of Mitch Albom before, nor knew much about this book when I spontaneously picked it up and decided to buy it. It pretty much started with \\"Oo, pretty cover\\" to \\"Oo, neat premise\\" to reading the first 50 pages and going \\"D**n, this is hitting me.\\" Not hitting me in the painful way, but hitting me with a load of emotions that a book has never really made me feel before.The story is easily said. Eddie, everyone's favorite old man, dies in an attempt to save the life of a little girl. In Albom's portrayal of heaven, Eddie meets the 5 people that had the strongest impacts on his life. With each story, we come to learn more and more about Eddie's past and how he became the man he was before he died. Each story is a short novel inside itself, and told with wonderful detail and heart.The Five People You Meet in Heaven; from a pretty cover to my favorite book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really enjoyed this short, nicely written story. I have found myself looking at my daily actions differently since reading \\"Five People\\". You just never know the influence you have and can have. Live carefully and read this book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I enjoyed this book. It does jump around. But I like that way it is set up that way. It starts on the day that Eddie dies. It tells every hour what is occuring to lead up to his death. Then his death happens and he ends up in heaven. But he doesn't know the first person and what meeting this person means to him. But later as he talks to this person, he understands more. Then it goes back into his life to a much earlier birthday and what was occuring then. You get a view of Eddies life from beginning to end. The book continues this way throughout the book. Each person he meets lets you understand the meaning of your life too. How we all mean something to each other and how we all touch each other's life without even realizing it. Read the book, I don't think you'll be disappointed. It's not Tuesday's With Morrie. But it's short and to the point."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Some books touch your life in special ways, this is one of them. I have watched and witnessed Mitch's career mature over the decades and have enjoyed his work. I enjoyed his early days writing sports columns in the Detroit News, I enjoyed his early books, I loved his afternoon radio show, enjoyed Tuesday's With Morrie but this work is nothing short of a literary gem. The book will make you rethink life through one authors vision of death. It will touch your soul, it will make you cry. It is a celebration of life. Can you say Pulitzer?? Hey Mitch, \\"You can't go, all the plants are gonna die\\" Adam.As a footnote, I find it interesting that all reviews are to one extreme or the other, not too many middle of the road ratings on this one. For those of you who rated it a one, I think you missed the meaning of the story along the way. All of us must certainly agree that the story invoked passion. For the prospective reader, you'll have to decide whether that passion is for one star or five! The fact emotions stretch to both extremes means YOU have to read it for YOURSELF to formulate your own opinion!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I didn't care for this book at all. I found it to be nothing more than whimsical daydreaming. The whole idea was rather immature. Older, more sophisticated readers probably won't get much out of it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I was under the impression I was about to read something insightful and thought provoking....too bad this book is neither. I recommend skipping this one unless you enjoy wasting your time."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The comparisons to A Christmas Carol are true, but Dickens' book is superior. The reviews that this book is preachy are accurate as well. Think Celestine Prophecy. I thought that this would be a nice light interesting read with some substance. True, this is a light read that will take less than a couple of hours of your time. False, there is no substance to this book and your time is worth more than this."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"From the reviews, people obviously love this book or hate it. I've just spent a couple of wonderful hours on an autumn afternoon reading a story that I will remember for the rest of my days. The 5 lessons Eddie learns are true lessons that could help most people as they muddle through their lives. Those who know and understand the things that Eddie discovers live far happier and less cynical lives. If you're happy with your life, read and enjoy. If you're willing to think about some things that may touch a cord or bring up a regret, read and learn. Personally, I think it's a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"When Eddie dies, he learns about how his life affected those around him. This book is inspirational- the five lessons that Eddie is presented with are good ideas to think about. This book is also a fast, easy read- a good book to recommend to non-readers."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I seldom read novels except Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code due to the phenomenal hype, but the title of this book had been interesting me for a while and kept me thinking who are those five people we are going to meet in heaven. So I decided to find out. The book is relatively short under 200 pages. It begins the story with the last day of an old man named Eddie, who will meet five people after his death in heaven to learn different lessons on the meaning of life. The beginning is a bit slow. It takes around thirty pages to set up Eddie's death. Honestly, as a reader, I couldn't wait to see the first person Eddie met in heaven and why. Despite that, the story goes very smooth and quite touching. Indeed, the author's perspective on fairness, sacrifice, memory, and love, inspires me a lot to re-think the meanings and values of life. I'm wondering who are the five people waiting for me when my time comes.(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 20-Feb-2005)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"is what this book is designed to give you. It's your typical feel good story in the tradition of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" except the main character Eddie does not return at the end of the story. The story itself is not very original - a man dies and goes to heaven. There he meets 5 people who show him what his purpose in life was. Yadda. Yadda. I would imagine that one reason this book has done so well is because it is an \\"everyman\\" story. The overwhelming majority of us want to know what difference our lives have made. I would have to agree with the reviewer who stated Heaven isn't about YOU. It's about God. As far as a spiritual novel (given the previous premise) this book falls short of the 5 stars so many others have given it. It's an exceptionally quick read but a bit expensive for stocking stuffer. Good to check out of the library if you are remotely depressed and need validation that your life has meaning. Not the best read of the year and certainly not the best that the author has penned."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I found it just too simplistic in its treatment of our interconnectedness. I did enjoy the sparseness of the writing - but I didn't feel moved by the message at all - and I really wanted to be moved. I would recommend the book as an easy read with a positive message - but not the eye and soul opener that others have labelled it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Perfect evening read for the busy, multi-tasking professional. I started my evening in a bit of a funk, and now feel inspired. Nothing terribly cerebral, but full of heart. Not my usual read, but well worth the departure. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"First of all, I think that Mitch Albom really meant this book to be more &quot;food for thought&quot; than something to be taken literally. Hence some of the other reviewer's disappointment. Yes, he probably did try and make us cry and manipulate us to an extent, but then he's an author--that what they do! Forget the hype surrounding this book and the &quot;other&quot; Mitch Albom book and read it for what it is: a sweet, short, heart-warming little piece of fiction. And I'm not sure I agree with some of the other reviews that this is reminiscent of &quot;Christmas Carol&quot; as it is totally different. Would also recommend another wonderful read: Jackson McCrae's THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD. While nothing like THE FIVE PEOPLE, it is worth checking out."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved this book! It's really makes us think that we are somehow all connected in some way. I couldn't put it this book down! This is definitely a great book to read while working out at the gym...1 hour on the stationary bike will be easy!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"i loved this book! it was a quick, easy read, offering a perception of heaven i have never imagined.by the end of the book, i was crying as the loose ends in the life of the main character tied together to create a beuatiful tapestry.this book is sweet and heart-felt, and offers peace and reassurance to anyone who has ever doubted their importance or self-worth.as far as the individuals who left negative reviews: yes, albom created a heaven where people are told they may have been responsible for the death of others, but it is a minute detail in the meaning of the bigger picture. by focusing on this point, your missing the moral of the novel!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book had a lot of good story lines and some very strong and interesting characters. I loved the way their lives intertwined with each other. I would recommend this book to anyone, &quot;sophisticated&quot; or not!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This short, simple book was one of the most moving pieces I have ever read. I found myself crying profusely at different moments. The book brought back many memories of my loved ones that have passed away, and how wonderful it would be to just see them one more time. It also had some very funny moments. For me, it is a book of hope and bittersweet dreams. I strongly recommend it to all, especially the cynical amoungst us."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"AMAZING!!! Mitch Albom has written a novel that is impossible to stop reading once you start. He dares to answer the question that so many people ponder, what is the purpose of life?In this novel an 83 year old gentleman dies and his life is explained to him by five people that he meets on his journey after his death. They help him to understand what some of the critical points in his life were, who helped steer him along his true path and those whom he helped guide along their own path. Mitch Albom shows us that some of the most important moments of our lives, are not the GREAT moments or the momentous events, but they are the times when we sometimes unknowingly shape the life of another person and help them along their path. It is in the small moments that the greatest beauty in life exists, the moments of pure love and an open heart, the moments when selfishness vanishes and great things, although small occur. It gives you pause to wonder who would be the five people that you would meet in heaven who would help you to understand the meaning of your life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Its not the best book ever but it is just a really fast, good read that leaves the reader feeling happy. I enjoyed it but its not a book i would read over over again. If you want a short fast read that leaves you feeling happy this is the book for you but beware that there is little substance for the sophisticated reader."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" by Mitch Albom, is a story about the beginning of the end of the main character, Eddie's, after life. He goes through heaven meeting five people and learning five lessons. These lessons supposed to allow him to understand his life on Earth.The book has some strong points and very few weaknesses. Its strong points include the character development. You are able to see the character unfold through short sub stories. But, as it is a strong point it is also its weak point. Its weak because it gives the story a stop and start feeling and kind of side tracks you. Overall this is a must read book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is one of those books that's easy to read and makes for a nice break from larger, more imposing novels. It possesses a brisk pace (about a 2-3 day read, though I read it in a day), and the writing style is simple and easy to get behind. This is really a book that almost anyone with a comprehension of the English language could read and enjoy. When some authors write in a simplistic, 'broken-down' style, I become infuriated (re: James Patterson), but with Albom, and with this book, it just seems to work. Even for those individuals who don't seem to find themselves to be religious, this is a book that, in reading, they'll get something out of. I believe there to be a Heaven, and hope that Albom has stumbled upon the true version in his book. The depicted Heaven seems like a perfect place, explaining to you your purpose in life, and the impact you made on five important people. I can't see anything more pristine than that. However, with all that said, the book is at times a bit over-the-top and a tad bit preachy. It's an enjoyable read, but don't expect too much out of it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have no idea why I waited so long to finally read this! It was powerful, emotional, and thought provoking. There were many times that I was highlighting text on my kindle, and it certainly warranted conversations with my parents...while there is still time."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The story is well written.

It is a good read and not too long or tedious to read. It makes you hope the scenario of Five People You Meet in Heaven is true."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I just got this book yesterday and read it in one sitting, so obviously it DID hook me in. I tried very hard to understand why a couple of the five people chosen to \\"meet\\" were that important, but failed to see their significance. The story is about a man who had been abused as a child, volunteered to fight in a horrible war and returned from that war both physically and emotionally damaged - never to really recover. The story jumps around from his last moments of life to previous experiences to what he then experiences after his death, so there is no continuity - and for me, left huge gaps and questions. It seems he had mostly disappointments in life from start to finish with the sole exception of marrying his one true love - but even that didn't seem to hold much joy for him. He was stuck in a go-nowhere manual labor job that brought no satisfaction, was haunted by his experiences in the war and was left with chronic pain and disabilities. Albom could not have painted a bleaker picture of a life - and then this very weird \\"accounting\\" of it after he died - all just left me cold and depressed. I will have to admit that I am in the minority when I say that I also did not like \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" - I read the book and saw the movie. Maybe I need to just accept that Mitch Albom is just not my cup of tea!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was a good read for sure. Makes you think about who \\"your\\" five people will be that you meet in heaven. Great price as well...bought because it was Amazon's daily book deal.

I pay for \\"prime\\", so I feel I should get all the perks even though I don't own a Kindle."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was a very good book.

I'm not sure that the book itself is thoughtful, but it is certainly thought-provoking, especially if you're one of those people who is always looking for meaning in life.Without giving away too much of the plot, I can tell you that the book is based on the time-honored simple theme of \\"what happens when some guy dies and goes to heaven...\\" The beauty of this book is how well that simple theme is fleshed out in the life of Eddie. Eddie is a lot like most of us in that he has lived a relatively quiet, uneventful life that some would argue doesn't play a large role in the grand scheme of things. All that changes when Eddie finds himself in heaven (which, BTW, isn't what most people have in mind when they think of heaven, but that is something for readers to discover on their own).Overall, I highly recommend this book and others like it as necessary for a culture that often downplays the significance and meaning of \\"ordinary\\" human life in favor of the spectacular, famous, and influential."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Today is Eddie's 83rd birthday.

The story of Eddie is well crafted and original.

I think we can all learn from his book, along with his \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" book that we have choices in how we can act that will one day catch up with us! Its up to us on how we want the end result to be!As for inspiration that changed my life, this book, along with \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" by Mitch Albom and Stacy Creamer, and \\"Leaving Lancaster County\\" by Teresa Phillips have broken my \\"shell\\" and made me a more positive guy!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved this book.

We lost our Mother a year ago to Pancreatic cancer and this book filled me with a peace that I haven't felt in a year. I found myself wanting and hoping that heaven would be like this. I also wonder who the 5 people Mum met when she passed away. This book will make you smile, laugh and cry. Have a box of tissues close by, you'll need them.

I enjoyed it enough that I went through it really quickly, but I came out of it kind of unsatisfied, like having a meal without the main course- something was just missing. I went looking for the whatever it was, and found absolutely nothing when I reread the book.Albom has some good descriptive language, and an original plot if you don't think about the cliched &quot;This is your life&quot;-type ideas. (Yes, that was sarcasm.) I really liked the book, and I think you will too, if you are considering buying it, but don't look to be totally fufilled at the end of this book. You'll find a small corner empty where there should be something.Overall, this book got four stars from me on merit of language alone. While Albom does have a tendency to lapse into cliches, I enjoyed the descriptions greatly.The verdict: buy this book, and read it when you've got time to contemplate things."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I had a hard time putting it down! The idea of how often and how unknowingly we change other peoples lives has really made me wonder how many lives I have changed and how many people have changed my life as well. If the afterlife is anything like this book we have a lot to look forward to."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Picked up the book with no real idea of what it was about. After the 1st page I was hooked. I have always been interested in other peoples ideas on life and death and this book was one of the more interesting. The story moves effortlessly between the chapters, becoming more enticing with each page. My wife read the book when I was done and felt it was one of the best books she has ever read. I highly recommend the book, and think it would make a great movie."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I totally disagree with the reviewer that wrote that this book is horribly written. My barometer on whether a book is well or poorly written is if I stop to re-read a sentence over again because it really moved me the first time, and/or if I read it aloud to my husband, I know it's written well. In a very short book, I read at least three or four sentences aloud. I found the writing lyrical at times, even profound.It's a true &quot;feel good&quot; read that I would recommend for everyone. It's the best book I've read in a while."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book tries hard to be touching and sincere. And it succeeds in doing that. But if you are hoping to expand your spirituality, explore your ideas of heaven, or, in fact, do anything else except read a soft book about a unknown topic and come away with a slightly gauzy, filmy view of heaven, buy another book. I read it because it got such enormous hype, a lesson I apparently haven't learned yet, and will probably meet again in heaven and have explained to me.It may be appropriate to read to a child of about six to eight, who is interested in knowing what happens when we die, if you are not an &quot;ashes to ashes&quot; kind of person.I'm just not the right person for slow-pitch, sweet heaven stories. The central theme is that five people in your life touched you in ways you didn't understand at the time, and that you touched others in way you didn't understand either. In heaven you understand it all. Connectivity explains the rest. I found it unsatisfying even as a simple, sweet story that teaches us to be kind to everyone. If I have to spend the first portion of eternity finding the five people and have them explain their connection to me, and the next part of eternity waiting for others to die so I can explain my part in their life, I'm not going to be buried in sturdy shoes and a good book--but not this one."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is a nice little book, I guess . After reading it, I just do not understand how it is so popular. One of the customer reviewers even used the term, life changing. It certainly isn't heavy in insights. I suspect those who are moved by the book are very easily moved by simple little books.I agree with the reviewer who said a reader's time can be better spent on many other books."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Have a box of kleenex close at hand when reading. This novel contains a line which will resonate with many readers. It's at the end of the fourth lesson when Eddie is asked about God. See if you can figure out which it is.tomwheelersr@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I don't want to say this was a BAD book - just that it exactly met and did not exceed my expectations. I expected that Eddie would meet some people he knew were important in his life and some people whose importance would be revealed to him. Yep. I expected that he would try to resolve some of the parts of his life that were difficult for him. Yep. I expected that it would have some sort of a &quot;happy&quot; ending (quotes are because he did die, after all). Yep.Well - I guess there was one unexpected aspect of it. I expected to care more about Eddie and his life - but I didn't.BUT most people that I have talked to including the person who gave it to me thought it was very moving and fabulous - so maybe there is something wrong with me.At least it was short."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is an uplifting treat that provides a very compelling take on the afterlife. In Heaven, Eddie meets five people who had a direct affect on his life and they explain the significance of what he thought to be a very trite and meaningless life. It's a story so powerful that it will have you wondering why you take your life so seriously and why you let the smallest of things stress you out. If you're trying to cope with the loss of a loved one, this book will definitely comfort you and help you to realize that there is still hope."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I absolutely love this book. Words can not describe my feeling upon finishing this work of art. I feel like a better person for reading it. Thank you, to Mitch Albom, for giving me an outlet to do some much needed soul searching."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Although this book was an easy read.....it was a PLEASURE to read. In life you will wonder why certain people are in your life, do they have a specific meaning or are they making a cameo??? Bottom line is anyone that is in your life touches it in one way or another whether we realize it or not. It makes you wonder who you will meet in the after life and why. A feel good book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was one of those stories that &quot;had me&quot; after the first page. It was one of those books that you can't put down.

Even better than &quot;Tuesdays wtih Morrie.&quot;"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book was staring back at me in the store and the title held me captive. I picked it up and anxiously flipped it over to read the summary....I finished the book in less than 24 hours, and I work for ten and a half of those hours!! I couldnt put it down, thehauntingly beautiful writing reminds us that we all make a difference to each other and to ourselves. My eyes welled up as I read each chapter in Eddies journey. The ending is as beautiful as one could imagine. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to absorb their minds into something other than a conventional fiction, I will go as far as recommending it to anyone who has experienced loss. It changed my perspective on the afterlife."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was a little disappointed with this book. After reading \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" (which I loved), I felt a little let down by this novel. Albom's view of heaven seems a little depressing to me, not to mention a little shallow. I did however like the overall concept of the book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After reading this book you will wonder who will be in heaven waiting for you! No person's life is worthless, it teaches; and Your life touches so many others in ways you've never realized. A thought provoking book. A quick read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"It was an interesting read, I found that I really wasn't impressed by the book. This book reminded me of the book What Dreams May Come, which I felt was a much better work."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Taking into account the popularity of this book (currently 2nd on NY Times bestseller list) and the testimonials of personal acquaintances, I am definitely the minority voice when I say this book is a letdown that offers nothing new for the casual reader.The story begins with the death of an elderly man who finds himself transported to a No-Man's Land that can be described at best as a Kandinsky painting; complete with offbeat hues and shades. The old man, named \\"Eddie\\", then proceeds to meet ghosts of his past that unravel the mysteries of his life (sound familiar?) which gives meaning to an otherwise mundane existence.The book is not bad by any means; it is well written and filled with powerful imagery. However, the plot is just a simple, rehashed tale using the age old \\"power of love\\" theme, and relies too much on the reader's emotion and sentimentality to carry it through until the conclusion.I recommend this book as a very quick read if you were traveling from, let's say Boston to LA. It immerses you into the story quickly, and no doubt will you find yourself immersed out of it just as quickly after turning the last page.On a side note, I found the references to the afterlife rather interesting; in the sense that Albom (the author) takes for granted that the reader accepts the concept of \\"heaven\\", or more importantly, Christianity. While the topic of God will inevitably come into play when dealing with life after death themes, Albom does a good job avoiding the burden of raising and answering theological questions by having his characters give generic responses to the deity, that guarantee not to offend any reader."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have finished two books in the last three weeks, this being one of them. As a pretty avid reader (6-12 books per year, mostly fiction) this is in the top five books that I have read all-time. It's a quick read, but one that you'll want to re-read as soon as you finish. Somehow he, the author, is able to capture very different emotions with each character, which would make this book very appealing to all types of people. Pick up a copy and read for yourself, I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book as a follow up to some of the other novels written by Albom, and I thought it was very good. The set up is a little different from other novels by having multiple chapters in each \`lesson' and each \`lesson' a different length. This book makes you think about your life and it is east to relate to the characters when you think about the deeper meaning. As I was reading, I made sure to remember the previous lessons to think about how all the lessons and characters connect. It is one of those novels that you will want to read again immediately after you finish. I would recommend this novel if you enjoy stories about life's lessons and the mysteries behind the saying \\"everything happens for a reason.\\""},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was such a lovely, hopeful and thought provoking work of fiction. But here's the thing - a bit of me believes/hopes that it's bordering on fact.Mitch Albom's 'The Five People You Meet In Heaven' tells the tale of Eddie, the fairground maintainance man and his story begins on his 83rd birthday.......his last day on earth.To help him put his lifetime into perspective he is met in heaven by 5 people from his past, some he knows - some he doesn't, but they all hold information that will help Eddie make sense of his life and understand what led him to arrive in heaven on the day he did.The message seems to be that whether we are aware of it or not, everything happens for a reason but more importantly, even trivial things can shape a person and that every encounter, occurance or event is tightly woven into the fabric of our lives.It is a very quick read, at just over 100 pages, but Mr Albom's writing style seems to pack a lot into those 100 pages. It's not 'gripping' or 'fast paced' but it is a page turner. I read it in one sitting as I couldn't wait to find out who Eddie's 5 people were and what his personal heaven would be.I don't think I've ever sobbed as much over a book as I did at the bittersweet ending of this one. I didn't see the 5th person coming and was literally moved to tears at their fragment of Eddie's life.It gets 5 out of 5 from me and I'm so glad I've read it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book touches the heart. There is so much wisdom in it. There were moments where I just felt tears coming while reading. A truly awesome book, written so beautifully!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book kept me intrigued right from the beginning. I didn't want to put it down. It moves at a great pace from the beginning right to the surprise ending. I was sorry to see it end."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\", Mitch Albom tells the heartwarming tale about an eighty three year old war veteran, named Eddie. Growing up Eddie had many dreams of becoming an engineer and all seen to be going the way he wanted it; until his return home from the war. After becoming a prisoner of war, Eddie's life changed. He had trouble finding work, became depressed and his relationship with his father became more and more increasingly difficult. Finally he gets a job as cab driver and he marries his true love. Life seems to be getting better, until he receives a call from his mom that his dad has collapsed with pneumonia. Thinking his dad is going to be out of work for a short time and to protect his dad from losing his job, Eddie decides to fill in for him at the pier. Unfortunately Eddie's dad passes away and Eddie feels forced into his father's meaningless job fixing rides at the Ruby Pier Amusement Park.Some 50 years later and now eighty three years old, he is still making sure the rides are safe and maintained at Ruby Pier. Eddy feels his has not achieved anything in his long life and that he has had no purpose or meaning, but on this day he is unaware that he will learn that is untrue.As he goes about his regular duties, Eddie happens to notice that a cart from the Freddy Free Fall ride is about to come lose and crash upon the boardwalk. He tries to stop that from happening but can't, so he rushes to save a little girl from serious injury by pushing her out of the way from the falling cart and puts himself in harm's way.Eddie dies that day and goes to heaven, but it is nothing he even imagined. He is just floating in space wondering what is happening, and then he meets the first of five people who have been waiting for him to arrive. Some of the people who are waiting for him he was never aware of while he was alive and learns how his actions impacted others. He learns he was a good man, his life did have a purpose and that he was loved by many. At the end of his journey and upon meeting the fifth person Eddie is finally at peace and heaven is just the way he imaged it to be.\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\", is a beautiful story and as usual, Mitch Albom does not disappoint. He immediately grabs your attention from the first paragraph and holds it to the very end. Just like his other books, \\"Tuesday with Morey\\", \\"For One More Day' and \\"Have a Little Faith\\", \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is a touching, heartwarming story that grabs at your emotions. I was actually disappointed when I finished the book, because I had enjoyed it so much, I wanted more. To fill that disappointment I immediately picked up another one of Albom's books.I am often asked by friends and family for reading recommendations and without any hesitation this book as well as other Mitch Albom writings are always on the top of my must read list."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'm a working mom of two who was trying to find some time to read, and this was a good book to begin that challenge. Some sections are short, some longer so it was easy to pace myself and read a bit at a time or read a lot if I had the time. The story was compelling and I couldn't wait to find out who he would meet next and the lesson he'd learn. Definitely good life lessons for everyone - I liked the point about sacrifice (it's not just giving up something but giving something for someone else).I thought of a few people I'd recommend this to so they can learn some of these lessons as well ;)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have probably bought over 50 of these books to hand out to people as a short read; just as a little stocking stuffer; a thank you; a babysitter, neighbor, friend as this book touched me so much.

Get It - You'll Enjoy It and trust me - you'll be getting it as gifts too."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The last sentence of this story summarizes the author's point and purpose beautifully: that all our lives and stories are connected, and everything has a purpose, however unseen or realized. BUT, I truly disliked this book!! I felt the 'point' was so poorly executed. The stories that unfolded were so sad and unnecessarily tragic that I was distanced and disturbed instead of connected and heart-warmed. The hero's life might have not been a waste, technically, but if he was too unhappy to realize the beauty in it, then the story is a tragedy in my opinion. I was expecting something uplifting, and couldn't have been more disappointed."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a great story of a man that died and the people he met along his journey to the afterlife, who were individuals that he crossed paths with during his physical life, and reviews his physical lifetime as well.

I would stay up until about 11 or 12 o'clock reading this book. I didnt pick this book because i had to read it for english i picked it because i read it for my 10th grade english class but never finished it and i decided to finish it.

At the time of Eddie's death he is an old man with white hair working as a maintenance man in a seaside amusement park. He tends to think that his life is without meaning and that he never really did anything significant. All this changes when one day an amusement park ride malfunctions and Eddie tries to save a little girl, but ends up dying in the process.When Eddie dies, he winds up in heaven and his existence on earth is explained to him through the five people he meets. These five people all have affected Eddie's life in a substantial way, or him their life. Eddie discovers many things about his life when he converses with the five characters.I thought this book was a little short, but is still great reading material for people of all ages. The book reminds you that the little things you do each day affect other people in ways you can't even imagine and that all lives are entwined to each other. That everyone has meaning and life isn't just about getting rich or being famous."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"When I was a sophomore in high school, this was on a list of books we had to read.

I was short, but I expected it to be boring and uninteresting.Wrong. I loved this book, it honestly has changed some of my ways of thinking.

Its a feel good book and the character does not go through everything to be good enough for heaven, he goes through everything so he can see the truth in every major event in his life and seek closure from it, so he can realize that sometimes not knowing the whole truth of an event can make us feel anger, hurt, loss, and hate because it is what made sense at the time and he learned and grew as a person knowing the full account of each event. That is the most important message i got from the book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I am stunned that this book remains on the best seller list!

I'm amazed that I learned so much, and got so many lessons about why things happen for a reason, in so few pages. I walked away from this book knowing that are lives are intertwined with other people, like the Blue Man and Ruby, who are far outside our immediate circles. This book made me appreciate everything I have in my life.There are some unforgettable quotes in here:[p 78]: \\"'Strangers,' the Blue Man said, 'are just family you have yet to come to know.'\\"[p 167]: \\"All parents damage their children.

If you have such a fervent literary sweet-tooth (such as my mother) then this book is perfect for you.For myself, it's just a little much. But I've always preferred reality to the \\"Disney version\\".I did enjoy the author's style of writing, and found much of the story interesting.Hey, at the very least it makes a great \\"Mother's Day\\" present."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"An amazing book about an ordinary guy with an ordinary life.

It is a simple story that sparks deep thought of our own so called simple lives. I am a religion teacher and I plan on using this book as required reading for my students. We all at some point think our lives are small or possibly pointless but we learn at some point that our life no matter how small has in some way affected another person's life whether it be for the good or for the bad. We all need to take a step back and think how our actions affect others and vice versa. A wonderful book about mortality, love and the value of life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I will start by saying yes, this is a simple book about a very simple life. Maybe that in itself makes it seem like perhaps this should be a bore, or a trite thing, but look deeper. This book can be the story of any of us. Eddie is the star in this one, a man who needs his eyes opened to the strength of the cords that bind humanity. Not one life is lived that doesn't touch another very deeply, either in a bad or good way. Simple ideas like this have harsh critics because frankly, we want the glamour of great tragedy or utter triumph in life. But do read this book if you understand the necessity of probing our relative fragility and connectedness as human beings. It's the simplest lessons that are hardest to learn. Just ask Eddie."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In the book &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven,&quot; Mitch Albom has again proved himself to be a writer of depth and imagination.He makes the reader see how life is one big connection and why each of our lives do matter in the end.

He clearly has another best-selling book on his hands.As a former sportswriter who covered events with you, Mitch, I wish you all the best."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"There was a lot of hype over this book but when I read it I was a bit disappointed. There is a lot of hidden meaning between the lines but the story was kind of boring. The author attempts to define what his interpertation of what heaven will be like when we pass on but I feel he really falls short in keeping the reader interested. I do give the story 3 stars because there were moments that did make you think about what your own impact is on people around you while you are living.The story is okay but nothing earth shattering!!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is basically about a man named Eddie who dies. However, after he dies, he gets to meet 5 people who were a part of his life. Through these visits, you learn about Eddie's life and Eddie discovers what his purpose was. This was a real tear-jerker but it was great! I would definitely read more of Mitch Albom's work based on my experience with this book. If you like any of Nicholas Sparks' books or just inspirational/spiritual books in general, this is definitely one for you!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I'm probably the only person on the planet who has NOT read Tuesdays with Morrie yet, but I certainly plan on reading it now. I loved this book! So much so that I've recommended to others who have told me that it touched them, also. I've always known that the impact that we have on others, friend or stranger, is greater than we ever imagine, therefore, I felt quite validated by Mr. Albom's work. No matter how small you think that your gesture is, it may mean the absolute world to someone else. I liked Eddie very much. He, in a lot of ways, is an &quot;everyman.&quot; There are so many, especially in his generation, who gave up their dreams in order to fulfill familial obligations that ultimately sucked the life out of them. Despite the fact that he felt that his life had no meaning, in the end, he learned that he lived a life filled with more extraordinary meaning than he ever could have imagined while on earth. I felt that it gave new meaning to the phrase &quot;finding your way home.&quot;I could hardly put this book down. When I wasn't reading it, I wanted to be. I can honestly say that I didn't want it to end. By the last page, tears were streaming down my face. The fact that I read it several weeks ago and am still affected by it says a lot. Obviously, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is one of the most beautiful, soulful books I've read in a long time. Well-paced yet unforced, it asks, in very simple language, some of the most profound questions connected with being alive.

There were parts of this books that brought me openly to tears. I recommend this wonderful book highly!

We just don't knowit at the time.&quot;I grew to care for the main character, Eddie--a grizzled warveteran . . . he seems to be trapped into a meaningless lifeof fixing rides at a seaside amusement park; i.e., until his83rd birthday . . . it was on that day that he died in a tragicaccident, trying to save the life of a little girl from a falling cart.He awakens in the afterlife, surprised to find that it is a placewhere your earthly life is explained to you by five people whowere in it . . . these people may have been loved ones or distantstrangers, yet each of them changed your path forever.To quote the author, that is the secret of heaven: that eachaffects the other and the other affects the next, and the worldis full of stories, but the stories are all one.There were several other memorable passages; among them:He learned a few words in a few foreign languages. He learned to spita great distance. He learned the nervous cheer of a soldier's firstsurvived combat, when the men slap each other and smile as if it'sover--We can go home now!--and he learned the sinking depressionof a soldier's second combat, when he realizes the fighting does notstop at one battle, there is more and more after that.Ruby stepped toward him. &quot;Edward,&quot; she said softly. It was the firsttime she had called him by name. &quot;Learn this from me. Holding angeris a poison. It eats you from inside. We think that hating is a weaponthat attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade.And the harm we do, we do to ourselves. . . . That's because no one isborn with anger. And when we die, the soul is freed of it. But now, here,in order you move in, you must understand why you felt what you did,and why you no longer need to feel it.&quot;People say they &quot;find&quot; love, as if it were an object hidden by a rock.But love takes many forms, and it is never the some for any manand woman. What people find then is a certain love. And Eddie founda certain love with Marguerite, a grateful love, a deep but quiet love,one that he knew, above all else, was irreplaceable. Once she'd gone,he'd let the days go stale.

Really, as we're shown with the story of Eddie, not until we get to heaven. Even the \\"regular people\\" as most of us are, can make big differences in other people's lives. It was a good feeling to read this book and be reassured that even the small things that we do for others do, in the end, really make a difference.I loved this story and am ordering extra copies to give to friends and family for birthdays and Christmas."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was great, I also loved Tuesdays with Morie. This book is an easy read. I recommend this book to anyone who just wants something good to put in your head."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In The Five People You Meet in Heaven the author Mitch Albom tells his story about Eddie's journey in heaven right after his death with five lessons he learns from each five people he meets in heaven. He uses third person limited narrative to describe the thoughts and feelings of the main character, Eddie, more specifically. He mostly uses long, but not complex sentences in this story. Because the main character, Eddie is not very educated person, the author mostly doesn't use hard words for his speech. The structure of this book is very organized by five lessons from each five people Eddie meets in heaven. The author begins the story with very interesting chapter title, which is \`The End.' The story starts to tell readers about the death of Eddie, then, his new start of journey in heaven. The author divided the story into many chapters, but seven parts in a large way; his death, the first person Eddie meets in heaven, the second person, the third person, the fourth person, the fifth person, and the new start. This organization is kind of chronological, but actually it is organized by the stories Eddie hears from the five people in heaven. At the end, after he meets all five people who are important to his life before the death, finally he enters to the real heaven happily with his wife who is already dead. This structure the author uses helps the readers to make big pictures of the story.There are lots of people who don't have confidence about their lives. An 83-year-old man, Eddie also thinks his life is inspired and not special to anyone, even himself. However, after his death, he goes to heaven and learns five important things about the importance of acting carefully, sacrifice, releasing anger, love and his job. Finally, Eddie realizes that his past life was important to other people, and he becomes proud of his life that has not been a waste. The author tells readers through Eddie's journey that the lives we are living are not meaningless, but important to other people, especially ourselves. Actually, I also sometimes think that my life would be just a small part of the world that nobody would care of. However, after I read this book, I thought again about the importance of my life. I realized that my life could be important to other people, not only my family or myself, even though I don't even know whom I am affected by or who I affect. Also, I realized that all the people in the world is connected, so we gets and gives effects to each other. Therefore, I think that everyone in the world should realize the importance of our lives and live the best lives with a lot of confidence that would make big difference in the communities. I want to recommend this book to many other people, because this book encourages readers that their lives are not meaningless, but important as a part of the world. Therefore, I want to recommend this book especially to people who are stressed about future life and get tired about inspired living pattern. This book would be able to give them great effects to their thoughts about their lives."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is not only a detailed journey through life and the afterlife, but a story that provides deeper meanings to what life is all about. This book was so vividly written that I pictured myself standing with Talla in the river or talking in the tree with the Captain. Also, it provided many life lessons without the forcing of a religion or beliefs in God or other higher forms of power. Although it can be read in one sitting, it is very well a must read that gets you thinking about life and what it means to you. It also doesn't ruin other ideas of heaven, but provides the author's idea of what a heaven could be like. This story is something that all people should read,whether they believe in a higher power or not. It it an uplifting and well written book that deserves the best seller it was awarded!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" was an outstanding novel. It was one of those books that as soon as you start reading, you could never put it down. It was beautifully written with much underlying meaning and thought-provoking comments. Although, at the end it did leave me with many unanswered questions, it was still an incredible experience. The characters were so believable and descriptive that I could imagine myself standing right next to them, sharing the journey. You don't need to be religous to fall in love with this story, either. Albom does an excellent job of entertaining without \\"shoving a religion down your throat.\\" This is the kind of novel that you can pick up and read over and over again, the kind that will make you smile at a bittersweet memories along the way, gasp during all the right places, and sigh with sadness and disapointment. This is the kind of story that grabs you by the hands, mind, and heart and carries you through the experience, dropping you softly off after the last, meaningful sentence to contemplate your own life, your own meanings, and your affect on others. This is the novel that everyone needs to read, to make us remember that we are a family, all connected, all related, all together in this life. The Five People You Meet in Heaven is that one book that you will always turn back to in your lifetime and when someone mentions the name of it, your eyes light up and you will remember the experience."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I believe that The Five People You Meet in Heaven was a very insightful book, and I am sure that there are many that would agree with me. I think that it was very well written, and that Mitch Albom gets his point through very well. This book highlights the important points of life.... rather, the five lessons of life. Each person that he meets in Heaven teaches him a lesson: The blue man taught Eddie that there is no random act that means nothing, and that no life is a waste. His captain teaches Eddie that sacrifice is an inevitable part of life and it is something to aspire, not regret. Mrs. Ruby teaches him that that holding anger is a poison that harms both ones, and thus he should forgive his father. His wife, Margarita, teaches him that that lost love is still love, but it takes a different form. Finally, the girl whom he burned, Tala, teaches him that his life was important and that no life is a waste.All in all, I think that The Five People You Meet in Heaven was an awesome book, which touches the human soul and leaves you pondering the after life. Mitch Albom's writing style made it feel like Eddie, a fictional character, was in fact real and this added to the story portraying a \\"realistic\\" sense of Albom's idea of heaven. It does not take very long to read through this book, experienced readers might even finish it in a day if they set some time apart, but this does not hinder the quality of the book. This book is very meaningful and makes you rethink the importance of your life and it might convince those who think that they do not mean much in the great scheme of things to change their minds and see what an effect they could make. Overall, I recommend this book to anybody who is looking for direction in life or those who find life meaningless, or just any reader who is looking for a good book to read; I thoroughly enjoyed Mitch Albom's novel, The Five People You Meet in Heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was first introduced to this book when I was required to choose to read a book for school. I had to choose from a selection of about ten books and I was immediately drawn to this book based on the title alone. This book provokes thought and is heart felt. It is poignant and has touched my life and the lives of others in many ways.The story is about an ordinary man who lived a humdrum, prosaic life, but upon his arrival in heaven he is able to find his life was worth so much more. Until he met the five people he did not understand the reason he was on Earth. Eddie was able to forgive the people in his life that have passed away and be forgiven. Each person Eddie met in heaven was like another story in itself. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to all."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After reading the Five People You Meet in Heaven it made me ponder what Heaven is really like. Its fun to think about who the people I'd meet if Mitch Albom's portrayed version of Heaven is accurate. Over all this novel was entertaining and somewhat thrilling at times. Even though this book was overall a well written story with several intense scenes, I had trouble staying interested throughout my entire time reading the story. In general I believe this novel is somewhat overrated and didn't keep me at the edge of my seat, wondering what might happen next; hence only three stars. Overall the Five People You Meet in Heaven is a novel that lifted my spirits and left me content in my thoughts."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really enjoyed Mitch Alboms \\"The Five People you meet in Heaven\\". The book was fairly easy reading, and kept me interested from the first page to the last. Eddie's venture through heaven is not what I had expected, and the people he met were such significant characters. The story is truly heartwarming and it is almost impossible to put the book down. The People he met in heaven all tought him a lesson that can only be learned through actual life. I highly recommend this book and found it as one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I really enjoyed reading the Five People You Meet in Heaven. This book was very interesting as well as entertaining. The book begins at the end of Eddie's life and takes you through his journey of heaven. Eddy believes that his life was unmeaningful and unimportant,but through his journey he learns how his life affected others and why he was important. This is a fairly simplistic book to read, but it has a powerful message.

It is really moving."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in HeavenThis is another Five Star Book by Mitch Albom. I have had the pleasure of reading several of his books, and find each and every one that I have read to be very enjoyable, well written, and makes me envious of his writing talent. This is enjoyable light reading, with surprises, laughs and tears along the journey taken by the main character of the story."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Albom's allegory of life, death, purpose, and meaning is a bit schmaltzy at times, often genuinely moving, and thought-provoking throughout. A small, quiet parable that can't fully embrace the sheer vastness of its subject, but kindly lends the reader a few more pieces of the puzzle."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven was a very touching story. This was my favorite book ever. It is a great book for the young and old. The movie is also great,too!

Overall, the best!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had heard a lot of this book before I ordered it. I must say that this book exceeded my expectations. Mitch Albom writes in such a way that it makes you want to call into work sick so that you can finish the book. What an awesome read!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This novel impresses me in many ways. The story is great, the way it's told is imaginative, the characters seem real, and the writing is wonderful. The simple style matches the simple man who is the main character and somehow makes the story more powerful and touching. Can't predict the future, but I'd say The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a permanent fixture in my favorite novels list."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought this book was a good read. In the beginning it talk about how he was going to die and I didn't stop reading until I found out how. It was also suspensful be cause it didn't tell whether or not he saved the girl, so I kept reading to find out if the first person told him. The second, the third, the fourth, and finally the fith old me. I also kept reading to see what the next persons life had to do with his. This book could be a very good and interesting read depending on what you like in books. If you like fiction books I highly recomend this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book.

It reminded mevery much of the movie A Wonderful Life with Jimmie Stewart.The first book I've read by this author, now I'll have to read&quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot;:)All the books I've been reading strike a chord with me, but thisone, I felt that I could have been the main character. I feltsuch a close relationship to the subject matter.Eddie is a carnival repairman, and the story begins with hisdeath. He feels his life was nothing, but he meets five very surprising people who show him otherwise. Some of these people he didn't even know existed.This was a very quick read, and one that I'd recommend to everyone. This reviewer rates it a five, because it's as good asit gets:)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"i passed over this book many times, simply b/c i didn't want to read a &quot;preachy&quot; &quot;self-help&quot; type book...but, then someone lent it to me, and i tried...i am so glad i read this book. the title is misleading. it's really about the 5 people eddie meets in heaven. i really enjoyed the story. it was a quick, easy read, but invoked a lot of thought. also, i was glad to see a story in which amusement park workers are portrayed positively."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is a gem.Like all great stories it has metaphors we can associate with the realities of our lives. There are five such metaphors in Albom's story that touch upon ignorance, hate, resentment, longing, and guilt.So, what's the lesson?A great story must be able to give a perspective about life to better it. Five People, five lessons, five emotions, five perspectives, like the glistening facets of a gem, all intertwined and related to one another ending up in a needless trap we call worrying. Events in our lives happen for a reason, though not always good. But what makes us worry is not the bad outcome, rather lack of understanding why.There is salvation in knowledge. While I'm telling you this, Albom is showing it in his story The Five People You Meet in Heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"None of us are sure what happens after we die, and we often wonder if what we did in life had any meaning. The author presents a fantastic tale that gives purpose to the seemingly meaningless events in one mans life, and how the character positively affected others. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was a great book! I just finished it today. It was very touching and very inspiring. I've read the other reviews here, and the only thing that I can agree upon with the bad reviews is that the book was short, but that's part of it's allure!!! It was to the point and while reading it, you were never sitting there thinking....I wonder what's next, because I'm absolutely bored...that was NEVER a thought I had while reading this book. The writing was excellent and I believe that anyone could relate to this story! Thanks Mitch Albom, and I thank your Uncle Eddie!!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I wasn't a fan of Tuesdays With Morrie because all the &quot;amazing&quot; insights Morrie shared were things I'd been taught from childhood. And although the idea that other lives affect ours, and vice versa, is not new, this book was nevertheless thought provoking. It was a warm, peace-inducing book. I particularly enjoyed Mitch Albom's ability to infuse the characters with a realism most books are devoid of. Eddie, the main character, had a seemingly sad, pitiable life. At the end Mitch Albom prompts insights regarding what has been displayed as the less-than-average life of his main character. This is a feel-good book during a not so feel-good time in the world. I'm a grateful recipient of Mr. Albom's simple, insightful, charming story."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was pretty pumped to read this book. I thought it was going to be deep and insightful.It was not so deep. As a matter of fact I found that the main character, Eddie, was underdeveloped and not all that likeable.Okay, he didn't have to be likeable, but he should have been sympathetic and I felt very little for this character. I really wanted to like the guy, but I didn't get to know him well enough to feel much for him.I did like the consistancy of the story as far as giving us reference points like birthdays to work from and I liked the basic theme of the book. The theme is one of a continuous journey where you find out in heaven how you impacted others while you were on earth. Just as an aside, I found the situations in &amp;amp;quot;heaven&amp;amp;quot; a bit more uncomfortable than I would hope heaven would be."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought this was an exceptionly enjoyable book. Light and easy reading yet really give you something to think about and ponder on. I found it to be uplifting!! I guess it really is a small world after all... you will know what I mean when you read this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was a well thought-of book.

It was very touching and a quick but pleasant read. I would highly recommend it to anyone but particularly to someone who might be experiencing tough times in life, as I think this book could help to make someone feel better in that instance."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This story gives you a different perspective of looking at the after-life.I love how Mitch Albom wrote this wonderful story. Not only is this a feel-good book, but it will make you think about life; how you've changed or helped a life you may not have a clue about; how certain people are put into your life for a reason, some you know, some you don't, some came before your time but ultimately shaped it for your future.I recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a book to get lost in, make you think, and leave your life a little better because of reading it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is a short, and I feel unrealistic view of the Biblical Heaven. The story is told through the life of Eddie, an old man who feels like he didn't do anything worthwhile with his life. As the title suggest, Eddie meets five people in Heaven, and each has a lesson for him to learn based on what happened on Earth.I was a bit torn on the rating for this book. On one hand, Eddie cannot do anything more to change his life -- he's dead, in Heaven, and this is supposed to be his time for understanding. On the other hand, I guess I'm supposed to glean things from Eddie's stories and apply them to my life for this book to have significance.The biggest reason I rated the book down is I don't feel Albom paints a realistic view of Heaven. I don't think it is going to be about me, although the idea of understanding everything is appealing. I think Heaven is going to be about being the presence of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. 1 Corinthians 2:9 \\"However, as it is written: \`No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him'\\" (NIV)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"this is NOT a sequel to Tuesdays With Morrie as some people seem to think. its not a book with fast pace action. if you cant read a book that deals with emotions, love, happiness, sadness and all that is part of a human life, dont read this book.this book describes a view of heaven, not your typical view of it but an idea of what it could be like. the author captures the emotions and feelings in a beautiful way. in a way that makes your jaw drop, in a way that makes your stare in amazement, makes you smile, and in way that brings tears to your eyes."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a poorly-written excuse of a book. I am astonished at the 5 star reviews and comments about this book changing lives. All I can say is that these readers have been so taken by all the hype for this awful tome that they can't see past their own noses! Either that or they don't have a clue as to what life is all about and have to cling to such a terrible book. The war scenes are pathetic and the heaven scenes cloying. I read where this book got a half-million dollars of hype and of course the author has been all over the talk shows. That's the only reason this book is being read at all. Save your money and don't be taken for a fool."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Sorry, but this is the sappiest, most insipid book I've read in a long time (and I read 50 books a year).

Wrong-o.Save your money and your time. Use it to do some good in the world."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The quality of writing in this novel is sophomoric and it shows in the dialogue and the descriptive text.

Finally got a copy of the book, and sat down this morning to read it. 3 hours later I was crying big tears and yet smiling at the same time. You get so caught up in the story that you just keep reading, mindless of the time and place. The story is up-lifting, it is poignant. We do make a difference in the lives of others, some we know, some we met just in passing. It reminds me of the saying about people may not remember your name but they will remember how you made them feel.

The story begins with Eddie's eight-third birthday but ironically it turns out to be the last of his days. The first chapter counts down the last hour of his mortal existence as Eddie progresses through his day as the maintenance support for the rides at Ruby Pier amusement park. Eddie is a blue-collar worker with a simple demeanor. It is only after Eddie's death that the reader begins to learn his history that leads him to his position at Ruby Pier. The details of Eddie's life are dispersed throughout the entire book as he meets the five most influential people in his life. Each character represents a different stage of his life. Significant parts of his life are disclosed during each encounter.The story entails two major conflicts both of which involve Eddie. The first of the conflicts is between him and his father. Eddie's father is portrayed as the antagonist of the story. His father's abusive treatment and neglectful approach towards Eddie leaves him residual feelings of resentment. Additionally, Eddie struggles with an internal conflict about what he has done with his life. He is less than please that he has ended up working at Ruby Pier like his father whom he harbors hatred for. He also dissatisfied that he ends up back at home feeling as if his life has no purpose. The climax comes when Eddie is confronted by the fifth and final character that is a little girl by the name of Tala.His existence appears to be routine and lacks significant purpose. The resolution comes to light during his encounter with Tala. Tala enlightens Eddie that his position at Ruby Pier was much greater than he had thought. Eddie is plagued with thoughts of a pointless life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I saw the movie to this book about 6 years ago and always wanted to read the book!

The present situation takes the reader through Eddie's death, funeral, and afterwards, third-narrative flashbacks reveal Eddie's past, and heaven is the bulk of the story, where Eddie meets five people with information crucial to his life.The story opens with counting down Eddie's final minutes, as he goes about his daily work routine. \\"Thirty-four minutes to live. Eddie lifted the lap bar, gave each boy a sucking candy, retrieved his cane, then limped to the maintenance shop to cool down from the summer heat. Had he known his death was imminent, he might have gone somewhere else. Instead, he did what we all do. He went about his dull routine as if all the days in the world were still to come.\\" From start to finish, the book remains interesting and is written with great simplicity.After he dies, Eddie starts his new beginning in heaven where he instantly feels like a child again and is able to run for the first time since before WWII.He discovers that heaven is not a place of beauty and serenity; it is a time for grasping the essence of his 83 years.Meanwhile, Ruby Pier, where Eddie had worked for over fifty years, closes for three days and his co-workers are forced to deal with his absence while parents are compelled to tell their children why the kind \\"Eddie Maintenance,\\" as they liked to call him, will not be fixing rides or making them balloons during his breaks any longer. Eddie never truly knew how much he was loved and would be missed.The five people Eddie meets had all once been in his life, even if only for a moment, and each have a lesson to teach him.One after another, they guide Eddie through his life and show him unsuspected connections and reasons to never before answered questions.By the end of the story when Eddie has met his five people, he has learned that his life had been filled with purpose, even though at times he had considered himself to be a waste for never finding a more honorable field of work and he also finds out if his last act of saving the little girl ended in triumph or catastrophe.The Five People You Meet in Heaven tells Eddie's story in an imaginative way that forces you to think about your own life. The story suggests that heaven is not a destination; it is merely a place where five certain people who impacted your life help you in understanding your past on earth and your new beginning in heaven.For both those who believe in the afterlife and those who do not, The Five People You Meet in Heaven gives you an inspirational glance at an innovative possibility for life after death, and will leave you pondering over who your five people would be."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thought that both of Mitch Albom's novels, Tuesdays With Morrie and The Five People You Meet in Heaven were written extremely well. Both were touching stories, which describe life moving onto death. Morrie was the main character in Tuesdays with Morrie, who gave an enlightenment to death. A true storie, Morrie is diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease), a virus that slowly takes over your body, starting with your feet. Mitch Albom was Morrie's college student, who took many of Morrie's courses on &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; and eventually reconnects with Morrie. The two were out of touch for a while, but Mitch decides to commute from Detroit to Boston every Tuesday, &quot;always their day&quot;, to talk with Morrie about life. Morrie has gains many fans along with fanmail and is now a very bust person. When Mitch comes, he records their sessions. Morrie dies later and Mitch gathers all of his notes and audiotapes to write his book that Morrie titled while still living, &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot;.I really enjoyed this book because there were many lessons and theories that Morrie told Mitch that should be learned. For example, &quot;Here's what I mean by building your own subculture...The little things, I can obey. But the big things--how we think, what we value--those you must choose yourself. You can't let anyone--or any society--determine those for you.&quot; Morrie is an inspirational character with a heart of gold, and a powerful mind. He gives up many things in the course of his death, but does not complain at all. Morrie gets to the point where he can't move his arms, eat food, and even breath on his own, but he still takes everything in with a positive attitude. Mitch's perspective of life is drastically changed when he reunites with Morrie. He realizes that he really doesn't lkike where his life is going right now, and Morrie helps him change for the better. Morrie is very motivating person and has many great lessons to be shared.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a fictional story about a man named Eddie. The novel starts out with the ending. Thatis, the ending of Eddie's life. It is Eddie's last hour alive, yet he doesn't know it. Eddie works as a maintenance man at Ruby Pier, an oceanside amusement park. He is in his early eighties and dies in a tragic accident: trying to save a little girl from a broken ride, and the ride crushes him. Eddie wakes up in Heaven and is told that he will meet five people there, they might be a complete stanger to him, or a very familiar person, but every one had an impact on his life. The first person he meets is a blue man. Eddie learns that he actually killed this man (indirectly and unknowingly) on accident as a little boy. The next person Eddie sees is his Captain from the Vietnam War. Here, Eddie discovers that one night in the Phillipines, when he and his group were POW's and they escape, Captain shot Eddie. This was because as the men were escaping, Eddie was in a trance, walking into a fire. Eddie's captain shot his leg in a final effort to stop him, which saved Eddie's life. Eddie never knew how he got shot, because he was unconsious for several days. Captain tells him that he shot him and why. Eddie is very confused, but then calms down and Captain disappears. The reason why Eddie is so mad is that his leg was permanently damaged, and he couldn't do many things afterward.When Eddie started off in heaven, he was a little boy: young, active, and free of pain, but as he meets these five people, he grows older, and has more pain, and relives events of his life.The third person Eddie meets is an older woman named Ruby. She walks out of a diner where Eddie's dad is and she starts talking to him. Eddie had never met her before, she was never a part of his generation. The purpose of Eddie meeting her is so he can get a better understanding of his father. Eddie's father was a maintenance man at Ruby Pier before Eddie, and Ruby is the person Ruby Pier was named after. She shows him stories about his father, showing his kind and loyal side. Eddie had not talked to his father for years before he died and finally gained more of an understanding of him.The two other people Eddie meets in Heaven are his wife, who died at the young age of fourty-seven, and a little girl from the Phillipines. This girl was the person he saw in the fire, while his troop was escaping and Eddie was in a trance. When Eddie was shot, he never got to save Tala. She was burned to death and in Heaven, she lets Eddie know what really happened. Now that Eddie has met his five people, he is cleansed and can move on in the afterlife.Although I really enjoyed both books, they are both MUST-READS, I enjoyed The Five People You Meet in Heaven a little more. I think that it was a very creative concept, an author talking about something he had never experienced, making everything up completely. It was very interesting reading about a character's life and afterlife in a different perspective. Most people imagine Heaven as a beautiful garden or clouds with angels, but Mitch Albom gave a totally different description of Heaven. I like that a person can take a completely imagined, but stereotyped, place and give it a different feeling to make people think. The author's theme is that you must be able to release all anger, understand why we ever felt it, and why we no longer need to feel it. This is how we cleanse ourselves when we get to Heaven, and how we move on into the afterlife. It was very well-written and deserves five stars for such a brilliant theory."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was not only a quick and enjoyable read, but reminded me of some of life's most important lessons which are too often overlooked. I highly recommend this book if you're looking for a feel-good read which might provoke more than a little subsequent quiet introspection."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I received this book, shocked by how short it was. I read it in under two hours, gripped by the concept Mitch Albom had about what heaven might be like. I hope he's right, because this is a beautiful idea of a possible afterlife. I would accept death peacefully, instead of fearing it, if Albom's theory turned out to be precise.This is the story of an elderly man's journey through his first step in heaven. He learned many lessons taught by people who had effected his life in various ways and had passed away before he had. I feel like I was lucky to learn the same lessons he learned, almost as if this book was a gift from God himself. I don't typically read self-help or spiritual books, and I wouldn't place this novel in either category. It is purely fictional, and introduces a very unique question that grabs both you and the elderly man. This question isn't answered until the end. Many times I wanted to read the last few pages to get the answer to the question, but I felt like I would have cheated myself and the knowledge that I gained by reading every page and not skipping to the end.It is a light book, not filled with deep thoughts or throbbing feeling. I'm also not a serious reader, usually chick literature and comedic nonfiction are all that I indulge in. This was recommended to me by a friend who teaches Psychology at Columbia University. I have to thank her, for now I will always immediately take her advice on any book, despite my initial hesitance."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven was a wonderful book. This book was a book about a man who thought his life was worthless. He worked at an amusement park. Eddie would walk around the park, making sure that all of the carts were secure on the rides. One day, this day being his last birthday, Eddie was killed by saving a girl's life from a falling cart. Eddie went to heaven. In heaven he met five people, that changed his life. This book makes you think about making an impact on other people's lives. The Five People You Meet In Heaven was a touching book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book in an afternoon. I enjoyed it a lot. It made you think about our role here in life, our reason for being, and how we impact others...quite insightful. I grew up in a town a few blocks from an amusement pier, so for me, the descriptions of that brought back memories. Good character development. If you lost a husband or wife lately, you may find some comfort in this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was a fantastic read.

Not usually the type of thing I read at all, and I really thought it would be extremely religious oriented. I'm not sure why I bothered with it, but I'm very glad I did. You will not find anything preachy about it at all. This is an amazing story about how 6 people impacted the lives of others. From those he didn't know to those he knew only too well. It's a lesson on how we impact others, even when we're not aware of their existence or our crossing with it. I only just recently read it and I want to read it again already. It really makes you think about how you may have impacted others and who are the five people you would meet in the afterlife. I think this really transcends a specific religion and can be applied to most afterlife scenarios.This is the second book I've read by this author and I think the reason I \\"bothered\\" with this book was because I had read one of the author's others. Whatever influence me to give this very unlikely read (for me) a chance, I'm extremely glad I did."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this beautifully written book. It is so worth your time reading. You leave the last page with moist eyes and the feeling you have been given a gift.

A quick read and enjoyable one, much better then I thought it was going to be."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Had the star scale been given in 1/2 increments, I perhaps would have put 3 1/2, but I thought it over and left it at 4 as opposed to 3. If you pick up this book expecting the same wealth of simple yet poetic wisdom from &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie,&quot; you might be dissapointed, as the fruits of this book are more focused on the life of one person, rather than being relative to the any or all readers. However, ignoring the judgements based on comparisons, this was certainly delightful to read, and still leaves a lesson or two for us to come back to. Heaven has been a subject that human beings have explored over and over, and through the general media's perception, perhaps has been done to death with &quot;clouds up in the sky&quot; mindset. Every once a while though, films, books, and other tangible facets of the human imagination give us a new perspective of paradise, or reinvented a traditional view. Albom accomplishes both. The people that have passed on before us are there to meet us in heaven, but here's the catch: they're not who you expected. Giving anything more would spoil it, so I'll leave it at that, plotwise. An easy, smooth read, this book will take little time to finish, perhaps as little as an hour or more, but will still leave you thinking about Heaven, as well as your life on earth, in a different way."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I fell in love with Tuesdays With Morrie and knew that I was going to enjoy reading Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet In Heaven. The book is an easy read, read the entire thing in two days- I couldn't put it down. The book really makes you think about your life, and also gives you an interesting perspective on what happens to you after death. I recommended the book to my grandmother who said after reading it that it changed her life. Anyone who enjoys a feel-good book needs to read The Five People You Meet In Heaven."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is one you can read over and over. A great gift to uplift the spirits and show you what life is all about."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved reading this book, and I hated reading this book. I loved it because the story is compelling, thought-provoking, inspiring, interesting, sad and funny. I hated reading it because it only reminded me word-by-word that I'll never compare to Albom's mastery of the written word. His main character is Eddie, and yet, at the same time, the main character is you, the reader. You needn't believe in God to enjoy this book, you need only be a person who's wondered what's next. This book doesn't give a definitive answer, of course, but it certainly gets you thinking... or should I say, musing. Yes, musing is a much better word, and you'll spend plenty of time doing just that. \\"Wonder what...\\" and \\"What if...\\" are contemplated in this book of beginnings and endings, and, as Albom so eloquently put it, \\"understanding your yesterdays.\\" Brava on this, Albom's finest work to date, which says quite a bit since he's written some doozies already. Further, it only took a few hours to read, which allowed me the luxury of diving head-first into a good book, and still having supper done on time."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book one Sat morning at my sister's house and couldn't put it down. It took me three hours, and although I was getting hungry for lunch, I couldn't put it down. It was awesome! I cried and smiled through the book! How many people do you meet in this world who are bitter about their life and their purpose? This book helps you believe everyone has a purpose on this planet... even those who think their life isn't worth anything... even those who think their life could have been different. I bought and recommended this book to everyone I know. Mitch Albom did such a wonderful job bringing you from the present to the past to the future. All I can say was it was awesome and a wonderful read. Keep the tissue box nearby!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I would have to say that this novel was pretty good overall. I think that I expected a little more plotwise than it delivered. The writing style definitely kept my attention which made it read very well. At no point did the book drag on and on as some do. Albom uses great description and paints a wonderful picture of the books main character, Eddie. This is the first one of Albom's book sthat I have read but I have to admit that it did leave me with a warm, fuzzy feeling. I would recommend this to a friend. It was sort of like It's A WOnderful Life pacled into a 200 page small book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is awesome! It was a nice break from the normal fiction. However, it is so believable or you want to believe. I felt sorry for the character Eddie though. He did not have any self esteem and thought his life was useless. I instantly liked the stories of each of the person who he met the first time and what his role played in Eddie's life. Until the next person then I liked them the best...until the next one...until the next one...I highly recommend this book for anyone that has a question about the purpose of their life on earth and what hopefully will be a change in their outlook on the now and later."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I enjoyed the book although the enjoyment came more from reflecting on those people who have had an impact on my life. It's a good discussion starter and it makes me appreciate the everyday people that come into and out of my life. I also enjoyed Silent Witnesses in the Gospels by Allan Wright, he highlights the people in the Gospels who make a difference without saying a word, that book really made me think."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Beautiful. Reminds us that we are not alone and are exactly where we are meant to be in this fast, lonely, never-perfect, dog-eat-dog world. I only wish he reviewed his Tagalog.

It was rather distracting."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. The plot is wonderful, and Albom really makes you wonder and even hope that what happens to Eddie will happen to you. I could not put this book down and have recommended it to everyone I know!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I rushed out to buy this book when I heard about it and read it in two days. While the twist at the end was interesting, the book was a big letdowns from the reviews and the hype."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If your life is miserable and you think that reading about a yet more miserable life would make you feel better; than maybe you might enjoy this book. I first felt attracted to this book by the title, thinking that a direct approach to whatever happens when one dies could be interesting. Wrong. This book made me feel depressed from the start and it just got worse and worse. It describes the life of the main character in a patchwork of bad recollections; cheap spiritual advice is then thrown in, all against a background of fantastic descriptions of heaven's scenery. Instead of inspiration the main character's life just gave me a depressing example. Of course many people don't have much of a choice but shouldn't one try to make his life better and happier instead of enduring it bitterly 'til the end?? What does the author inspire us to do? Follow a sad path with patience and get rewarded with a stupid explanation of what it meant in the end?? Please... The main character's apathy is frustrating. Ok, lead an honest life but DO take control and please try and enjoy it!Moreover, the good part of this book's message could have been written in 5 pages, the rest is a waste of paper."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"And I bet given the title, this guy made a lot of money...What a gimmick..."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The entire book felt contrived to create a certain emotional effect in the reader. Full of cliches."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is an overly cute book. It literally reeks of saccharine. It is poorly written and reads like a rip-off of other, better books dealing with spirituality.This a huge disappointment since Mitch Albom was the author of the wonderful Tuesdays With Morrie."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Gloomy, maudlin, depressing. A book with no redeeming qualities."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"But that's really about all it is. Depressing, emotionally empty, self imposed guilt is what the main character, Eddy tries to come to terms with. But in Eddy's heaven, there are five strange people. That's all. Five people (one of whom is blue, one is a very angry GI from World War 2) who serve only to reinforce Eddy's emptiness until all of a sudden, Eddy finds 'satisfaction' in knowing that his meaningless life had meaning to someone else. And the meaning Eddy found was totally focused on the past-the life he just left. So the underlying point of the book subtly implies that the point of heaven is to put relevance to our lives here.In otherwords, Heaven is nothing more than an extended session to try to find meaning to this life. Sorry folks, if you can't find meaning or purpose of life on earth, you ain't going to find it in Heaven either.I found out, from the Very Reliable Source, that the purpose of life here on Earth is to put the perspective on the meaningfulness of Heaven. This book just reminds me of how so often we want to put Heaven on our own terms."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"First of all, life is preachy. From lessons in school, to lessons in life, to lifes often painful lessons, it is all preachy.Didn't like the book? Who cares if you did?I did. I took a lesson away from it and that made me a better person. If you go through life and do learn something on a daily basis then you are either dead or brain dead.Mr. Albom writes a simple book filled with insight that most would understand and appreciate except those that are too cynical to understand those insights.This book should replace most of the self help books on your shelves.Really, read it and become more human. It couldn't hurt."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie it ain't, but it is cleverly marketed to look like it. The jist of the book is that heaven is a place where your life is explained to you by five pivotal people in your life. The author flashes back and forth between the past, present, and hereafter too quickly for the story to be imbued with any meaningfulness--it was pretty banal from beginning to end. Halfway through I just wanted to put the book down and not take it up again, but I forced myself to finish only b/c it is a short book. (Incidentally, the war scenes in the book are not believable.)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. The story was so imaginative.

And afternoon well spent."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The plot of The Five People You Meet in Heaven (Albom, 2003) is revealed through the journey of a bitter and resentful 83 year old war veteran, Eddie, after an unexpected death. He enters heaven meeting five people along the way, while searching to find redemption of knowing if he saved a young girl in his final act on earth. Eddie views his life as meaningless and worth nothing as maintenance man of an amusement park, and battles these internal conflicts of self worth and life purpose. In his journey through meeting five people in heaven Eddie finds the importance of connections with people, unveils the reality of his earthly perceptions and understands the genuine meaning of his life.Eddie's internal conflict of feeling trapped in a meaningless life by carrying resentment towards people and events in his life are revealed throughout his journey. In meeting each of the five people, he identifies how connections to all people we encounter in our life, are important for things to happen as they are suppose to. Those people who are here before we exist; those who we meet at random, and those who we are tied to for life are all there for a reason, though \\"You may have not known the reason at the time\\" (Albom, 2003, p. 35).In meeting each person Eddie learns lessons; a lesson in death and life, \\"one withers, one grows\\" (Albom, 2003, p. 49), the lesson of accepting sacrifice as \\"something to aspire to\\" (Albom, 2003, p. 93), he learns forgiveness, that love doesn't stop and that every life has a purpose. With each lesson one of the five people he meets divulges the experiences and people Eddie perceives so negatively in life from an unseen angle of the same story (Albom, 2003, p.44). As the reality of his perceptions are received and learned, Eddie continues to inquire about his final act on earth, searching for the answer so he may find some redemption for his life.The only memory Eddie has in his final act on earth is jumping to save the little girl, but then all going dark, he can only feel the two small hands on his own. In meeting the unexpected fifth person along his journey, the reality of his life experiences surface with a crescendo of emotions that support Eddie's internal conflict fueled by the judgmental perceptions of his life. Eddie washes away the pain and sorrow these conflicts have caused in his life as he interacts with the final person on his journey. He not only learns the answer to his final act on earth but finds the reason and meaningfulness of his life \\"Is where you were supposed to be\\" (Albom, 2003, p. 191).Albom presents a powerful plot through Eddie's journey to heaven and flashback presentation of experiences in life, lifting the reader through the intensity of his internal conflicts, and the release of his pain in finding the answers to which he seeks. He portrays Eddie's life and his journey through the connections with the five people he meets, and experiences the story of his life from their view rather than his perception, in order to heal and resolve his internal conflicts through finding and understanding the meaning of his life. It invites the reader to contemplate his own life experiences as he walks through the journey with Eddie.&#8195;Reference:Albom, M. (2003). The Five People you Meet in Heaven.

I check out the book from the library to read to my son. This was a way to help developed his comprehension skills. Turn out, we both look forward each day reading the book to learn more of the adventure the main character endure. I would only read limited chapters during the school week, and more during the weekend. Later, we viewed a dvd movie version of the book. It was good; however, the book was better."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought this book because the title intrigued me. I recommend it because it was not only entertaining, it made me think. This book may challenge you to rethink what you belive about life after death - and before it. What have you done in your life that has been important to someone, that has touched someone, or hurt someone - without you even being aware. How has that shaped your life, or theirs?When it is all said and done, our perception of our life and it's worth may be very different from the five people we meet.

After reading Morrie I didn't believe I could be touched so deeply, I was wrong. The five people were so real to me and changed my philosophy on how to live life. Doing that which our heart desires, we give back to others in such special ways that we don't even realize we are doing it.I bought so many copies of the book for friends I may go broke and love every minute of it! Thanks Mitch for touching my life again with your wonderful writing."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have never read Tuesday's with Morrie nor have I ever written anything by this author. I picked up this book becasue the title caught my eye in the bookstore. As a person who has a family member who is sick, and as someone who has a life threatening disease myself, I decided to give it a whirl. I have to say I am glad I did.I am not sure what is waiting for me after this life, or even if there is an afterlife. But, reading this book made me think. Not about who I will see but will I be someone's person that they meet. The simple and straight forward style of the book makes it an easy read, but one that leaves a lot up to the reader to understand. As someone who is married and who has gone through times that have left me changed (granted not a war but dificult times just the same) I was able to put myself in Eddie's place.I think that we all look for ways to break out of what it appears our rolls are in life. Eddie found out that his roll was exactly what he did. He couldn't get away from it. I also found it quite compelling that Eddie wanted to have his wife back in her later form, not the form she appears in. Makes me wonder, how will I look in heaven? Do I get to choose?All in all, a good book. One that will have a prominent place in my collection, my mind, and my heart."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Outstanding book!

Once I started reading it, I couldnt put it down! I finished it in 4 days!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I bought this book with great expectations. It was on the N.Y. Times best seller list and had much popular support. It's the closest to formula fiction I've come across in a long time. The premise of the story doesn't work from the beginning--an 83 year old man with a bum leg doesn't work at an amusement part checking the rides! The structure of the book is a formula throughout--man dies, goes to heaven, sees different colors, and a new person appears with lame advice and a really lame piece of philosophy. To say I was disappointed is an understatement!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have to start writing books. I felt so cheated out of my hard earned money after reading Tuesdays with Morrie that I had to be convinced by a friend to read this new opus.It is clear that this book is the depiction of the most gooey, demagogical pop culture new agey philosophy of the author.It is not worth the paper it is written on and people could save time and money by doing something that would achieve the same results. Watch Oprah. But of course, most of the readers already watch Oprah."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I couldn't take Mitch Ablom's previous book seriously after Morrie went at great length about how great it was raising his kids and ol' tin-ear then asked him if he'd do it again. My wife and I roared at that, but we both kind of liked this book, having (need I say) received it as a gift and succumbed to the temptation to read it and perhaps find ourselves mistaken in our initial assessment of the author. I'm not sure we've come around, but this was a pleasant enough book to read, with an epigram I'll always remember and one of the sweetest moments imaginable near the end. What more can you ask from a book?Mitch works very hard. James Joyce and Immanuel Kant work hard at their writing, too, but with them it seems appropriate to the material. Here it does not. When I call this Adult Fantasy, I don't mean Teen Fantasy (battles, scantily clad women), or Science Fiction. Call it Meaning-of-Life Fantasy. It's a tricky genre, these slim volumes. The paragon for me is Og Mandino's The Greatest Salesman in the World. He makes it look easy! Yet even he fails in most of his other attempts. (I think I've read them all, and Mission: Success! is the only other real gem.) Mandino's masterpiece is about positive attitude, and it is legendary in the world of sales.The sentence I love in Mitch's book is: \\"Parents rarely let go of their children, so children let go of them.\\"Another aphorism isn't bad: \\"Eddie admitted that some of his life he'd spent hiding from God, and the rest of the time he thought he went unnoticed.\\"This one I would call \\"average\\": \\"Strangers are family you have yet to come to know.\\"But there are a lot of real klunkers: \\"The waters of their love fell again from above and soaked them as surely as the sea that gathered at their feet.\\"Well, it's a high-wire act, isn't it. If you crave literature about human emotions, try Women in Love or anything else by D.H. Lawrence. If you'd like to juice up your outlook and put some meaning in your life without waiting until you get to heaven and meet your five people, read The Greatest Salesman in the World. But I'm happy I read this book too."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was given to me as a gift. It's so poorly written, I couldn't help wondering what the publisher was thinking. Made to appear as another \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", Albom sinks into a 5th grade writting style with a Christmas Carol theme. It's preachy, phony, sappy and tries to appeal to the emotions of the Oprah crowd. A dreadful money grab and not even worth the deep discounts offered here. Avoid this book as it piles up on the floors of your local Kmart."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend, and I was very glad I did. What I took away from this book, is not what others appear to have gone away with. I found this book a very good lesson in appreciating people. So many times, we pass judgement on a person based on their appearance or circumstance without considering what has made them who they are. This book has helped me recognize everyone has a story. It has helped me remember everyone has a purpose and everyone has value. Hopefully, I can remember the lesson I have learned from this book and be broader minded and more compassionate when I meet people."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The five people you meet in heaven was an excellent book, well worth the 3 hours spent reading.

So I started it and was taken aback...I wanted to learn more about the old man and his life after every page. The stories are great and they all link up to a great ending in the fifth person. The idea of heaven in this way is unique and I think it works quite nicely. Heaven could be this and it could not be this, but either way the idea behind the book is great and captivates the readers.

It's lightweight and appropriate inflight material. Other than that, the book is way overrated."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I seldom read novels except Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code due to the phenomenal hype, but the title of this book had been interesting me for a while and kept me thinking who are those five people we are going to meet in heaven. So I decided to find out. The book is relatively short under 200 pages. It begins the story with the last day of an old man named Eddie, who will meet five people after his death in heaven to learn different lessons on the meaning of life. The beginning is a bit slow. It takes around thirty pages to set up Eddie's death. Honestly, as a reader, I couldn't wait to see the first person Eddie met in heaven and why. Despite that, the story goes very smooth and quite touching. Indeed, the author's perspective on fairness, sacrifice, memory, and love, inspires me a lot to re-think the meanings and values of life. I'm wondering who are the five people waiting for me when my time comes.(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 20-Feb-2005)"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is widely read, which gives one reason why you should too. Another is that it is a really really great story. A neat idea taken to its fullest potential. Phenomenal and moving.What I can perhaps add is that the audio book version is the best audio rendition of a book I've listened to (25+). Not only do you get some well-done dramatic mood music, but you get a great narrator. The beginning of the book you get an introduction from the author, and the end has an interview with the author. I find these additional features really add value to books, and this is no exception. Albom discusses his writing method, how he conceived the story, and how he became a fiction writer."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Eddie is a 82-year old man with a limp from an old knee injury that he got during the war. He works as the Chief Maintenance at Ruby Pier, when one day he dies in a tragic accident. He is transported to afterlife, where he meets with five people that determined the course of his life, even though he sees some of them only for the first time. Slowly but surely he starts to understand why his life went the way it went as he forgives and is forgiven the acts that caused him pain and that made other people suffer.The idea that heaven consists of five people explaining your life, but also that things go the way they go because lifes are interconnected, even when it is not blatantly obvious, is thought provoking, even though some people may consider it to be somewhat new age. The book is well-written, a wonderful read for a long Satuday evening by the fire."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I agree with I CRIED MY EYES OUT. I read Tuesdays With Morrie a few years ago and remembered it being a fast read with some insight. I bought this book last year and it sat on my book shelf until a couple of weeks ago. I pulled it off the shelf after my father's recent death and found much healing between these pages and stopped often to cry. Still I couldnt stop reading and read it inside 3 hours. I agree that it is not a book for everyone. But for others, it will resonate. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has had an emotionally distant relationship with a parent. The words in this book helped me make peace with my distant father, but most importantly myself. There's a paragraph that states that &quot;all parents damage their children; they can't help it.&quot; What follows is a beautiful explanation that provides fodder for forgiveness. admittably, I may not have given this book such a high ranking had it not been for those moments of revelation interspersed throughout the story. For me, this book lives up to the first sentence inside the book flap: Every ending is a beginning."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As the 5 people Eddie meets in heaven walk him back through his life, they help him see that his life did have value and wasn't as worthless as he thought. It sort of reminded me of It's a Wonderful Life, the old Jimmy Stewart movie, by answering the classic, \\"What if I'd....\\" for Eddie. This book does an excellent job of making you reflect on your life and the effect your words and actions have on others. It also shows that we are connected to each other in ways most of us have never imagined. It reminded me that we are not the first to touch this earth; there were others here before us. The presence of these earlier visitors continues on in their unknown brushes with our lives. The world goes in a circle and we are part of that circle as is every other person in our own personal sphere and the world.Great book, easy read, you should try it and see what it does for you."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A thought provoking book. It's a very different view of heaven than is given to us by most religious teachings which is why it is causing resentment amongst some people. Keeping the actual concept of heaven intact the book beautifully describes who you would encounter in heaven and how they would proceed to explain to you how your life was changed on earth by the actions you or sometimes they took. I felt this was refreshingly different from the good/evil view of heaven and hell we are accustomed to hearing i.e paradise to people who are good and hell with the Devil and the burning fires to those who are bad. Here the soul of the protagonist is taken through five &quot;pockets of heaven&quot; as the author describes it and he is given explanations to both his good actions as well as bad in his time on Earth. Surprisingly the book also shows him redeeming himself for some bad he did on Earth although unknowingly. All in all the book reinforces what we often hear from people or try to convince ourselves with when we cannot find explanations to why certain events are taking place in our lives, which is &quot;Whatever happens is for the best&quot;. Some people figure this out(most of the times to keep themselves from rebelling against their circumstances) in their time on Earth and some people as the book shows come to know of the reasons in the afterlife. Read the book with an open mind and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I for one loved this book! I see that it has not received the highest recommendations from other readers and I am surprised at that. This book really makes you see how so many people affect the course of your life, whether they are alive, or passed away years before you were even born. Some people just set the path that your life will follow, whether that is good or bad it is up for you to see."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved this book. It was sad, and at times dark, but beautifully written. It will touch your heart."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"First of all, Mitch Albom gets credit for coming up with the idea of this book, because after the amazing success of &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; his next book was going to suffer in comparison. Still, with &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven,&quot; Albom manages to come up with an inspirational idea that does him credit. The best compliment I can play to this book is that I think we would have heard about it if it had been written before &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; or if it was written by someone other than Mitch Albom.The worst thing I can same about &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; is that the idea is better than the execution, which is another compliment. The idea is concisely explained early in the story: When you go to heaven you meet five people, each of whom was in your life for a reason and they altered your life in a significant way. You may not have understood why they were important in your life, but that is what heaven if for: to understand your life on earth so that you can have the peace you have been searching for.Another compliment, although it might seem backhanded, is that once you get to the point where the rules are explained to the main character in the story, you become distracted. I suspect I am not the only person reading this book who put it down at that point and speculated as to who would be the five people we would meet if we made it to heaven. Of course, one of Albom's points is that will be surprised by who the five people are, so whoever you come up with, you would be wrong. But the idea is intriguing and perhaps of more value than standing around the 21st century equivalent of the water color to discuss who should be voted out of the tribe next.Everybody has their own idea of heaven, Albom notes, and he presents this book as a wish more than a guess. As wishes go, this one is pretty good. I would suggest that you not sit down and read &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; in one sitting, although that is easy to do, but instead try to break it down to one person (and one lesson) a night. That would also give you more time to devote to coming up with your own version of this tale. Ultimately, perhaps the biggest difference between this book and &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; is that the point of this one might be easier to work into your own life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If you haven't read Albom's first book, this one will hit you right between the eyes. If you've read Tuesdays with Morrie, you'll be prepared for Five People. Other reviewers have laid out the premise of the book. Let me tell you what I think will happen to you. First, this will likely be a book you read and re-read. It's a keeper that will occupy a prime spot on your bookshelf because it will make you think...and think some more. Albom has a quality of making you read about others and reflecting on yourself without pushing his writing as another self-help manual. It's a cute story, a parable I suppose, that has you thinking about the relationships you have, have had or wish you had. It then spurs you to think how you should improve or revive those relationships.If you have or have ever had a relationship you wanted to be better, read Five People and you will be challenged, encouraged and very likely delighted to act on that desire. If you find your attitude headed the wrong direction, the ideas from this book will help you to change your outlook. If you think your job doesn't matter, this will help you understand why almost anything you do is worthwhile to someone.This is a must-have book. I rank it in the top-10 of any contemporary book I have read."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"&quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; is an enjoyable quick read that attempts to make sense of the main character's life after he is killed in a tragic amusement park accident. Eddie is the amusement park's maintenance man charged with keeping the rides safe and operational. The novel open's with a countdown of the last fifty minutes that Eddie spends on earth. During this time, Albom introduces scenes that establish Eddie as a gentle giant whose heart has been dampened by a life of trials, tribulations and shortcomings. However, as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that at the core of Eddie's heart is a deep - at times inexpressible - love for his family and friends.After Eddie's death, he is transported to heaven where he meets people whose purpose in heaven is to help him understand his life on earth, &quot;That's what heaven is&quot; explains Eddie's Army Captain who died in combat while attempting to rescue his troops, &quot;You get to make sense of your yesterdays&quot;. Each person he meets represents levels of heaven and provides insight to how Eddie's life affected others. In doing so, the novel becomes a compilation of the various concepts of life after death that is popular in modern spiritual beliefs. There is never any mention of a hell and heaven is depicted in terms easily accessible by readers. &quot;. . . heaven can be found in the most unlikely corners. And heaven itself has many steps.&quot; &quot;Each of us was in your life for a reason. You may not have known the reason at the time, and that is what heaven is for.&quot;This is a good read. Although Albom doesn't offer any new perspectives on the concept of heaven, he does tell a nice story with feel-good dimensions that are always good to reiterate. The writing is clear, well paced and contains some of the most truthful passages I've ever come across in literature - &quot;ALL PARENTS DAMAGE their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhoods completely. . . . &quot; and &quot;LOVE, LIKE RAIN, can nourish from above, drenching couples with a soaking joy. But sometimes, under the angry heat of life, love dries on the surface and must be nourished from below. . . .&quot; These are a few of the many well written and truthfully constructed passages throughout the book. &quot;The Five People You Meet In Heaven&quot; will be a God send to some, offering comfort in moments of death and clarity in times of uncertainty. A worthwhile read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I received this for Christmas and once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. I read it all in one sitting."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in HeavenBy Mitch AlbomHyperion PressThis fiction novel is about life after death. Specifically about a man named Eddie. Eddie is an old, burly chested, maintenance man at Ruby Pier, a local amusement park. All of the kids love him, but all the teens hate him, and he hates those teens right back. Eddie gets into an accident at Ruby Pier where he meets certain death face to face. From there, the book journeys with Eddie through the five different people you meet when you get to heaven. Each person has had an impact on Eddie's life, in one way or the other, whether he knew them as family, or didn't know them at all. This story also ventures with Eddie through flashbacks of his life, such as birthdays, his marriage, and war. But throughout the book, Eddie is left with two questions he is dying to know: Did he save the girl who he tried to push out of the way of the falling cart, and what was his purpose on earth?I think that Mitch Albom did an exquisite job writing this book. I had previously read Tuesday's with Morrie, and I thoroughly enjoyed that book. Although I felt that Tuesday's with Morrie was a slightly better book, I still think that The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a book that is worthy of reading. One downfall to this book, I feel, is that it is a little corny at some points.I think that Mitch Albom's view of heaven has some believable points and some points that are not. I loved the way he described the sky, how it changed colors, because it adds a new element to the imagination, the way you see the scene he is describing in your head. But on the other side, I think that the whole five people thing is a little far-fetched. It just seems a little too odd. For example, the bestseller The Lovely Bones has some points that are similar to this book.Overall I believe that this book gets a 9 out of 10. It wasn't perfect, but I still took pleasure in reading it. I would suggest it to people ages 13 and up."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"the good news is, it's an easy read. if you've done little or no spiritual work, this book will be a revelation and uplifting. if you're a bit beyond that, it's trite and not that interesting, sorry!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As much as I wanted to like this book, I couldn't bring myself to. The characters are flat and the plot predictable. If you're really looking for a book that explores death and the afterlife well, try Hotel World by Ali Smith or The Lovely Bones by Alice Seabold. They're much more worth the money and time."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I had heard what a wonderful book this was, but after reading it, I began to think that this is one of those books that people feel obligated to like when really there isn't much there. I definitely wanted to like this book much more than I did, I enjoyed Tuesdays with Morrie, also by Mitch Albom, and I liked the idea of heaven being an exploration of our interconnectedness and an answer to the question \\"Why am I here?\\" but it was not the life-altering experience for me that I've heard about from other people...Things I did like about the book (in addition to it being a quick read) was that I learned some things about myself, not so much because the book told me things about myself, more so because it did inspire me to self reflect, but then again, I think that is what books are supposed to do.

Why would anyone want to believe that heaven exists as some kind of therapeutic analysis meant to explain your earthly existence. What is the point? You're dead already!

Mitch Albom has such a unique way of writing that i couldnt put it down. He gives the readers an idea of the possiblities the afterlife has in store for us. The book also unfolds many emotions. Even though you get to experience many emotions throughout the book, at the end you feel refreshed and happy about what happens.Im not going to give away what happens in the book because i think that if you are reading my review you should go pick it up and read it.

The book leaves such an impact on your life that you feel you could read it over and over again.I strongly recommend this book to all.

Interesting but... not all there. I must say I was intriuged by this book's plot. It could have gone a long way, but Albom did not take it to its full potential. Its rather tired morals and clich&eacute;d dialogue put a weight on the otherwise airy pace, scenes of near-rape and death bed repentance seem out of place in the book's almost whimsical narration. Airplane reading."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was given this book as a gift and felt obliged to read it. I believe if I am honest in my review I would have to say that the best thing about the book is the fact that it is a very quick read. If you are looking for deep reading, this is not it.I have read the author's other book, Tuesdays with Morrie, and found it to be a fairly good book, but 'Five People' does not measure up to the bar set by the author's other work."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a \\"cute\\" book. It is filled with platitudes and the author's version of heaven and what he thinks is life wisdom.The book traces the main character's death and path to heaven. What you can read between the lines is that Eddie was a pretty unhappy and unlikeable guy in life (presumably modelled after the uncle to whom the book was dedicated). The path to heaven according to Mr. Albom goes through five meetings with people who touched a person, eevn tangentially, during life. Through these people, a person sees that every story is connected and there is redeeming value to every miserable happening on earth.The writing was decent but I just could not get past the point that this was one person's opinion about life and heaven. Regrettably, I did not find that opinion to be reasoned, challenging or intellectually stimulating. There was nothing to make the reader think that author was a great mind whose opinion on such a subject as the afterlife should be given any more credence than anyone else's. Much of what was passed as \\"Wisdom\\" could have come out of a fortune cookie, a \\"thought for a day\\" calendar of from the guy next door.I actually found the flashbacks to Eddie's life the most interesting parts of the book. The heaven part did nothing for me except make me worry that I was getting too much saccharin for one day."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was very easy to read and had many worthwhile lessons. I found I was rereading parts of the book simply to review the main lessons. The book is about a man named Eddie who dies while working at an amusement park. The obvious cycle in this book is the cycle of life. It starts out with Eddie's death, but once he reaches heaven, he feels young again. His body ages as he meets the five people in heaven who are waiting to teach Eddie five lessons about life. I also noticed the circles within the lessons from the five people. The five people are Eddie's mentors as he makes his way through his process in heaven. The first person he meets teaches him the lesson that all of our lives here on Earth and in heaven are connected. Our actions have reactions for someone else, whether it is positive or negative we may not even know. The second person teaches him that sacrifice is &quot;something you pass along to someone else.&quot; You can't feel negatively about the events in your life. The third person teaches him that forgiveness is much better than holding a grudge. You need to understand the reason why you were angry and the reason why you need to let it go. The fourth person teaches him that love continues through life an death. Finally the fifth person teaches him that wherever the path leads, he was meant to follow it. He worked at the Pier because he was supposed to work there. He was supposed to take care of the children, and make sure they are safe. He realized that his actions affected children and adults in his lifetime and in the future. Because of his observations and his mentoring Dominguez, the rides will continue to be safe and maintained. Eddie completed his first cycle in heaven and is waiting to start the next one when he becomes the person one will meet in heaven. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and will read it from cover to cover again many times. The lessons are worthwhile and apply to anyone. Being a mentor is an example of touching someone's life. Through our wisdom, we can either help improve their lives or make it worse. If we focus on the positive, the impression we'll make will be ten-fold."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Reading the NY Bestsellers List can sometimes lead you to books that sound interesting but turn out to be a complete waste of time. The idea was an interesting one; you die, you meet five people who teach you wonderful insights on your life that you overlooked while you were on earth. However, that would work much better had the main character led a corrupt life in the corporate world or had actually overlooked something in his life (which would have been cliche but much more believable). This was not the case in this book. Eddie seemed to be a man who had some ghosts in his past but overall was a very loved man and a led a very quiet life. This made the lessons he learned almost seem redundant. To top it off, the writing was very poor. It wasn't much of a page turner and at many points, it was very predictable and bland. If you really want to learn some life lessons that enlighten you, pick up his other book, &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie.&quot;"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book in its short and simple way help us to look into people and life with a new appreciation. The five people he met in heaven revealed so much about life that most of us took it for granted. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to spend an enjoyable afternoon. It's so refreshing to read a good novel without exaggeration of sex, violence or foul language."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I admit that I bought this book with the simple hope of a decent story without a winding plot. Decent story? Yes. Winding plot? Still trying to determine that. As with many good tales this one left me with a few &quot;Ah ha!&quot; moments. After all, isn't a good story supposed to leave you thinking about it afterwards?I would put this book in the same category as The Lovely Bones with the simple message of &quot;This could happen to anyone - especially you.&quot; In a time where we are bombarded with the media coverage of wars, snipers, teen suicide, late-term abortion debates (and anything else that could turn your stomach while listening to the evening news with your family) it seems that a story such as The Five People You Meet in Heaven is something that should give people a reason to step back and think about the really important things in life and what's waiting for you on the other side. Drama aside, this story left me looking at the strangers I bump into everyday differently ... it truly leaves you thinking about your everyday decisions in a different light."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This is a very special story about life, death, a person's purpose and redemption. I'm sure you have to be in just the right place in your life to truly appreciate it's value. And if you have no heart, you just won't get it. It is written very simply, but anything more complicated would ruin the message. Yes it is a message book, but I think it's specialness is that it's message is unique to each person. I couldn't put it down. I thought it was one of the best stories I had ever read, and yes it did bring tears to my eyes."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Mitch Albom's new novel tries to be something that so many of the other genres (horror, mystery, science fiction) never try to be, and that's nourishing. Books like Five People are the kind of books that should be selling millions, not all these mass production thrillers. What I enjoyed most about this novel is the amount of respect each character is given. Each life or character described, all of them, are always introduced with sincerity, no matter what situation they are brought into, like war, or problems with alcohol. It's a shame that books like these are few and far between, for it strives to at least help answer questions, where the only medium that tries to answer questions now are self-help books, which offer too many answers in too many sugar coated ways. In short, this novel will hurt no one, for its sole purpose is to fulfill and satisfy the reader. With that being said, there are a couple mistakes in the novel.First, we are introduced way too late to the wife of Eddie...the whole time we are supposed to suspend the idea that he loved her 'greatly', until finally, around page 150, we finally get to know her better. A relationship like that should be described in pages, not paragraphs. Also, there were times when the description of heavens, the different colors, for instance, were vague and too foreign to the rest of the subject matter.But, to wrap it up, these are small things...there are always errors in a first novel, but it still shines bright and once finished, you'll feel as if you've swallowed a tasty vitamin, nourished and satisfied."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I wanted so badly to be moved by this book. In my humble opinion, I think I see brilliance forming in Mitch Albom's writing. However, this book is a stop on his path towards being a great writer. The format and structure of the book is very creative. If you aspire to write, I suggest you read it for the inspiration to approach your stories more creatively. If you desire deep inspiration, I'm not sure you will find it here."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Although simply wrote, this is a gem of a tale. I loved Albom's idea of Heaven in here: that 5 people will come forward (some are loved ones, while others are distant strangers) - all of whom have changed the course of the deceased's life profoundly, whether intentionally or not. This is the story of Eddie who dies on his 83rd birthday, then gradually meets the 5 people in Heaven who explain his life and the connections that made him the man he was. It is a great way to recap one's life, and Albom gives us a sensitive view of Eddie's. This is a book that will speak to every age group, and will hold up through time. It's also a story I will not soon forget."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have never read any of Mitch Albom's book. This one was recommended by Amazon when I purchased a different book. I got it used so I wasn't losing much if I didn't like it. BUT I couldn't put it down. The story was great and I would read it again. It made you think about the people we come into contact and how they imapct our lives. I Loved it!!!! I would like to read some of his other books now. I found a new author that I love."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"i got this book as a gift, and i couldnt put it down! i still read this today, and i buy it as gifts!! i buy all of mitch albom's novels, theyre great!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Definitely worth the read. Might I say, just as good if not better than Tuesdays With Morrie. I could go on about how there were literally jaw-dropping moments or where I almost shed a tear but that would take away from your own experience. Do yourself a favor and pick this up. You will not regret it!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I first read this book in 2005. I have purchased probably 10 copies of it. I've given it to my family and friends. It has become my take along book to read on the airplanes, it will last for a good two to three hour flight and when I finish it I usually end up giving it away to my seat mate.Some may say corny mush, I say thought provoking,reflective, bringing me back to reality and reminding me to be thankful for my life even with all it's trials and struggles. We all touch each others lives in ways we may never know in this life and I am counting on understanding it all one day."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"My son read this book for school. He was so impressed with the story that he insisted that I read it, too, before he had to take it back to the school library. I had to read it quickly but that was not hard to do. Once I started reading I was so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. My son kept interrupting me, asking what point I was at and what I thought so far. He wanted to discuss each of the five people as I got to them, asking me how I thought it would end. And the ending came as a surprise to me. This one really makes you think about your life and what comes afterwards."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"An excellent novel that makes you think of the repercussions of the actions, even the most miniscule, that you take every day. This is definitely a book that everyone who loves reading should have."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book a few years ago. It's one of those books that, when you've finished it, you are just so absolutely glad you read it. I'm an avid reader and I often--no, scratch \\"often.\\" MOST of the time I read a book just so I can get to the end of it. I might love the book while in pursuit of that end, but a good percentage of the time I'll forget the gist of it completely in a few months time. But you keep reading because every now and then there's a book you don't forget. One that stays. That perhaps makes you see certain things differently. That changes your view on something. A book that you tell people about...over and over. A book that makes you want to hit them over the head if they don't show the same enthusiasm for it that you have. This is one of those books. Trust me."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!We watched this movie in developmental psychology when I was in undergrad. It changed my life, helping me to develop a more holistic view of the world and way of thinking that is still with me today. So naturally, I had to get the book....which was every bit as good. Fresh baked, warm gooey chocolate chip cookie good."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I read this book after a former boyfriend told me about the author. I am now a huge fan of Mitch Albom's. I read this book about 5 years ago and then saw the movie. This is one you want in your collection!!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I believe in life after death, and this book offers another perspective in a way that I have never considered. After reading this book I cannot think of my heaven in any other way. This book thoroughly kept my attention, and I have found very few books that can offer that to me. If you want a book that gets you thinking about what happens after death, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This delightful story has a good punch. Other reviews get into the story, so I won't. Basically, the underlying message is that you never know the full picture nor do you know your influence--or that of others.The message is hidden in an interesting story that spans the long years of one life and you will want to make sure you have the tissues handy when you read about this one. It is an easy but captivating read--and the perfect gift."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"After the release of the book, I heard him speak about it at the Texas book Festival. This book lived up to Everything i thought it would be. Dont go in thinking it will be another Tuesdays with Morrie, its not. Mitch shows another side."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"For a light reminder of life's spiritual mirror, The Five People You Meet in Heaven represents a great introduction into the world of spirituality, and life after death, and how our lives all have a purpose. When you are ready to go deeper, read the near-death, purpose stories by Betty Eadie (embraced by the light)or Tiffany Snow (psychic gifts). These highlight the deeper Spiritual things, and a look into heaven itself.Indulge yourself! Continue on the path to be a higher intelligence in the universe! The world needs it, doesn't it?"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"As a theologian I find it interesting, some people's \\"version\\" of heaven. As the author points out - all of which should be respected (except maybe the having sex with 70 virgins version).The lessons learned deal with things we can do now - letting go of hate, learning to love, forgiving etc. It is a very thought provoking small book. I got it yesterday and finished it today.It may not change your life, but it just might change your mind...about life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This was an easy read, and yet had such an impact that even weeks later I am still thinking about it. I have recommended this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is not what you would think. Because of the title many people think that the book is all about heaven, death and spiritual life. Not at all. It is a unthought of look at the people you meet once you die. Short book and a good read for a lazy day."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A great story on the meaning of life and how our lives can have a profound impact on other's lives, without us even knowing it. I loved this book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"An easy light plot which is sweet at times. The book is predictable at times. I do not have time to read a book with a thick, detailed plot and this was easy and fairly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. Very touching, especially because I can relate to a lot of what Albom has to say. A must read. Give it to everyone you deeply love."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This wonderful little novel was so refreshing and hopeful. This view into what heaven could be like is original and mind blowing. Mitch Albom did a wonderful job. Personally, I really liked it.Every loose end was perfectly revealed. My favorite part of this novel is when Eddie is with his wife. That was romantic and so sweet, and just reading that portion of the book made reading it worth while. Don't get me wrong, the others he meets are important, as well, but Marguerite made the biggest impression on me.The best I can say about this novel is that it is a great book to have in your collection. For me to describe every person Eddie meets in heaven would take away the reason for reading it in the first place. If you like wonderful stories with meaning and hope, this would do it. There are some stories out there that helps you get through life and maybe answer some hard questions, whether they be fiction or nonfiction, and this is one of them. This book helps you realize everyone has a purpose on this earth. It is a positive view from one person, and I think he did an excellent job. I am glad he shared this novel with the world, and maybe, you will to. Enjoy.Joy"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Good book. Mitch is very innovative in his writing skills. Catchy, could not put the book down. Best part was meeting the fourth person, Eddie's wife... his love for her, his longing to stay with her, the comfort he felt in her presence. At last finding the truth about, and the reason for his nightmares (meeting the fifth person) all those years, his regret for staying behind at Ruby Pier. While other books out there try to explain 'the reason' for our existence, none I've found to be more engaging than this. Good work. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Having never read any of Mitch Albom's other work, I was very anxious to read this book because the premise sounded very promising.I like to think of this book as a journey into the unknown. Nobody here really knows what heaven is like, and its very existence is even questioned by many. Albom gives us a glimpse of what his heaven is like by allowing us to follow Eddie, the main character, on his journey through heaven.Before Eddie's death, he was an old man who felt he had done nothing with his life. He was plagued with the questions that a lot of us inquire of ourselves. What have I done in my life? Has my life been worth living? What have I got to show for it? Sadly, when Eddie died, he felt that his life was a miserable existence with no meaning.Enter Mitch Albom's heaven. It's an experience. It's not really like what television, movies, or your own mind have portrayed it to be. There aren't people lounging around in togas sipping fine wine and having a jolly old time however they please. Albom envisions heaven as an experience at looking back at one's own life and how one has unknowingly affected and been affected by others--sometimes strangers. In heaven, Eddie meets 5 different people who have affected his life in some important manner, though he doesn't necessarily realize it until the story unfolds.To be quite frank, I was slightly disappointed in this book. Given the premise, I was really hoping for an uplifting, somewhat spiritual book that would give me a warm fuzzy after I had finished reading it. It didn't. However, I honestly believe that if I let the theme of the book play around in my head for awhile, I'll appreciate the book more. Moreoever, I look forward to reading the book again in the future (maybe in a year or so) because I think it will get better in future re-reads.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book was a wonderful surprise to a dreary day. It has lessons to give and heartfelt endearments that remind us how we are all on a journey, a path of some kind, together. Even if you don't believe in heaven, who can deny that fact!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I still have no idea what made me think this book looked good. I had never heard of the author, I don't believe in God, and my first experiences of the idea of Heaven & Hell were from Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey and Ghost. One's a comedy. I'll let you work out which one.But for some unknown reason I picked up this book, after reading the blurb on the back. And I read it in under a couple of hours. It's not much over 100 pages long, so it won't take readers long to read. I have to admit myself that when it comes to the idea of God, I respect other people's opinions, but not for me. Although, I will admit to believing in life after death, and Heaven.The story starts with a chapter called \\"The End\\". Interesting start to the book, and it continues from there. An eighty-three-year-old man, Eddie, is about to die. The first chapter starts with his last hour on earth, and how he dies. From there, it continues with five people that he may or may not have met during his life. One is an obvious one. The rest are interesting to say the life.Apparently, there was a real life Eddie out there, that influenced Mitch Albom to write the book, and it's weird how one person can influence such a thought-provoking book. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, although it left me feeling really sad by the end and I was gutted that I finished it. There's just something about The Five People You Meet In Heaven that made me pick it up. I have looked at another of his books, and not felt the need to get it at all. But I urge anyone who is in the least bit doubtful about getting it, do. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The book is a simple little parable. It's neither very good nor very bad. It just doesn't really do much at all. With so much to learn and read about in this world and so little time to do it in, there are better books to put on your list."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"Having read Tuesdays With Morrie, I welcomed the opportunity to delve into another inspirational tale as told by Mitch Albom. With its appetizer-sized chapters, I thought this would be a great &quot;tween&quot; book as I ventured from one long novel to the next. What a disappointment. This book was not only depressing, which I gathered from the reviews I had read prior to purchase, but it lacked any sort of resolution or true connectivity. The story was jumbled, and the veiled attempt to tie it all in failed miserably. Moreover, much of the supposed resolution our protagonist finds is hardly believable. Tuesdays With Morrie is one of the best books I've read, but, after this, I doubt I'll ever spend a penny on any of Mitch Albom's books again."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A must read. Makes you really stop and think about how you impact other people's lives as well as how other people impact your own life.Excellent...loved every chapter."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was perusing my budget and swore that I wouldn't buy any more books this year...until I went into Sam's to buy groceries and saw this curiously titled little tome. I pleaded with the budget gods to forgive me this one last time and tossed it into my cart. I sat down to read it when I got home and never moved from my chair until I'd read the last page. What a story!!It's chock full of Zen-like, thought-provoking insights about the important things in life like love, forgiveness, hope, friendship and living in the present moment. The blue man was one of my favorite characters....what was heaven to him was hell to another...so true of real life! So much depends upon our outlook, our circumstances and our attitudes. I read somewhere that the worth of a book can be measured by what you carry away from it....in that case, this book is worth it's weight in diamonds and gold. I'll treasure it and find it a home along side my favorite inspirational books."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I have been an avid reader all my life, and periodically a book comes along,that I have to shout, &quot;buy this book&quot;...Has anyone ever done something special for you, or been part of a giving moment,when, after its over you say, &quot;Wasn't that so nice&quot;. Thats the feeling you get after reading this book..It was a very nice, quiet, thoughtful book.It made me wonder who my 5 people will be! There was a quote from Ruby to Eddy at the end of the book, that is still resenating in my mind. It teaches, but does not preach.Kudo's to Mitch, you did it again.."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The centerpiece of Mitch Albom's slim, top selling volume is Ruby Pier, a seashore amusement park built when railroads were the main transportation and generation whims reformed and renamed the park's rides. Albom's main character is an elderly amusement park maintenance man named Eddie (which Albom notes was based on his uncle), who marks time in his life through a series of birthdays frustrated and crossed with funerals and family conflicts, and through park attractions changing names and styles.But when Eddie dies in a park tragedy trying to save a young girl, he enters a heaven Albom only paints as the ultimate virtual reality attraction. In it, five people drawn from his life's story appear to explain how their lives intertwined with his and the afterlife lesson you must draw from them. (Much of the root of this, without giving the story away, relies on the popular \\"six degrees of separation\\" idea.)What this leaves you with in \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" is a richly detailed backdrop: evocative pictures of seashore parks, dank one room apartments, mundane funeral arrangements, even wartime prison camps. Fitting the book's fantasy theme, Albom's characters are as one-dimensional as the characters in a boardwalk video arcade.Albom sends Eddie to a circus performer, an army captain, family members, each holding a step of heaven idealizing their respective earthly lives. They provide long-awaited answers to painful questions constantly asked or subconsciously hidden (Albom effectively portrays the physical and mental anguish Eddie goes through.) Each attempts to provide life closure which eludes us all on earth. For its many faults, the book attempts an answer to a basic human question: What meaning did my life have? (Albom mentions his view of heaven is \\"only a guess,\\" which makes sense as he hasn't seen the real place yet.)Yet Albom's heaven is not one earned by a Savior's life and death, faith, good works or even divine providence (the \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" and God directly are mentioned once each). His pithy character dialogue (especially a mawkish yet distrurbing climactic scene with the fifth person Eddie meets) assemble a paradise without judgment or purification, only fulfillment.The book's charms reflect its pop culture touchstones in stories like \\"Christmas Carol,\\" \\"It's A Wonderful Life,\\" and even some of Earl Hamner's sentimental scripts for the old \\"Twilight Zone\\" series. Dialogue between Eddie and his beloved Marguerite is sincere and tender on earth as it is in heaven. It serves as the book's anchor, consistent with a heaven faithful people believe in and want. Otherwise, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is at times compelling but mostly cloying. It's a reconciliation story set where reconciliation is needed least."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was shocked when I saw so many positive reviews for this book. The book reads like a sickly sweet cloying 1950's B movie. It is so loaded with over-the-top sentimentality that one has to put the book down every so often to keep from getting nauseous.Cloying is a good word to describe this trash. Albom pulls out all the stops in his no-holds-barred attempt to make the reader feel.... what.... sick? Maybe I'm just not sentimental enough. I needed to take a shower after reading this book.Perhaps it wouldn't be so bad if the author didn't try so hard. Every page contains a desperate attempt to emulate Alan Alda's sentimental world view (If you liked what Alda did to \\"Mash\\" you'll love this book). Seriously, though, it's impossible to let go and get lost in the story and characters because 1) the book is so poorly written and 2) the story and characters are sooooo fake.The characters are all one-dimensional stick figures. You've seen them and their lines many times before in every \\"heartwarming\\" holiday-made-for-TV movie. Soap opera characters seem complex by comparison. This book is \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" on crack.I think that when Mr. Albom gets to heaven, there will be some people waiting to talk to him..... all the people who got duped into wasting their time reading this book!"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"In a world were we are often in a rush, and worry more about ourselves, than what we may be doing for others, and how our lives our linked to everyone around us.

It teaches each of us a valuable lesson that we never know who's live we may alter each day."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The five people you meet in heaven is a classical, touching book. This book taught me to never look at just the face value of things.Eddie wandered why he had to stay at the pier and why he didnt deserve better, soon he finds out. This book is really worth reading. The 5 people in heaven all have a reson for being the 5 people you meet. Before I read the book I wondered how the 5 people Eddie met related to his life on earth. I found this book extremely touching and sad. Although, it was sad and a bit depressing, you get hooked. I love this book and Mitch Albom has written it well. I gave this book a five star, this is because this book strongly deserved it. Read the book and find out what Eddies life means, and learn life changing lessons in life."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"AFTER READING THIS BOOK, I AM HOPING TO HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE AS EDDIE, THE MAIN CHARACTER, DID.

Just a lovely tale about one lonely man's journey into the afterlife. What happens after we die? I say we slowly rot in the ground, but this novel paints a much brighter vission of life after death. The title says it all. I don't usualy get emotional unless I lose a lot of money playing poker, but this book is right up there."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The first person he met is questionable. Didn't really see the point. The last person he met ... the author was definitely trying to make it come together, but IT TOTATALLY DOES NOT WORK; IT WAS FORCED, AND SO 'FAKE'. If Eddie (the protagonist) is traveling through 5 different pockets of heaven, where each soul creates what they want to share with Eddie, then why doesn't the Asian girl speak better English? She's old enough to speak well. Why does she have to speak in broken English? She is in heaven now. Anything is possible in heaven, even good communication. Overall, the book is a quick read. I finished it in 2 hours. It does make you think and value your days on earth. Of course, don't think too hard about the book and the author's choices or else you'll start seeing holes; big holes which may put a damper on that sense of feeling good after a sweet paperback."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"this book is great for a weekend read.

On day he died trying to save a girl from getting crush by a roller coaster.

What made me enjoy this book so much is how those five people all made a connection in his life. Like the blue man taught him how to juggle which help him escape from prison in war. This story made me realize how everything you do helpful in life makes a difference. Also it shows how people affect our lives in so many different ways and we don't even know it at that moment in time. Then when you get older things start to fall into place like a Jig saw puzzle. It makes me realize that our life here on earth has a purpose. Though we may not know it, but in time we realize that we have helped many people which may make a difference in your next life. Also this had similarities with a Christmas movie i watched called \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\". I like this book also cause of the ending, which tied everything together. This book kept me interested and always wanted me to read more. I thought this book was a good story and I would advise other people to read it. if you have not already."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"A lot of the people who review books here seem self-conscious about reading something that isn't great literature--and won't give high marks for entertainment value. Don't people read novels for entertainment? If a book holds you enthralled until the end and makes you wish you had the idea first and could have written it; in my mind it deserves the highest rating. I don't think this book could have been better. It made me wonder who I might meet in heaven should heaven be like the author's idea of it. If you are a literature snob don't read it. If you like entertaining and wonderful books you should read it and I know you will be happy you did.I listened to the unabridged audio cassette version of this book. I really wish they would tell you when each side is finished and to either turn the tape or fast forward to the end."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"By Jan Rivers, Colorado Springs, COWhat happens just beyond this life? What is heaven like? Everyone asks. But only Mitch Albom could turn his Uncle Edward's sickbed glimpse into a curious tale of amusement park characters here and beyond.With delightful imagination, Mitch Albom brings insights about the afterlife which invite readers to re-examine the present -- and their assumptions about life, death, and heaven.Readers who like Albom's fictional exploration of what happens just beyond death may also enjoy the real-life beyond-and-back experiences told to Celia M. Hastings in THE UNDERTAKER'S WIFE."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I enjoyed this book as a person who rarely reads.

I really enjoyed this book. This is a perfect book for someone who wants to feel connected to a lost loved one."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I loved this book. It was really good. I liked the whole set-up. Eddie has to meet with five people who were connected in his life in order to move on. The five people he meets are all interesting - people who were very important in his life to people he hardly met or only slightly knew. I think that is how we all go through life - having people who mean a lot and also affecting people we don't even know that we did.It all culminates with the last person he meets. I don't want to give the ending away, but the last person he meets actually shows him how important he was even though he never thought he was anyone important.I have read his next book, \\"For One More Day,\\" but it was not as good as this one. I am looking forward to reading his new book, \\"Have a Little Faith,\\" but will have to wait until summer vacation.

The book makes the point that the man hated his job but stayed anyway blessed a lot of kids or people, but hated his life!

Also I need to say that this is my first negative review.If you are an other reviewers and want to explain to me with respect why it is a very good book please do.Keep on reading."},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"This book is marketed as an inspirational novel: heart-warming, uplifting, and spiritual, with a dash of self-help thrown in.Unfortunately, that's not what I got our of this book. What I found was a novel full of blather, boredom, and mediocrity.The gist of the story is that all lives are interwoven- our life affects another life, which affects another, and so on. In theory, this is practical advice, however in real life, we have to make our own choices and decide what is best for ourselves without regards to how it will affect the mailman, the grocery store clerk, or the family living down the street.Eddie, the main character in the story dies suddenly. He travels to \\"heaven\\" where he meets five people whom his life has affected. Supposedly these encounters teach Eddie about thankfulness, grace, and love. The problem now is this: Eddie is dead. What is the point of learning how to live after you're already dead?The writing is somewhat choppy, with descriptions are sometimes hard to understand and visualize.

It may look like a lightweight, but it packs a powerful emotional punch.

In fact, you may walk away from it spiritually enriched thanks to the words of solace it provides.

I loved this book and highly recommand this book to everyone! Spiritual uplight"},{"Title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom begins at the end of a man's life and does and excellent job in portraying life after death. Although it is just one man's perspective of what life is like after death, it is an excellent and creative one.Although the title of the book may hint that it is religious; it is far from that. This book is for people of all types. It just allows readers to get a glimpse at what after life might be like.The book revolves around the death of Eddie, the main character. It begins with counting down Eddie's remaining hours left on Earth as he his working at the amusement park named Ruby Pier. Then while on duty a horrendous accident with one of the rides takes his life. He is then sent to heaven where he meets five people who in some way; shape or form Eddie has impacted their lives. They are all there to teach Eddie a lesson and fulfill any gaps he may have about his life.This book is not your everyday ordinary book; it has three story lines all being told at once: his different birthdays; life in heaven; and life on Earth without him present. All the stories are surrounded around Eddie's death which is told chronologically and in the end complete Eddies life on Earth.As the story progresses, readers are told more about Eddies past and character. His character is developed through the many people he had interactions with during his life on Earth.This book is very similar to that of the books we read as young children where every story has a lesson. Every person that Eddie meets in heaven has a lesson for him, which helps him overcome any holes he had in this heart and life.Although I haven't read any other novels by Mitch Albom, I would certainly recommend this book to others who are just looking for a very creative book that is an easy and fast read; you won't want to put it down! This book will leave you wondering just exactly what heaven is like."},{"Title":"Dorn: Of the People, a Political Way of Life","review":"Well written, Bryan Dorn-style!

I requested she read it to me nightly for a long time! My Mother did the voices of the characters so great! As I got older, I read it on my own and I wore out the story, reading it countless times. As an adult, I still love the story because it is magical, suspenseful and just a little bit scary but not too much for a child.This is a wonderful story with many morals. It TEACHES a child RESPECT for elders (definitely always an issue in the world today) and when unsure what to do, to go GET ADVICE FROM SOMEONE YOU TRUST before acting and to LISTEN to that wise advice VERY CAREFULLY. This book teaches a child to be COURAGEOUS and use wise advice along with her WITS, INSTINCTS and HEART to get out of perilous situations.The Russian illustrations are very different than a typical American book; which I find very refreshing. It has vibrant primary colors and lots of black outlines to set the pictures off. Also the layout of pictures within the story is sheer genius.The girl was badly mistreated by her stepmother but yet was kind and gentle, not letting it effect her personality. This is the moral from the book I appreciate the most. REMINDS ME OF A WISE SAYING:&quot;YOU CAN'T CONTROL THE SITUATION BUT YOU CAN CONTROL HOW YOU REACT TO IT.&quot; Children should be taught this truth from birth!This is a great book! I highly recommend it.

It is perhaps the most important of Richard Niebuhr's books (despite the continued influence of _Christ and Culture_ and _The Responsible Self_). One of the central issues theologians wrestled with in the 20th century was the rise of historicist thought. Such thought is still with us today; it is the grounding of postmodern secularist relativism -- because we are each limited by our prejudices (shaped by our social, geographical, and temporal locations), we cannot possibly critique one another. Niebuhr was one of the first theologians in American to offer a solid theological answer; his thought still resonates today in the work of Stanley Hauerwas and others, who argue that God has entered history and that we are to join this particular history, that of Israel, Jesus, and the Church. Niebuhr tells us Christians that we should acknowledge our groundedness, our contingencies, our limitations. Only God can transcend all these differences and present us with the gift of unity. God invites all to become part of this historical movement.

For example, on the streets while I live, I see things like bits of garbage, emergency vehicles flying past people and animals turned into roadkill. But sometimes, we see some things that we might never find on the streets at all. One boy will tell his father a great experience on a street that he saw in this great book which happens to be the first children's book ever written by the legendary Dr. Seuss.In the story, we meet a little boy named Marco who every day has to tell his father what he saw on his way home from school. But every time he tells his dad of his stories, they tend to be a bit lacking and not believable. So one day, Marco decides to twist up his story a bit while walking home through Mulberry Street. He sees a horse and a wagon, but he decides to change the horse into a zebra and the driver into a charioteer. But Marco thinks that a zebra is too so he changes it into a reindeer. Throughout the story, Marco continues to change his story into he turns it into a big street-wide blowout.This may truly be one of the most original books ever created for children. It has a perfect point and the mind of a child. It's also a perfect debut for Dr. Seuss, since we read and see how his work was like before he evolved into the legend he has becomed. Readers will love this book and how it's so simple and imaginative that any child will enjoy it, even if they haven't read any of his books. The book is just great from beginning to end and no Dr. Seuss fan should ever be left without this great treasure."},{"Title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Books)","review":"I love this book, it is so adorable!

In fact it would be hard to say who enjoyed it more, me or the children. The story is about a boy who everyday as he walks home from school, spends some time concocting a wacky story to share with his dad.In true Seussian fashion, there is great rhyming, fun artwork and lots of imagination. I particularly liked that the book demonstrates how children can \\"stretch\\" their own imagination. The technique is simple and one even very young children can practice and enjoy. It involves taking an ordinary scene and exaggerating first one element and then another, until the whole situation is really outlandish and silly. If you start with a wagon being pulled by a horse, for example, the horse can become a zebra, and the wagon something more elaborate until step by step it becomes one of those strange Seussian contraptions with big and little wheels, and umbrellas in odd places. Trust us, it's great fun! And the sharing of the father and child is very heartwarming as well.Definitely Give This One A Try!Both my 6 and 8 year olds enjoyed this book. The artwork is very good Seussian stuff, and the rhyming is some of his best in my opinion. I would also add that Seuss seems to be a very good bet for youngsters that are reading ahead of their age level as the content is not overly sophisticated.Reading Level :::The Accelerated Reading level (ATOS) for this book is 3.6 - which means that this book is has been analyzed and thought appropriate for the average child reading in the 6th month of the 3rd Grade. This is only a guide for children practicing reading, and the book can of course be read to children of any age.Pam T~mom and reviewer for BooksForKids-reviews"},{"Title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Books)","review":"I bought this book because it brought back such good memories of my child's childhood and my own as well.

I liked this book because after you read it your imagination is running wild. It is a book about a young boy's imagination when you can't stop it from running like an Energizer battery. After the story was over I couldn't stop thinking about more things to add to the young boy's story to make it even better. It is a great book for this project because you are really tapping into your childhood and your young imagination. I think everyone should read this book to see the magic of being a child. If you like Dr. Seuss books this is one you will really enjoy. It is fast pace and it rhymes to help the story be more fun.My stepmom thought that this book was very creative because it was full of imagination. This book made her laugh because all of Marco's ideas were very silly and fun. She thought that it read at a very fast pace. She also loved the pictures and drawings because they kept changing as the boy's thoughts kept elaborating. The words rhymed from line to line keeping her interest throughout the book.

While it is an entertaining book with humorous illustrations, on the whole I find &quot;Mulberry Street&quot; to be oddly unsatisfying.The story concerns young Marco, who has been asked by his father to tell him what he sees on the walk home from school. Seeing nothing but a horse and wagon, Marco lets his imagination run wild, until the horse and wagon are transformed into an elephant and brass band, accompanied by numerous other people and animals.Without giving away the ending, I will say that the book seems to deliver a curiously conflicted message regarding storytelling and imagination. Although &quot;Mulberry Street&quot; is not at the level of Seuss' greatest classics, it is still an important landmark in children's literature, and would make a good addition to any family or school library."},{"Title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Books)","review":"I have memories of loving this book.

This tell of one boy's vivid imagination will make children happy and make us adults try to reconjure our own dreams. The characters are funny and the names will have your tongue in knots. Certainly not his best, I'd say that is is more political and social commentary, but definately a fun fun book to have if you don't already."},{"Title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Books)","review":"This is the first of Dr. Seuss's books for children, and it is a good introduction to the imaginative creativity which opened his career as an enormously popular children's writer. In this story a young boy walking home from school, and on seeing a simple horse and cart, embellishes it in his mind by first changing the animal, then the conveyance, then adds passengers, and so on, until the horse and cart are transformed into a veritable parade. This is a quite enjoyable flight of imagination.Unfortunately, the story opens with the boy's father admonishing him against lying, and when he arrives home his father's quelling response keeps the boy from sharing his story. Young children do know the difference between truth and fiction, so the conflict between the boy and his father is troubling. Either the character in the book is actually given to deception, or his father is suppressive of his imagination. Both interpretations would suggest potentially serious problems in a real father-son relationship because they evince a lack of trust. The tall tale is wonderful, but the dynamic between father and son isn't one I want to have emulated in our family."},{"Title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Books)","review":"When you first open this book, you will be struck that it's not quite like any other Dr. Seuss book. The first drawings are smaller and simpler. The poetry is a little more restrained. You'll wonder why it's different, and then you will realize that this was his very first book for children. Like most of us, he was a little restrained at first. But, before long, the full gamut of Dr. Seuss is loose!Marco is a small boy who walks to school along Mulberry Street. His father likes to encourage him. &quot;'Marco, keep your eyelids up and see what you can see.'&quot; Marco's father is looking for the eye of a scientist or a reporter. But Marco has the eye of a poet. So when Marco tells what he has imagined he has seen, his father sternly says, &quot;'Your eyesight's much too keen. Stop telling such outlandish tales. Stop turning minnows into whales.'&quot;The story then takes you through one day when Marco only sees a horse pulling a man on a broken-down wagon on Mulberry Street. But Marco soon imagines something much grander. If you change a horse for a zebra, that's better. Or you could change that zebra for a large reindeer. Or better yet, how about an elephant with a Rajah wearing rubies on a throne on top? And on it goes.When Marco gets home, he's elated. &quot;I ran up the steps and I felt simply GREAT!&quot; The reason for his excitement is because &quot;I HAD A STORY THAT NO ONE COULD BEAT!&quot; I think you'll agree.So what does he tell his father? You'll be amazed!I found that this book worked well at several levels. First, it captures the kind of miscommunication between parent and child that can set up barriers that exclude what could be much shared joy. Marco's father needs to learn to enjoy his son's imagination, as long as Marco isn't confused about what is real and what is imagination.Second, many people have trouble understanding how to be creative. Substitution of elements is a classic technique. Here, the structure of that process is elegantly displayed. First, you replace one element. Then you see if that helps you see a way to create a related replacement of another element. Then what does that suggest? And on it goes. Soon, there is no obvious link back to the beginning, but you have created something wonderful that would have been hard to do from a blank sheet of paper. Fiction writers, pay attention!Third, most children these days complain that they are bored all of the time if they don't have someone putting on a world class act for them. Here is a good role model for how they can create an exciting set of thoughts out of something very mundane. Wow! Is this needed, or what?To take advantage of this potential, I suggest that you and your child go out for a walk and play this imagination game together. Then, come back and make a book out of the experience that recounts how you went from one step to another. That's a wonderful way to ensure that your child's natural brilliance has a chance to develop even further, and she or he will realize that you want to enter into play with him or her. Wonderful bonding will result!Enjoy all of the potential of everyone and everything!"},{"Title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Books)","review":"This is a fine book. It appeals to everyone I know, from a bright young sprite to an old grump. I especially love to read it aloud because it has great rhythm and rhyme and a refrain, that everybody likes to join in on. I also recommend it for purchase for your own small child, grandchild, neighbor or friend, because even non-readers will pull it off the shelf over and over again. Seuss's pictures are completely engaging. I'll close with one piece of trivia: This was the first children's book Seuss ever wrote. At the time, he was making his living drawing cartoons for magazines, newspapers, and advertising campaigns. I've read his own account of how he got started on it. He was on a cruise during a storm, listening to his ship's engines pound out a rhythm and he came up with the refrain. Started to make notes as to just what his narrator might see, worked on the text and added drawings at home, and sent it out to editors only to have it rejected umpteen times. Finally he just happened to bump into a editor he knew who liked it and he was off on a new career. What a genius."},{"Title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Books)","review":"New York City at a time when seeing a horse and wagon was so common-place that Marco, walking home from school had to think of something better to tell his dad when he got home. And, oh, what sights he saw! right there on Mulberry Street. Elephants, Eskimos, airplanes dropping confetti, and &quot;a Chinese boy, who eats with sticks.&quot; It was great for a little boy in the late 30s in Northern Minnesota, and little kids love when I read it here in California in the 90s. It gives a feeling of Lower Manhattan that can be still found in the city today, though the horse and wagon might be harder to find. Wonderful imagery!"},{"Title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Books)","review":"The main character in this book is named Marco, and he has a slight problem with an over-active imagination. Every morning when Marco leaves home to walk to school, 'Dad always says to me, \\"Marco, keep your eyelids up and see what you can see.\\"' We meet Marco when he is on the way back from school and all he's noticed 'was a horse and a wagon on Mulberry Street.' Marco isn't too proud of this observation, \\"That can't be my story. That's only a start. I'll say that a ZEBRA was pulling that cart!\\"Slowly and surely the story changes, now the zebra is pulling a chariot, now it's a reindeer, next it's pulling a sled and before you know it, he's got two giraffes and an elephant pulling a big brass band with a trailer attached on behind going through town escorted by the police. Marco gets so excited about this 'story that no one could beat! And to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street!' But when Dad asks him what he sees he replies '\\"Nothing\\" I said, growing red as a beat, \\"but a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry street.\\"'The story is told in rhyme, as you might be able to see from some of the quotes I used. The story flows wonderfully, just like all of Dr. Seuss' works. The pictures are wonderful as well. The way all the animals are smiling and seem pleased that they get to pull these things is just really cute. The colors used are really nice, and the pictures are really bold and bright.Personally, this is one of my favorite Dr. Seuss books because I really like Marco's imagination and how he is always telling 'such outlandish tales... turning minnows into whales'.Loggie-log-log-log"},{"Title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Books)","review":"My favorite book out of the ten I read is And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street by Dr. Seuss. I liked this book because after you read it your imagination is running wild. It is a book about a young boy's imagination when you can't stop it from running like an Energizer battery. After the story was over I couldn't stop thinking about more things to add to the young boy's story to make it even better. It is a great book for this project because you are really tapping into your childhood and your young imagination. I think everyone should read this book to see the magic of being a child. If you like Dr. Seuss books this is one you will really enjoy. It is fast pace and it rhymes to help the story be more fun.My stepmom thought that this book was very creative because it was full of imagination. This book made her laugh because all of Marco's ideas were very silly and fun. She thought that it read at a very fast pace. She also loved the pictures and drawings because they kept changing as the boy's thoughts kept elaborating. The words rhymed from line to line keeping her interest throughout the book. Lastly, she shared that Dr. Seuss is one of her favorite authors of all time."},{"Title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Books)","review":"Seuss knows,as any good children's writer should, that the best source is the uninhibited child's delightful imagination.Only a young,fresh mind can make up a story that no one could beat...from seeing a horse &amp; cart on Mulberry Street."},{"Title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Books)","review":"This book spotlights the line between imagination and deception. An imaginative boy thinks outlandish thoughts and even considers telling them as the truth. Just before I read the last page to my children (ages 5, 3, and 1), I asked them what they thought Marco would tell his father. My children gave sincere thought to the question and one of them decided that he would tell them the imagined story and not the real one. They were delighted with the ending and when asked to tell me three things about the book, they responded that the book was about \\"telling the truth\\".Despite the wholesomeness of the ending, the book is filled with fun that is so typical of Dr. Seuss. It gives a nudge toward thinking outside of the box and making the most of your surroundings. My girls were smiling and intently listening from start to finish."},{"Title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Books)","review":"We, fourth and fifth graders, read And to Think That I Saw it on Mulberry Street by Dr Seuss . A boy walking on Mulberry Street was going to his house when he sees a horse pulling a wagon and starts adding spectacular things to it like zebras, elephants, and more while going to his house from school. He describes what he thinks the horse and the wagon will look like with the stuff on it. Then he puts more to make it like no other. He did this because his dad said to look and see what you can see but he turns stuff into something amazing like turning minnows into whales. The illustrator carefully chose when to add color and when to not. It's a great a book because it he turns things into better things like changing a horse to a zebra to a reindeer and then to an elephant. If you look closely you will find extra funny stuff."},{"Title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Books)","review":"Well just about any hard core fan of Dr. Seuss will have read this work, or at the very least know of it. Even those that are not big-time Seuss lovers will at least have heard of it.In children's literature we have three authors that are almost universally know. First of course is the unequaled Beatrix Potter, then the Brothers Grimm, and right up there with them is Dr. Seuss. Stop and ask anyone, at random, on the street and the chances are pretty good that they will know who you're talking about.This work, \`Mulberry Street' is Theodor Seuss Geisel's first published book for children. He of course went on to write over 60 others in a long and very, very fruitful career. The first thing that the reader must remember when first reading this work is that it was published in 1937 and as I said, it was his first work. Times were different in1937; different artistic standards, different attitudes. That being said though, the genius of Seuss shines through on every page and frame in this book.Already, the author has use the odd meter which has become so familiar, the same propensity to draw the strange looking critters and creatures which have become so beloved, and the theme of starting simple and adding to the story as it progresses is quite evident and will be seen through the entire body of his life's work.A young lad is walking down Mulberry Street and spots a horse and wagon. (Actually, in 1937 this was a very common sight). The boy notes that telling this story of just seeing a broken down wagon just won't to. So being like most little boys our hero starts adding and embellishing. Suddenly the old horse becomes a prancing zebra and then the wagon becomes a Roman chariot being driven by a charioteer. Each page finds our little story teller adding to and modifying his story until the end when we have an entire parade including a police escort, an airplane, brass band, the Mayor and city council and a whole cast of characters included.In the end, when asked by his father what he saw on his way home from school, reality hits the youth. I loved the ending.Is this thee best Seuss book? That of course is in the eye and mind of the reader. I personally think not, but on the other hand I have not read a Dr. Seuss book that I did not like. I was able to relate to the young man quite well and as a matter of fact, he and I shared many of the same imaginative characteristics at that age. I suspect that most kids into day's world will be able to relate t to this also.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (I Can Read It All By Myself Beginner Books)","review":"This is a classic Seuss book - strange, wild, rhyming. Marco is obliged to tell his father what he saw every day. But all he's seen today is a horse and wagon. (Ah, timeshift. If I saw a horse and wagon on the street it really WOULD be worth talking about!) So he changes a detail or two, and in a one-person version of telephone goes dashing up the stairs to tell his dad all about the BIG BAND and PLANES and ELEPHANTS he saw.Hilarious :)I will note that there's a mention of a \\"Chinese man who eats with sticks\\".

I was inspired to create more than one of the projects in this book, and it also helped me think more creatively when I looked at some of the things I already had laying around in the shed.This book has projects that will please the most sophisticated gardener, as well as projects for gardeners who like a more primitive or country look. Miller and Irwin have an original and creative sense of style and many of the projects in this book are very different from the standard copycat projects everyone else seems to have. Planters, benches, trellises and projects that are just plain fun fill the book.As the book progresses, you will see some of my favorite projects, such as a huge pinwheel, which I am very excited about making for my children's garden. You will learn step by step techniques for creating garden ornamentation like a glass hanging planter or a window leg table from pieces that you can find in your local salvage yard or pieces you may even have in your own cellar.All in all, there are over forty ideas with step by step instructions. There are also many more ideas to inspire you to create you own garden art and structures in the galleries of additional ideas.The best thing about this book is that it is not just a pattern book for making projects. It is also set up to teach you to look for and use salvage to create your own unique pieces. It is well written, crammed with ideas, and fun to read. The pleasure these women feel when they create a new ornament for their gardens comes through very clearly in this book."},{"Title":"Salvage Style for the Garden: Simple Outdoor Projects Using Reclaimed Treasures","review":"Most of us know that using a wine barrel cut in half makes a great planter.

Florinda Donner-Grau is an elegant writer, but she accomplishes this without losing the directness that marked Castaneda's writing. This book is a look at sorcery from the perspective of a woman -- but it focuses more on the abstract aspects of sorcery than Taisha Abelar's book, much more akin to &quot;The Eagle's Gift&quot; and &quot;The Fire From Within.&quot;On the other hand, if you've never read any of these books before, this is an excellent place to start -- especially if you're a woman. The author doesn't assume any knowledge of the world of sorcery, and more or less presents her experiences from the ground up, making it very much accessible to anybody. All you'll really need is an open mind and a surplus of energy, and the very act of reading this book will become a transient act of sorcery itself."},{"Title":"Being-in-Dreaming: An Initiation into the Sorcerers' World (Harper Odyssey)","review":"If this was the first book I picked up and read on the subject of Sorcery, Toltecs or such I would be lost as far as getting any real meaning out of it. I think it best to read Castenada and Sanchez first."},{"Title":"Being-in-Dreaming: An Initiation into the Sorcerers' World (Harper Odyssey)","review":"A similar story like Taisha but in a 'dreaming' fashion which makes the reading a little bit more difficult. I like to find Florinda aware of her dream to find later that it was just another dream and so on until she finds the key."},{"Title":"Being-in-Dreaming: An Initiation into the Sorcerers' World (Harper Odyssey)","review":"Donner is supposdly one of Castanada's \\"inner circle disciples\\" that has dropped out of the public eye. This book is just a continuation of the Castanada myths. This is a difficult book to take serious, unless your new and naive to Castanada's writing and are still entralled by the myths. Donner's book is just another typical Castanada story with a slightly different twist to it, in order to sound original and credible. This technique has worked well for a whole slew of parasitic writers that re-write the basic Castanada themes and present them as original and make a ton of money off the gullible. She is just another parasite ripping off Carlos Castanada devotees."},{"Title":"Being-in-Dreaming: An Initiation into the Sorcerers' World (Harper Odyssey)","review":"With this book, Florinda Donner (FD) gives us another view of the sorcerer's world revealed in the works of Carlos Castaneda (CC) - the way of knowledge ; the warriors path. As with CC's books it was a difficult book for me to put down. Unlike CC, however, FD's presentation is much more of a view from the outside, only entering that world for brief periods. Perhaps because FD is a woman, or maybe because she is not a &quot;nagual&quot;, her tales of power bring that world to the reader in a unique way. It's the same world, seen through a different pair of eyes. Eyes which, for me, could more likely have been my own.In one sense, &quot;Being In Dreaming&quot; is more believable than the stories of CC. The tales have a more ordinary, real-life quality, while still being told artfully and with a great sense of adventure and humor. This same real-life quality, however, in a sense makes it more difficult to accept the juxtaposition of such people to our day-to-day reality.Throughout most of the book, it's easy to think (of the characters in &quot;Being In Dreaming&quot;) things like &quot;those people are crazy&quot;, or &quot;they're just irresponsible non-conformists&quot;. But by the end of the book, our own phantom-like nature becomes clear, and one is left with the haunting realization that it's we, not they, who are not seeing &quot;ourselves and our surroundings for what we really are: breathtaking events that bloom into transitory existence once and are never to be repeated again&quot;.Where CC's works are like high explosives, shattering the ego at it's foundation, &quot;Being-In-Dreaming&quot; is like a subtle, consistent chipping-away at that same foundation. While the ego has the capacity to totally rebuild itself; to simply &quot;forget&quot; the blasts of CC, FD's stories enter the reader's mind and remain, like those small plants that grow in the cracks of huge boulders, eventually cracking them to pieces.The subtitle, &quot;An Initiation into the Sorcerer's World&quot;, is a very good description. Read with caution."},{"Title":"Being-in-Dreaming: An Initiation into the Sorcerers' World (Harper Odyssey)","review":"A masterpiece. This book, like Taisha Abelar's \\"The Sorcerer's Crossing\\", is very well written and done with the same impeccable spirit as Castaneda's books. Fiction myth or truth; what one gains from the books will depend on the individual and their own sense of magic."},{"Title":"Being-in-Dreaming: An Initiation into the Sorcerers' World (Harper Odyssey)","review":"I like this book for the very fact that there are no teachings. Although I enjoy Castaneda's teachings, he can get very bogged down and frustrating. Books are the western way for learning, but \\"experiencing\\" is worth more than a thousand words in any book, especially, if one is to receive any training in shamanism, etc, or for that matter medicine, law, psychology, etc. Castaneda writes well, but is still just an intensely involved anthropologist in his projects.I also wouldn't say this book was a waste of money (buy it second-hand...). And, self-importance is the irony of this book - of any of Castaneda's books. In fact, if I remember correctly, Don Juan constantly reprimands Castaneda for being so self-important.I enjoyed the stories and EXPERIENCES of this book and the descriptions of the sorcerers. Florinda's descriptions made these people come to life and not remain flat, one-dimensional persona. Who would have thought that Casteneda by any other name, was funny and NOT entirely a self-absorbed person.

The strength of the book is the excellent style and grammar in the writing. I don't rate a book on style and grammar alone. The content basically lacks existential meaning.However the author does stab at how one can get others to submit to being controlled. For example, the controller claiming they have supernatural power like reading the other persons mind, getting the submissive to identify with a type of thinking that says, \\"if that is true then this must be true\\" when the two have little or no correlation, and the age old control technique of \\"give up self\\" to gain super powers. Control also is shown in the insecurity and anxiety of the relationships.Unless you only want to witness good grammar, I don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Being-in-Dreaming: An Initiation into the Sorcerers' World (Harper Odyssey)","review":"I write this review with the great reverance for its author, Florinda Donner.As controversial as any book by Carlos Castaneda, no one like Florinda captures that something, the essence of what we find in all Castaneda books. A path of subjugation of the personal self to the greater force, the binding force of the Universe, as it's called in Tensegrity.The book is not easy to understand. After all - there is nothing to understand, but only to enter into the enticing wonderful world where (quoting the nagual) \\"we gotta cancel out the self - otherwise the curtain is down\\". That alone can be practiced for a very long time.But than again, I wouldn't take this as a text book - it is rather a feat in perception, performed by a very talented adept, under an equally talented guidence. That said, i was surprised at how well she explains the use of the shifting of the assemblage point to perform the basic tasks from basic moving to doing her graduate work, etc.It becomes apparent that Florinda was a somnabulist - not many of us are, so we need to do much more than her to get where she was from the start. On that note, i would say that we can start from having her boyish courage, and relentless passion that is such a powerful signature of her spirit."},{"Title":"Being-in-Dreaming: An Initiation into the Sorcerers' World (Harper Odyssey)","review":"More from the feminine view of the teachings of don Juan Matus and the Toltec way of knowledge - a great balance to what Carlos Castaneda wrote - especially if you are a woman."},{"Title":"Being-in-Dreaming: An Initiation into the Sorcerers' World (Harper Odyssey)","review":"I loved this book.

I say in the middle of the action because, even though it doesn't appear to be so, serious trouble is brewing in the midst of the mountains.Another thing to be noted about this book is that it breaks away from the Companions of the Hall at times and introduces new, though equally welcome, characters--and a bit of politics. But fear not, readers! This isn't just politics--it's dwarven politics, complete with rioting and tavern fights. At first I found the political aspect and the break away from the Companions irritating and time-consuming, but by the time I was a third of the way through the book that plot, too, had drawn me in, and I anticipated the latest developments.Many near miracles happen towards the end of the book (all of which earned a welcome sigh of relief after a daunting climax!) and there are characters from other FR novels popping in and out from time to time. I feel that the best part of the novel was the subtle character growth occurring in several of the characters, and I at one point found myself cheering on Wulfgar, a character I have never before even remotely liked. And, of course, there are the pitched battles and heroic moments for which Salvatore is so famous, all present and out in force in the latter half of the novel, especially. Next October (and the release of the next novel in the trilogy) can't come soon enough."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"R.A. has definitely laid the groundwork for a fantastic trilogy.

The character development of everyone else in the book was well done. I also give him credit for not giving three chapters worth of back story constantly and just accepting that most people know the story like an old blanket and just want the next step, not a refresher course.Also Bob, thank god it isn't another revenge against the traitor so that Lloth will retain me to her favor.

There are many good things, and many things that just don't seem right in this book.The thing that is right, is that Salvatore tries to make the group of protagonists like they were in the two previous trilogies that I mentioned. He succeeds.The action and fight sequences are as good as ever, and there is a fair amount of humor, too.But, that is about it. Now comes the bad stuff.First off, there doesn't seem to be a real plot to the book. It starts off with a concrete plot, then something else just comes up, and the book just seems to go from random event to random event is some instances.Secondly, Salvatore mars this book by bringing in characters from other books and he also creates a whole side story that doesn't really matter at all until he just throws it in at the end to make it seem like it mattered. And this side story takes up at LEAST 50 pages of this fairly slim, 345 page book.Lastly, there are some times in the book, very similar to Drizzt's &quot;diary&quot; entries (which are outside of the main text, and are a good addition), that just don't seem to belong. He is a little too wordy in these cases when a simple paragraph might have done better to get his point across, rather than 2 pages.It seems that I am a little harsh, but I was hoping to get a Crystal Shard, or Homeland, or Starless Night, and I got something that didn't quite make it. Overall, this book deserves your time, but don't get your hopes up too high. And, even though it is called &quot;The Hunter's Blades Trilogy,&quot; Drizzt is at best featured equally, when compared to all of the rest of the crew."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book Rules.

I realize it's a fantasy story, but to really care for and appreciate the characters one must be able to associate with them on some level. Drizzt has passed that point. You don't feel any sense of mortal danger for him any longer, or for any of the characters for that matter. They always do the impossible without the slightest chance of failure. The thing that makes great heroes is the their ability to overcome great adversity through rigorous and often painful experience. Even when Catti-brie is almost killed, you never truly feel that she is in mortal danger. The calvalry ALWAYS comes on time, and the only people killed are minor characters that you barely remember their names, if they are even introduced. It makes the supporting cast a little unbelievable and extraneous at best. Don't get me wrong it was an entertaining read. Salvatore has great driscriptive ability and the the fights in this are truly wonderful, but that's all that the book is - fight after fight. All the plot is, is filler between the fight scenes. I love a good drow plot as much as the next person, but does everything have to have the drow behind it? The Forgotten Realms is rich in other species and factions that could easily make for a far more interesting plot than the drow."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Your books are too good to be true.

It would have been much appreciated to have some character developement. Say, Drizzt saying \\"Cattie-brie, I love you, Wulgar, go to hell, you stupid idiot\\" (wahahaha). I also think that Artemis should come back, but not as the evil Kill-Drizzt maniac, but rather as a character with some real personality.Considering Salvatore has managed to write so many books about one character and still keep his readers entertained is amazing. Even more amazing, is no matter how much I tell myself, Drizzt is one of those \\"perfect\\" characters I usually don't like (never makes a mistake fighting, too honorable to admit his love, and most important, he is brought up in an evil environment, and is somehow kind??) he still manages to be one of my favorite fantasy ever characters ever!! The book is still worth the read, and if I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars, rather than just 3 or 4."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Once agains R.A. Salvatore has proved that he is truly a literary Legend. The Thousand Orcs, His latest book offers a very personal look into each of His core characters lifes, as a group, but more importantly, as individual. The Troupe is on their way back to Mithral Hall when they come across the battered remains of a dwarven caravan with quite the grim tale to tale. From Bruneor's internal conflict, knowing his place as the rightfull king of Mithral Hall and giving up His life among his freinds traveling the roads and facing the dangers of the wilds in a fashion that only He can, to Wulfgars own struggle, feeling that He must give up his warriors heart and path to see to his responisblities to His new family. From the emergance of rumblebelly(who has come into his own-*I am so proud) to stand and fight beside his fellow troupe members, to the budding relationship of Catti-brie. It is a non-stop adventure, I personally went through the book in one day........But then when it comes to Drizz't and company how can you not find it difficult, if not impossible( for me it was the latter) to put the book down, Definatly a Salvatore Classic ........Nuff said ya heard."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I cut my fantasy fiction teeth on the Dragonlance novels and the other D&amp;D novels back in the day as a teenager in the late 80's/early 90's. That's what Mr. Salvatore's novels were good for then as now. Thousand Orcs is no exception. But I think some people who are new to the books need to be told up front in some way that &quot;Hey, this book is probably best enjoyed if you are a teenaged boy!&quot; I pick up these books by Salvatore, Weis &amp; Hickman, and the rest now and then and I just can't get through them anymore, because I've grown past the reading level required, and also because I've read the mature fantasy of George RR Martin and David Gemmell and their ilk. So maybe we need to start publishing this stuff and marketing it as Young Adult fiction or something. Just so we won't have all these people clamoring about the quality of the writing. This stuff is great for teens, but adults should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"If your a longtime reader of R. A. Salvatore and you've followed the life of Drizzt then this is the next step in your existance.I'd have to agree with Salvatore, though, that its time to give Drizzt and his group a rest. They've lived life, they've run through adventures that would kill any other person (and has even brought people back from the Abyss!). Come on, stop telling Salvatore to make Drizzt work harder. He deserves to retire.But...The book is not nearly as great as The Dark Elf Trilogy, but starts a great tale that can lead to more great adventures. Your old friends are back, along with some doo dads. Oi oi!Salvatore spends some time with the Orcish perspective, and follows the story of many different races with all their own preceived notions of the world.I'll let you read it for yourself and decide, but I believe its a great addition to my library. I'd give this book 4 stars, except for that fact that I want to read the next book now. :) If it can draw me back into Drizzt world then that's worth another star."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Please note - this is a review for the entire series. I don't really believe in reviews for single books in a trilogy, since everyone expects to read all the books or avoid them if they don't suit their needs.I won't claim I've read all of Salvatore's writing (I still have two trilogies of his fresh ordered waiting to be read) but I've certainly read all the major series - all of Drizzt, Daemonwars Saga and Cleric's Quintet. Out of those, the newest complete Drizzt trilogy is probably the weakest.You won't have anything to complain regarding Salvatore's writing - it's as good as always. The descriptions are good, the battle scenes are quite believable - it's the character development I couldn't stand.Salvatore has been including \\"philosophical\\" elements in his Drizzt books for some time now. The problem is, in the previous series they were marginal. Now, I have a feeling like half of the entire trilogy is devoted to describing Drizzt's moral dillemas. Which is not something Salvatore does well. He isn't too good at building characters with a deep personality - I've read Robin Hobb recently, so I do have a comparison. That's not really something I expect of a Forgotten Realms novel, too. Salvatore tried to make a \\"deeper and darker\\" trilogy - and I am forced to claim it was an ambitious failure.Now, let me rephrase - this is not a bad novel or a bad trilogy. You will still have all the elements known from the previous Drizzt novels. For me, the books were simply too slowly paced and most of the character development scenes - boring. If you want to follow Drizzt's adventures after reading all the previous novels, then you'll still want to read this, just as I did. It will probably be a better read for wholehearted fans of the Drizzt characters, but for the same reasons, it will probably be a much harder read for those who don't feel for that character. The choice is yours. I'd give the book 3.5, maybe even more towards 4 than towards 3, but it still falls short of what a book needs for me to give it a four-stars rating."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The story starts off in the spine of the world.

The story moved very slowly and the characters were very shallow. I kept waiting for the story to pick up, and was sorely disappointed when the predictable end came.

I have been a fan of Salvatore's for many years now and can easily look past the pulp that Mr. Salvatore's writing has become. This stuff is written for teenaged boys! (That's where I started) The thing that really kills these books is the predictability. Everything you think is going to happen eventually happens! I'll tell you what, everything you think is going to happen in the following two book probably will too! Two other points: #1) How many times can Cattie-Brie fire an arrow \\"just in time\\" to save Wulfgar's \\"hide\\" #2) What is up with the names?!!! Can you believe some of these names: General Dagnabbit, Shingles McRuff and there was a guy in the last book Sharky or something! OH MY GOD! These are by far the worst ficticious names ever in the history of literature! Do yourself a favor and read Robert Jordan's books. Or read Salvatore up to Sea of Swords, this one isn't worth it....unless you like to figure out the whole book by page 12. Just say it after me \\"NO MORE DROW, NO MORE DROW\\"! Can't Drizzt and co go on an \\"Adventure\\"?"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Dwarf King Bruenor is on his way back to Mithral Hall for his ceremonial crowning when he gets word of an orc raid. Together with a small group of fellow dwarves, with his drow elf friend Drizzt Do'Urden, and with a pair of humans, Bruenor heads to the battle. He has been reluctant to seize his crown at any rate from fear that his advisors will keep him from adventure, and this may be his last chance. Bruenor doesn't count on an alliance between the orcs and the frost giants of the north. Drow renegades have forged this unlikely alliance in hopes of creating chaos--chaos that they can exploit for their own advantage. And the death of King Bruenor sounds like the most profitable kind of chaos possible.Author R. A. Salvatore continues his story of Drizzt and his friends as they adventure across a violent world of magic and conflict. Drizzt is in love with a human woman, but wonders whether he dares bring a half-drow into the world, and whether he would be doing a kindness to marry a woman who will be old while he is still a young warrior. Meanwhile, dwarf relations between Mithral Hall and Mirabar have reached a critical point--leading to a near civil war in the mixed human/dwarf town of Mirabar (this conflict is barely integrated into the main plot line--presumably it will become more significant in later volumes in the series).Early on in the novel, it appeared that orc King Obould would break out of the traditional orc stupidity mode and actually develop intelligent plans to do serious damage to the orcs and humans that oppose him. Quickly, however, he reverts, failing to take advantage of his giant allies, falling into obvious traps, and generally behaving like the traditional stupid orc. While he can't be faulted for this, it was a bit of a disappointment to me, at least. It is difficult to see any number of orcs as a real threat to an organized force of dwarves, especially one backed by the formidable blades of Drizzt. The enemy drow never really unveil themselves and never lend much intelligence to their allies' plans.Like many Wizards of the Coast novels, THE THOUSAND ORCS has something of the feel of a role-playing adventure--a small party of adventurers is thrust into an escalating adventure where more and more enemies are gradually introduced. Although Drizzt is a fan favorite, there isn't a lot of character development in this novel, at least. Salvatore's fine writing makes this one worth reading--but if you happen to miss it, you'll be able to pick up the characters without any problem."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"If you liked the other books in this series, then you'll enjoy this one.

If you like Drizzt, you'll like this book, but don't expect too much out of it."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"After a bit of a lull with Paths of Darkness--a series only true Drizzt fans would enjoy--Salvatore does a much better job with the first book of The Hunter's Blade triology. Everything that's grand about Salvatore's writing is present: fantastic battles, great characters, and converging plots. Like many of the other reviewers I felt the Drizzt/Catti-Brie romance is dragging out incessantly. My other minor gripe is that the main characters--being the Companions of the Hall--were often less interesting than the ancillary ones. I found myself more entertained with Torgar and Pikel than I was with Catti-Brie, Wulfgar, and Drizzt. Still, the Salvatore does a great job adding depth and new twists to Bruenor and Regis.Minor aside: this is the nicest a Drizzt book has ever looked. The borders, segment breaks, and logos are of a higher production value than previous Salvatore tomes. Great cover too!If you've enjoyed Salvatore's previous work, but felt Paths of Darkness was under par, this book should bring him back into your favor."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book marked my first excursion into R.A. Salvatore's literature, and I must say that I liked what I saw. While I am only passingly familiar with the Drizzt stories, Salvatore provided enough backstory in certain places for me to at least get the picture.For those of you expecting an epic battle between Drizzt and an army of humanoids, you'll be a little disappointed. Although the thousand orcs do appear, for the most part Drizzt has the benefit of his companions and doesn't really face a whole army until very late in the book.However, this book stands on its own very well despite not giving the action that the title and cover art promised. This is a story about change, and how each of Drizzt's company deals with it. Each of the characters are going through their own trials: Bruenor is returning to Mithral Hall as king and is desperately searching for one last adventure, Wulfgar must balance his warrior spirit with a newfound family, Regis is striving to become a more useful and essential part of the company after a brush with death, and Cattie-Brie and Drizzt are encountering several snares in their relationship. Salvatore's characters are very well done and come across as very human, with their own strengths and failings.As an added bonus, I discovered that Salvatore was a superb writer when it comes to non-human races. His story features orcs, drow, giants, dwarves, halflings, and elves, and they all come off as a part of their own race. A typical fantasy novel usually treats dwarves as small bearded humans, elves as pointy-eared and arrogant but woodsy people, and so on. The differences between the various Forgotten Realms races really come out here.The writing occasionally stumbles and the plot becomes a bit predictable near the end of the story, but overall R.A. Salvatore did a wonderful job here in detailing very interesting characters and putting them into a very good starting story for this trilogy."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have been reading other reviews of this book recently, and I am slightly at a loss. I have read this and the The Lone Drow, as well as every other Drizzt novel. I will focus mainly on the negative reviews I've seen, as well as a few of my own thoughts. I noticed that many of the more negative reviews seems directed toward the &quot;lack of dazzling swordplay.&quot; Perhaps these people are correct, in that Drizzt doesn't have a highly skilled opponent in this first installment. But should that take away from the excitement of the read? No, and it doesn't. There is still action aplenty for those who enjoy a good battle. Just because we don't see the skills of an Artemis Entreri or Dantrag, doesn't mean the book is not a wonderful read. In fact, many of the dark elf books don't feature this type of battle, two highly skilled opponents in a duel to the death. The action is still fast paced and fans of the genre as well as newcomers will find something special.I would also like to comment on some peoples thoughts that the intermitent personal thoughts of Drizzt somehow slow the story or take away from it. From the first time I read this book, I thought of R.A. Salvatore as a philosipher, with a deep understanding of the human spirit. I have been told by many friends that Drizzts feelings mirrored their own, and Mr Salvatore has not fallen off his game with this book. His feelings of isolation, even among friends can mirror our own. When we were deployed for nine months to Afhganistan with the US army, some of us carried Drizzts words with us. Salvatore gave us hope and strength when it was hard to come by.I think that some reviewers of this book need to look deeper that the words before them and search themselves for the story here. This is an excellent read and I would recommend this and any other book by one of the masters of the genre"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The Thousand Orcs is the first novel in The Hunter's Blades trilogy. In this Forgotten Realms story, four drow have convinced King Obould Many-Arrows to ally his orcs with Gerti Orelsdottr's frost giants. In their initial joint raid, a band of twenty orcs and two frost giants attack a dwarf caravan from Citadel Felbarr, killing all but two of the dwarves. Then a band of a hundred orcs and four frost giants level the village of Clicking Heels.When Bruenor receives word that Gandalug Battlehammer has died, he leaves Icewind Dale to return to Mithral Hall. He is accompanied by Regis, Wulfgar, Catta-brie, Drizzt Do'Urden, and a small army of dwarves. First they detour to Mirabar to agitate the dwarves there and then to the Fell Pass, where they run into the survivors of the dwarf caravan. They track down and destroy the band of giants and orcs that had attacked Clicking Heels, alert Mithral Hall to the danger, and set out to warn Shallows town. Obould and Gerti soon learn of the presence of Bruenor in Shallows and sent a band of ten giants and a thousand orcs to bring back his head.Meanwhile, back in Mirabar, Marchion Elastul is showing his paranoia and enraging some of his dwarves, particularly Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker.This new series by Salvatore describes a massive attack of goblinkin and giants against the humans, dwarves and elves. Drizzt is in the vanguard of the defense, alone except for Gwenhwyvar, and not even knowing whether his friends are still alive.Maybe the negative reviews on this novel are a kind of backhanded compliment to the popularity of Drizzt and his companions. I don't see why people get so bent out of shape over an adventure fantasy? Of course, Drizzt and his best friends are not likely to be bumped off; what series ever did that? What, you point to the New Jedi Order series? Hey, you forgot about the Demonwars series! Maybe Salvatore WILL terminate his most popular character! But you will have to read the other two books in the series to find out! Hee hee hee.For those of you who live only for the fighting, get used to character development. Salvatore is obviously going to continue to develop his main characters, hopefully with less agonizing and more swordfighting than Hamlet, but these personalities are definitely going to change.Recommended for Salvatore fans and anyone who enjoys desperate swordfights against impossible odds.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Since the Icewind Dale trilogy so many years back, Salvatore has been dazzling readers with his &quot;Drizzt Saga.&quot; The Thousand Orcs does not disappoint. Packed with exciting action sequences from a couple of combatants to all out battle sequences, this book delves into the depths of the characters so well developed.What makes this book stand out in this series?The mortality of his characters. The heros are not a group of untouchable superbeings fending off countless numbers of enemies, but instead a tight-knit group facing an uncertain future.Well, the future's not entirely uncertain. It is clear the rest of the trilogy, much like this book, will be nothing but a heart-pounding, page-turning adventure in reading!"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This was the first RA Salvatore book I read (though I had attempted to read the Demon Awakens but stopped because I had read too many &quot;youth from small village is suddenly thrust into danger that escalates to world-saving scope&quot; at that time.)I'd heard of Drizzt and his friends for years and of Mr. Salvatore's fan base in fantasy fiction and wanted a taste of what was going on.The book is action-packed in terms of combat, hurried marches to warn or save others, as well as plotting and scheming behind the scenes. However, what hurts this formula of action and plotting is that the action revolves around an uninteresting desire by the main characters to just hunt down some troubling orcs and giants in the region rather than face the crusty trappings of government. There is mention of a lost citadel, but overall I thought the plot was very thin, and so made the characeter's motivation a bit uninteresting. However, this does lead into the main character development of the tale, beginning around page 160, where the protagonists must face the fact that they are addicted to the dangers and excitement of the road and adventure. OK sounds nice, but is this all?The puppet-masters of the orcs and giants that are haranguing the countryside are revealed early on to be a foursome of outcasts who are bored and so looking for something to do with their time. The plot thickens later, but all the while I'm thinking, &quot;These are the villains of the piece?&quot; Well it does work out that the heroes are just thirsty for adventure and the villains are just as restless for something to do.There are side plots as well, many involving dwarfs, and the main storyline also revolves around newly crowned dwarven King Bruenor. All dwarves are stout, have funny names, and can take a beating. Get to like dwarves, because there's a lot of dwarf action here. In addition, there's a lot of dwarven humor. If you, like me, were disappointed in Gimli being made into a parody of dwarves in the Two Towers film, you will be annoyed by the goofy-named whacky dwarves like Pikel Bouldershoulder in this book.So, overall, I found the plot a bit uninteristing, the humor not aligned with my sense of fun, and the character development limited. But, to Mr. Salvatore, I say keep the flame of adventure and excitement alive! If you are a Drizzt fan, you'll likely enjoy this one. But if you are a fantasy fan wondering what's up with Mr. Salvatore's works, start somewhere else."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I've been a big fan of the entire series since I read the dark elf trilogy. It was so good that I even showed the book to some friends who also share the same enthusiasm about the series. Since then, I have read all of the Drizzit books (even the ones without him). I've found that only the first 7 (and the Entreri book) are fantastic. The rest much like this one are 50% garbage. I dont like Catterbrie, despite the fact that she has all of the great weapons she stinks. She is extremely annoying and I hope they kill her off. I also find her relationship with Drizzit ludicrous. Wulfgar was only cool when he was a bad ... barbarian instead of a loser with emotional problems, he should have stayed in the abyss. Regis was funny, now he's just annoying. Drizzit should go back to being a loner, its what he good at.

That's why I can't wait to pick up the sequel. The only qualm I have is that the characters name their weapons ... no problem with that, but the reader is never told this, so at first you're left wondering who Salvatore is talking about.)Style - 4 out of 5 (Right off the bat, Salvatore grips you into the story. His choice of words keep your mind flowing smoothly ... until you hit a one-on-one fight scene. In close fighting, Salvatore gives you a blow-by-blow, step-by-every single step description.

Drizzt's journal entries at the beginning of each section (four sections to a book, typically) are awesome! Reflective and wise. There is a lot of action in these books, and if you like fight scenes (with swords, war hammers, etc.,), you will find many in this book (as well as all of the others). I love that there are a lot of magical creatures (and monsters) in the book; dwarves, elves (moon, or good elves, as well as drow (dark, or bad elves), gnomes, goblins, orcs, and giants.

The rest is Dwarven politics (stupid names for Dwarves too -- Dagnabbit, Rockbottom, Shingles, Withergoo... references to fail and disease, as if the author dislikes this himself) involving characters I never enjoyed in the main series. Bruenor the boring, Regis & Cattibrie the annoying and Wulfgar the emo. Author brings in the Bouldershoulder brothers from his poorly done \\"Cleric Quintet\\" Forgotten Realms series, and these dwarven characters speak with atrocious accents. Accents whose purpose is demonstrating low intelligence.Four dark elf exiles are bored, so they've stirred up trouble in the region by manipulating frost giants (supposedly high intelligence in D&D; source material... stupid artillery in the book) and orcs into seizing land. The dwarven nations want their lands and fight. Drizzt shows up for a few battles, mostly vs. frost giants. That's it. Salvatore isn't much for characterization, none of his characters grow in this novel. It's not as good as the early volumes of Drizzt (don't really consider it a Drizzt novel), being mostly short stories about Dwarves.If you are looking for \\"One Dark Elf. Two Enchanted Blades. One Unknown Enemy. And a Horde of Invaders.\\" like the back cover advertises, you will not like the book. More than one dark elf, and the enemy is known by page 30 because Salvatore writes many scenes involving the bad guys. (I don't want to be the told the villains plans, I want to be shown them as they surprise the good guys!) Plus it's a slow starter because of the random Dwarf scenes.Overall, this book was a flop. Not recommended. If you want good Drizzt, start with the Dark Elf Trilogy."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I bought this book second hand in a small town while on vacation. This book seemed better than the alternatives (romance novels), so I bought it. I must admit that the book has been a really good read for someone who had never really considered themselves to be a reader of fantasy books. This was a true surprise for me, as the writing was vivid, clear, and fast paced. Almost as soon as I picked up the book, I was able to place myself in the lands where the book was set. The characters were clear and the action never ceased once it got started. It was just so well done, it almost felt like I had been reading similar novels for years. The only complaint, it was the start of a trilogy. Get it and enjoy!!!!"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Salvatore returns to his action origins and shows just how much he has grown as a writer since the first set of books (The Icewind Dale Trilogy) came out. The action is just as vivid as ever, refined and filled with movement. But Salvatore continues to raise the stakes, both on a personal and a universal level. Obould is a smart orc and he has come to power and wants the Northlands for himself. What's new about this? Orcs usually have only wanted to kill kill kill, but this Obould has a vision. The adventures begin right off and the companions battle fiercely for the cause of right. Excellent storytelling and easily read introspection engage the reader fully. This is a fine beginning to an exciting new trilogy by our favorite fantasy writer."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"When I started to read this book for a report in High school, I thought I would read it and get it over with.

This book was OUTSTANDING. I read it in a day, I couldn't put it down. I like this book not only because it is written by a great author but because the way in which he makes you feel when you read it (or any of his works for that matter). I had the feeling that I was actually in the story as another character sensing everything that they did, following them along their journey. I would give this book 10 stars if I could."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Perhaps I have grown to expect more from my favorite characters. This book is not very engrossing. Its a fair introduction to the next book maybe. I am simply not compelled by it.Perhaps if this is your first RAS book, you will enjoy it. But for me it was just another story in a different setting with new characters, that did not compare in character or plot depth to stories RAS already wrote about the lead characters.I get the impression he tries to do some things in this book which the editors prohibited, and so he hastily changed the plot in places. He has fixated on the ends, and so much less detail on the means. As if he had a skeleton outline, but needs to put another layer of flesh on it.Maybe its because I'm not scared of a pack of orcs. Simply not worthy enemies for the Companions of the Hall.Take notice, this is not RAS best work.If you have never read about these characters, its still a good introduction. If you have and want to see them again, still a good read. But stick with a used paperback copy :)"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"R.A. Salvatore has exceeded my expectations again with this amazing novel, the first of three. I write the review for The Lone Drow here as well. I sing the praises of both books. The lone Drow in fact has exceeded the success of The Thousand Orcs in many ways, though both are among the best books by R.A. Salvatore. I congratulate him on his success, and eagerly await the next installment, The Two Blades."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The Thousand Orcs is another book in the neverending saga of Drizzt Do'Urden and his companions. While at times Salvatore has seemed to be on autopilot with these characters this latest book feels fresh and continues the evolution of these people we have come to know and love.For those that enjoy AD&amp;D, Salvatore has always been the best writer to translate that world into prose. This time around the companions are faced with the challenge of defending areas of the Savage Frontier from attack by a large force of Orcs (if that wasn't obvious from the title).The pacing of the book is quick. Events never seem forced, instead evolving logically from one to another. Salvatore juggles the story between his cast of familiar characters and does it well. The novel doesn't have the dark tone of his recent books. The companions have passed through hard times and are reunited to face this new threat.The ending seems to be a bit of a stretch, but it does send the characters in a new direction that will make for interesting reading in upcoming books."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"R.A. Salvatore's newest Dark Elf book is a fantastic read that leaves fans everywhere waiting anxiously for the next book in the series! An awesome ending wraps a great book that won't leave anyone starved for action.Now I have to get this off my chest...the book kicks butt! That's not an exaggeration. If you are a fan of Dwarves (and who isn't heheh) then you are in for a real treat! I even sensed a little Demon Wars creeping into the story in the form of politics/tension between different cities (which I loved).Like I said there are dwarves, heheh, tons of them. Everyone's favorite Bouldershoulder brothers make an appearance along with some other familiar faces and some new ones. There are some parts in the book that make you pump your fist in the air and get those goosebumps you get, accompanied by a big grin (at least I do anyway).There are some awesome fights, vintage RAS, so you'll get your action fix big time. Some new behind the scene enemies are introduced, although not expanded on too much yet. I bet they play a bigger part in the rest of the series.One thing I have to say is the book has a pretty awesome ending (well, like I said, the whole book was awesome)! I won't give anything away, but it pumped me up big time. Who would think a few sentences could leave you wanting more sooo bad."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I disagree with the notion that books must have intellectual value--that smacks of snobbish elitism, no more and no less. At the same time, I have to agree that this isn't a must-have book unless you're a diehard fan. This reminds me more of a serial pulp fiction story that's stretched out a tad too far. It also seems that the book could've provided more value for the money. (Do the margins seem a little too broad, the text not as packed? Sheese.) I also agree in that Salvatore has a problem: he always has to spell everything out, what each character thinks and what each character plans on doing, as if he thinks his core readership have all suffered severe head trauma. This isn't a good thing, it makes things too predictable. The advantage for the reader is that it makes for light reading (I can finish a Salvatore book these days in under 3 or 4 hours), the disadvantage is that it isn't as gripping as previous books. It's my hope that Salvatore flexes his writing 'muscles' more in future books, otherwise you may as well wait for the softcover versions of his novels and spare your pocketbook the pain."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"= Yes, We DO Need Another Trilogy...Reviewer: K Gallagher from Honolulu, Hi United StatesRarely has any author, in any genre, created a series of such consistent quality as the Dark Elf books of R. A. Salvatore.Even so, that The Thousand Orcs (the fifteenth full-length novel in roughly as many years to feature characters introduced in the Icewind Dale trilogy!) stands as one of the finest installments in the series is nothing short of breathtaking.I write this review for the purpose of assuring any follower of the series who doubts that it can possibly go on for much longer that not only is this tale not showing its wear and tear, but, incredibly, taking full advantage of the ground gained (and, more importantly,loose ends tied up!) in Sea of Swords tobegin weaving something very new... at a truly remarkable pace.This is the tightest, fastest presentation since Starless Night, yet its attempt to cover a broad scope of intrigue, action, and personal relationships is the most ambitious since Siege of Darkness.The result is a nearly flawless creation that should set the heart of any true fan beating at life-threatening speeds.What do you know?We did need another trilogy after all."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Salvatore has done it again! The Thousand Orcs is a wonderfully written fantasy book that could have only been done by a master. We have followed Salvatore's standard core of characters down a multiplicity of roads and are now seeing a maturity and insight in the lives of each one.The Thousand Orcs starts in somewhat the way most good books must start, at the beginning of the tale. Drizzt and company are off to Mithral Hall and stumble upon the survivors of a neighboring dwarf contingent that have a bleak tale to tell. The hero's change course and take off on what they expect to be a grand adventure, unbeknownst to them the foe is quite formidable. We get to enjoy their triumphs as well as their failures.It's about time that a writer, a popular writer, realizes the level of intellect his readers have. When I first bought this book, I was afraid that Salvatore had perhaps fallen into the Louis L'Amour syndrome, that is that he writes one book fifty times. There are so many series on the market today and most of them are the same story over and over, with no growth in the characters from one story to the next. The main principles of the stories usually end up being flat and unbelievable.I found that the best part of the storyline was the surprise ending. Salvatore takes a good story and with the surprise ending, a great story rises from the ashes. He has definitely left the door open for the remaining books in this series. Salvatore has set himself up of the ruler of Tolkien's world and seems to enjoy the perch from above."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have been on one hell of a hot streak with fantasy novels lately, but I can't take credit for finding this one. To be perfectly honest, I probably wouldn't have even bothered with the Thousand Orcs, just based on the universe it takes place in (I'm a little opposed to reading the D&D; books - or at least I was). My aunt gifted this book to me, and I'm glad she did.When you purchase this book, you're introduced to some of the most elaborate, drawn out and interesting characters that you'll ever read about. You can tell that Drizzt, Bruenor, Wulfgar and all the rest of the ensemble cast have a good deal of history, and enough mystique for where Salvatore can take them that you remain intrigued.This is obviously not the first book in Salvatore's long series (I've since read his original trilogy - also spectacular), but it serves a decent enough purpose of drawing the reader in. You aren't ostracized for not being a longtime fan of the series. Rather, it's as if this book (and every other one, for that matter) is competent enough to make you want to read the others.The Thousand Orcs isn't just a story either. Advancing the plot would be one thing, but the book was intelligently crafted, and there are a lot of intricate designs woven through the author's craft. There was never one point in the book where I wanted to put it down and take a rest. I needed to find out what happened next. It's a wonder that I was able to convince myself to go back instead of forward, to read the rest of the Hunter's Blades Trilogy. I'm sure I'll get there though. This is one series you don't turn back on."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I purchased the Thousand Orcs when it first came out with the notion of reading it one day because the cover was so cool. That's how I pictured Drizzt. Spoiler alert: That scene was not in the book - 1 star. I've read just about all Salvatore's dark elf series and I'm a fan, but I found the book wanting. The entire book appeared to be nothing but several short stories about characters I don't really care about, other than Drizzt's core group. At the end it comes together, but it seemed forced. The jumping around to the various other groups was jarring and didn't add anything to the story. I feel that the author missed a golden opportunity to make this a mystery. Why are the orcs rampaging, why are the giants helping them, are the drow involved? I was expecting a lot more from the story and the author. But hey...the cover was cool."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This story was good. The problem with the Drizzt books is that the same 'Companions' seem to survive all obstacles. I would much recommend this to those who are new to the whole Drizzt, Bruenor, Wulfgar group since this story seems to be able to pick up directly after \\"The Halflings Gem\\" as if all the other books in between never happened.I just wonder how many more stories will go by before any of then actually die. Granted, I read every book up to this one but it still follows the same formulaic plot lines.If you don't mind the battle action but knowing that the main characters won't die (either because the fans like all of them too much or the author is afraid to kill any of them off), then this is for you. I mean, if a thousand orcs don't kill any of them, what will?"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I could read all these books twice really.

This book, the start of a new trillogy does not let fans down.Action and suspense is littered throughout the pages of this book. The plus about this book is that it seems that Drizzt and the gang have finally met their match.

However, I still recommend the book even though I think it is not as well done as his previous for Drizzt series."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"It was evident from the start, with all the talk of death in Drizzt's musings between sections that Salvatore was dwelling upon and drawing from the terrorist attacks in the US last year. It became more apparent as the story reached its climax and the decription of mutilated bodies, loss of friends and ultimately the collapse of a wizard tower that 9/11 was exactly what Salvatore was using as his inpiration for this novel.I didn't dislike the book, it though I wonder why all the these characters have such a hard time coming to terms with their own feelings. Drizzt speaks about living in the present yet he is too frightened to even speak his thoughts to the woman he loves. Build a bridge; get over it. Either kill her or let them get married.I believe that Salvatore is trying to breath life into Drizzt the same way the death of Chewbacca reanimated Han Solo. Lets hope it works, though unless a certain mortally wounded character ends up dying, this probably won't happen."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Salvatore's previous FR novel, &quot;Sea of Swords&quot; seemed a bit lackluster to me, so I was not as jazzed as I apparently should have been for the release of this book.

Yet The 1000 Orcs returned my faith in Drizzt Do'Urden books. The book did well in setting the stage for the upcomming trilogy, and made me want to read the approaching books even more. My one comment is that I would have liked to see Drizzt in a little more combat with his blades, the book set me up for far more combat then it delivered. Salvatore keeps one very special quality in mind with his characters, they are mortal and it is possible for them to die! Catti-brie wrestles with her own mortality throughout a good portion of the book (yet it isn't a dominating theme). All in all this was a great book, and once I started it I didn't put it down (read it in just about 2 days)."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book is without a doubt the most refreshing change of pace in the Dark Elf books yet!

Breunor, Wolfgar, Cattie-Brie and Regis have never been more than background characters for me (and other than Breunor, I find them pretty bland.) Drizzt is not the main character here. I know R.A. Salvatore is setting up the rest of the trilogy (at least I hope he is), but I'm dying for the Dark Elf to start doing his thing.I found it hard to get into this story. A lot of this has been said before in all the other books (Drizzt's soliloquy like diary notes in-between sections are particularly uninspired.) R.A. Salvatore still writes action well, but that's not enough to sustain the novel.The back cover says: One Dark Elf. Two Enchanted Blades. One Unknown Enemy. And a Horde of Invaders.A bit misleading.This is actually a story about Breunor Battlehammer faced with being King of Mithral Hall once again, the economic/political issues between Mithral Hall and Mirabar and lastly a horde of Orcs banding together with Frost Giants to conquer more land.

Considering it's the first book of a new trilogy from an ongoing series, it was a fun read with a reasonable amount of character development and just enough action to get me looking forward to the next one without feeling like I'd read an extended prologue.I loved the dwarves, especially Pikel the \\"Doo-dad,\\" and Salvatore writes them quite well, giving each of them a distinct personality.On the other hand, the biggest disappointment was the infamous lead, Drizzt, whose intermittent letters and incessant navel-gazing made him a rather annoying presence in the story. The parallels to racism and interracial relationships are rather heavy-handed and do nothing to really define the character beyond its archetype. Salvatore seems to be leaning on past stories a bit too much to carry that particular storyline.Overall, though, this book was a lot of fun and I am intrigued enough to check out some of his other books while awaiting the sequel."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Well sorry to be the negative one here, but I am an avid fan of Drizzt and I was not impressed at all!You think wow 1,000 orcs cool! sorryI have finished past Drizzt books in days, I was just glued to them.

You could have put all the usefull 'Drizzt book series' information into a couple chapters.And the usual best parts of the book (aka the fight scenes and character development)lacked in fullness. They just didn't seem as complete as past books. I have to say bad guy character build-up as well was pretty weak. And usual character sterotypes didn't match up with one main character, I won't say whom but fans of the series will know.All in all if you have free time, can borrow the book, and you enjoy the series, its your choice.

While the reuniting of the band is an important event, the fact that many of the difficulties brought about in the books between the Legacy of the Drow and this book continue to plague the adventurers. I fear that these stories will end up at the bottom of the scrap heap unless some absolutely new and fresh character development occurs. Until then, I suggest continuing to buy these, but don't be surprised when they stop being interesting."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Though I've played DnD for many years, this is the first Salvatore I've ever read (I picked the book up because he was in town for a book signing). While I think there's far better fantasy out there, this story was sort of light, cotton candy fantasy. Not that this is a bad thing.My only real complaint with the book is that the jacket is incrediby misleading. Don't expect Drizz't to solo 1000 orcs."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"RA Salvatore's THE THOUSAND ORCS is a fairly average piece of fantasy. It is obviously a continuation of a story that has been proceeding for some time and over many volumes. Not having read any the preceding novels I will have to say I found myself a bit lost for background at times, not unexpected.However given that it is usually much better to have read the prequels I would like to evaluate the work I did.Average. The writing was up to contemporary standards but thas about it. Character development somewhat on the skimpy side but adequate. Plot, eh, so so.Its not a dog by any means but it won't win any awards either."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The dialogue, and character names are laughable. Dagnabbit, Nanfoodle, Rockbottom, Runabout, Shingles, Withegroo, to name but a few. With names like this, I'm surprised I didn't find someone named; Goshdarnit, ohhell, or wyritethis? The only thing I can guess, is that he's under contract to write x number of books for Wizards and he's not happy about it. If you're tired of writing about Drizzt, just say no, but please don't butcher it. I've always loved Salvatore's books. Homeland was one of the best Fantasy books I've ever read; fun and inventive. The first of his stories not to borrow so heavily on Tolkien. This is by far his worst book to date. In a lot of ways I think Starless Night was the last great book in this series of characters. With the exception of Drizzt and Catti-brie, every other major player's stories in these books were finished, and finished well. The new beginnings and thoughtless banter that has grown since then, (including Wolfgar's rebirth) cheapen the story. It's like reading a comic. The X-men are good, but it gets pointless after a-while. The same group of people, year after year after year. The danger is gone when the characters become two-dimensional gods who can never die. If you've never read Salvatore, please, try the Icewind Dale Trilogy, The Dark Elf Trilogy, The Legacy, and Starless night. You will not regret it. Later books were good in one way or another, but they really lost the magic of the first few, and this new series is bad. I might have gotten somewhat into the story if it wasn't for the distain it seems this was written in. If the author reads these, please take little offense, I mean no disrespect. Salvatore is a great writer, but this was not a great book. Try his older work, when he was still hungry."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book is an excellent example of the skill of author R. A. Salvatore. Not only this book, but all his books which I've read have several things in common. Given that, here's what a Salvatore novel entails:He is known for being a great author, especially of fantasy. He's especially well-known for the many novels centering around Drizzt and company, and for the novels set in his world of Corona. The Thousand Orcs falls into the former category, dealing with the latest from Drizzt and his companions.His battle scenes are vivid, but not so weighty as to take away from the story. The characters are realistic and intrigueing, and the &quot;action&quot; in any given part of one of Salvatore's books might be a battle, political subterfuge, a character's emotional conflicts--in short, Salvatore isn't limited to skillful portrayel of battle. He can, and does, include a variety of gripping situations in his works. The Thousand Orcs is no exception, boasting all three of those things and more.If you're a Salvatore fan, I shouldn't need to tell you to buy this, because you've probably already got it on your wish list. If you aren't, this book is as good a place as any to get started!"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"R.A. Salvatore has created one of the best loved and most dynamic charachters in the entire fantasy genre. With the creation of Drizzt, he has garnered legions of loyal fans and praise from high places within the editorial world. I remember back in '97, my senior year of high school, i was sitting in english class reading &quot;passage to dawn&quot; i believe- my teacher walked by my desk and made an offhand comment that he could not stomach the fact that salvatore was now getting his books published in hardcover. He obviously thought that fantasy novels should be confined to paperback where they could be perused by the &quot;common&quot; reader. How wrong he was.Salvatore is a master at his craft. This is the reason he is as succesfull as he is.Drizzt and the gang are back and they are going orc hunting. An alliance has been formed and it threatens the safety of all the humans living in the region of Icewind Dale. Drizzt and Bruenor and Wulfgar and Cattie-brie and even Regis have taken it upon themselves to investigate these rumors of a large army and a threat to the surrounding villages.The book is mostly about the journey to discover what exactly it is that those pesky orcs are up to. Most of the novel takes place on the road and gives us information about where the charachters are now in their lives and the things that weigh most heavily upon their minds. Thoughts are turned toward loved ones and the life that the companions have chosen to lead. Is it a wise one? Will they survive for much longer? Will they all be together in the years to come?I particularly enjoy the monologues that Drizzt delivers as a preface to each part of the book. In this alter ego, Salvatore can ask and answer some pretty deep questions and explore some pretty heavy issues.This book is written well. It is plotted well and the charachters are written in a way that makes them believable and real. They have real problems and real pains- they arent just hulking barbarians and lithe warriors riding in the save the day in the nick of time. The last third of the book is where the action happens and boy, it happens fast. When the dust settles we are left feeling a little hopeless, a little angry and more that ready to devour the next volume in this all new trilogy starring our favorite rogue drow elf."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Rarely has any author, in any genre, created a series of such consistent quality as the Dark Elf books of R. A. Salvatore.Even so, that The Thousand Orcs (the fifteenth full-length novel in roughly as many years to feature characters introduced in the Icewind Dale trilogy!) stands as one of the finest installments in the series is nothing short of breathtaking.I write this review for the purpose of assuring any follower of the series who doubts that it can possibly go on for much longer that not only is this tale not showing its wear and tear, but, incredibly, taking full advantage of the ground gained (and, more importantly,loose ends tied up!) in Sea of Swords tobegin weaving something very new... at a truly remarkable pace.This is the tightest, fastest presentation since Starless Night, yet its attempt to cover a broad scope of intrigue, action, and personal relationships is the most ambitious since Siege of Darkness.The result is a nearly flawless creation that should set the heart of any true fan beating at life-threatening speeds.What do you know?We did need another trilogy after all."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is the best in long while for the Icewind Dale crew. If you are a true fan of the series you can appreciate the excellent read this book will provide. It is quick to the action, fast with the plot and all around a page turner. If you enjoyed the Icewind Dale trilogy you will enjoy this book. All of the gang are back together and in full force and of course your favorite Drow is leading the charge.Many people say that the characters lack depth and Believability but to them I say.....uh why read fantasy if you want real life. Too many authors today feel that in order to represent their characters in a \\"real\\" way they have to kill off a few of the major characters, Salvatore realizes that it is these unbelievable characters that keep us coming back for more. I for one will only stop reading the Drizzt books when he stops writing them.I am drooling for the next book. If he can suck me back in to the story with his patented fight scenes and plot twists he can bring in the newest of fans. The only thing that I feel was missing in this book was an enemy worthy of our Hero's skill. Really since Artiemis there have been few who demand the attention and scorn of the readers. I give it a thumbs up and will continue to wait impatiently for the next installment.To those of you who want reality........watch the news!!"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I read a lot of d&d; novels back in the 1990s when I was a teenager and didn't know any better. I remember Salvatore being one of my favorites. Before reading The Thousand Orcs, I hadn't read anything of his in probably 10 years or more. When I picked it up, I knew I would be getting a trashy fantasy novel. I just didn't realize HOW trashy a fantasy novel it would turn out to be.To sum up my reaction: Salvatore's prose in this book is incredibly heavy-handed, repeatedly bombarding us with explicitly-spelled out details that we, as the reader, should already know because he's already told us, as if we were three years old, many times before.This book also drags along incredibly slowly. Most of its 300+ pages is spent assuring us that Drizzt and co are old friends and yet, despite supposedly knowing each other better than they know the backs of their own hands, they still stumble awkwardly through their dialogue as if they had only just met moments before.Nothing very exciting really happens in this book. It comes across as more of a disgustingly bloated prologue than a novel in its own right.The worst parts of the book involve the bumbling and annoying Bouldershoulder brothers, originally from Salvatore's other FR series. He appears to be attempting to mesh his two series together but it fails miserably. And enough with the awful stereotypical \\"old-timey/country bumpkin\\" dwarf accents already!In closing, it is quite clear that Salvatore, like JK Rowling, no longer has an editor. The Thousand Orcs could very easily have been edited down to a short story, if not a handful of chapters. Perhaps the entire trilogy could have been shortened to just one book. I haven't read the other two in the series, and I'm not sure I want to ...That's all from me."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Whenever an author has written an extended series of books about the same characters, there is always inclusion of a period of introduction (or reminders) of significant events. This is mainly for new readers of the series. For those who have read the previous works, this can be tedious. Such is the case for this book. However, without being cumbersome, Salvatore managed to hit the major events in the characters' lives to illuminate some of their motivations. The problem is that there are a good many characters that require this, so it seems to take a while.As with all of the books in this series, there are great combat action sequences. The gist of the story is that there are numerous orcs and giants uniting in the north to menace the goodly races (human, dwarf, elf). This happens as the companions are returning to Mithral Hall for Bruenor to reclaim his crown. They are diverted from this course to avenge the deaths of those early victims of the orc/giant alliance. This diversion leads the companions into significant danger, with Wulfgar acting as counselor to Catti-Brie at one point. This and the event that precipitated it give some conflict and depth to her character which persists the rest of the novel. Regis continues acting contrary to his early ways, and his inner reasons for this are discussed. Drizzt, meanwhile, is Drizzt, narrating the book through section introductions. He does not play any larger a part than the other characters, though he does shine as per his usual.There is significant inclusion of previous Salvatore characters, not only those originally from this series, as the Dwarven brothers from the Cleric Quintet appear. New characters are also introduced, on both sides of the conflict. Salvatore manages to weave political intrigue into the mix, again on both sides, to great effect.The climactic battle of this novel occurs in the defense of a remote village against the evil hordes. This takes a good portion of the end of the novel, but it flies past. Facing insurmountable odds, the companions battle on. Humor even finds its way into the mix before all is done.As the title of this review indicates, I thought that the book started slow, but this was mostly due to the introductory process I noted earlier. The several segregated storylines are united in the end to a satisfying conclusion. I truly think that this book will appeal to both new and established readers of the series. And trust me, you, like me, will be dismayed that another year will pass before the next book in the series is released."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I need to qualify this review with the fact that I've been a fan of this series for quite some time. However, 1k Orcs was sub-par for Salvatore. I wasn't invested, and after being so bored with secondary characters, I actually put this book down for a few months before picking it up again this week to finish it on a long flight. Really, the best thing that I can say about this book is that it appears to set up a nice second book in the series (I must say that I've been waiting for the return of the Hunter since I finished the Dark Elf Trilogy). As a stand alone, not his best. To those who are reading this as their first book in this series, I STRONGLY suggest starting with the Dark Elf Trilogy or Icewind Dale Trilogy Collector's Editions. This was just not a good sample of Salvatore's usually excellent work.Oh, almost forgot to mention...outstanding cover art!"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The first review on this page is a little harsh...but for good reason. There have been and continue to be some elements missing from this VERY long series. I was hooked by the first three trilogies, but since then, I've been waiting. I'm not sure I know exactly what I am waiting for from the Dark Elf series, but I'm sure I'll know it when I read it...and I didn't read it in this book --&gt; BUT...this is the first book in a TRILOGY. To me, it read like a three hundred page prologue.It is definately leading up to something.There are some story elements that lead characters toward out of character behavior (I think...) and some parts of the book seem rather hastily thrown together -- but there are also some very real moments for the characters.When I finished the book, I was wondering if I have just outgrown this type of fiction...so I went back and reread the Dark Elf Trilogy. Nope. Still awesome. So...I know Salvatore has it in him...I just haven't seen it in a while.Anyway...just dont forget that this is numero uno in a three book set."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"After reading all the previous Drizzt novels his work on the Hunter's Blades Trilogy is almost unbearable to read, in fact I could not bring myself to finish reading the final book in the series, it just seemed like the same old stuff repeated over and over and over and over again. The \\"plot\\" just seemed to get worse and worse..... very disappointed in his work in this series, oh well gives me time to explore other works such as Dragon Age: The Calling, which was surprisingly a pretty good read. No more R.A.S. books for me as his work has seemingly degraded into complete garbage....though I will say I did enjoy his earlier work. A pity that his work on these terrific characters has become awful in my opinion. Agree or disagree, it just my opinion and everyone is free to their own."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This, like all of RA Salvatores books, it well written. It is a bit tedious at the start, mostly for the benefit of new readers with paragraphs of explanation of previous events but once you're past all that it is a great book that pulls you along. In this book the charachters, Drizzt, Cati-Brie, Wulfgar, Burenor, and Regis are all facing things. Drizzt is being Drizzt and fighting to protect others, he is again and again reminded of why he left his birthplace. Cati-Brie is faced with the fact that she is mortal, and it terrifies her. Wulfgar is dealing with life, wife and kid. Bruenor is heading home, to Mithril Hall to again be King and is searching for a last Hurrah. And Regis is trying to make himself useful, he's always reminded that if he didnt have such powerful friends he would be dead and he's trying to pay them back in his own little ways.And ontop of each's inner battles is the threat of a thousand Orcs (hint hint the title) and a clan of Giants are running wild in the Spine of the World just as Bruenor (looking for an adventure) is going home. There is some political intrigue, a few guest appearances, and plenty of fighting to sate your appetite.I recomend this book, its exciting and just continuing Salvatores long list of good reads."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Salvatore is back with a double bladed vengeance!For those of you who are fans of the series, The Thousand Orcs marks Salvatore's return to the basics...and if you ask me what he is best at. Without giving away the books story this book brings us back to the five companions facing tall odds and delivering with heroic deeds.Salvatore once again proves that he is that master of action. The book is full of dramatic battle descriptions filled with amazing detail. The grand battles of the Icewind Dale Trilogy and Legacy series continue without some of the slower, and somewhat depressing, psychoanalysis of the last few books. Don't get me wrong, as always, we still get to toil with issues of morality and hard choices but in a venue that is more exciting and action packed than recent works.What more can I say other than I will be waiting to buy the next two in the series. If you are new to Salvatore's Forgotten Realms novels start at the beginning with the Dale Trilogy. You will not regret the time spent.Happy Reading"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am of two minds on this book. On the one hand, Drizzt Do'Urden, my favorite character ever, is back; alive and well. His perils and trials are as potent as ever, and his scimitars as keen. With his companions by his side, all seems right with the world.But deep in the mountains the orcs have formed an alliance with the frost giants, spurred on by the wicked minds of several drow, and disaster awaits for those who stumble upon them unknowingly.As Drizzt and his friends fall deeper into shadows, it looks as though this time they may not all make it out alive.I loved the characters, as always, and I'm glad that we have a chance to revisit the bouldershoulder brothers.I was a little surprised at the fact that Drizzt was still agonizing over Ellifain. I understand why he feels a bit responsilbe, even though he's not, but it seems like he's taking it just a little to far to me.The time spent in Mirabar was a little tedious, and could have been shortened, but on the whole, I think this book was fairly well balanced.But back at the beginning, I said I was of two minds. Well, I liked this book, but I'm not sure that all of my feelings for it came from this book itself. I think a lot of the reason I liked this book so much was because I had read the books before it. If this was my first meeting with Drizzt and the others.... I'm not sure that I would have really cared as much.This book was definitely not as strong as the Icewind Dale trilogy, or the Dark Elf trilogy, or the Legacy of the Drow either. But, it was much better than the last four books, so I am hopeful for the next 2.So, all in all, this book was pretty good, and I'm hoping Salvatore can pick up where he left off here, take the story, and run with it.Welcome back Drizzt!"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Yesterday I locked myself in my office forwarded my phone to voice mail and began reading. I continued today until I finished. Some people compare these books to the DemonWars books and find the Drizzt books wanting. To me that's like comparing apples to oranges.That said, The Thousand Orcs was one of the most outstanding pieces of fantasy written. Battle scenes galore, emotional turmoil, exploration of the antagonists' psyches. There are cliffhangers, subtle and overt changes to the hearts and minds of the characters. There is also a bit of political intrigue that I think filtered over from some of Salvatore's other works.You can see Drizzt taking a whole new direction with this series.Plus, a couple of past favorite characters are in the thick of the action, as well as some new characters.All in all, great book. And at least he's regular about releasing them."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is the second book by R.A. Salvatore that I've read and this one is probably even less impressive than the previous which was likewise unimpressive. My main issue with his writing is that he seems to have a very sadistic bent. In the previous book I read Drizzt and his group methodically chopped down several Hill Giants in such a brutal fashion that I felt rather sorry for the giants. The Thousand Orcs ups the ante by having Drizzt's crew rip apart a trio of Frost Giants. For those who don't know, in the world of D&D; Frost Giants are the largest, most intelligent and most refined of the giants. For Salvatore, giants seem to be a means to create scenes of carnage on a embiggoned scale featuring a brutal dissection of these enormous humanoids. To add to the mix Orcs are offered up like pigs to a slaughter with most of the main characters taking extreme delight in hammering them mercilessly.So this leads me back to then whole concept of Dungeons and Dragons. Although the point of the game is role playing and characters can gain experience by performing actions \`in character' it eventually all leads back to killing beasties. When a D&D; party comes across an Orc camp how often do players think about the morality of attacking a group not currently engaged in battle or the dubious morality of wiping out sentient humanoids? Salvatore creates Orcs that are so weak and inept that it feels cruel when they are ripped to shreds. Are we to assume that goblinoids are wholly evil and only fitting for genocide? It really says something that the writer was able to cause me to reassess that whole concept of Dungeons and Dragons.Great writers are able to paint a visual picture with words and put the reader into their world. Tolkien wrote like an artist carefully and meticulously crafting Middle Earth, immersing readers in his vision. By contrast Salvatore only writes two things; action and dialogue. As ethically dubious as the action is the dialogue is even worse. The author is clearly trying to build some deep relationship between the main characters but their interactions are nauseating and I truly don't care about any of them. The characters are constantly self analyzing with Drizzt being the worst with his incessant introspective musings.With R.A. Salvatore you get quantity over quality and for some people that's a fair tradeoff. The author might be talented but when you shovel out this much material something has to give. A writer like George Martin only delivers a new book every four years or so and I have to wonder whether he'll ever finish his Song of Fire and Ice series but the quality is much higher. For me there are way too many books available to be reading assembly line writers like R.A. Salvatore and Margaret Wies. I would love to read a quality D&D; novel but I have to wonder if any exist. This book is just a mess with dozens and dozens of characters and a plot that is both overly bare and excessively confusing at the same time. I still don't know what the motivation behind the orc/frost giant team-up is. Salvatore seems to be considered a superior D&D; writer but it may come down to him being the best of a very weak talent pool."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"RA Salvatore's writing is very pedestrian in style and seems more like a play by play commentary of some D&D game than anything resembling a novel. This book is only recommended for 14 year old fanboys who judge a book's quality by the numbers of magic items carried by the heroes."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Having read the first three series in the tales of Drizzt, some of which were published 16 years ago when I was just starting college and still playing AD&D;, I find it hard to believe Salvatore has published sooo many books on the Dark Elf, and I find it hard to believe it's been so long since the Crystal Shard came out. While Salvatore is no Tolkien, Salvatore is a writer who does come up with some decent plot lines and some fun characters. Having said that, let's look at some of the elements of this novel.Plot: Not bad. Overall solid, as the things the characters are doing make logical sense. A band of Orcs, allied with Frost Giants and advised by some renegade Drow elves, are attacking outposts throughout the North. Drizzt and his friends become involved and the story takes off from there. The book is full of action and realistic violence (battles are violent by nature) and this is an area where Salvatore excels.Character development: Salvatore doesn't develop characters like Charles Dickens, but if you expect that sort of thing you shouldn't be reading Salvatore! The characters may be somewhat thin, but they are fun to read about. Personally I love Drizzt and his friends, and you will too (if you are reading this review you probably have read some of the books in the series).Overall this book is a good 3.5 Stars. Salvatore knows how to get the action going, and he does so almost immediately in this novel, the first of the series. Like I said earlier, it's not Tolkien, it's not Dickens, but that doesn't mean it's not good in it's own right, which it certainly is. If you like action, adventure and fantasy, they you can't really go wrong with this novel."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I think this book portrays psychological problems, which is uncommon in most fantasy stories. I love Salvatore's use of depth, and description when in battles, and this book is no exception. He is truly a brilliant writer, and I look forward to finishing The Lone Drow, and beginning The Two Swords. I have to say, this is one of the best books I've read this year."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I read it over Christmas time and have to say that this is the best out of all in the Drizzt Do'Urden books. I have them all so I say this with a lot of knowledge. It kept me riveted from the first page and I found it very hard to put down. I would actually say he took everything to a new level with the characters and the fight scenes were terrific. I would love to describe more but I would just take away from the book. I can and will say it was totally INCREDIBLE and I am on the edge of my seat waiting for the follow up."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"After the somewhat disappointing Sea Of Swords, R.A. Salvatore completely redeems himself with The Thousand Orcs. This book had everything you could want from a great Fantasy novel. It had Drizzt Do'Urden, without a doubt the most famous Fantasy character of all time, it had inner thinking plots, political intrigue, and great action! Any person who loves Fantasy at all should go buy this book. It is so great you'll want to read it over and over again. So don't rent it, buy it!I'm very eager for the next book in the series approximately one year from now."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"while not being the most exciting book salvatore has written, the thousand orcs is still pretty good.

But bear with it, the finish is worth the wait."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The latest edition of the Icewind Dale series represents a return to the good old days of the original trilogy. A grand quest for yet another Dwarven stronghold, and hordes of monsters to slay. It's very satisfying to see the whole gang back together again."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This review is simply a continuation, and verification, of my other review on Amazon for Salvatore's \\"Sea of Swords\\". Mr. Salvatore's older books like Homeland and The Crystal Shard are fabulous on every level, but the Drizzt character and storyline have slowly been dying over the past several years. The Thousand Orcs is simply the nail in the coffin I saw building in Sea of Swords. This book is even more jumbled, pointless, and at times, even boring. Established and building plot lines (like Drizzt's and Cattie-Brie's budding romance) go no where and are eliminated. Old characters are re-introduced for literally no reason other than to fill space. The plot is schizophrenic and shoots all over the place. The villains are boring (more drow? Again???). The action is well-done, but simplistic and absolutely nothing new whatsoever if you are a Salvatore reader. Compare *any* action sequence in this book to, say, the Drizzt/Entreri battle in Legacy or battles at the end of The Halfling's Gem, for example. The fire is long, long gone.I was so depressed in reading this book. The Drizzt storyline is dead, but not buried, and it needs to be. It looks like Salvatore is trying to revitalize Drizzt in future novels by having him operate alone once again. That's fine, but I would much rather he focus his energies as an author on bringing new life to new characters than trying to resurrect old ones. Don't buy this book. If you want some good Salvatore reading, instead go out and by the new Realms of Shadow and read the Entreri/Jarlaxle short story he has in there. I guarantee you, that short story will bet ten times the entertainment of the entire book of The Thousand Orcs."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The was a great read with Drizzt and his friends, but seemed to miss a plot. The books starts off one way, then heads another and adds different characters and leaders but doesn't tie them all together. Maybe it will be tied together in one of the other 2 books but we will have to wait and see. I highly recommend the book but it is not his best of the Drizzt series."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I got this book the day it came out and began reading it later that night. About a week or so later, I was finished (I would have had it done sooner, except for work and such). Anyway, I must say that this is a very worthy addition to the series! This has all the Companions of the Hall back together again, with some brand new characters that are introduced and seem quite interesting, although we only learn a little about them. Hopefully we will be learning far more of them in the future!!! Suffice it to say, you should definitely read this novel if you are a fan of the Drizzt series and if you are a fan of very good fantasy novels. In my opinion, R.A. Salvatore is one of the best fantasy writers of this age, so you should definitely read this series and any of his others that are out there. The DemonWars is an exceptional series too!"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"R.A. Salvatore is without a doubt the best author to grace the Forgotten Realms, and this IS a good book, BUT... I do get tired of nothing but Drizzt Do'Urden. Enough already! Write about someone else in the Forgotten Realms Mr.Salvatore, there's a whole realm of interesting characters out there."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Here continues the adventures of the Companions of the Hall, which have appeared in several books accompanied by the most famous of their lot, a certain renegade dark elf named Drizzt Do'Urden. This time, Gandalug, the King of Mithral Hall, has succumbed to his years and perished, and Bruenor Battlehammer, the surly dwarven hero of the series, is his only heir. Bruenor may be old, but that doesn't mean he is content to handle stately matters locked away in a stuffy throne room. No, Bruenor would rather be on a grand adventure, his friends in tow. So it is that Bruenor arranges such an adventure, to the excitement of his companions. But all does not go so well, for an unusually intelligent orc has formed an alliance with a deadly queen of frost giants, and together they are about to sweep the reaches of Icewind Dale and leave destruction in their wake. Naturally, it's up to Drizzt and friends to put a stop to this.Here begins the Hunter's Blades trilogy, which promises a more focused narrative and set of events. After all, the Paths of Darkness books (the last four in the series) were somewhat of a letdown (apart from the surprisingly good Spine of the World), and failed to bring a coherent and continuing storyline to the table, and all but the aforementioned seemed hastily concocted and thrown together in a manner unbefitting the author of the Icewind Dale and Dark Elf series. A flowing plotline is something that's been needed since Passage to Dawn, point of fact - and finally it's arrived.For the Drizzt virgins (who should start at the beginning with Homeland, or at least The Crystal Shard, instead of reading from here), this series is kind of like an action-packed comic book combined with a fantastic soap opera. If you're an avid fan, these characters feel like friends of yours, and you probably know what they're thinking before Salvatore tells you about it. As such, it is once again a splendid thing to reunite with this colorful cast. Despite the sloppiness of Salvatore's most recent additions, it is these characters that keep me itching for each new installment. The battles, which Salvatore handles so vividly, and which were so compelling in the past, have become somewhat derivative and unexciting. My biggest beef with Salvatore is his refusal to try new things. I've seen Drizzt and company fight too many cowardly goblins and dim-witted orcs. One such battle resembles all the rest, and the fate of the heroes themselves is never truly in question. Therefore, the title to this latest book alone was a bit troublesome for me. The Thousand Orcs. Great. More orcs.Somehow, though, once things really get moving in this novel, Salvatore manages to inject some life into his tiring formula. I actually felt that the Companions of the Hall were in mortal danger this time around, and relief is fleeting. I would have liked a more interesting and original threat (orcs AGAIN?), but the way the tale unfolds reminds me of the Salvatore I fell in love with when I was only 13.This looks to be the start of a grim and promising series in the Drizzt Do'Urden saga. It may not be the most original thing you've ever read, but the characters will more than keep you entertained (particularly if you're a die-hard fan not unlike myself), and the action may have its lulls, but the climax is a real page-turner that rectifies the tome's earlier mishaps."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"&quot;Drizzt . . . fighting alone!&quot; I read the words on the back of the book jacket and trembled. Finally, after the Dark Elf trilogy, a new book was out where Drizzit was on his own again . . . a chance for some serious character development . . . with more substance than whistful pinning away after a blissful future. Imagine my dissappointment at discovering that over half the storyline and scenes dealt with characters other than our dark friend. Imagine my dissappoint to find that most of the scenes containing Drizzt were extremely diluted with other characters. Imagine my chagrin to find he doesn't fight alone. Sigh!Don't get me wrong, I like Wulfgar, Catti-brie, and the others--I'm just tired of them stealing the show . . . almost to the point of making Drizzt a secondary character. If you loved the last two books, buy this one hard-back. If, however, you want something with the flavor of the Dark Elf Trilogy, save your money. You won't find such until Bob takes the time to craft a yarn with some true character development. Until then, I'll continue to look for an honest dust jacket. Until then, I won't make the mistake of buying hard-back until first, I've checked it out at the local library. Sigh!"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Well. It seems that fates and lady luck has finally caught up to several of the heroes of the halls. Unlike many of the other Drizzt books, tradagey abounds for our fabled fivesom. And the ending is sure to leave you near to heart break for one of them (find out who by reading it).With the inclusion of several others, brought in from previous books, and some well wrote out bad guys (and girls), this promises to be a well worth start, to what i hope will be one of Salvatore's best trilogies yet!My only regret, is i will have to wait a full year (from what i know) for the second installment."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"There is so little one can say about this book without ruining it. Just know that Drizzt and the gang are back into the orc bashing bussiness (and for a whole series too!) and this time they aren't coming out with a few bumps and bruises. Drizzt is not immortal, neither is his friends. This books shows how easily that is applied. Wonderful as it is though, I have a beef with it. It is CALLED The Thousand Orcs. But no one actually FIGHTS the thousand orcs. A lot of them, yes, but not a thousand. (and giants don't count). Regardless of the somewhat fudged title, it's still a good book. If you get the chance, check out the advertisements for the book. The one with the numbered outlines of the orcs on the cover picture of the book is priceless."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"First off I must say that Salvatores masterpiece is the Icewind Dale Trilogy. That is hands down his finest work with Drizzt. The Dark Elf Trilogy is, in my humble opinion not worth the paper it is printed on. This, book, 'The Thousand Orcs' (which by the way is a bit of an underestimate and misleading) seems to be a return to his winning ways. The characters have grown, they have had trials and been changed by them. This sets up really mature interaction among our adventurers. Salvatore is at least a writer who keeps continuity at the forefront. He doesn't just introduce a new development in one novel only to forget about it in the next. So it is neat to see the conflicts that the characters new entanglements produce. What is also nice about this book and Salvatore in general, is the fact that he does like to surprise the reader. And that is a hard thing to do when the themes fantasy novels have been pretty much done to death. I probably need not say that Salvatore handles the action superbly. Or need I mention that the books are action packed and fun? No...good.My only complaint really is the title. It is more than a thousand orcs, more by a lot. And it isn't just orcs. I don't quite understand that."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have been a loyal fan and reader of the Drizzt novels since the beginning. Salvatore is a great writer and to read one of his novels is a real treat compared to some of the fantasy dribble out there now. The story is good and the action intense at times. My complaints are few, but stop this from being a great novel.First, the Companions of the Hall. While I love all of them, this book makes it feel like its finally the time for Drizzt to move on. They have had there run, let's retire the gang before this gets really monotonous. Drizzt needs to go off on truly new excursions. This book pretty much plays like the old novels of the series but does include a situation the Companions have not faced before in the finale.The Drizzt/Catti Brie love situation has been drawn out too long now. Several novels have gone by and neither has even truly said what they feel. All I am saying is that Salvatore had better finalize this situation by the end of this trilogy. Enough is enough.My final complaint is the biggest. It seems that with the latest novels Salvatore seems to not have enough material to fill a book about the main plot. Thus he involves side stories which seem to have no bearing on the story. He does tie them together at the end, but very weakly. Making much of the material seem unnecessary and a waste of pages. Like in the Spine of the World which was more about a girl named Marelda than Wulfgar, he does it again. This time we are given a story of Ivan and Pikel of the Cleric Quintet dealing with some moon elves who are interested in finding out if Pikel is a druid!? And the other story is about the political situation between dwarves and humans in the town of Mirabar! The people of the town are concerned with loosing profits, when we as the reader know that the book should be centering more on this massive invasion of orcs and frost giants. When these two side plots connect with the main story at the end of the novel, it just seems pointless.Despite my complaints, this is a good book. Hopefully the next two novels in the series will deal with the story at hand, instead of going off into something else which has no bearings. I don't recommend new readers of the series to start with this one, especially since there are lots of references to Ellifain, a character who died in the last novel. Start from the beginning with The Crystal Shard."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book was a good book standing on its own. The Drizzt saga has had twists and turns, and if you've read them all as I have, you are familiar with some of the &quot;filler&quot; books such as Spine of the World, where nothing really happens except story filler. This book is not a filler book , but does set things up for the next two or more books. Parts of it are very reminicent of the Battle of Helms Deep from the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and the cover art is misleading, but overall, the book was worth reading!"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Wow! THis is an amazing read and I recomend it highly. Bands of Orcs come out of the Spine, rampage, and invade. It is totally great...."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm convinced by now that Drizzt and his buddies could travel to Valhalla and take out Thor just by doing 1d10 damage to his kneecaps. Sure, they'd bleed some, but Drizzt would come out with enough hit points for another 25-page tie battle with Artemis Entreri. Frost Giants? Thousands of orcs? Toss 'em all into the Scimitar Meat Grinder! Oh, more drow! Evil schemers, they are. I suppose they'll kidnap and torture Cattie-Brie or something else stupid to make Drizzt and Bruenor really mad. One of these drow will buy it in the sequel, and the rest at the end of this trilogy. Maybe they'll get eaten by a yochlol? At least we do have the tricky orc King Obould Many-Arrows back now. He might just make things interesting.Seriously, Salvatore is the best thing going for the Realms, and he's a hell of a good author. But the odds of Drizzt and all of his friends surviving all [that they've] they've been through has convinced me they're invulnerable. Salvatore should have killed Cattie-Brie or Bruenor (or Drizzt!) a couple of books ago and continued on. Introduce some supporting characters that become major chacracters. Add a mage to the group. Don't misunderstand, I like all of these characters, but I'm having to accept that they're going to mow down every evil thing thrown at them - with the exception of Gerti Orelsdottr: she's in the Realms sourcebook (with King Obould), so Salvatore will have to run a chit through WOTC to put her head on Bruenor's many-notched axe+50. Couldn't Salvatore continue with his storyline without one or two of the major characters? (Yes, I know Drizzt wasn't around for Servant of the Shard, but you know what I mean.) It would be much more interesting. I suggest he has a couple of them meet a glorious demise, and see how the rest of them deal with it. I think Salvatore just needs to think up some more cool characters not named Cadderly and either tie them in with this series or give them their own. Either that or WOTC makes him write until he pulls a Weis & Hickman and axes his characters out of spite. I know: A trilogy all about Regis. I'm serious. I'd like to see how the biggest wimp in Dizzt's crew takes out the Realms...All that being said, this *is* a Bob Salvatore book, and I read it through in two days. It is fast paced, action-packed, and descriptive. Salvatore knows how to tell a story better than almost any fantasy author, and he does it here again. It is quite predictable, but it never fails to entertain. Bringing the Boudershoulder Bros. in helped enliven the story, and Salvatore is the best writer about dwarves I've ever seen, especially his sidestory about the dwarves of Mirabar. The reader is also inclined to expect Entreri and Jarlaxle to appear sometime in the trilogy, which wouldn't be a bad thing. Finally, there is one path Drizzt could venture down that would prove truly interesting: to see if he can redeem Ellfain's hate-filled soul. Sure, she's dead, but this is the Realms, after all. In spite of my whining above, if you like Drizzt and his pals, you will enjoy The Thousand Orcs."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"First of all let me start by saying if you havent ever read the Dark Elf Trilogy Then by all means start with those. You wont regret it. I've read every book in this series as soon as it has been released and of late Salvatore has been getting more into the emotional aspect of the heroes and away from all the action packed mayhem that characterized the first eight books in the series. I've been patient thruogh Wulfgars paltry exploits and I'm glad I was. When I picked up &quot;The Thousand Orcs&quot; I didnt put it down again until I was done. If your a fan of the rest of the series then I'm telling you right now:BUY THIS BOOK FOOL!really, you will be VERY glad you did. If you like the action, this is where its at. Googobs of action."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Well well well, Salvatore does it again. The book is an all round awesome one. He shows more character then in any books written before. It shows Wulfgar and his inner turmoil with his new found family, Bruenor with the tasks of a new King, Regis with trying to prove himself, is there finally a chink in the armor of Cattie-brie? And what of Drizzt, maybe love drills a hole in his heart?I found The THousand Orcs to be just another of Salvatores awesome books. It keeps readers on edge and keeps pages flying. I normally find it difficult to read books twice or even three times, yet Ive read this one 4 times since it came out.If your looking to burn a little money out of your pocket this is definetly a good choice."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Wow. It is safe to say that this book has the most action I have ever read in a book. I read a couple chapters the first night I bought the book. I was so into the action packed story that I read the rest of the novel the next night! That is around 300 pages. It had the perfect mix of action, romance, and comedy.I've known about R.A. Salvatore's fantasy novels for some time but I never really took the time to pick one up and read it. This was the first novel by Salvatore that I read and it was amazing.

It is true (as I have read in other reviews) that this story does start out rather slowly, but it quickly turns into a compelling page-turner that will leave you groveling for more. Salvatore weaves this tale with 3 major plotlines seamlessly into one climactic ending (somewhat of a to be continued) that ties up most loose ends and answers many questions. There is plenty of comedy, suspense, tradgey and horror to satisfy all of the readers needs. I give &quot;The Thousand Orcs&quot; by R.A. Salvatore 5 stars for writing a book so good I layed on the couch all day reading the novel, ignoring hungar and thirst altogether, What a wonderful feeling !!"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The Thousand Orcs, i thought was a great book even though there was alot of twists and turns throughout the story.

Another great book."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"\\"The Thousand Orcs\\" once again features the most popular character in fantasy, Drizzt Do'Urden. It is a book that will not dissapoint.Drizzt and his friends are all on their way to Mithral Hall in which Bruenor Battlehammer is to be named king. Along their way they find that Orcs, Giants, Goblins, and all other evil races are swarming together to enact war upon the \\"good\\" races. Eventually Drizzt Do'Urden finds himself alone while his friends battle for their lives.There are some negative aspects in this book. The battles that involve Drizzt are not the ones we as fans specifically want to see. Drizzt is caught up battling Giants and Orcs during huge mass warfare rather than the far more entertaining one on one battles we enjoy so much. Also Drizzt as a character should be featured much more than he is in the book. Drizzt should be the entire focal point of the books. Not Cattie-Brie, Wulfgar, Regis, Bruenor, etc., but jut Drizzt himself. Seeing the other characters play an equal role is not very good at all.However with the small negatives aside, this is a great read that still deserves 4.5 stars(rounded to 5). It has a great side story in which political action and intrigue play a large part that will no doubt lead into future books. The mass war battles although not as good as Drizzt battling toe-to-toe with another character, are superbly done. There is plenty of action and a emotional sort of love plot set in between.With this book Salvatore solidifies the fact that he is the best author Fantasy has to offer today. I am eager for the next book."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Another amazing adventure for Drizzt and friends. I can't wait for the next one..."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book is an example of what sets apart great authors from the mediocre melange. Salvatore does not regurgitate old themes and circumstance, but instead embarks on a monumental foundation building process for the rest of the series. He draws on political intrigue, new villains and locations, and a dazzling array of wonderfully crafted characters. I was delighted when I discovered Ivan and Pikel in the story since they were two of my favorites from the Cleric Quintet. Some fans might be dissapointed in the fact that the story does not involve many Drizzt battles, but there is plenty of excitement to replace them. I was amazed at how much ground he covered in 345 pgs. and found myself immediately ready for the 2nd installment. Again, this book is refreshing in that it's a much different flavor from Salvatore's previous novels. The story does not revolve around Drizzt or Wulfgar, balances a greater number of parallel, tangential stories, and brings together a fascinating collage of themes that no doubt will be used in the coming novels. Another enjoyment I had was that Salvatore took some time in building Regis' character to be somewhat different than his typical role in the previous books.My only complaints would be the eternal unresolution of Drizzt and Cattie-Brie's relationship. Yes, it makes progress, but it's measured with baby steps. This romantic and sexual tension between these two characters has been going on for too many novels to count, and I for one would like to see it go somewhere. I almost get the feeling that Salvatore doesn't even know what he wants to do with these two yet. Maybe in the second book;)All in all, I think it's exciting to see the dynamics of change that has affected the group of characters. They have all changed so very much from The Crystal Shard, and very few authors can pull off such a large continuance of stories involving the same characters, without falling prey to the usual plot rehashes, theme regurgitations, and stagnant character development. Salvatore proves that he does not suffer from the usual failings of other authors. Great job!"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Salvatore does it again.

Tension runs high especially concerning the pending decisions about exactly how far Drizzit and Cattie-brie are going to take their love for each other. And the question that arise from that contemplation brings about some serious racial and longevity issues to their lives.

Salvatore's 'Drizzt' saga began many years with the Ice Wind Dale trilogy. The original trilogy was an excellent adventure that introduced readers to what would become the Companions of Mithral Hall: Drizzt, Wulfgar, Breunor, Regis, and Cattie-Brie. Since that time, the characters had largely stagnated, not really growing or changing as they moved from adventure to adventure. That changed with 'Spine of the World' and 'Sea of Swords' as Wulfgar began his return from the abyss and his friens began to adjust to the changes that they found in their friend. Finally, in 'The Thousand Orcs' the rest of the cast begins to explore their own inner demons.The novel opens with Drizzt and Co. beginning their trek to Mithral Hall where Breunor is to resume the throne after the previous king died. Along the way, the stumble upon the aftermath of a growing army of orcs, postponing their return to Mithral Hall. This is much to Breunor's delight, as he is not anxious to resume his duties as king, which he views as a very dull lifestyle.Regis, the halfling thief, continues to evolve following the near loss of his arm in a previous novel. He is no longer content to hide behind his friends as they fight for him. The trouble is, he doesn't know how to be more of a help without getting in the way and putting his companions in further danger. As events unfold in the novel, he has some difficult decisions to make.Cattie-Brie, facing a near death experience, makes some difficult realizations that will lead to some difficult decisions in future novels. She and Drizzt, a human and a Drow Elf, have an evolving relationship. But what can become of such a relationship? What will happen as she grows old, but Drizzt maintains his youth, inherent in the elven race? These questions plague both Cattie-Brie and Drizzt and will shape their future for novels to come.This novel has a very Tolkenesque quality to it. Readers familiar with 'The Two Towers,' either the novel or the movie, will recognize several similarities. However, Salvatore resolves things in his own way and does so in fairly satisfying fashion.This book will make the most sense if you have read the previous novels of the series, however, it is not entirely necessary. There is a lot of new material in this novel, that a new reader to the series will be able to grasp and understand without having read any of the previous works in the series. For one, all the old enemies (Entreri, Jarlaxle, etc.) are absent, so no past history is needed to understand the foes. I highly recommend this novel to any fantasy fan."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Salvatore is killing us! This book is a wonderful lead to so many different roads of possibilities. As with any trilogy you have to expect the author to set up the scene and this book does just that. If you have no experience with the characters or story lines do not start with this one. You have to understand the depth of each character to understand the enormity of the situation in their eyes. Drizzt- his worst fear, he's alone. Cattie Brie- her adoptive father out of action, facing the reality of mortality. Bruenor- ?? Anticipate the possibilities!"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"By far the best of Salvatore's last three books concerning the famous Drow.

After you read up on the history of Drizzt Do'Urden and follow him through all of his perilous adventures this is finally what makes it all seem so small compared to how great this trilogy is and will be. Now I have to admit how i read the books was rather messed up because I did not get it. I thought that The Thousand Orcs looked cool so I decided to read it and I found out very quickly that I read the newest books and I needed to read the older and other books with Drizzt Do'Urden so i went back and read the Dark Elf trilogy and now i am reading the Icewind Dale trilogy and I am almost done with that. But i could imagine what it is like to have the reward of reading these books after a person has read all of the others. From beginning to end I smelled a good author with his introduction and the crouch before the pounce as the band of friends go and attack the nearby orc encampment. With R.A. Salvatore's way of making you just about as nervous as you can get knowing that in the end that something dreadful is going to happen to Drizzt and his friends after u read the back of The Lone Drow. This is another must read by Salvtore but first i would say that u should go back and read all the other books that lead up to this and at least Icewind Dale and Dark Elf because they are very important inserts to help this book and this trilogy make sense."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"R.A.Salvator does it again in this book. Like the ealier Drizzit books he adds plot twists throw in characters from his other series and linkng them together in the Forgotten Realms.A quick ut suspensful read...I'd recomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"While the story starts a little slow, I may attribute that to the fact I haven't read this type of book in awhile (although I remain always faithful to Drizzt's band and Salvatore's wonderful writing). The book really flows and you eventually find yourself not wanting to put it down.I really like the detail with which Salvatore describes the actions (you can almost see the orcs piling up around the adventurer's!). I like also that he did do a lot more with the other characters. Regis and Cattiebrie are much more in the forefront this time (Wulfgar already had his moment in the spotlight). And Bruenor ends up being the main character of this book, which I find delightful.I really enjoyed this one and will be purchasing book two shortly)."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"From the opening chapter, I was drawn in and hooked on this great book. I just love the cleric dwarf RAS has created here. There are so many vivid characters and a pretty engrossing storyline to boot. My only complaint is when your nearing the end of the book (with only a handfull of pages left) and you just want to keep readin on and on...that has to say something!Good job RAS. Definatly one of my favourites from this author !Justice Delivered"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was cleverly written. The adventure and action juts keep coming. I also enjoyed The Lone Drow. I cannot wait for the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"If you like action and fantasy. Read this."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The book that started up the Hunter's Blades Trilogy! A perfectly good RA Salvatore novel for any Fantasy Fan. Drizzt Do'Urden shows what he really has in this book, by battling Orcs and Frost Giants alike. A great Prologue of the brandnew series that still isn't finished. If you liked this book, get The Lone Drow and see how the story continues."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book was awesome it was full of action packed fights and was almost impossible to put down. Salvatore has done it again, using the legendary Drizzt Do'Urden."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This was the first &quot;Drizzt&quot; novel I read, and I was utterly amazed by it. The Bouldershoulder Brothers Ivan &amp; Pikel are absolutely hilarious. We meet two new vilains in the orc king Obould Many-Arrows and the frost giant princess Gerti Orelsdottr. Racial issues also play a major role in this book, with the inner strife in Mirabar between the corpulent marchion and the dwarves, led by Torgar hammerstriker and Shingles McGruff. We get an inside look at Drizzt's turmoil over killing ellifain, an elf he actually saved many years prior. In Wulfgar, we see a man whose overcome both gut-wrencing torture at the hands of a demon and immense inner torment. My sole complaint lies with the map on the opening page. Not only is it not of the quality of those in Streams of Silver and Silent Blade but it is also some what misleading. other than that, an excellent(and well-timed given the surge in interest in LOTR-inspired works) novel."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The Thousand Orcs picks up where the Paths of Darkness trilogy left off with the fabulous five searching for the lost great mining city of Bruenors elders when trouble arises in the form of orc and giant raiding parties. The five friends soon change course and start to investigate along the way warning all those in the area of the danger. A few small skirmishes and one rather large one leads them to the town of Shallows. This is where the book climaxes into a very intense epic size battle that will keep you flipping pages way into the night.While this is a solid main plot the two subplots are lacking to the point of boredom. One is the dwarves of Mirabar wanting to join Mithril Hall with their own kin. Second is the downfall of Salvatore and that is the story of Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder. The chapters that include the dwarven brothers can be completely skipped because they do not advance the storyline at all until they meet up with Regis and Pwent. This crossing of novels although in the Forgotten Realms is annoying at best. Please Bob in the future leave the hyper green dwarf and his cold shouldered brother with Cadderly and have them live happily ever after.The heroes although fascinating and fun need some help from Salvatore to advance the storyline of the five heroes, 20 years of writing and not too much has changed. There is still the tiresome love story between Drizzt and Catti-Brie with no advancement in sight because they still act like teenagers instead of adults. Then there is Wulfar who died (Icewind Dale Trilogy) when really he was only captured by a demon (Paths of Darkness Trilogy) to becoming a father and getting married (Paths of Darkness Trilogy), however still remains on the road of adventure with his friends upon his \\"wifes\\" request to do so and leave her behind. That is one huge stretch in character building so although we love Wulgar I think the man that has developed the most in these novels needs to put down his hammer and become settled in the normal life he chose in The Sea of Swords. Bruenor should also just accept being a king and lay down his ax as well. I know hard to swallow, but instead of talking about all of this in every novel including this one please Bob write it and make it happen so we can all move on with the storyline.All and all a great book to read when you need a break from the more intelligent reads like Wolfe, Martin, Baker and Erikson. Still the same old Salvatore great description and characterization with action scenes so intense you feel you are there. If you need a hack and slash novel with characters you will fall in love with Salvatore is the best for this type of genre."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"As always I was captivated by R. A. Salvatore's excellent writing. He did a great job at bringing into play new characters and merged them well into the lives of the already well-known characters I love."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This story was pretty good there is a lot of description and has a good story line. There is a lot of action so I would recommend it to a person that likes action books. This book is fiction and I like how the story is about some dwarfs. The enemy is orcs and ice giants who I like to read about. If you like to read about mythical creatures that kill stuff then I recommend it. I think this is about four stars to me because when I read it I got kind of side tracked and not as interested in it. Nikilwig is a pretty interesting character that is heading to Mithral hall. On the way there they encounter lots of monsters then get into lots of fights which I like to read about. This is my review of The Thousand orcs."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This was a story which grabs you from start to finish. Not many questions were left unanswered at the end of the book, but it kept you wanting to pick up the 2nd book to see \\"The Hunter\\" come back to life."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"If you are a real fan of Salvatore's you will love all his books, regardless of hows or whys regardless of typo's and regardless of whether its new and fresh and all that stuff. Its amazing to me all the people who think they know how to write or write a review.Like they are literary genius's that make thier living off of editing good books? I mean give me a break people, I do beleive its Salvatore's series and his imagination thats at work and not yours. I can only speak for myself when I say I am a true fan of Salvatores, because I will read all his Books About Drizzt and gang and never give him a bad review. To Salvatore's Darkelf Books I give them all 5 stars. Also his books should be in the 50 best of 2003."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"One of the things most people don't realize about the Hunter's Blades Trilogy is that it's written according to the Third Edition D&amp;D rules, whereas the previous ones were all 2nd Edition.The author's transition is pretty smooth. But don't expect it to be as exciting as his previous works.I definitely liked his writing style in the old 2nd edition better. Although 3rd edition captures a lot more stuff and is a lot more realistic and detailed, I could tell that when writing this book, Salvatore was suffering from inexperience with the new ruleset.The story is not THAT interesting. Don't expect to be turning pages in great anticipation.But, it's Drizzt, the best-woven character in Forgotten Realms after Elminster. I think the second and third books in this trilogy have the potential to be much much better than many of his previous books, and the first one only opened the door for this."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book starts off very slow for readers familiar with Salvatore's original flair with his million dollar cast of characters. The title also leaves much to be desired as this book is about the relationship between Drizzt &amp; Catti-brie...the thousand orcs are there to add a little intregue in this budding romance novel. Four stars because there is not enough action, however, it is a must read book 1 that you won't put down until the last page when you become angry until you start reading book 2."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Salvatore's storytelling keeps getting better and better. In this new book, his mastery of intrigue and intertwining plot lines is akin to Clancy's. Aside from being a great story featuring the Icewind Dale characters, it's engaging and difficult to put down."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"What I mean is this. The books on Drizzt and company are starting to pile up, numberically I mean. You would expect that after writing so many books surrounding one set of characters that the quality of the series would decrease and become uninteresting. I was sorrowfully preparing for this. HOWEVER, The Thousand Orcs was like a blast of fresh air in my face. A fantastic story that continues to build even through the end of the book, coupled with even further character development (perhaps the greatest thing about the Drizzt books is that the characters themselves grow, change, and adapt to the chaotic world) does well to ease your craving for an excellent fantasy read, while opening a huge hole in your stomach that can only be filled with a big bite from the next book, The Lone Drow. I can't wait, cuz I'm starving."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm an avid (or rabid, some say) Salvatore fan. I've read all of his work and have been waiting for another dark elf book, so I was very excited to find this at my bookstore. As far as I'm concerned, no book can rival the original Dark Elf trilogy - the 1st three are masterpieces - FAR better than Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately, Salvatore seems to have lost some of his uniqueness and originality in this book. It is so much like The Two Towers that I couldn't help but think that this was a quick, make money while LotR is big again book. It is worth the money and the time spent reading it but it is far below his usual standards. Of course I'll buy the next 2, due for release this Oct and Oct 2004 respectively, and hope to see the old Salvatore reemerge."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"do you have nothing better to do than sit around and write flame reviews as if your opinion should set the course of Salvatore's idea?GO OUTSIDE. Go. That's that big place, on the other side of the door, where all that noise and sunshine comes from.that is all."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book was Salvatore at his worst. Do not buy it. It was really boring until the end and then all Drizzt does is fight a few frost giants. After this Drizzt goes into a berserk rage that lasts for another whole book because he thought that Bruenor died. This attempt to build up tension turns Drizzt into a bloodthirsty instinctive monster for another whole book. All he thinks about is kill orcs, kill orcs, kill orcs."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Books like this are the reason my teachers sneer when I bring fantasy into study hall, and it annoys me to see such glowing reviews about such mindless drivel. This is pure escapism reading with no intellectual value. I'm a musician and I know what an insult it is to be called a hack or a sellout but I sure was thinking that about the author while I was reading this. There are two things that I look for when I read: quality of writing and storytelling enjoyment. This book didn't work on either level.Quality of writing: Where is the pretty prose? The breathtaking descriptions? The scenes that make me believe I'm in this world? They're not there. I can't believe this author has been writing longer than I've been alive. There's zero improvement in writing skills since the Dark Elf trilogy. If anything it's worse. Is it just me or was this book aimed at the lowest common denominator? I'm 14 and I felt like I was being talked down to. Kids are smart Mr Salvatore. We really are. Especially the ones that are into reading. You either write specifically for kids and tone down the violence and sexual inneundo aka harry potter or trust us to get it. Don't bludgeon us over the head with a club. Tickle our senses with a paint brush.Storytelling: Did this book start off slow or what? Why would you even start the book with people other than the heroes? The prologue is one thing but chapter 1 too? Once it got started there were too many plot lines going on here and it gave the whole story a jerky feel not to mention that some of them were just boring or pointless. I'm not one of the drooling Drizzt fans and even I felt short-changed at how little he and his friends were in this book. Every time we did see them it seemed like they were having some deep conversation that I guess was supposed to pass for character development. These scenes just felt clumsy and overdone as if the author assumes the reader can't read between the lines so everything needs to be spelled out.That pretty much sums up my feelings about the book. Author was insulting the intelligence of the reader. Everything from the stupid dwarven accents to the slapstick humor of the two brothers (why were they even in this book?) to the clumsy prose to the lack of any literary value. Writing is art and all art should say something. If you're just telling the story for the story's sake or the rent it pays, then you're cheating yourself and your readers."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm surprised by all of the 1- and 2-star reviews for this book. You should know what to expect when you pick up one of RAS's FR novels. If you're looking for high-brow literary masterpieces, stay away. If you're looking for quick, easy, and fun adventure with characters you know and love, this is for you. In my opinion, 'The Thousand Orcs' is no better or worse than the close to twenty other FR novels by Salvatore, and while it shouldn't be considered on the par with the best fantasy out there, it is what it is. Even though I know there are many other books that would outshine these books (and not near enough time to read them all), I still find myself coming back time and again for a little adventure with Drizzt and Co.'The Thousand Orcs' picks up right where 'Sea of Swords' left off. The companions are reunited (with the addition of Delly Curtie and baby Colsen), and Bruenor and the gang are setting off for Mithril Hall where Bruenor will take up the kingship. Unbeknownst to them, a powerful leader has emerged in the orc tribes of the Spine of the World, uniting the orcs and allying with a band of frost giants and renegade drow. As Drizzt and Co. travel to Mithril Hall they encounter many signs of heavy orc activity and decide to patrol the region and warn its inhabitants of the danger. They also make a stop at Mirabar, a rival of Mithril Hall, to stir up trouble and remind Mirabar's dwarves of their heritage. I'm sure that story will progress further in the rest of the trilogy. The Bouldershoulder brothers play a prominent role in this book, as they go through some pretty random-seeming adventures on their way to witness the coronation of King Bruenor. The whole book comes down to a desperate situation with the Companions being trapped in the town of Shallows during a siege of overwhelming strength. The final battle takes up the majority of the second half of the book and is quite intense.This book didn't really do too much to further the overall storyline of Drizzt and friends, except for getting Bruenor closer to accepting his role as King of Mithril Hall. The relationship between Drizzt and Catie-Brie is getting rather old and moving nowhere, Regis has had some sort of epiphany about his role in life, and Wulfgar has essentially returned to his old self but with more maturity.So, if you like the previous Drizzt novels, you'll probably like this one too. Don't let the cover fool you however, this one isn't any darker or more mature (other than using the word 'bitch' a couple of times) than the others."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"R.A. Salvatore brings us back to the world of the Forgotten Realms, the story brings us back to the life of Drizzt Do'Urden a renegade Dark Elf that has turned his back on his evil heritage and walks the path of a hero.The Orc king Obould Many Arrows has bounced back from his previous defeat at the hands of the Dwarves. Under the manipulation of the Drow (Dark Elves), Obould has allied with the Queen of the Frost Giants, Gerti. They have started mounting small scale raids against the Dwarves, killing several small bands.At the same time Bruenor, the new Dwarven King of Mithral Hall, is travelling home with Drizzt and his heroic companions. They stop by the rival city of Mirabar and are rebuffed by the human leaders. This is an affront to Mirabar's Dwarven population and sows the seed of rebellion which will lead to further strife.King Bruenor continues his travels home, to find the last two survivors of the Orcs raid on a dwarven trade caravan. Bruenor quickly gives them shelter and orders an all out search for the raiding Orcs. The battle that insues is very one sided, even with the Orc's Giant allies.Queen Gerti orders that the killers of her Giant kin must be destroyed, a command that leads to the momentous events of the climax. The Orc King leads his people in an overwhelming attack against the Dwarven host.The Dwarves are eventually driven to the small human outpost of Shallows. Shallows is ruled by a wizard who has built its walls high and strong, but they were not designed to take on an army of Orcs and Giants. The battle brings Elves, Dwarves, and Men together to defend Shallows from the forces of evil.The story and characters are well written. Even though it is the first book in the trilogy, the characters have a long background in the other books that the author has written in this world, so I would not recommend reading this book out of order with the rest. It is a fast, gritty and entrancing tale of swords, sorcery and intrigue. The action and adventure is very good. For fans of the fantasy genre it is a must read."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"You will either love Salvatore's works or you will be luke warm regarding them. There doesn't seem to be any in between. I was flushed with excitement reading and could hardly put down this book. Make plans to have your phone off, your drinks handy and a comfortable chair to finish this book."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I do recommend this for advanced readers in Salvatores line. That said, it is magical, but not for first timers. It has too many references to previous occasions for someone to really grasp into the big picture. Now, i have gone back and started reading from the dark elf trilogy ,and so many more things start to make sense. All in all, this is an excellent read, but start with Homeland and work your way up the ladder, you get a lot more out of it."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I admit I can't help but enjoy R. A. Salvatore's stories, and this is an excellent beginning to what promises to be a wonderful trilogy.In truth, however, it's the introspection of Drizzt and his slow development that I enjoy folowing the most. Slow because he has centuries to live as opposed to the vast majority of his friends and companions, who don't. His thoughts and observations break up the story and give a unique perspective that allows us for that moment to step back and take our own view of things.Of course, there are all the \\"usual suspects\\", some old friends, as well as new friends-and of course some we would not call friends-all very original characters. Some very humorous, some not. Some unusual heroes, and some very promising villians. In common, they all have their own different points of reference and background, and that makes it easier to see their different perspectives.Book 1 of The Hunter's Trilogy sets the stage very well for Book 2. I will say no more than that. If you are a follower of Drizzt, this is a must read. If not, it should make you want to go back to read earlier works to fill in his past history."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The Thousand Orcs by R.A. Salvatore is the first book in the Hunter's Blade trilogy. It was my first read by this author and I absolutely loved it! Very Tolkien-Esque writing with lots of action and tons of adventure! Character development is also used in top notch in this novel. The cover art tells of the excellence that this book trully is! A must read for any Action/Adventure/Fantasy book fan! I will definetly read more from R.A. Salvatore."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have just completed this book last night, and it is one of the best R.A. Salvatore books I have ever read. The book is basically non stop action, starting from one orc raid on some dwarven traders, leading up to a great battle in the secluded town of Shallows. I think I speak for everybody when I say that R.A. Salvatore should make a movie of the entire saga!"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Another installment of the immortal Drizzt series, The Thousand Orcs ascends to a philosophical level not normally seen in most fantasy novels. As always, it includes Drizzt's essays, and many complain about his confession of love for adventure. However, that has been a theme running through the entire series, and only those unfamiliar with the series lack the appreciation for Bruener's yearning to continue their adventure.Unlike most installments of this series, the only way to truly love the antics of the main characters is to understand the character development from the previous novels. One series of particular significance is the outstanding Cleric Quintet (also by Salvatore), in which the Bouldershoulder brothers, Cadderly, and Danica have their story. I'm interested to learn the backstory of the other renegade drow vaguely alluded to. If you begin your experience with Salvatore with this novel, you will not get the whole experience. It would be like watching Return of the King without seeing the previous two. The characters mean nothing to you.Read the books, know the author, and love the characters. I've read the whole series twice, and even quote them in my AP writing courses. You'll never find a more intellectual series of fantasy novels."},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have to say I have waited a long time for another of RA Salvatore's works from the fantasy realm of the dark elf and he hasn't let me down. I am trying to read this one slowly so I can move right into the sequel without having to wait too long. Drizzt is back in action and kicking some a$$ the way we've all come to love him. The other characters help keep the story interesting and we see a number of characters from other RA tales come into the mix. I always find it intriguing when different stories tie into each other. For example, the Bouldershoulder brothers play a big part in the Cleric Quintet. Amazing quality and a book that will wet your whistle for a while (if you can put it down:-)"},{"Title":"The Thousand Orcs (Forgotten Realms: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book was fast action the whole way. The best part about it is Orc king Obould who is becoming one of R.A. Salvators most deadly villians. I recomend this book greatly. However for new readers it would be a good idea to read some back books to catch up to the story."},{"Title":"Study Guide and Workbook: An Interactive Approach - for Starr's Biology","review":"Most college level introductory Biology textbooks cover the same material so distinguishing among the many options comes down to presentation. This book does provide many diagrams and pictures, however the writing is so horrendous that it appears the editor is as poor a writer as the actual biologist who's providing the information. When you have to re-read a sentence three or four times to understand its meaning, then it was obviously bereft of any sort of formal editing that any college textbook deserves. The systemic lack of appropriate sentence structure, modal verbs, and conciseness limits the reader's ability to absorb the material in a manner conducive to effective apprehension.The good news is that this is the older 5th edition of the textbook whose present edition is the 7th. I haven't read the newest version, but I am hopeful an actual editor was hired during its production. Since this 5th edition is available at a very low price, it is suitable if you're only looking to brush up on the basic principles of introductory biology. As a supplement to formal course instruction for anyone looking to pursue higher disciplines in the subject, investment in a better-written textbook would be strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Study Guide and Workbook: An Interactive Approach - for Starr's Biology","review":"This was my text in my undergraduate biology classes.

Patrick Leonardi's \\"The Ultimate Study Guide for Biology: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations (Volume 1, Volume 2 and Volume 3) were right on the mark for great test preparation questions.

Cecie Starr has a good way to explaining to me certain concepts by using current research that is easy to understand, and connects to the chapter. She uses examples and images illustrating the concept that I thought were helpful, and I was surprised by how up-to-date the book really was (the most recent thing I've seen is the SARS virus), and was even more fascinated for it. Also, Starr makes a point in redefining terms, or telling in what section the term is defined, so that the reading is more understandable.I honestly enjoyed this book over every other boring biology book I've had in the past. She uses great examples and explanations that helped me to learn. I always need something to attach the information to, and this book worked well in doing that for me.As for the online material, I used it very infrequently, so I guess I can't really comment on it well. The CD with the book uses videos, quizzes, flashcards, and links to helpful websites. It's helped when I've used it, but I haven't found much reason to since I understood the book well.

Hemingway, who saw the Spanish Civil War from the inside as a reporter, has a remarkable gift for describing places such as a guerilla camp in the high mountains, capturing the undertones between people who do not really trust one another, evoking the tension before a dangerous action, then setting out the course of that action in simple concrete terms. My reading accelerated as it went on, and in the end I could hardly put the book down.I turned to this after reading a much more recent book about that war, Dave Boling'sGUERNICA. Despite the more approachable style of the later writer, Hemingway clearly has the larger vision. Whereas Boling writes a sweeping family saga, Hemingway confines himself to a three-day period in a single area. The hero, Robert Jordan, is an American instructor from a college in Montana fighting the fascists with the International Brigade. He is sent behind enemy lines to blow up a bridge spanning a mountain gorge. To do so, he must recruit the aid of local guerrilla bands, who may or may not trust him or each other. From this simple assignment, the scope spans out in thought and flashback to a much wider canvas, not so much of place and time but of moral vision. For Hemingway (clearly anti-fascist, but no card-carrying red either) is concerned at every turn with human dignity, the liberty which makes this possible, the love and hope which makes it worthwhile, and the apparent impossibility of preserving these values in wartime. This is a novel of substance.Unfortunately, neither Hemingway nor Boling avoids the temptation to romanticize the common people of another culture. Most of Hemingway's guerrillas are two-dimensional at best, and rather difficult to tell apart. The exceptions are Pablo, the once-fearless leader now turned cautious, and his wife Pilar. But Maria, the rape-survivor with whom Robert falls in love (or at least into bed), is a male fantasy of eager compliance; he even addresses her as \\"little rabbit\\"! Worst of all is Hemingway's extraordinary decision to render spoken Spanish by means of an exaggeratedly literal translation, leading to lines such as: \\"And what thinkest thou of this of the bridge?\\" and the immortal post-coital question: \\"Didst not thou feel the earth move?\\" And his description of the act itself, a breathless homage to James Joyce and Gertrude Stein, may be a literary tour-de-force, but in that simple context it is laughably overblown. Hemingway had a better connection than most to people's souls and the movement of the earth; if only he did not go to such lengths to prove it!"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"\\"War is not a life: it is a situation, one which may neither be ignored nor accepted.\\"T.S. EliotFirst off, let me preface this review by stating that I have never been a big fan of war novels. Secondly, I would definitely not classify myself as an ardent aficionado of Hemingway's work. I highly respect, admire and appreciate his contributions to American Literature, yet he wouldn't quite make it into my top 10 list of favorite American authors. So that being said, I had my reservations and trepidations about what I was getting myself into right from the get-go. So many books... so little time...Published in 1940, this is a story about a young American man (Robert Jordan) who is in the International Brigades and attached to an anti-fascist unit during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). Jordan is an expert w/ explosives, and his mission is to blow up a bridge during an attack of the city of Segovia. Most of the novel is told to us from Jordan's perspective, which is obviously motivated by Hemingway's own experiences while living in Spain during this violent, chaotic era. The story is essentially about the three days leading up to Jordan's mission and takes place in the mountains just north of the capital of Madrid. It is here, that he meets a truly unforgettable, colorful cast of characters - Maria, Anselmo, Pablo, Pilar, Fernando, El Sordo, Agustin, Rafael, et al..., all fighting the good fight with our hero Senor Jordan.Jordan, like most of Hemingway's male protagonists, is full of testosterone, a bit aloof and apathetic, disillusioned, and of course, heroic. Papa Ernie describes him further, early on in the novel: \\"He was serving in a war and he gave absolute loyalty and as complete a performance as he could give while he was serving. But nobody owned his mind, nor his faculties for seeing and hearing, and if he were going to form judgments he would form them afterwards.\\" Like Ernest himself, Robert is a rough and tough, cynical, macho man. However on the flip-side of that coin, he is also a very sensitive and vulnerable soul, a flawed, complex character full of contradictions. He is a realist and a dreamer. He is a passionate lover and a fighter/soldier, a trusted, loyal friend and a bitter, vengeful enemy, etc... In other words, one big ball of paradox!Many reviewers have criticized Hemingway's characters for being too simple and unsophisticated. For example, the beautiful Maria, Jordan's love, especially takes a beating, for being so shallow and two-dimensional. However, I don't agree with that assessment at all. We have to remember that she is a simple, country girl who has been brutally treated by the enemy (I will not disclose how) and is caught up in trying to survive the savagery of a war. What do expect her to be like - Isabel Archer? Emma Bovary? Yes, Maria is a bit too simple and submissive for most strong, modern-day women to relate with. But Hemingway's creation of Pilar, well, there is a dame of different colors completely! She is one of the most fascinating and also one of the funniest creations in all of literature - a truly singular and intriguing character indeed!This was quite a nice surprise for me. I have only read five of Hemingway's pieces, yet this one is not only my favorite, but also has enticed me to pick up a few more of his classic works. It is the type of book that you either are going to love or going to hate and you will know which side of the fence you will fall on right from the get-go. Hemingway was a true minimalist, and spins this heart-pounding, intense yarn in a simple, straightforward manner. He doesn't develop his characters a la Austen, Balzac, Tolstoy, James, et al... but yet, few authors can do so much with so little like old Ernie could. And this classic is a prime example! Fiercely and austerely told, it is one hec of an intense ride!Highly recommended"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"We'll start with the simple ones: sad, deep, bloody...But it's the longer ones that truly sum up the book: thoughtful, emotional, frightening...\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" starts out simply enough, but it slowly progresses to being a book that houses a series of complex, not entirely predictable characters. Robert Jordan is the main character, an American, often comparing, often thinking. We follow him around in the midst of a not-so-pleasant, frighteningly bloody war. He is accompanied by other men who are either helping him, or have similar tasks, though not all are so. There is Pablo, who in reality, is Jordan's enemy, in that he intends to prevent Jordan from blowing up a certain bridge. There is Pablo's wife, Pilar, who tells a chunk of the book in the form of stories to Jordan about the past. There is Maria, Jordan's crush, and though many concentrate on their love, Maria is a rather flat character, though her history is one that tells more about the surrounding situation.The book itself isn't across that long of a time span, on the other hand it includes many stories that are told to Jordan. The reader is drawn in quickly, and despite the blood, the fear, and the uneasy way everything is written, it's an incredible book. Perhaps it's because of these things; they make the book more realistic and touching to the reader.It is certainly a great book, a wonderful read, and an interesting view on a little known event. It's a good book to read, even if you're not fond of stories with death and blood."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Despite the fact that Hemingway won the Nobel for the Old Man and the Sea, this is easily his best work. It's combination of a gripping plot, intriguing and full characters, and simple, beautifully constructed prose is one that is rivaled by few works ever written. The story is not a complex one that nonetheless captures the imagination of the reader. It is one of love, heroism, convictions, responsibilities and an avalanche of vocabulary words more.His language comes off as repetitive only because it is true. It is true to the words that we speak in our everyday usage and we can assume that that's true of the people of his times. The short, crisp descriptions give the reader a lucidity that one wouldn't normally associate with the lack of syllables in the descriptions. Like Shakespeare, one looks at a phrase, a sentence, a paragraph or a page and cannot discern how anyone could change a word for the better. Everything he put down is as it should be. Potentiality in literature has been reached and fulfilled in this particular form and variety.This book ranks with the greatest of American culture, the English langauge as well as with the greatest the world has offered. I do not hesitate to include it with the Brothers Karamozov, Don Quixote, Journey into the Night, Hamlet and the few elite literary accomplishments that humanity has produced.So, yeah, it was a good book. Read it."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Then check out the passage when he falls to nothing. This is the best war book (along with Tim Obriens The Things They Carried which is way different, and about a different war, but equally powerful) that I have read. It exhibits everything and gets to the point of life and its lack of purpose if you cannot find something worth dying for, and that that purpose is not the real purpose at all when it comes down to dying. This is not a dark book, nor is it self-pitying as I imagine a less able writer would make it so soon. It is not even depressing, it is exciting and touching and well-written. And there's winesacks as well. &quot;the bell tolls for thou,&quot; he quotes. This book gets to the connectedness and loneliness of people."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book is definitely one of the best classics I have ever read. The imagery, setting, action, and overall milieu was clear and well-written. Hemingway accurated describes the transition of a man in face of death and war. Torn between his obligation to the cause and his love of Maria, Jordan becomes increasing concerned with dying for the individual. The novel creatively portrays the psychological states of many of the people involved in war. I really recommend that you read this."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"You understand you have to like Hemingway. This work embodied his distinct style of writing, the spare, yet eloquent manner that is known as his. Hemingway's ability to saddle every word with meaning and emotion is at it's ripest in this work, where he writes a war story that encompasses the entire spectrum of the human experience, form love to hate, spite to sacrifice. While the Spanish Civil War included tens of thousands, Hemingway writes of a handful of people who represent the whole of the country. Heroes do not always win in Hemingway's world, but in their defeat, they do win. The bravery and ultimate sacrifice of the protagonist captures that bitter fact of life. This novel has a meaning and lesson that can only be appreciated and understood by those who have read it. It would be a loss not to."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway is still a gem. This book builds on his wonderful sentences into a tragic view of the Spanish Civil War. It is not overly 'macho' as some of his books. Just a darn good read even after 70 some-odd years."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bell Tolls, is equally very engaging and very dull. Occasionally this novel cracks with energy, the tension among the characters is quite potent, and then at other times it bores you near sleep. The rambling monolgues can be great(like when Pilar is detailing Pablo's once fervent commitment to the cause) and then at other times the words seem to be an annoying roadblock that you have to wade through to get to the meaty parts. All in all I respect this novel and do think it is a good work, but I can't give it more than 3 stars, because of the chores it sometimes put me through."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"After having read the first half of this book, I was bored. Nothing happened. We heard about a future attack, but it never happened. But then suddenly, at the last few chapters, it finally took place. And then the book got so exciting that I sat there gasping for air. I also understood why the boring first half was included, because that part was the one that made the last half in to such an incredible experience. And after I read the whole book, the first half became exciting too. So buy this book, it is the best I have ever read. But keep in mind, that the first half is boring. So do not give up. Keep reading it to the end, and I promise you the best reading experience you have ever had. It is the first book by Hemmingway I have read, but it will not be the last."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom the Bell Tolls is a great example of Hemingway's to-the-point writing style. He does not repeat himself more than he has to, and stays on the story.I enjoyed reading For Whom the Bell Tolls mostly because of Hemingways writing style and the historical background. Being a young male reader, I did not enjoy the love part of the story. I did not feel there was enough going on.Overall, Hemingway made a great classic story of the Spanish Civil War, and a unique, to the point writing style which I enjoy."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway's style was so fashionable amongst writers of the post WWII era, that Italian authors actually attempted to invent their own slang just to sound like him. I haven't kept up with modern Italian literature, but I am noting that American writing is slowly regressing into that pre-Hemingway over-wordiness. The focus now seems to be on sounding &quot;poetic,&quot; rather than writing &quot;one true sentence.&quot;This is truly sad because Hemingway brought American writing to a new level. You can almost feel his straining to come up with the perfect words for his descriptions.I read For Whom the Bell Tolls for the first time thirty years ago, when I was fifteen. It convinced me then that Ernest Hemingway was the greatest American writer of all time. Re-reading it now, in middle age, I still feel the same."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"A friend commented, and I whole-heartedly agree, &quot;there is so much more to Hemingway than the caricature of Hemingway.&quot; Amen. This book is beautifully written."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Good story, outstanding prose that makes the protagonists and war-torn Spain come alive before your very eyes."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"To me Hemingway epitomizes the hard drinking, hard living, hard loving, worldy writer. In this book, the main character Robert Jordan is a soldier send on a mission to the hills of Spain to blow up a bridge. There, Jordan meets up with a rogue band of warriors who believe in war but not in military. Once united with the militia, Jordan becomes involved with a woman named Maria. The fight scenes are incredible. The ending is even more incredible. I'm not going give away the book, but the ending brought tears to my eyes- I guess it's true, underneath every man of steel is a heart of gold."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"From beginning to end, this novel shows Hemingway's masterful command of the english language to affect his readers. This novel expertly touches upon every emotion a human being is capable of, holding a mirror to each and every one of us. Robert Jordan's sense of honor wavers several times throughout the novel but in the end, decides he must sacrifice himself for the good of his country. In a sense , he is almost like Jesus Christ. What a great novel."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"For Whom The Bell Tolls is one of the best books I've ever read. I've only been alive for 16 years, and I've read many books, but this makes the top. I loved the classic war epic about it. And the fact that there was a slight love story weaved into it made it all worth while. Robert Jordan could solve any problem that he ran across with whatever resources he had. I personally rate this as one of Hemingway's best and suggest that anyone who enjoys classic war stories read this book."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"In my opinion, Hemingway is the best writer to have ever been. His writing in For Whom the Bell Tolls is a bitter, believable prose that transports the reader to a place where the dust of war and the death of men is a startling truth. You don't need to know the author, Spanish or Spain, just be caried along by the beauty of his work. And if you do know Spanish, overlook his many mistakes in the language."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book was excellent. My room mate advised me to read it saying that it was the greatest book about the Spanish civil war ever. I know nothing abot the Spanish Civil war so I cannot comment on that. The only part of this book was that Hemingway wrote it. Not to knock Hemingway but knowing that his characters always die was not a comfort. I found myself routing for Robert Jordan through the whole book. It was like the last play of the Super Bowl. the way he had everything going wrong, but then at the end his mission goes through with full force. I've never really read Hemingway in all my life, but if I had to chose one of his books I would have chosen this one. The way he depicts the Spanish is all but wholesome, describes them more like cavemen, literally. There are many witty parts of this book that can only be funny during war. For anyone who is a history buff or wants to know what real war is like I advise them to read this, and pass it on to someone else."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I loved Farewell to Arms, so I picked this up at the bookstore near work and couldn't put it down. It really grabbed me. While the first chapter in any Hemingway book is difficult due to his lack of immediate characterization, it soon becomes easy to understand. I loved the dialogues between Pilar, Jordan, and Maria. They were so funny. I even learned some Spanish. I love Hemingway's prose and for a while I tried to model my own writings after his. Unfortunately, I'm not as good as he is at it. Anyway, this book has inspired me to go to Spain for my semester abroad and to research the Spanish Civil War more deeply. Great novel that happens to be educational."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I like this Hemingway book even better than A Farewell to Arms. It \\"stayed with me\\" long after I had forgotten most of the details. I read the book as a university freshman, then reread it after it came strongly to mind in summer 1987. I was standing on a steep, green meadow in Schwarzwald, reshuffling the deck of life. Like a Hemingway character, I was traveling around Europe living an adventure.Descriptions of many scenes are memorable. Reading as a twenty year old, dynamiting the bridge and the part where Maria crawls under the blanket with Robert Jordan were the strongest. One still likes those descriptions twenty-five years later, but one then also pays attention to the long description of old dead roses as the essence of the odor of death. And one never forgets the powerful ending. Here's how I remembered the ending before rereading it yesterday: Robert Jordan, mortally wounded, sends the pregnant Maria toward safety with the rest of his escaping band of comrades. Lying on his stomach on the steep meadow, as Franco's fascist troops come up the hillside into sight, he pulls back the bolt and takes a bead on the lead officer on horseback ....Because all dialogues in the book should take place in Spanish, Hemingway wrote partly in the early seventeenth century English of John Donne (readers familiar with the king James Version of the Bible, translated early in the seventeenth century, will easily recognize the language). This has the advantage of giving the reader the sensation of reading 'not-English'.It's still a very powerful book. In the context of history, Hemingway was impregnated with the Teddy Roosevelt brand of heroism."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Remarkable. This is a truthful and captivating tale of the Spanish Civil War (The republic against fascists) Hemingway, chose to center the story around a guerrilla group fighting behind enemy lines, as well an American dynamiter, Robert Jordan, who joins forces to take up a mission that may cost their lives. The story is set up straight away as Robert Jordan is introduced to each of the members of the small guerilla band(under 10 members), then the plot slows down a bit when the initial planning of the mission is taking place.Complications in this mission weave the plot: from a dreaded conspiracy and sell-out, to an unexpected romance. Robert Jordan is caught in many dilemmas, as he falls in love with a girl during his time with the guerrilla group, and now he faces the fear of dying and leaving someone that he loves behind. Jordan&iexcl;s internal monologue in this book does wonders in his contemplation of what is right and wrong, and trying to figure out what is important: duty against love, the cause of the Republic against the lives of the partisans--the very people that he had become close friends with. I think all this builds up the suspense and the fear for what may become of the characters.There are quick shifts between past and present in this long novel that actually only spans a mere three days. Flashbacks of Robert Jordan&iexcl;s grandfather and father, tells us a lot about his character and the reason that he fights in this war. And stories of each of the characters past, brings us closer to understanding each of the band members.The horrible story by the woman Pilar shows us that there is no such thing as &iexcl;the good side&iexcl; or &iexcl;the bad side&iexcl; in war; war itself is evil. The morality of war is also briefly discussed, along with an old man&iexcl;s fears of taking the life of another. Then of course there is the general question that is on the minds of all the characters: When will this all end?What I especially like about this book is its unique and brilliant dialogue. Hemingway directly translates Spanish into English, resulting in an awkward, but strangely realistic speech, providing fuel for the story&iexcl;s atmosphere.And all this leads to the explosive climax, with El Sordo&iexcl;s last stand, the blowing of the bridge, and the attempt to escape. It is brilliantly descriptive, and has a well set-up plot that will make you pray for the characters to come out of it alive. The suspense is unbearable. This book is definitely a page-turner and perhaps one of Hemingway&iexcl;s best works after The Sun Also Rises."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I can't say enough how much I like Hemingway and his writing. The complexities of relationships and the struggle to understand people's loyalities are shown in this book. Also a refreshing and informitive look at the Spanish Civil War.

Whether or not it was during the Spanish Civil War or not, I don't recall. What I remember most is his acidulous critique of the blundering All-American dolt who thinks he is the only one who can sort it out...He remembered great Paul Robeson, who will always be remembered( -I take it that many correspondents already take me as black.) Robeson was a great follower in battle, a great propagandist, and therefore a great warrior.Lee railed , in his inimical Gloucestershire, about 'The Big Cowboy' who thought he could lead these tender men to battle. He was kind, to the point of sheer tenderness, about Hemingway as a supporter of the people's great struggle, but he always saw him as impossibly arrogant, (I think), as a forerunner of today's all too cowboyish thickhead, who could I be thinking of?"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"The greatest book by one of the world's greatest authors. Anyone who considers themselves remotely interested in reading or literature should read this novel immediately.

So anyone you want's to read about being in a war should deffinetly read this book, it could change your mind."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I have been interested, as a pro-Republican partisan, in the Spanish Civil War since I was a teenager. What initially perked my interest, and remains of interest, is the passionate struggle of the Spanish working class to create its own political organization of society, its leadership of the struggle against Spanish Fascism and the romance surrounding the entry of the International Brigades, particularly the American Abraham Lincoln Battalion of the 15th Brigade, into the struggle.Underlying my interests has always been a nagging question of how that struggle could have been won by the working class. The Spanish proletariat certainly was capable of both heroic action and the ability to create organizations that reflected its own class interests i.e. the worker militias and factory committees. Of all modern working class uprisings after the Russian revolution Spain showed the most promise of success. Russian Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky noted in one of his writings on Spain that the Spanish proletariat at the start of its revolutionary period had a higher political consciousness than the Russian proletariat in 1917.That analysis calls into question the strategies put forth by the parties of the Popular Front, including the Spanish Communist Party- defeat Franco first, and then make the social transformation of society. Ernest Hemingway in his novel For Whom the Bells Toll weighs in on that question here. Whatever value the novel had or has as a narrative of a small slice of the Spanish events one must look elsewhere to discovery the causes of the Republican defeat.Ernest Hemingway most definitively was in love with Spain and always lurking just below the surface was his love affair with death. That combination placed in the context of the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39 makes for an explosive, dramatic tale. The hero is an American, Robert Jordan, aka Ernest Hemingway, of fizzy politics but a desire to help the Spanish people. Additionally Jordan, if expediency demands it, is willing to face danger and death at the command of the Communist-dominated International Brigades (although it is not always clear whether he is a Lincoln Brigade volunteer or a freelancer). Hemingway's critique of the Stalinist domination of the military command and therefore authors of the military strategy that led to defeat at times overwhelms the story. His skewering of Andre Marty, leader of the International Brigades, also has that same effect. In short, Hemingway believed that 'outside forces' meddling in Spanish affairs led to death for Jordan and disaster for the Spanish people. Well, nobody expects nor is it mandatory for a novelist to be politically astute or correct. Here Hemingway joins the crowdThe one subject that Ernest Hemingway seemed consistently to excel at was the telling of war stories. And whatever else might be true of For Whom the Bell Tolls it is preeminently a war story. A classic war romance if you have also seen the movie treatment of the book starring Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman. It might be a male thing, it might be a Hemingway thing, or it might be that the nature of war lends itself to dramatic tension that holds a story together. Today, in some literary circles, it is not considered politically correct to laud works by such dead, white males as Hemingway but the flat out truth is that the man could write. If his work stands outside the current canon of American literary efforts then something is wrong with the new canon.To make matters worst the current leftist-oriented literary establishment, grizzled, hard-bitten warriors that they are, has not been the only force that has taken aim at Hemingway's head. At the time of publication in 1940 the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, those who actually fought in Spain and the various Communist Parties throughout the world were unhappy with the novel. Why? Hemingway was too harsh on the deficiencies of the Communists, the International Brigades and the Republican forces in general. Above I mentioned that writers were not expected to be politically astute. That is one thing. But to say that Hemingway was essentially sabotaging the exiled Republican efforts to aid the refugees by the thrust of his novel is also politically wrong. The man did materially and militarily aid the Republican side (sponsoring volunteers and ambulances). That accrues to his honor. In short, Hemingway's writings- yes. Hemingway's politics no"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"A number of previous reviewers have noted that this book is about the difference one man makes in the world. Unfortunately, I think a number of reviewers have missed what Hemingways is saying about the issue. He is not saying that one man makes all the difference in the world, or that one man is meaningless compared to the whole. What he is saying is that the world continues without him regardless of whether he changes the world or not. The title of this book, and its theme, comes from John Donne's 17th Meditation, which says that\\"...No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee...\\"Hemmingway masterfully tells the story of a man, Robert Jordan, who becomes involved with some Spanish gypsies on his mission to blow up a bridge to help his side win a war. He begins thinking that it does not matter whether he lives or not, as long as he accomplishes his goal. However, he falls in love with Maria, and suddenly wants to live. He takes great pains to make sure that he will be able to do his job and blow up the bridge. He finally does it. Then he dies in the escape. And the world continues on without him. Hemingway is trying to say what Donne was saying: life is not tied in the individual, though the individual may be important. The individual is a part of the collective whole. The issue is not whether the individual is valuable or not, but rather the issue is the individual's relation to the complex web of human existence. Perhaps the best illustration of this idea is in Hemingway's beginning and conclusion of the book. It begins with Robert Jordan lying in some pine needles planning his life. It ends with him lying in pine needles dead. The whole middle of the book simply details his part in the complex web of human existence.Hemingway also explores the concept of war through Robert Jordan, who is fighting a war he does not need to be in. Robert begins to question why he is fighting and why the war is happening. Some have complained that Hemingway glorifies war. I do not disagree. I disagree when they say that it is wrong to glorify war. It is not at all wrong to glorify the Allies side of World War II, is it? It is wrong to glorify war for war's sake, but I'm not sure that Hemingway does that. He glorifies the willingness to lay one's life down for what one loves, not simply dying and killing meaninglessly (which makes his own suicide later in life rather ironic).Whether you agree with Hemingway's thesis or not, it is very well written and very interesting to read. The characters are very real, and it is neat to see what Spanish gypsies were like in the early part of the 20th century.Overall grade: A"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Someone should rush into George W Bush's office with a copy of this book. It's not anti-war, but it is about what Wilfird Owen called 'the pity of war', the terrible ironic waste of camaraderie and love and stories and landscapes, and the value of the life of just one man.So many reviews summarise the plot, so I'll refrain. It's almost like Hamlet, though; Robert Jordan has to blow a bridge, but four acts go by before he acts. In that space, he and we learn what the act will really mean - nothing, in terms fo the war, but everything to him. he's like a matador, int eh pause between the bull's turn and his impact. The whole book is lit up with Robert's mortality.And it sounds amazing, lyrical, not entirely spare, but with half-heard rhythms as steady as pulses.I liked Maria. I know I'm swimming against the feminist stream, but why not goodness in a heroine instead of the tiresome feistiness we've all seen so much of lately?Pilar, however, is not tiresome, and to meet her is alone enough to put this book at the top of any list of tO read books you may be making. She shines because it is SHE whoo is Hemingway - yes, folks, he was fat and a bit food-obssessed. And she is the storyteller. Hemingway was interested in that kind of transgression - read Garden of Eden. But read this first."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Poor Papa has become such a caricature, it is easy to forget that he was the source and inspiration for countless writers. On rereading For Whom the Bell Tolls, I was reminded of what thrilled me long ago when one could speak of \\"serious\\" fiction without ironic intent.ExoticismAll of Hemingway's work has an exotic locale with an unusual American driving the narrative. In this novel, Robert Jordan, a professor from Montana, is a demolition operative with a group of guerillas in the Spanish Civil War. He lives in the mountains, eats rabbit stew with partisans, is fluent in the dialect, makes love with a senorita in his sleeping bag, destroys bridges with steely skill and faces death with aplomb.StyleHemingway's direct and lucid style is in full form. It sounds great when read aloud. Nobody did it better.In this novel, much of the dialogue is memorable because of the literal translation from peasant Spanish. No English speakers would carry on as they do, and the arcane cant with its earthy directness permeates the whole novel.In 1940, Hemingway was unable to use 4-letter curses. He had to substitute the word \\"obscenity\\" or \\"nameless\\" yielding something like \\"I obscenity in the milk of your nameless mother.\\" Well, it's not very shocking, but I'm happy old Hem was stuck with that translation. Had the Bell been fouled with English vulgarities, it would have come off today as quite common and the exoticism would be considerably dampened.WomenMaria is Robert Jordan's love, but she is unremarkable as a character. In those times, a warrior's love interest had to be air-headed and adulatory. However, Pilar, the woman who commands the guerillas is an unforgettable person. She is too fat and ugly to bed, but her skill as a story-teller and judge of people are superb.PoliticsIn politics Hemingway was pro-peasant and he fought facists throughout Europe. In his latter years he complained about J. Edgar Hoover tailing him, and perhaps it was not delusory. Americans who assisted the Republicans (they were the good-guys in that time and place) were branded as Commies and were forever on the FBI trouble-maker list. It was courageous of Hemingway to make a collaborator like Robert Jordan his hero.Buddhist TouchesRobert Jordan is no monk, but he does live by some prime Buddhist principles. He goes on for some length about living in the now- there may be no tomorrow. Just before his death, he explains to the Maria that wherever she goes, so will he be there. A mystical touch that cannot heal their parting.And SoRead this novel to be transported to a time and place beyond the memory of all but the very old. Human nature is displayed in the extreme- both base and uplifting. It is one of the last great war novels that told its story without a blink.Hemingway's appeal is not very complicated. Growing up I knew some outdoorsmen and war heros, but they tended to be illiterate or mute. I knew some good writers, but they tended to be bookish dweebs. Ern could negotiate both camps, and he was the first writer to seize my attention. I think he'll be charming readers for a long time."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This book is definitely a \\"desert-island\\" book for me. I love all of Hemingway's extensive body of works, but this novel is by far my favourite. The story is about a young American man who is fighting voluntarily against Franco's Fascist forces in Spain. This man ends up leading a band of guerillas in what turns out to be a totally useless military foray. The novel itself only encompasses seventy-two hours, but in that time Robert Jordan, our American hero, loses his comrades in battle, falls in love, and is badly wounded. Hemingway's writing is masterful in this classic! This book, even more than \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" outlines Hemingway's thoughts on the futility of war, and the effect that war has on one single man. Even though the novel encompasses such a short time, Hemingway makes use of flashbacks to bring the reader into the series of events that led to this particular point in Jordan's life. Again, Hemingway makes use of personal experiences for this novel. He was actually involved himself in this Spanish civil war. His writing style is spare, although incredibly vivid. This is a truly wonderful book, that I feel encompasses all the best of Ernest Hemingway."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Mark Twain once said that \\"a classic is a book that everyone wants to have read but nobody wants to read.\\" It is a shame that \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is considered a classic, because unlike some of Hemingway's works, this is such an exciting, vivid, impossible-to-put-down novel. It should never be required reading in high school, although intelligent young readers would certainly love it. (Now that I think about it, some of the violent scenes are probably too gory for today's politically correct curriculum anyway.) It is the sort of book that someone's older brother at college lends to them, and then they pass it on to their best friend, and so on. There's a lot to this book beyond the plot, but unlike many other books that strive to explore deep human themes of life, sex and death, this one is approachable and very readable.The only reason I can think of not to drop everything and read this book right away (look how cheap the used copies are, for crying out loud!), is if you are planning a long voyage and want to make sure you have something really great to read along the way, in which case I would wait. While I am sorry that I didn't the book myself until I was 34, I had the great gift of reading it on a camping trip amidst hills, streams, pine tress and a rocky coastline that made it easy to imagine myself in the mountains of Spain along with the characters, and that made it worth the wait."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"When I read this book, I was astonished. How could a book be so amazing, so perfect? How could such a collection of words come from the mind of a man? This is the first Hemingway I have read and it will be the last so as not to risk tainting my impression of his genius with what must be relatively inferior works. Though I'm sure his other novels are great, I simply can't imagine them being on par with this absolute masterpiece."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway's story of Robert Jordan, an American college instructor fighting for the Spanish republic, is a beautiful story of desperate love and the death of an ideal.Robert Jordan has been assigned the task of blowing up a bridge behind Fascist lines in support of a Republican offensive. He is sent to a guerrilla camp in the mountains behind the lines, where he meets those who are to help him with this task. He also meets and falls in love with Maria, a young Spanish woman who was brutalized by the fascists, and rescued by the band in a previous raid.Hemingway details the nature of the war in the way that only he can, using his stark prose to depict the decay of the idealism that characterized the beginning of the Spanish Republic. This is particularly evident in the character named Pablo, a once-fervent fighter for the Republic who has lost hope in the cause and just wants to be left alone in the hills. Each character has his own idea of the Republic and why they are fighting, which is as truthful a depiction of the Republican cause as could be hoped for.There were three parts of this book which really stood out for me. The first was Pilar's account of the execution of the fascists in her village. Pablo's ruthlessness, along with the growing terror of the people who go from reluctant participants to bloodthirsty mob, is terrifying in its escalation and horrible finish. Second is the final stand of El Sordo, who accepts his fate, but draws a little pleasure and satisfaction in his efforts. Third is the final battle in Chapter forty-three. Hemingway doesn't overdramatize things, he realizes that things are dramatic enough, and the straight-forward presentation of the battle as things go well and then get worse carries much more impact as a result. The stark, straight-forward writing makes these events come to life as tragic circumstances not only for the dead, but for those who survive as well.I would suggest that any reader do a little research into the Spanish Civil War before reading this book, as a little knowledge of the circumstances and people of the war (like Marty and La Pasionaria) will enrich the story immensely.This book is very compelling reading, as Robert Jordan struggles with love and duty, while both fearing and accepting his dangerous assignment. In the abstract, this book is about the death of the ideal in Spain, the corruption and dissent which led to the demise of the Republic. Hemingway conveys these ideas in a way that only Hemingway can, weaving a fabric of sadness and beauty amid hopeless circumstances."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This is an excellent, immortal novel. Hemingway truly takes the reader on a journey through his world. The characters are very real and the book develops with great skill and depth. This novel should be required reading for humans.For Whom the Bell Tolls has no bad points."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"This was my first time reading a book by Hemingway, and it was not all I had hoped for. The Spanish Civil War is one of my major interests (it was the subject of my undergraduate research thesis) and so I ordered this book with great anticipation. Unfortunately, I was not completely satisfied.\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" gives a great understanding of the personalities and characters of the Spanish people. It also is balanced in the sense that it shows that atrocities were committed by both sides.However, my main complaint with the book is that it seems like nothing happens. It is not until probably the last 100 pages or so that action begins to take place. (Granted, there were many instances during the Spanish Civil War where the lines were at a standstill and nothing DID happen, so perhaps in that sense it is quite accurate). But despite how much Hemingway tries to build up to the destruction of the bridge, it's not exciting by the time you actually get to that point.The other thing that irritated me (and this is just as a Spanish speaker) was that the dialogue is written as though it was literally translated word-for-word from Spanish conversation rather than translated for meaning. For example, the dialogue reads, \\"That he comes soon,\\" (\\"que venga pronto\\") instead of, \\"I hope he comes soon,\\" or \\"He better come soon.\\" It just makes the dialogue awkward and unnatural.Despite my complaints, I will not let this be my only reading of Hemingway and I will try out something else of his in the near future."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Robert Jordan is a young American fighting against the fascists in the Spanish Civil War. He is sent into the mountains to make contact with a small band of guerillas to blow a bridge in support of an offensive.Hemingway's tremendous strength of drawing characters that the reader comes to know and care about is on full display in \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\" Jordan falls in love with the young woman, Maria, who is seeking refuge from a world that has robbed her of her childhood innocence. There is Pablo, the former leader who has seen the futility of the war and cannot face the day without dulling his mind with wine. There is Pilar, Pablo's mate, who longs for her youth, but has now assumed the role of leader and mother to the small group of fighters.Robert Jordan and the reader come to know the dynamics of the group quite well. Jordan wrestles with the necessity of endangering the group of people for \\"the cause.\\" This book depicts the contrast of war's brutality with the camaraderie of friends.\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is considered a classic for a reason. This is a book that has aged well and will stick with the reader for a long time."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway has a way of getting into our heads. The characters are plain spoken; almost Shakespearean at times; with powerful, philosophical paragraphs sprayed in. His interest in bullfighting is obvious if you have read any of his work; and is not ignored here. Against the rules of writing he uses the Spanish tongue; although irritating, he gets away with it.Set in the mid 1930's, and centered around an American munitions expert fighting to help the cause of removing the Germans, Italians, and the rest of the fascist armies from out of Spain. He links up with a group of cave dwelling partisans outside of town. Much of the book is spent on his relationship with this group and him falling in love with a young girl, whom he can never have.Some may object to the ending, but I found it fitting; \\"I man's gota' do, what I man's gota' do\\"Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"Hemingway's \\"For Whom the Bells Toll\\" an entertaining read but more importantly a very moving read. It does not say that war is terrible it says what's terrible about war. Everything in the book has a meaning; the imagery beautifully shows Robert's changing understanding about life, the allusions show an interesting blend between Spanish and American influences, and his abstinence personification and metaphors shows how concentrated Hemingway is on real life. However the symbolism found in real life is surprisingly poetic especially in the book, where Robert lay at the same position he did as the book started only this time he lays with his heart against the forest floor. This of course means he learned how to use his heart by connecting it to the love interest Maria, who symbolizes Spain the country Robert finds his family in. Truly the lessons learned by Robert is the lessons every one learns, and Hemingway was smart enough to put it into a thrilling war novel with impeccable historical influences."},{"Title":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"I first read this about 40 years ago.
