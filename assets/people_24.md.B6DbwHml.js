I've been meaning to get around to this book for a long time, but it took the movie, 'The Great Raid' to cause me to put this as priority.I previously reviewed GHOST SOLDIERS on which the movie was made, and done well. It was so realistic that I had to cry (and I don't cry easily) because of the ferocity and lact of humanity the enemy showed. It was the same in WWI only our soldiers were not equipped to fight anyone that animalistic. I see now why Tennessean Alvin York went berserk and killed so many of the approaching enemy in this war, as he was cornered and was fighting for his life.It's not always war where you have to defend you right to live in freedom. I had to use my elbows to get out of a difficult situation which I found myself in this past month. As in WWII, the enemy set out to engage and reduce the other side. This war engulfed Europe in 1914 and we came to their aid; now, in 2005, more than ninety years later, Europe has surpassed U.S.A. as the superpower of the world calling themselves the United State of Europe. Copycats! We should not jump the gun so quickly when the ally you fight for strives to surpass you in everyway. We thought we were helping England against Germany. Well, at least the Confederates who 'lost' the American Civil War took the cause of Britain and France, while the American Yankees took the side of Germany. It was another Civil War only on foreign ground this time. My favorite historian wrote that Lincoln didn't ask for or accept a surrender from the Rebels as that would be acknowledging that the Confederacy had been a sovereing nation and not \\"just a feverish mob,\\" as Sam Houston is credited as saying. I have trouble believing a Tennessee governor would stoop to such stupidity.The machine gun, poison gas, trench warfare and the airplane were used first in this war to beat all wars. \\"As President Teddy Roosevelt rallied the diverse ethnic groups of the nothern state (where he originated from) -- Italians, Mormons, Jews, and Irish -- Confederate President Woodrow Wilson struggled to hold together a nation still beset by ignorance, prejudice, and class divisions.\\" The United States still has all of the listed attributes, especially two professors from other states who tore down one of the Southern Civil War heros with a book full of lies and no truth. That shows ignorance and prejudice is alive and well as the Northerners are still considering Tennessee a hillbilly state and everyone in it \\"white trash.\\"As in WWII, the aim was \\"don't surrender,\\" and \\"never give up whatever the situation.\\" The Americans were bound to give no information to the enemy when captured except name, rank, and serial number. when captured except name, rank, and serial number. There is a government employee here named Whitt who is proud he went through \\"Ranger\\" school and, now sixty, is still using the war tactics he learned there to bully anyone who has a difference of opinion. Sometimes, in severe times of conflict, the soldiers and their leaders had to crawl like a snake to survive. Planes had a pivotal role in rescuing the POWs in the Phillippines and their flying low over the camp was the signal for the troops to move into position for the night maneuvers. It's true that war is hell; and nothing is really accomplished. When you defeat one dictator or generalisimo, there is another to take his place to start another war.Houston went on to the Alamo after fighting at San Joquinto to meet his fate. He was shot in the ankle by his men there and had a festering groin wound from his early days in Tennessee which caused the dissolution of his marriage. He went to live with the Cherokee Indians leaving the Governor's chair empty. If he called the Confederacy a feverish mob, he is not one to talk as his life was just one fever after another."},{"Title":"Bar-20 Days","review":"Rather than feel as though I was reading a novel, this felt more like I was reading three or four short stories -- episodes in the life of a young Hopalong Cassidy.

In Mulford's books the cowboys are a somewhat romanticized version of the real thing. There is always a realistic Old West picture of people and places. After all, Mulford was born in 1883; he lived during those times. His style is often the Victorian indirect humor and description, without the dryness. But sometimes it is just plain danged good writing. Lots of interesting characters, and they're not cardboard. If you like history and the Old West, tag along the trail with Hoppy and the other boys from the Bar-20 Ranch. I bet you'll enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Bar-20 Days","review":"Not your William Boyd Hopalong. This was a neat book for a kid that grew up from the 40's thru today. (Yep!

It's a one-of-a-kind must-have for anybody who loves music. A real class-act. The pictures and layout are fabulous, and to read interviews of writers talking about how they created some of some of your favorite songs is enlightening. But the CD's---the audio interviews with these wonderful creative people---are truly amazing. I especially loved hearing Graham Nash talk about Joni Mitchell and &quot;Our House&quot;---but all the interviews are super. You feel like you've been invited into the writer's living rooms and are sitting right there while they share their trials, tribulations, and victories.

Some of the songs featured, like &quot;Our House&quot; and &quot;Sitting on the Dock of the Bay,&quot; were popular when I was a teenager and really brought back memories. Hearing the stories behind these songs that are so memorable for me really gave them a dimension that they didn't have before, making me like them even more.

I highly recommend it - not just for music lovers, but for everyone who has ever listened to the radio or a stereo.I'm a big fan of VH1 Behind the Music and this is more like a &quot;Behind the Songs&quot;.

Insightful interviews about the many (25) classic songs leave a lasting impression: this is edu-tainment at its best. The detail in the book, good number of pictures and good composition, make for a most relaxing read and listening experience.

Segments of this should be standard in every high school music class, to inspire the next generations of songwriters, and pay honor to the writers before them."},{"Title":"Off The Record: Songwriters on Songwriting","review":"I was interested in Off the Record not so much because I'm a fan of the music, but because I have a lot of curiosity about creativity, and I'm fascinated with other people's processes. That's why I loved this book. Grace Slick comparing (and contrasting) songwriting with painting, John Sebastian drawing creative inspiration from the mechanics of a guitar, Randy Bachman realizing that the classical training he'd abandoned as too restrictive was actually the key to the musical freedom he craved-it's great stuff. Very enlightening."},{"Title":"Off The Record: Songwriters on Songwriting","review":"Does anyone else think this review has been spammed repeatedly?

Semester after semester I deal with these texts and this is the first time I have ever despised a book enough to actually write a review about it.Firstly, although this may simply be a pet peeve of mine, I am tempted - in the spirit of the season - to send the author a Christmas gift: a dictionary, with the word \\"Redundant\\" highlighted; and a thesaurus, with the page containing the word \\"Nevertheless\\" dog-eared.Aside from that minor nuisance, however, I often find that the author writes with a vindictive attitude. What I mean by this is that I found many instances where he writes something along the lines of \\"these people believe this, and these people believe that, and this is why they're ALL wrong.\\" In all honesty, he comes across as being bitter that anyone other than him would ever do research on any subject.Also, because of the author's tendency to frequently cite his own research - more so, in fact, than any other one source - this text appears to me to be some sort of feeble attempt to legitimize the author's previous works and thus validate him as a doctor. (\\"Look here! It's in a text-book, it must be true!\\")In summary, this textbook is entirely amateurish and - although it may occasionally contain some useful information - many of the pages consist entirely of poorly written filler information which negates any positive effect the good information may have had.My suggestion to any other adolescent development professor out there: write your own book. You'll make some extra money AND validate yourself as a \\"scientist\\" (or whatever else you might want to claim - crawl into a breadbox and call yourself a loaf of bread for all I care but DO NOT use this text.)P.S.

In a state of confusion and disbelief about how they now feel about each other, she finds herself driving by her former lover's new home, wondering what her new life is like. She finally realizes that this is not going to help her situation, and after reading an article about a woman who disappeared for three weeks only to reappear in Florida, hundreds of miles from her home, she decides to disappear also, to remove every trace of her former life and to discover her true self.This novel traces her path along the roads and highways of eastern North America, starting in North Carolina and settling on a remote island off the coast of Canada. Along the way, she discovers herslef through musings about relationships, her missing-in-action father, animals and nature -- especially about the mysterious catamount, a large mountain cat, which is on the verge of extinction and rekindles feelings about her own life's path.It's a very moving story about self-discovery. Sarah Van Arsdale's style is poetic, very clear and detailed, making it quite enjoyable to read. I really liked the main character and how she handled herself in very realistic terms."},{"Title":"Toward Amnesia","review":"Wow! This book is for anyone who's ever been dumped by anybody. Ms. Van Arsdale writes beautifully. This story is filled with clear imagery and a deep understanding of loneliness and loss."},{"Title":"Toward Amnesia","review":"1996 Lambda Literary Awards Finalist in Lesbian Fiction\\"It was on Memorial Day that I decided to achieve amnesia.\\" Thus starts Sarah Van Arsdale's first novel \\"Toward Amnesia\\", a story of lost love, pain, depression and pursuit of oblivion, self-discovery and, ultimately, about what makes us want to keep on living: \\"[...] the catamount had battled back from the edge of extinction, just as I had propelled myself back from the cusp of amnesia. My god, I'd nearly obliterated myself, that untamable nature.\\"After reading an article about a woman who disappeared for three weeks only to reappear in Florida, the nameless narrator runs away in desperation, trying to built a new life to escape the memories of her five-year relationship with Libby, her confusion over the end of the relationship and her still ongoing obsession with Libby who has taken a new lover while blaming her for the break up. Finding a medical textbook with a reference on how people become amnesiac, she tries to induce amnesia on herself by immersing herself in the cold deep water in the island where she settles. The book style is poetic, with an unerring clarity and detailed view of emotions and nature, and the first-person narrative is effective in establishing the emotional tone of the book. Also, considering that this is not a plot-driven book, it is a sign of Sarah Van Arsdale's talent as a writer, the way that her book keeps us riveted until the end. A highly recommended book and a fine example of high quality lesbian fiction."},{"Title":"Toward Amnesia","review":"I love this book, and am on my 3rd time reading it.

I can't wait to read her next book!"},{"Title":"Toward Amnesia","review":"After reading this book, almost two years ago, I was so moved by the poetry of Ms. Van Arsdale's words that still I have a vivid picture in my mind of each chapter. It is true that this book delves deep into heartbreak, and that in itself can be quite depressing, however it also delves deep into taking charge of ones brokeness. Reading this book could possibly change you... and there lies the beauty and power of literature. Bravo Sarah."},{"Title":"Toward Amnesia","review":"I don't usually like love stories, romance, etc, but this isn't a love story in the truest sense of the word.

It was very easy to read and I got caught up in what the main character was trying to do- leave her loss and old life behind and create a new life (one without her old lover). In the process, she heals herself and finds herself again."},{"Title":"Toward Amnesia","review":"&quot;Toward Amnesia&quot; reminded me of Anne Tyler's &quot;Ladder of Years.&quot; Sometimes, a woman reaches a point in her life, by her own or by others making, when she needs to change. But she's not sure to what. The best way to achieve that is to run away because in that aimlessness she eventually runs toward something. The poetic style that Van Arsdale uses in &quot;Toward Amnesia&quot; is effective in setting the emotional tone of the book, though it's sometimes monotonous in this first-person narrative. Our main character, the narrator, has lost her lover, Libby. She is obsessive, depressed and, honestly, needs more than a weekly visit with her psychiatrist. I don't think Van Arsdale realizes this (the summaries above do not), but this running away is a sad story that fails to come full circle. In her effort to achieve \\"amnesia,\\" the narrator eases the pain of a lost love but she also loses herself. She fails to see how Libby has been cruel, by taking another lover and how Libby has blamed the separation on her. I'm not convinced that the narrator has or is going to make it back to herself."},{"Title":"Devotionals for Women on the Go: Women of Faith Audio Book Devotional Series","review":"If you are into listening to the music and some devotions here and there, than you might like this.

Barclay goes back to the original Greek word behind each of the 15 works of the flesh (from immorality to drunkenness) and behind each of the fruits of the Spirit (from agape to self-control). He looks at the way the pagan Greeks used each word, at the way the word is used in the Greek Old Testament (the Septuagint or \\"LXX\\"), and, of course, at the way the word is used in the New Testament. As Barclay says in his preface, \\"any consideration and exposition of Christian Ethics must necessarily begin from as clear as possible a definition of the ethical terms of the New Testament.\\" Barclay gives us a paradigm for doing just that."},{"Title":"Flesh and spirit: An examination of Galatians 5:19-23","review":"One of his best contributions.

I don't know what made anyone give this more than a 3 star at the most. I have read two other books by her, Morning Glory and The Endearment. They were both very good. This was just okay.

It reminded me a little of an old Bogart-style who-done-it, but with a bit of modern horror added in. The author has obviously traveled throughout the world and makes many references to distant lands, which I enjoyed.

She doesn't arrive at adefinitive model but does present a convincing case that it lies in the sense of being able to feel safe and free within a &quot;transistional space&quot; wherein one feels ones drives as being from ones own self and not the result of identifcation with the other.Overall a very dense book, that for me rewarded skipping around alot."},{"Title":"The Bonds of Love","review":"This is an incredible book.

Her ideas are still very contemporary and I was surprised to see the publication date! I wish she would write more!"},{"Title":"The Bonds of Love","review":"In remarkably clear language, Benjamin reworks Freudian psychoanalysis so to include the possibility of mothers and fathers mutually recognizing each other as subjects thereby enabling a cooperative relationship where similarities and differences are acknowledged. Without this modification, she argues that traditional Freudian theories with their sole reliance on individual intrapsychic reality cannot help but reproduce patriarchal gender relationships which are characterized by domination and submission, most notably reflected in the cultural polarity of male rationality and female vulnerability as seen, for example, in the Story of O. She further argues that the dispassionate rationality of the marketplace masks not only the dependency of the working class but male domination as well. Convincing in its integration of Freudian theory with both feminism and marxism, it marks a significant step forward in understanding how the personal is indeed political."},{"Title":"The Bonds of Love","review":"This was a very academic book about women's rights, women's power and the thought process of power and domination. It was very insightful and helpful for me to understand my relationship with women."},{"Title":"The Bonds of Love","review":"Are a bit ephemeral, according to Benjamin, for they suppose and originate in the constitutive acts of an other subject, acts which not only may recognize one's subjectivity but also fail to recognize one's subjectivity. Thus the pain when such a failure occurs. Thus the efforts individuals expend to manage their lives to avoid such pain.Benjamin's book was hardly the first to address these issues. It was, however, the first to address them systematically while relating them to feminist theory. An important book. A must read for those interested in Left political and social theory."},{"Title":"Visible Worlds: A Novel","review":"I had not heard of the author until I discovered this excellent novel in a London bookshop last month. I am surprised the book did not get more publicity on its publication as it is a cleverly plotted, very original, reader friendly novel. I was frequently reminded of Graham Swift's Waterland, but Visible Worlds has a distinct identity of its own. The author hints early on that her main twenty characters are all linked, but she keeps the reader guessing, teasing us with little clues in each chapter. One family leaves a trail of footprints in the snow that stretches twice around the globe - almost; a trail covered by three family members in a relay that takes more than half a century to complete. The landscapes of Northern Russia and Canada are beautifully evoked - I have recently read several books about Antarctic travel and thought I had read more than enough descriptions of long marches through snow, but Bowering finds ways of avoiding the cliches favoured by other writers. The book has a strong feeling for places, time, distance, family tensions and the Cold War paranoia of the 40s and 50s. I found the book slow at the start, but it is well worth reading through to the end. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Visible Worlds: A Novel","review":"Good read but characterization not strong enoughThe plot of this book was exceptionally well crafted. The imagery and descriptions were written so well, you can truly see yourself in the Arctic Ocean, northern Canada, Siberia, and Germany and everywhere else the author takes us.

I loved the way that Mrs Guillaume developed the characters. The secondary characters helped to bring everything together, G-Paw had some serious issues with his views of women. Jacie was not someone who would let people walk over her and Chas was determine to make sure that her reputation is not ruined with gossip about their relationship.

What Chas has not devoted much time to is a love beyond a thriving business.Feeling responsible for the spur of moment decision that has caused Jacie to lose out on another job, Chas makes her an offer, but after talking with her brother Uri, Jacie has a counter offer for Chas.

While he has a vast knowledge of the repertoire and the personalities of new music, bringing some enjoyable trivia to the book, I found MUSIC: Healing the Rift to be disappointing.The interesting proposition with which Hewett opens and closes the book is that new music is useful to the public because, far from being some elite art hermetically sealed off in academia, it proves a basis for discussion of popular music and has already went through many of the changes which popular genres have experienced. Even as popular artists criticize the art music tradition, their rhetoric is full of terminology derived from it.

If you are familiar with books from this era, they are usually published in segments and later put into one full book, (such is this case). Details on the four sections of this book are as follows:Book 1 & 2: Story of a man named Paul Flemming, who lost a loved one and is on a journey through Germany. This is almost entirely thoughts on philosophy discussed between himself, his good friend Baron (who departs at the end of the second book), people he meets, people telling stories and sharing opinions, most of which is naming and contemplating the works of other famous writers, poets, artists, musicians, songs and so on, and reflecting their own sentiments of the works.Book 3: Much of the previous, now in Switzerland, but with an introduction to a good friend Mr Berkley and Mary, who shares similar interests and he quickly comes to love. But in telling a story, he embarrasses himself and decides to leave with his friend, Berkley, to continue his travels.Book 4: Now with a more negative outlook, Flemming travels with his friend when a storm follows and Paul falls ill. After a few weeks, he begins to feel better, and Mr Berkley reads to him. Soon fit to move on, the story continues. Paul is more on the subject of life and death, and with, (at least to me,) an unhealthy interest in graveyards. I guess he's in a transitional period. He meets more people and is inspired by their stories. At the end, he hears the voice of his Mary in the next room and dreams of her. But instead of seeing her, he leaves to continue his travels.Mostly theory and observation, but not enough practice. Given his circumstances, I'd imagine he'd be going through changes. Some interesting introspection and thoughts on life; though, if you're looking for a story with a definite feeling of beginning, middle and end, this is more of a philosopher's book told through the heart of a young man in the midst of a deep existential crisis.PS. I'm under the assumption, also, that Longfellow chose the name Hyperion from the uncompleted epic poem of John Keats (as Longfellow seems to be a fan), since the poem talks about despair of the Titans and their fall to the Olympions. Keats temporarily gave up because it felt too Milton-esk (which Longfellow seems to also be a fan) and from tending to his brother who succumbed to death from TB in 1819. Later Keats attempted continuing the poem (The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream): \\"framing it with a personal quest to find truth and understanding\\"..... Of course, for all I know, Longfellow mentioned this in the Introduction, which I did not read...Ah, as for aesthetics, this is a lovely little edition."},{"Title":"Kallie's corner","review":"Twelve year old Jane Nichols, the only child of wealthy parents, lives a comfortable, orderly, sheltered life in Manhattan in the 1960s. She attends a private school, is a member of the most desireable clique, and does whatever her parents, teachers, and friends expect her to do.Then Kallie, a scholarship student, joins the seventh grade class, and Jane begins to question her passive and conformist existence. Kallie, the daughter of traveling anthropologists, is comfortable with people and places beyond the borders of Jane's narrowly defined world. Jane's friends think that Kallie is weird, but Jane is intrigued by Kallie's descriptions of her dollhouse, an alleged replica of a Hudson River Octagon with three stories, including a dome with a cupola.When Jane discovers that the dollhouse is not exactly as described, she is initially angry and disappointed, but she rapidly recovers as she discovers the joy of imaginative play and the satisfaction of creating playthings. Shunned by her old friends, Jane decides to celebrate Kallie's birthday by helping Kallie's neighbor, Mr. Girandello, stage a puppet show with a Christmas theme in Kallie's honor. But first, Jane has to locate a venue, write a script, help create the puppets, obtain refreshments, and solicit the assistance of the unconventional inhabitants of Kallie's Greenwich Village neighborhood.The events that follow help Jane develop her leadership skills and usher her towards the threshold of adulthood.

In his moving story of the Yaak Valley in northwestern Montana, he does touch on these subjects--the economic and other reasons why the Yaak should be protected from out-of-state corporate interests--but his story is more far-reaching than that. He understands that the value of a forest extends to something less tangible than economics, and he says it as well as any other living writer. His discussion of the correspondences he's had with the Montana Congressional delegation is entertaining and poignant, and his descriptions of natural scenes are visceral and succinct. At times his tone is like that of fellow naturalist Doug Peacock, but his skill with words is far greater. Bass gets a lot of bang out of few words. You'll come away feeling like writing to your Congresspeople. A beautiful and passionate account."},{"Title":"The Book of Yaak","review":"I first came across Rick Bass in the very readable collection &quot;Big Sky Reader.&quot; His essay there about accompanying a friend on a fishing trip with several out-of-state fishermen was an enjoyable glimpse into the lives of folks in the thinly populated woods of the far northwestern corner of Montana. It's a self-sufficient kind of life, where people make do with few amenities in exchange for the beauty and solitude of the mountains and the isolation that comes with many months of snow and cold.That essay, &quot;This Savage Land,&quot; appears in this collection of the author's nonfiction. However, instead of the self-effacing, quiet humor of that essay, the rest of this book is a poignant account of an apparently doomed effort to preserve the Yaak River valley as a wilderness and bring a stop to the clear-cut logging that has been steadily turning it into a vast area of devastation. Chapters describing the author's letter-writing campaigns and his trip to Washington DC to make his case before Montana's congressmen alternate with descriptions of walks on the mountains, sighting bears and other wildlife, discoursing on the delicately interrelated flora and fauna, and admiring what is left of the old growth forests. There's also a chapter on the experience of the winter months and another on a summer of fires in the mountains and the role that fire plays in the regeneration and preservation of forests.Through it all are the themes of loss and the ruinous harm of the logging industry, which he believes is not simply destroying a wilderness area but removing a critical link connecting regions where grizzlies, wolves, and other forms of wilderness wildlife still survive. When that connection is gone, he believes that these creatures will quickly die out. Meanwhile, the poet in him believes that something also dies within humankind when the wilderness is gone, and he reminds us that once it's gone it will be gone forever.I recommend this book to anyone interested in the mountainous West, nature writing, and the lives of people in sparsely populated and isolated areas. It's also a book for those whose hearts respond to the call of the wild and who are concerned by the destruction of national forests by the heedless economics of the logging industry and its strangle-hold in government and other seats of power."},{"Title":"The Book of Yaak","review":"Rick Bass bares his deepest feelings about the forest where he lives in northwest Montana. This book is a collection of personal essays, some are straight forward pleas for the reader to take action, that show how important it is to to save the remaining ancient forests, not only in Montana, but anywhere. Other essays describe his experiences with the local people, wildlife, and the forest. Collectively, they all help us to understand the importance of saving our forests from the destructiveness of poor logging practices. Rick's passion for the forest comes through loud and clear. After reading the book, you'll be moved to write your congressperson"},{"Title":"The Book of Yaak","review":"Rick Bass lives in the Yaak Valley of northwest Montana. He wasn't born there, but he came to love the place and has made it his home. The people of the valley make a small, isolated community, with only weak versions of the infrastructure most Americans expect such as roads, telephone service, and shopping opportunities.This book is a collection of essays, as short as one page long, talking about the Yaak. They are presented in no particular order that I could determine, but that's OK - - Bass doesn't really write essays, he writes poems that look like essays.The chapters provide lyrical accounts of his love of the valley, daily life there, political activism on its behalf, and the friendships he has in the valley. There are encounters with grizzly bears and politicians, the deaths and illnesses of friends, adventures with a fishing guide, and the pleasures of waiting for the mail.I find it difficult to describe the book further. Like the Yaak, it is, and it is good that it is."},{"Title":"The Book of Yaak","review":"Rick Bass has written a plea that is at times elegant and at other times shrill. The best writing in the book are the stories of long-time valley residents (both human and animal) trying to exist in a habitat that is shrinking in the hands of indifferent government and corporate stewards. Every 30-40 pages there is the ripe whiff of the holier-than-thou that usually occurs when a gifted writer transplants himself to the West and somehow comes to believe he is the only one who can truly interpret its significance. But this is possibly a quibble based on the prejudices in my head as a longtime Wyoming rancher. In any case, it's good to know that each member of the Congressional delegation received a copy of this book, although it's doubtful that Conrad Burns or Craig Thomas ever cracked the thing."},{"Title":"The Book of Yaak","review":"I bought this book after visiting the Yaak. and loved the wonderful prose and the enormous feeling of the wilderness.I loved the book, and recommend it highly -- it really focuses on the valuable resources we have but often don't appreciate."},{"Title":"The Book of Yaak","review":"I do alot of reading of Conservation related issues and I like the fresh and crisp approach Rick Bass used in waking up the frontier spirit that is in all Americans.

To their amazement it is Lilliput and they are the first &quot;giants&quot; to visit since Lemuel Gulliver. Of Course Lilliput has also modernized over the intervening centuries. The children try to find a way to return home, and although the Lilliputians are kind and caring, they wish to preserve the secret of their island home......How will it turn out? Well it's rather a surprize. Read it and find out!"},{"Title":"Castaways in Lilliput","review":"I'm so happy to see this wonderful book back in print. I would have to say that Children's literature is and always has been my favorite genre and I've read thousands upon thousands of children's books. When I say this is one of my favorites of all time, I mean it as high praise indeed. My 4th grade teacher read it to our class back in 1962 and I was captivated by it from the first page. Two brothers and a sister, Ralph, Jim, and Peggy, drift too far out to sea when they are rafting off the coast of Australia. In the darkness of night they do eventually wash up onto a shore...but it is certainly not a familiar shore in any way! It seems the kids have washed aground in Lilliput, the very land where Gulliver's story unfolded long before. There have been no other \\"giants\\" in Lilliput since Gulliver's Travels and the Lilliputians are as amazed and unsettled by this event as the children. Lilliput has continued to change and develop in the years since Gulliver's visit and theirs is a modern world not unlike the one the children have left behind, only much, much smaller. The descriptions are really delightful such as when one of the Lilliputians gives poor Peggy a bedspread to wipe her tears. The youngest brother finds ways of getting everyone into trouble and causing some hilarious predicaments. This book has lots of action and is such good food for the imagination that it stuck with me for over 40 years and is still as fresh in my mind as the day my teacher read it. Do the kids ever get home to Australia? Well...wait and see, but don't miss this book, it's the greatest."},{"Title":"Castaways in Lilliput","review":"\\"Castaways in Lilliput\\" is one of those enchanting, delightful imaginary books and features 3 young children, who find themselves stranded in Lilliput, which was, to them, only a fairy tale before. Naturally, they all want to go home (although Peggy is, of course, delighted by the tiny houses filled with furniture); but they find themselves in quite a pickle as they grope around among the miniscule cities and desperately try to convince the Lilliputians that they are not wicked and violent giants.Quite an entertaining story; I didn't like it quite as much as some of Henry Winterfeld's other books, but worth the time indeed. I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars, as 4 seems to be a bit underrated. Highly recommended for kids!"},{"Title":"Castaways in Lilliput","review":"Read this as a child and never forgot it.

He loves the story and asks me to read a chapter, or two, or three to him every day! Great story for kids that love fantasy!"},{"Title":"Castaways in Lilliput","review":"I recently got my hands on an old copy of this well-loved book. My 9 year old daughter was as enchanted as I was with this story of three kids who are castaways in a raft and find themselves on Lilliput. I was very vague on the details but I did remember how charmed I was when the Lilliputians brought food to the children: Tanker trucks with milk, wagons of tiny loaves of bread, teeny-weeny little cheese balls. I also remember how cool it was to picture the kids riding on the train. This book has held up well over the years, it did not seem dated at all. Definitely a must read!"},{"Title":"Castaways in Lilliput","review":"I recently came across this book while babysitting my 9 year-old Nephew. He asked me to find his lost book, and I found it, but also found myself reading it as well. Being 32 years old, I'm not embaraced about confessing this because I enjoyed it as much as my Nephew dose.I found it rather Ironic that the characters should be Australian, because that's where Lilliput really is. At the time when Swift wrote \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" (1726) no Englishman had ever seen the shores of what was then known as \\"New Holland.\\" (Now, Western Australia.) The exact position of Lilliput is in what is now the edge of the Great Sandy Desert, near the Infamous 1950's nuclear testing ground at Maralinga. So if they're still there, they aren't going to be very happy, hah ha!The whole story progresses with the 3 kids beings washed ashore and discovered by the local inhabitants, as they attempt to play with the toy like city that they find. After that, the adventure kicks off, with the youngest brother causing all kinds of mischief and cute moments, when Peggy, the girl, is giving a bed sheet to substitute as a hanky.Over all, it's a fun story that had me reading all night, and is a definite must for younger children, as well as older readers."},{"Title":"Gouldian Finches: Everything About Purchase, Housing, Care, Nutrition, Breeding, and Diseases","review":"I found this book very interesting, and providing helpfull information for the average finch keeper. I have been raising and breeding exclusively gouldians for about 13 years now, so I find the genetics section in this book (though not VERY elaborate) of primordial importance. I also liked the vivid description of the nuptial dance, the sound and chirps etc... as well as the pictures. So, if to say, on a scale of ten, 1 being a very silly book and 10 an extensive genetical analyisis and nutritional guide for expert breeders, I give this book a well-earned 7."},{"Title":"Gouldian Finches: Everything About Purchase, Housing, Care, Nutrition, Breeding, and Diseases","review":"This book is one of a series of pet books which do actually tell you most of what you need to know if you want to keep the pets concerned.For once, I did things the right way round and bought the book BEFORE the birds, and as a result I have learned a number of tips which I hope will make my keeping of these beautiful birds more successful.The photos are excellent but I query whether the average finch keeper would need quite so much detail on finch genetics - and am left amazed that breeders seem to be going to such lengths to breed all colour out of a finch whose chief attraction, to me at any rate, is its bright plumage!"},{"Title":"Gouldian Finches: Everything About Purchase, Housing, Care, Nutrition, Breeding, and Diseases","review":"If you've already studied all of the Gouldian Finch information on the Web, and now you're looking for a resource that will be more comprehensive and authoritative, then this is NOT the book for you. A simple Google search will easily unearth more information, and the Gouldians you will read about on the Web are far more robust than the seemingly suicidal birds described in this little volume. In fairness to the author, I'll add that this book was published in 1991, and much of the information on the Web was probably extrapolated from this author's pioneering work.A more petty grievance about this book is that the author deserved better editing by his publisher. Someone should have renovated all of the awkward sentences, the possessives without apostrophes, and the outright errors, such as where we're instructed to PALPITATE (instead of PALPATE) a bird's belly."},{"Title":"Gouldian Finches: Everything About Purchase, Housing, Care, Nutrition, Breeding, and Diseases","review":"If you are serious about raising these beautiful birds, this book is a must.

She turns out riveting bestsellers published under her name and also finds time to pen intriguing Victorian romances writing as Amanda Quick. Now, following on the heels of \\"Lie By Moonlight\\" we're treated to another return to the 19th century when men were handsome and mysterious and women submitted to their \\"ravishment.\\"Heroine Venetia Milton not only submitted, she planned it. A photographer with paranormal gifts she is pleased to be away from those who know her and at Arcane House where she is employed to photograph a collection of relics. She was retained by Gabriel Jones, a gentleman with many secrets. Fans of Amanda Quick know that it isn't very long before Venetia and Gabriel are in each other's arms.Venetia is stunned when she reads of her paramours death. Then, for reasons which were not quite clear she pretends to be his widow. As any widow would be, she's shocked to find her supposed late husband living and breathing. Please note that the breathing on both their parts is heavy as their attraction to one another is renewed.Nonetheless, there are those who would do them both harm in order to discover the secrets that Gabriel possesses.Romance, mystery, intrigue all set in Victorian England and given voice by stellar actress Anne Flosnik. What more could a listener want? Enjoy!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I really love Amanda Quick, but this one just didn't work. We don't even get to see the hero and heroine meet and spend time together; the action starts after they've already spent a week getting to know each other. Very disappointing from a romance novel.And I don't really expect tightly woven mysteries in my romance novels, but the plot in this one defies belief. It's never explained why the first murder even occurs. The hero's fear that the murderer will focus on Venetia because she's using the last name \\"Jones\\" is beyond ludicrous. If that was going to be a major plot point, at least make it an unusual name that would link the hero and heroine together. But JONES?!All would be forgiven if the romance were compelling, but it wasn't in the slightest. I will probably choose to wait for the next one in paperback or at the library."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"After a night of passion with Gabriel Jones (the gentleman who had hired her to photograph his collection), photographer Venetia Milton is saddened to read that Gabriel has lost his life in a fire. Deciding to make use of this opportunity, Venetia poses as Gabriel's widow and moves her family to London, where she opens a new portrait shop. Imagine her surprise then when Gabriel walks into to drawing room many months later, very much alive. Apparently, someone wants access to some papers that they think Gabriel has, and he had pretended to play dead in order to discover who had tried to kill him. But now, with Venetia pretending to be his widow, Gabriel is afraid that the killer will come after Venetia. Venetia is stunned, and a little miffed that her plans have come crashing down around her; after all a live husband was the last thing she expected to have to contend with. But with her life, and potentially that of her loved ones at stake, Venetia will have to put her ire behind her and work with Gabriel. But can she? For Venetia has secrets that she'd rather not share, esp with the man she's so terribly attracted to...I know that the last few novels by Amanda Quick haven't exactly been stellar ones --esp when one compares them with her earlier work \\"Seduction,\\" \\"Scandal, etc. But there's always been something, even in her less than stellar works for one to grab onto -- a good storyline, good chemistry between the hero and heroine, suspense. This time around, however, everything seems very flat and very formulaic. The storyline is a variation of one that has been used a number of times, the chemistry between the hero (Gabriel) and the heroine (Venetia) is almost nonexistent, and the villain of the piece not only sticks out a mile (the villain might as well have carried a sign saying \\"here I stand, come and get me.\\") Who would have thought that there would come the day when I would actually give an Amanda Quick novel 2 stars?The shame of it was that the storyline, although it was much used intrigue/mystery subplot, had quite a bit going for it. However, while one can overlook the fact that an author has much used a very familiar subplot, slightly harder to overlook is the fact that the interaction between the hero and heroine in \\"Second Sight\\" lacked sparkle. From the manner in which the first few chapters unfolded, I rather thought that I was going to like Venetia quite a bit -- she seemed intelligent and very capable. But while, thank goodness, Amanda Quick did not allow her heroine to behave in an extremely foolish manner even once, she did make her seem rather obtuse at times. Gabriel, on the other hand, was easy to like and take to, even if his character was under-developed -- and really, one has little choice but to approve of a hero who possesses a sense of humour. All in all, though, this was a disappointing read: the historical aspect was mere wall papering (and although I realize that for many readers this is not a priority. I rather like a little more detail in these historical novels), the suspense was lacking, as was the chemistry between Venetia and Gabriel, and the storyline just lacked energy and vivacity. If you are a fan, by all means read this book, but be forewarned, it is nothing like her earlier works. If you've never picked up an Amanda Quick romance novel, than choose one of her earlier works instead (esp her \\"S\\" series), you won't be disappointed"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Seducing Gabriel Jones seems like the perfect solution. He's handsome, charming, and Venetia Milton knows she'll never see him again. And Venetia certainly doesn't want to remain a virgin for the rest of her life. When word arrives that Gabriel has died, she decides to become his widow. In Victorian England, widows have so much more freedom than unmarried young women--and Venetia needs all the freedom she can get to make her photography business thrive. A thriving business is all that keeps her and her family from poverty. When Gabriel walks back into her life, however, not dead at all, her calculations go out the window. Has she put herself and her family in danger, as Gabriel suggests?Venetia and Gabriel investigate the strange occurances that surround an alchemical discovery which Gabriel had made at the beginning of the novel. Someone has already stolen an alchemical notebook and seems intent on stealing the empty case that once held it. But Gabriel's investigation has gotten him nowhere in the months he was presumed dead and Venetia is convinced only she, perhaps using her psychic ability to perceive auras, can help him. Gabriel, in turn, wishes to keep Venetia safe and is frustrated by her willingness to put herself in danger.Author Amanda Quick (Quick is a pen name for Jayne Ann Krentz) is an excellent writer. Her characters come to life and her dialogue sizzles. It's easy to get hooked in SECOND SIGHT and it's a hard book to put down.Still, as I read it, I started feeling as if I had read this book before. I hadn't, exactly. Increasingly, for me, Quick's books are starting to fall into the same pattern--a poor but talented and ambitious female is making her own way in the world--but badguys are causing her trouble. Fortunately, there's a hero around who finds her quirky nature compelling, helps her overcome obstacles (while nevertheless making it clear she could have done so on her own). I think I'm ready for something a little different, please Amanda."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Amanda Quick aka(Jayne Ann Krentz) never lets us down. And Second Sight is wonderful, full of zest, wit, and wonder. The first in a series about the Arcane Society, I can hardly wait for the next.Gabriel Jones hires Miss Venetia Milton to photograph the Arcane Society's collection of metaphysical and pyschic objects. He is the son and heir to the Master of the Society. Gabriel has his own sixth sense in that he can get emotions from objects that have been touched. Somewhat of a recluse he finds himself enchanted by Venetia and she finds him fasinating and seductive. Because of his abilities Gabriel doesn't go about in society very much. He and his brother do the undercover work for the Society. At this time they are trying to find out who stole the notebook they found in an ancient wizards tomb.Venetia is the sole support of her family, she sees auras, and uses this ability in her photography. Using the money from her job for the Arcane Society she sets up a shop in London. Two weeks after Gabriel has whisked her away from the Abbey because of a break-in she sees his death notice in the paper, shocked and full of grief for the man she briefly felt connected to, she uses his last name as hers when she goes to London, as a widow has more cachet in the sight of the ton. Imagine her surprise to learn he is still alive.Gabriel returns to protect Venetia, and fully intends to exploit the good fortune that she has used his name as hers. Her picture of the lid of the strongbox is very important to the man who stole the notebook and he will do anything to get that picture. As in any good mystery by Ms Quick they are quickly involved in the muddle of events that unfold. I read it in one sitting, lately I have started to debate on my hardback purchases. So many have not been worth the money. This one is.

However, once I discovered that it was the third book in the Arcane Society series - I decided to start at the beginning. So I purchased Second Sight - let me just say that I had reservations about the setting \`Late Victorian England'. I don't normally read things written in this setting - but it wasn't as unpleasant nor as distracting as I normally find the setting.Gabriel Jones was a well written character - I would have like to have experienced more of his dark side. Venetia Milton's character was surprising, she was an unusually strong character for the setting of the book - I have to say I was very impressed.I am now on the 3rd book in the series, and while I am not completely hooked on the series - I have purchased the next 2 - (The Third Circle (Arcane Society Novel)andRunning Hot: An Arcane Society Novel).The series in reading order:Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)White Lies (The Arcane Society, Book 2)Sizzle and Burn (Arcane Society, Book 3)The Third Circle (Arcane Society Novel)Running Hot: An Arcane Society NovelThe Perfect Poison (Arcane Society, Book 6)Fired Up: Book One of the Dreamlight Trilogy (Arcane Society Dreamlight Trilogy)"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"After deciding to seduce her employer, photographer Venetia Milton gets more than she bargained for when criminals interrupt their night of passion. Gabriel Jones, member of the secretive Arcane Society, is sure to put Venetia far from danger before going after the criminals in his home. The thieves are there in search of an alchemist's formula thought to enhance paranormal abilities. Ensuring Venetia that they will meet again, Gabriel goes off to fight the intruders.Later, when the papers report the Gabriel died the very night he sent her away from danger, Venetia decides to take his surname with her new venture in business--the Jones Gallery. She decides to go into trade to support herself and her family which is comprised of her two younger siblings and her aunt.

When her deceased husband, Mr. Jones, returns from the dead her world is thrown into a whirl. She can't help but wonder if Gabriel returned for her, or for something to do with the paranormal-focused Arcane Society.This book was okay, but just okay. Venetia was likeable, but I never felt that she had a strong sense of identity. Her psychical powers were about all she was good for, and I never really felt any reason to like or dislike her. Gabriel, on the other hand, was an impressive hero and one that I would be interested to read about in future Arcane Society novels. His gift for sensing his prey and protecting what is his were my favorite parts of this otherwise mediocre story.As some of the other reviewers noted, all of Quick's novels are beginning to sound the same. If you like them, then you won't be disappointed. But I can't help but wonder if she has anything else in store for us."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"If this book had been written by any other author, I would have given it 2 stars. I was very disappointed because I have read every book written by Ms. Krentz/Quick and have loved them all. I own them all! This one totally left me cold. I never got into the characters. I thought I would like Venetia at first, but I never really got into her. She was very stiff, formal and had no sense of humor whatsoever. She did warm up some during the love scenes, but even those seemed thrown in because they were necessary in the book. It was like the characters thought, \\"Oh yeah, we're supposed to be incredibly sexually attracted to each other, so let's have some sex scenes\\". The character of Gabriel was also like a shadow of all the other male leads in the Quick books. None of the relationships in the book were well developed. Venetia's and Gabriel's relationship didn't really develop either. It didn't seem like they were friends, let alone lovers. Finally, the mystery seemed to limp along. It didn't make a whole lot of sense to me throughout. It then comes to an abrupt, unbelievable end. I hope the next Quick book will be up to the standard of her previous books."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"This is my fourth time to write this review. If it doesn't work this time I will know that the paranormal forces are aligned against me and give up. The first two I erased myself. The third one disappeared into that great black hole in the Amazon computer (but only after two days) and it didn't even have any rants, raves, or rambling. Go figure.THIS REVIEW HAS WHAT SOME MAY CONSIDER SPOILERS. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM, STOP READING NOW!1. This is billed as a paranormal romance. Don't believe it. If you expect to learn anything about the Arcane Society from this book you will be disappointed. Why was the society formed? We are told that the society was formed two hundred years previously by the alchemist Sylvester Jones but that is on page 5 and no more information is given. Who were and are the members? How do you join? How have they maintained the strict secrecy concerning the society all this time? WHAT DO THEY DO? None of these questions, which are actually quite basic, are ever answered. Venetia was commissioned to photograph the \\"artifacts\\" of the society. Do you know that not one of them is ever described?2. What was the formula? What was it supposed to do? Again, no information. Just in the very last pages, what happened if you drank it, but what was its purpose?3. The editorial and artistic decisions made in printing this book just made me MAD! The print is so big I could read it without my reading glasses and I DID NOT buy the large print edition. Each chapter begins on the right hand page and half way down, at that. This results in totally blank pages, half blank pages and enough white space between other chapter endings and new chapter beginnings to form another blank page. I actually added it all up. At a conservative estimate I got over 63 blank pages (or their equivalent) inside this 390 page novel. Padding, padding, padding just to make it into a long enough length for a hardcover book. Hopefully these issues will be addressed in the paperback version. FIX THIS! Also, the print is done in a washed out grey, not crisp black. Why? For atmosphere? Did I mention that the margins were \\"generous\\"?4. The heroine, Venetia Milton, was (according to my way of thinking) cold and calculating. This was supposed to be because she was \\"modern\\" in her thinking for the late Victorian era. She chose to seduce Gabriel Jones after finishing her photography job at Arcane House because it was an isolated location so there was not much likelyhood of getting caught, she would never see him again, and she was on the shelf because of her age and family obligations. She wanted to find out what passion between a man and woman was like but never wanted to get married. When she thought he had died she was sad enough to cry, rub his coat (which she had kept with her even though all her clothes and photographic equipment was left behind-but not the camera-during her flight from danger)and then decide that life must go on. She became a \\"widow\\" in London to ease her way into business and used Mrs. Jones as a name because he wouldn't be needing it anymore. Cold folks, cold. When he \\"came back from the dead\\", she considered him an inconvenience. There was no joy in seeing him, they never even touched! Good heavens, she called him \\"sir\\" for well over 2/3 of the book! And please, Ms Quick/Krentz, what in the world were you doing with the Janus Club stuff? Just more \\"modern\\" thinking? In order to provide a reason for blackmail? Very, very weak.5. The paranormal \\"gifts\\" these two characters had were piddly. She saw \\"auras\\", he \\"felt evil\\". Whoop-de-do! I kept waiting for something else to be revealed, but that was it. Sum total of their paranormal abilities. Why was it necessary for this novel to be set in late Victorian England in order to set up the contemporary novel under the Jayne Ann Krentz banner? This one is dull and boring. That is my opinion. Others love it and have praised it to the skies. I love other Amanda Quick books, just not this one. It is totally forgetable for me and I will never want to read it again.In short, it would have made a passably good 100 page short story. Nothing more.*****As an update, I saw the paperback version of this book in the bookstore yesterday and I'm happy to say that the publishers did address (to some degree) the problems of blank pages and other editorial decisions mentioned in my review. If you want to read this one, for goodness sakes get it in paperback.*****"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I've read almost all of Amanda Quick's romances and most of her work as Krentz. I liked Lie by Moonlight better than Second Sight because it seemed less predictable. Regardless, her writing is a notch above other romance novelists and it is always good for fast easy read with likeable characters and just the right amount of steam. If you are looking for great literature along the lines of something by John Steinbeck this is not it of course, but sometimes you need a little chocolate and a romance."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"This is a book you will either love or hate.The book starts of with the two main characters Venetia and Gabriel together in a room. You kind of feel you missed them getting to know each other as they've already been together a week.The main story of this book is that Gabriel Jones is presumed dead after a break-in at the house they were both staying at. So for Venetia to open her own business and not have to face prejudice she decide to pretend she is married and takes the surname, you've guessed it Jones.Now he is dead, right, so what has Ms Venetia to fear? Well guess what Gabriel isn't dead, he's pretending, so he can flush out the real murderer who he want to think that he is dead. Confused. Don't be. It's quite simple when you read it.Anyway Gabriel reads the paper one morning with his cousin in attendance and he knows straight away this woman who is a photographer, who has his surname, is Venetia. So he decided to go to her and see what she is about.He puts the tale about he is her dead husband returned from the dead. The tabloids weave a romantic story out of this. It's really her own fault.Now keep in mind Venetia has a special ability, she has paranormal gifts, but so to does Mr Jones. So they have some things in common. This is focused on a bit throughout the book. You also meet Venetia's family who are involved in the family business and her younger brother at times is quite funny with the way he says thing and then Gabriel's family are rather interesting also.Anyway to sum it up, this was funny in parts and a very enjoyable read for any Amanda Quick fan.

Ms. flosnik's reading style and accent totally take me right to England and I can picture everything that is happening. The main characters are likable and are presented in an average mystery/light romance.

I wolfed down the paperback in a few hours. It's not a cozy murder mystery; it's a romance thriller with an intrigue.Though the characters in this book were on the anemic side and the plot a little murky, I still enjoyed the story a lot. The mystical properties held by the central characters were interesting to this first time Amanda Quick reader.I realize that the paranormal presented in Second Sight is a measly scrap for ardent pursuers of supernatural centered stories. Still, the tasty bit served in this book roused my enthusiastic curiosity for more.Also the seduction scenes were fun too! The few scenarios sizzled on the pages on Second Sight. Judiciously placed, the few trysts add a spicy tang to the story without overwhelming the reader's senses.It was my first book from this author and I'm looking forward to more - under her real name of Jayne Ann Krentz or by her pseudonyms.

Historical romance fans will enjoy this charming couple who either are in the fire or causing the fire.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"The Arcane Society is a group of magic users who exist within a wider mundane world and have been organized since the 16th century. The author, writing under multiple pen names, has novels with this world view in both the late Victorian era and modern times. This is the first (chronologically) set in the 19th century and begins a series of at least three. (White Lies and The Perfect Poison follow.) I accidentally read them out of order, but each is sufficiently self-contained that it didn't matter too much. The &#34;bodice ripper&#34; sections seemed rather formulaic - spinster decides to get laid, target is in the Arcane Society, she has magic too, he &#34;takes&#34; her virginity, they beat the bad guys and get married. The individual plots are interesting though and it's a nice adventure as you learn more about the Author's theories of magic and how they relate to good vs. evil plotting. I picked up these because I really enjoy Mercedes Lackey's Elemental Masters series. These have more sex and less plot, but they're still quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I just loved this book!The characters are engaging, dynamic, and quite entertaining! Amanda Quick is known not just for her exciting adventures and steamy romances, but also for the comedic prose that has readers laughing out loud at the dialogue between characters.Venetia Milton is thoroughly likable. A young charismatic photographer with a sense of adventure, she cares for her younger siblings and elderly aunt after her parents past away. She is clever with a strong sense of responsibility, loyalty, and kindness. She is a heroine the reader can't help but admire! Little does she know that her life is about to change after she embarks on a project to photograph old relics for the Jones family...Gabriel Jones, the Jones family heir, is intelligent, dashingly handsome, and good at keeping secrets hidden. On a mission to discover who stole the recipe for the founder's formula, he embarks on a mission that can cost him his life and the lives of those he cares for. His protective nature, sense of humor, and compassion are a perfect match for Venetia and make him an excellent and thrilling hero.The characters in the plot from young Edward to Gabriel's parents are wonderfully scripted! With a robust cast of characters, a clever and twisting plot, and a hot and sultry romance, this book was one I enjoyed immensely."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"It is a good book, and it explains how the arcane society bagan. It is a little of a hard read. If you read this book first you will not continue, but I read 2 others and got hooked, so I needed to know how it starts. If this is the first Amanda Quick book you have read, put this down and read others and then come back to this."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"3 out of 5 stars. Another book I started out really liking and then grew bored with. It was ok I guess."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I've read a few books from the Arcane and Harmony Series, but had never read them in order, so I was looking forward to reading the book that started it all. I was a little disappointed with \\"Second Sight\\". It didn't seem like it was quite up to Ms. Krentz's usual riveting standard. The writing seemed almost a little sloppy at times, not as well constructed as later novels in this series.That being said, though, I did enjoy the book and was happy to start at the beginning of the Arcane novels. I'm also happy that I purchased it, simply because I like to have complete series in my library. I suspect that any sloppiness of writing was simply the author feeling her way through the new universe she had created."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyes this book. Amanda Quick, who heads off the Arcane Society novels series with this book has definitely gotten my attention. I can't wait to see what else she has in store."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"The plot was rather lame and didn't hang together too well. There wasn't much suspense. The evil one was pretty easy to identify and I'm not sure there weren't loose ends. The way people spoke was quite stiff; Victorians may have talked that way, but I wouldn't think so. The convention of the single girl with responsibility for younger siblings was there, but the younger siblings had little character or anything to make them stand out.At the end when everything was explained, the characters just took turns explaining what happened. Even the younger sister who really hadn't been involved in the plot had a piece to say about it all.The hero was a rather silly person who worried about his psychic powers making him a throwback, but fell in love with the heroine immediately (though she, like a modern, rather than Victorian woman, just wanted a night of illicit passion - another convention for these novels, in fact, this one used by this author already). In Victorian times, this is not credible. I was thinking how she could easily have gotten pregnant. She was only 27! (Supposed to be old in Victorian times, but with her sense, she'd have known that was a risk).Readable and OK, but really a rather dumb book!"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"The Arcane Society novels are diverting paranormal adventures. I like the fact that Amanda Quick tends to create capable, self-reliant, career-oriented heroines who think for and act by themselves."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"This was my first Amanda Quick book. It got off to a good start, but gradually declined into a boring state of affairs. I was finding myself wondering why the pace was so slow and ponderous while Gabriel's, Venetia's, and possibly Caleb's lives were in danger. I was wondering WHERE is this book going and WHEN are we going to get there!?? UGH! The logic behind their strategy to unravel the murders and mystery was so weak. For what is supposed to be a romance, there was no sexual chemistry beyond the initial contact. Gabriel seemed pretty dull. Venetia pretty stiff while flaunting the \\"I gotta be an independent female\\" thing. I made it halfway through - to the scene when Venetia dressed as a man - and it just put me over the edge. It's like the author was just writing whatever to fill the pages - so insipid and cliched. I can't waste my time reading this stuff when there are so many good books to be had. What a disappointment. I won't be rushing into reading any other books by this author."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I was very impressed with this work and read her later books because of it. Too bad the others were not nearly as interesting as this one. Great characters!"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I was surprised by all the positive reviews of this book; it averaged one star with my book club. This is the 2nd Amanda Quick book I have read (the first being \\"With this Ring\\") and there is no comparison between the two. I really enjoyed her first book, but with \\"Second Sight\\", it felt like reading a different author entirely. The characters were bland, the dialogue repetitive, and there was no sexual tension whatsoever. This is light reading with a capital L. I'm going to try another of her older books, I hope it isn't as boring as this one."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I like Amanda Quick's books (and also the books she writes as Jayne Castle). I think they're fun, lighthearted, amusing - even if they can be rather samey and a bit, well, cheesy.Second Sight seemed a little different to her other Regency/Victorian books.Although the basic story is the same - romance mixed in with a murder mystery and a bit of psychic/mesmerism included as well, like Wait Until Midnight and some other books, this one felt a little... well... stale.It started off a little differently, with the requisite giving up of virginity to tall, dark, handsome rugged stranger at the beginning of the book rather than halfway through, and somehow the rest of the book didn't quite ever catch my attention fully.Our heroine Venetia is a photographer and she has a special talent in that she is able to view people's auras. Gabriel Jones, the tall dark rugged man, is a secretive chappie who takes her virginity and then gets himself killed. Venetia pretends she's his widow so that she can make her way in her photographic business more successfully than being a spinster - but then Mr Jones turns up alive and they start investigating murders and missing relics. It's all similar stuff to that which Amanda Quick has churned out before, but it doesn't quite have the magic that some of her other books have.It's noticeable that the chapters are shorter in this book and that there aren't any real cliffhangers - things resolve quickly, moments of scary fighting only last a page or two, and the resolution trundles along as expected.Some of the vocabulary in this book is remarkably similar to that in Amaryllis that Jayne Ann Krentz wrote as Jayne Castle. The \`hunting', \`primitive', \`throwback' descriptions of Gabriel Jones seem very like Rafe Stonebraker in that other novel; is she running out of ideas?Overall this book is a perfectly acceptable read, and none of her novels are great literature, but I usually find them better than this and Ghost Hunter, her latest Jayne Castle, was way better. This is still a step up from the Lavinia Lake books she wrote as Amanda Quick, though."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"outstanding book. Very good subject and very well written. I loved Venetia and her modern views."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"If you have enjoyed Amanda Quick other books you will find this one very entertaining. The characters are interesting and play off of each other well. The idea of both Gabriel and Venetia having paranormal abilities and both using them on each other was exciting. Both of their families were enjoyable to read about. I hope her next book is about Caleb, Gabriel's cousin."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I found this surprisingly good. I'm not much of a romance reader unless it is mixed with another genre, but I really liked this one. The characters were smart, funny, and endearing. The setting is historical with a touch of fantasy. The characters have some form of magical ability which they hide from society by being a part of the \\"Arcane society.\\" I thought the minor characters were so funny and sweet. Each was different and unique from each other. I'm looking forward to reading more in this series."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"This was a pretty good story, and I really liked the interactions between the hero and heroine. I have always enjoyed Ms. Quick's characters, they are not your usual cookie cutter fare. This book is no exception, and it is very well written. I especially liked the elements of paranormal that were tied into the plot-and it was very smoothly done as well. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a touch of the supernatural in their romance, and also to all the readers like me, who will pick anything up with her name on it!"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I've always been a fan of Amanda Quick's witty sense for verbal exchanges and amusing plots, but this is by far one of the worst romances I have ever read. The romance between the couple in unconvincing and unsubstanciated; the plot is silly and nonsensical. Do not read it; you'll be disappointed. Try one of her earlier books, like Mystique, that's a bit more plausible."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Upon her parents' death and the resulting financial devastation to her family, it is up to the inimitable Venetia Milton to support her younger siblings and her aunt, else they become destitute. Forging a career as a much sought after photographer in a time when women rarely hold jobs in male dominated professions, Venetia finally manages to obtain a job that will secure her family's fiscal well-being for some time, even allowing an advantageous move to London.Knowing a widow will be better received in Polite Society than an unmarried woman, she invents a late husband, adopting the last name of Gabriel Jones, the man who showed her one night of passion before his untimely demise. The plot succeeds better than she ever expected, and soon she is the toast of the town, an acclaimed photographer in high demand by the most fashionable names in London's elite society.But the unexpected rival of the very much alive Mr. Jones on her doorstep threatens her carefully laid plans, while the danger that follows him threatens her very life!This is the first book from Amanda Quick I have yet read. I was quite excited to read a book by this much lauded author, and the plot for Second Sight struck me as a story well aligned with my reading tastes. With a blend of the paranormal romance amidst a Victorian era setting, it is the kind of tale that I would normally find myself riveted to.The plot was indeed well done, with some very intriguing \`whodunit' twists and a suspenseful story that keeps the reader guessing until the end of the book. Where the book missed, in my opinion, was in the character development. The prologue to the story starred the hero and another male character, and neither intrigued me throughout the prologue. In fact, I could not discern which of the two men was the hero.The first chapter introduced the heroine of the piece, Venetia Milton/Jones, and it is her character that the reader can empathize with first. Through her eyes, we are reintroduced to the hero, Gabriel Jones, and become more interested in this character as well. Both are likable, attractive people, and I genuinely wanted to see them together, but found my excitement for the match dampened by the consistent formality between the pair, even while in the throes of passion.There was almost no real character development for the cast of supporting characters, including Venetia's family, who are present in many scenes. Throughout the first half of the book, these characters remained largely one dimensional, only becoming slightly more interesting in the second half of the book as we saw a bit more of their personalities. Still, having finished the book, I cannot tell you much about something so minor as Venetia's family's physical descriptions, beyond that her sister is 16 years of age and her brother is somewhat younger.With the lack of character development, I felt disconnected to these characters and the story. I could have put the book down at any time and not wondered again what had happened to them.Since reading Amanda Quick's Second Sight, I have discussed my impressions with friends who have also read her work, and they have found the same issues with newer books that I experienced in this one. Based on their opinions of her earlier works, I would like to give one of her older stories a read, as I understand those books did not suffer from the same lack of character development. If the characters are as well-fleshed in the older books as the mystery was in this one, they will be worth giving this author a second chance."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I gave it 4 stars but if available, I would give it 4-1/2 stars. Ms. Krentz never disappoints. I enjoyed this book as I have all of her previous books.

I love that I learn something new about the era she is writing about in every book. I anxiously await the second book in this series."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"It didn't take me long to read this historic romantic suspense novel.

After reading that Gabriel has supposedly been killed, she moves with her family to Victorian London, using the alias of the widowed Mrs. Jones when she sets up her studio. What follows is a fun bit of suspense, a love story, and a tale of psychical powers all rolled into one."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I'm so disappointed. I always look forward to an Amanda Quick book, although the last several haven't been her best.I can't believe this book was written by Jayne Ann Krentz! The characters were flat and had no life in them. There was nothing to show why the hero and heroine loved each other. The villan was boring and unrealized and the storyline uninteresting. I finished the book hoping for improvements but they never appeared.Sadly, I felt nothing for Gabriel and Venetia. Based on the first chapter I thought I was going to like Venetia but it turned out otherwise. Once she went to London she became hard and a bit unfeeling. I couldn't believe her reaction to Gabriel being alive and not dead - it was as though the woman in the first chapter had vanished and been replaced by this unfeeling person. Her attitude was that he should go away and let her focus on her business. She often unknowingly relayed that disinterested feeling to others. Again, a big disappointment."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Why do I feel that I have read this book before?Could it be because the protaganists are the same characters as in ALL the previous titles by this author? Or maybe because we have the pretend wife/widow plot AGAIN? Or even because there is a secret society of an archaelogical nature -as in the VANZA books?The whole thing is just a mish-mash of previously used ideas thrown together under a new title and with new names.For all that, it is readable.

I have been about 75/25 for the Amanda Quick novels as a whole but this one is right up to her form and takes into consideration both the historical time period as well as the paranormal elements.I read \\"White Lies\\" in hard back so I already knew something about the Arcane Society. The story opens with Gabriel and Caleb Jones, cousins, uncovering some amazing artifacts that an ancestor left behind including his own skeleton, books and a strongbox with a journal that has an alleged formula for increasing psychic powers!! The cousins enlist members of the village to help them load things and, of course, one of the villagers is greedy and steals the journal.We flip a few months ahead to where the lovely Miss Venetia Milton, an up and coming photographer, is taking photographs at the Arcane Society mansion of the many ancient books and antiques that they have including the strongbox. She is escorted by Gabriel Jones. Venetia finds herself very attracted to Mr. Jones who is also intrigued by Miss Milton. Venetia is almost 30 and beyond the \\"marriageable age\\" so she is looking for adventure and passion. She doesn't believe in marriage as her father set a poor example (explained later in the story) and thus is hoping that the \\"heat\\" she sees in Mr. Jones' eyes is some reciprocal attraction.Venetia is successful in seducing Gabriel -- or does he seduce her? However, Venetia also has \\"second sight\\" and senses strangers in the woods headed for the mansion. Mr. Jones summons his servants and sends them and Venetia out through a secret tunnel while he chases after the two strangers. Venetia with her handsome commission from the Arcane photographs goes to London with her aunt, sister, brother and housekeeper to setup a photo gallery.The comedy, complexities, mysteries and romance that then ensue are just fascinating. I read this book straight through and thought it was just great fun. There were enough plot turns to keep the reader guessing as to which person wanted the formula and plenty more twists on how all would be resolved.A fun but intriguing read!"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Fabulous as always.

But that's okay because Gabriel Jones has secrets of his own. Venetia is Amanda's standard spunky female lead and Gabriel is her standard alpha male trying to disguise himself as a Beta.One of the aspects that I found so interesting in this book is that she brought some of the characteristics from her Jayne Castle futuristic books into this historical thereby setting up a world view that is continuous across her genres. I would love to see her further pursue this line of thought and more firmly connect characters from her Amanda Quick world to her Jayne Castle world."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Even with the supernatural element, I enjoyed this story. It was quirky and fun, with a hint of mystery and some good characters. It's a traditional romance story, following the prescribed arc, so all of the goodness lies in the little details.

Their ancestor, an alchemist, was a believer in the paranormal and cloaked himself in mystery. Many members of the present day Arcane Society believe he took the formula for a mysterious potion among other treasures with him to his grave. When the cousins hire an upcoming photographer Miss Venetia Milton to photograph the relics in the alchemists lab, someone breaks in and steals a notebook written in code that may hold the secrets to the mysterious formula. Venetia must make a living for her family, but when she meets Gabriel she decides to seduce him knowing it may be the only chance she ever gets to taste passion. Shortly after she and Gabriel make love, intruders break in and Gabriel sends her off to London through a secret passage. Months later after not hearing from Gabriel, Venetia reads in the paper that he perished in a fire on the night she left him. To protect her image she assumes the identity of Gabriel's widow. Weeks later to Venetia's surprise a very much alive Gabriel arrives on her doorstep demanding she play out the role of his wife. It seems he faked his death to weed out those who stole the notebook and now Venetia is in danger from their enemies. What starts is a mysterious adventure to uncover the villians and Gabriel and Venetia's must reveal their own paranormal abilities to solve the mystery.I felt that the first two chapters of this book started out with a rush, promising to be a passionate, thrilling book. What happened is the story went downhill from there. The passion faded, the mysterious formula never really is explained (we're supposed to know what it does?) and some of the characters just didn't make sense. For example, the villan takes on a disguise and it is explained he intended to live out his life with this disguise but that just wasn't logical. (If I say more it would ruin it for the reader) His disguise was of a nature that it could have only been pulled off temporarily and his motivations just didn't ring true. Also, what happened to Caleb? HE's in the story at first but then nothing more is mentioned about him...wouldn't it seem logical that he too is in danger....and Gabriel's paranormal abilities just kind of seem downplayed....I expected a lot after the beginning but it just didn't deliver. Its not a bad book but it just started off so good and then left me hanging that I just couldn't give it more than 3 stars.

Miss Venetia Milton's parents died over a year ago in a train wreck. Since then Venetia has had the responsibility of providing for her maiden aunt, Beatrice Sawyer, her sixteen-year-old sister, Amelia, and her nine-year-old brother, Edward. Having an excellent talent for photography, Venetia had made due. But when the Arcane Society employed her to photograph its collection of relics and artifacts things began looking up. The Arcane Society paid extremely well and in advance. Venetia left Bath, traveled to meet her new employer, Gabriel Jones, and earn her pay.Venetia and Gabriel knew each other less than a week. During the last time together they were intimate. Before they could speak about any possible future together, they were interrupted by two men attempting to steal a two-hundred-year-old strongbox. Gabriel had his coachman take Venetia to safety before going to hunt his prey.Gabriel Jones was a Hunter. The Arcane Society members consisted of secretive, reclusive eccentrics who were obsessed with the arcane and uncanny. Gabriel's psychical abilities made him a predator, a hunter. Once the two would-be thieves were taken care of, Gabriel decided to let people believe he was dead. However, three months later, when he learned Venetia had opened a gallery in London and has been portraying herself as his widow, he knew that she had unwittingly placed herself in grave danger. Gabriel had no choice but to pretend to be Venetia's returned-from-the-dead husband and move in with her family to keep her safe.**** Let me say first off that you should NOT read the first four books of this series in order of release.

Love her storylines, interaction between characters, quick dialoge, I could go on. However I was a bit nervous about this story, as I really liked her Regency novels, but I am not a big fan of the Victorian Era. But she came though again. Her heroine was plucky and quick-witted and brave and very take charge. Her hero was powerful and confident. Venetia Milton was a photographer (unusual profession for a woman in the Victorian era) with a family to take care of. She was the sole breadwinner in her family consisting of herself, her aunt and her younger sister and brother. She had no time to persue relationships so the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get herself ravished was too good to pass up. Her employer (and ravisher) Gabriel Jones had the eyes of a sorcerer. . . however soon after thier tryst, Venetia learns that he has died tragically. As a romantic whimsy to pay tribute to him, she takes on the guise of Mrs. Jones, a young widow and goes to London to pursue her career. However, Mr. Jones is not dead, and the people who wanted him that way, may now be interested in Venetia. The story gets better from there with nosy interferring family members and secrets aplenty. This is the first Arcane Society Novel and I can only hope for more"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I Love this author, I love the themes and I think that her leading ladies are all really strong.I have been reading her books for years and although some of the themes are familiar, the books are always fresh never boring and I can never put them down."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"This book will probably rate fairly high on a romance-novel lover's list.

You would like to remember the \\"good old days\\" but your trip back into nostolgia is a bumpy one because no one took the time to identify the people or to explain the events or to arrange them by topic?The authors have completed the task that we would all like to do. The book is a true labor of love that is also helpful for the historian and anyone that wants to take a trip back in time or down memory lane.The rise and fall of an ethnic neighborhood in the Financial District is carefully and enthusiastically chronicled by the photographs that have been chosen and arranged by topic: the neighborhood life, the stores, the culture, the relgion, community services, the education, and its rise and fall between 1900 and 1970. This is a neighborhood that reflected the best of America -- where people were proud of their particular culture and shared it with their friends and neighbors to create the true melting pot that is New York City.The pictures come alive as each person in it is identified and a brief anecdote is narrated about what is depicted. It is almost as if you have have an opporunity to drop in to have a chat with a dear friend. It is like catching up with someone who you haven't seen for some time as you exchange reminiscences.We often examine the lives of great people. Here we have a chance to learn about the lives of ordinary people who made a difference to New York and the world. Here we learn the stories of people who served their country and died heroes in America's war; the stickball games informally organized by the boys; the women dressed in their Sunday best chatting on the park benches; and other things things great and small that make up the daily life of a neighborhood. After all, this neighborhood is the home of the Heismann trophy!"},{"Title":"Let's Make a Difference: Super fun activities and cool ideas for making the world a better place","review":"Upon reading this Book I realized the impact it could have on our young People.

Please forgive the drama, but without this book, I sincerely believe my marriage would be over now. This book, and Genderspeak, also by Elgin, provide everyone with the tools to take control of an always obnoxious and sometimes dangerous situation that exists in many relationships, verbal abuse. Elgin gives power to both parties involved. The abused learns to handle the angry words coming at them in a calm, effective manner. The abuser learns to look at his/her behavior from his partner's point of view.One of your reviews calls this &quot;blaming the victim.&quot; I disagree!! Elgin provides tools to deal with verbal abuse, in contrast to others (Evans included) who conclude by advising that the relationship terminate, since there is generally no good way to handle the situation. Elgin's approach is empowering to both parties, her message is &quot;You are NOT helpless and you do NOT have to run away from this!&quot;"},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"What a waste! I agree with the other reviewers. This book might be of some (limited) benefit in dealing with verbal jabs from people with whom you have limited contact or limited emotional investment. But, her assertion that these techniques will defuse all but the most egregious verbal abusers is so absurd that it makes me wonder if she's ever been in the same room with one. Don't waste your time or money. A MUCH BETTER option would be Patricia Evans' &quot;The Verbally Abusive Relationship.&quot; Evans addresses the problem, from why it happens to how to recognize it to what you can and can not do about it. Elgin tries to create a Pollyanna world where the abuser will respond logically and like a &quot;sane&quot; human being. If that were the case, you wouldn't be considering this book in the first place."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"I found Elgin's techniques to be extremely helpful when I was struggling with remaining in an abusive situation. They helped me recognize, analyze, and divert the verbal abuse. Although it did not cure the abuser of the need to abuse, it did change the abuse to more open and easily recognized forms, that made the final solution more obvious. These techniques have been extremely useful in other instances of verbal abuse from healthy individuals, and have changed the mode of communication of those individuals towards me for the better. She gave me the power to control my language environment, and to remove myself from toxic language."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"I think these ideas might work with people you have limited contact with.The scenario about the husband blowing up about the dinner was just terrible and I really couldn't see how this guy really loves his wife. He just expects her to be obedient like some dog.Elgin says if you just respond the right way you can stop the verbal abuse. This just isn't true. Most verbal abusers are just looking to find fault about anything.The problem lies with the abuser and not the victim. The abuser needs to learn how to stop treating people that way.Most victims of abuse spend years twisting and contorting themselves to try to fix what they are doing wrong so the abuse will stop.Notice the in the scenarios the abuse never stopped. Just until next time when the husband felt like blowing up about something again."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"I was deeply disappointed in this book. I am desperate to find some effective strategies for dealing with a verbally and emotionally abusive parent. The author makes one good point: that what abusers want is to get attention and a \\"rise\\" out of you. But her strategies for avoiding this are *only* useful for very *mild* cases. I laughed out loud at some of the techniques she thinks would work. She clearly does not know my abuser. She herself does note this, by saying that some people have an underlying problem that has to be solved before the abuse will stop. But what to do in that case? Her only answer is that you may have to leave, and of course one can't \\"leave\\" a parent. She completely ignores that the verbal abuser is usually blackmailing you in a very effective way until you give in to them. Ultimately, the book is misnamed. This is not about verbal *abuse,* but simply about becoming more effective communicators with normal people."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"In this book, Dr. Elgin gives practical ways to handle verbal attacks and discourage future abuse. In today's world, those suffering verbal abuse are often accused of being to blame for their situation. This leaves them feeling even more helpless and guilty. In reality such situations often arise for reasons having little to do with the 'guilt' of the person receiving the abuse. Recognizing this, the author teaches some of the specific forms verbal abuse takes and the most effective response to that form. By teaching effective ways to handle specific language interactions, Dr. Elgin gives receivers of abuse the power to break the cycle without futher endangering themselves. Though appearing simple on the surface, these techniques have been proven to work in real relationships. I have found this book and others in the Gentle Art of Verbal Self Defense series to be of much help in both my own relationships and the relationships of those with whom I shared the information."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"This book could have provided the useful material in about one-fourth of the length, which is why I rated it down. What I got out of it that is helpful to me includes the following. Never feed the verbal violence loop - use neutral intonation and impersonal language (the 2 main keys to her theory). Also that we need to realize that, \\"Letting verbal abusers' insults and smart cracks and hurtful remarks go by isn't letting them get away with it. Allowing them to succeed in their goal of tying up your attention and getting an emotional reaction from you is letting them get away with it.\\" I also found helpful some specific \\"language stategies\\" to use for getting up and leaving when the conversation is hostile and apparently going nowhere."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"Found this book to be full of constructive, tangible ways to change the way I communicate.

Immediately able to put it to work."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"As the (soon to be ex) partner of a verbally abusive man, I can say with certainty that if you are in an intimate relationship with a confirmed verbal abuser, this approach will not only ensure that the abuse continues, but that you will feel responsible for it. The first section on &quot;Miller's Law&quot; is a blueprint for continuing the dynamic of verbal abuse, because it asks the partner to try to understand what she must have done to deserve the abuse. There is never an excuse for abuse, and it isn't the recipients fault, no matter what."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"This book explains that people who are targets of verbal abuse aren't helpless, and provides them with strategies for verbal self-defense. The approach is not &quot;blaming&quot; the targeted individuals -- it's empowering them. Elgin has never suggested, either in print or aloud, that verbal abuse victims are responsible for the hostile language environments that make their lives miserable, but she has told them how to take control and cure their environments. This book teaches that at a level written to those who need it most."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"This book was awesome . I read it in a few days. It is well written and very practical. It has helped me immensely in stopping big arguements with my family. But I review and practice the principles. If someone says it does not work, they are not willing to make the effort to learn and practice the principles. Some people prefer to just say it is impossible and like books that attack their abuser so they can have a pity party for themselves."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"I ordered this book because it interested me when it was listed in the \\"people who order this book also recommend. . .\\" category when I bought another book on verbal abuse \\"Your Perfect Right\\". I read and use books often as a means of learning new information and skills and found \\"You Can't Say That to Me\\" to provide good information and an accessible means of using this information instantly in situations involving verbal abuse. Other reviewers have criticized the author's view of verbal abusers as just another means of communicating (rather than as \\"the bad guys\\") and have disliked the obvious stories used to illustrate her information points. I can see where such criticisms arise, but the author is very clear about categorizing abusers using \\"styles of speech\\" from a linguistic perspective and including the category of people who are verbally abusive because they are \\"psychologically disturbed\\". This helped me identify times when I think I'm am being slammed, but it is more a matter of communication styles and the interactions of our different styles, and times when I am dealing with someone who habitually uses verbal abuse as a means of domination, or building up themselves by putting down others. I think this book is extremely useful for people who are not tortured by chronic verbal abuse situations and an inability to defend themselves, but have times when they feel put down harshly but are not certain of the intent, nor how to respond without being self-defensive or abusive themselves. Her approach using knowledge of linguistics was not at all academically dense (as is \\"Your Perfect Right\\") and I found myself able to use the methods of analysis and response in real life as I was reading the book. Yes, many of her story examples are fairly simplistic, but this is not to over-simplify real life events, but to provide clarity about the information she is providing. It really is comforting to be able to think to myself \\"Yes, this person has their own problem and enjoys/benefits from abusing, demeaning, me - or - well, I can see how it came about that I felt put-down in the communication with this person because we were using conflicted styles of expression that fed on each other.\\"Also, when I read the list of other books by this author, I found that she also has written one of my favorite scifi/fantasy genre novel series \\"Native Tongue\\". This gave me a greater understanding of the author and how she views people and their linguistic styles. Although, the information in this book is easily understood and used by someone who doesn't really understand what linguistics is all about.I would have put a fifth star on my review if the book also had provided more information on dealing with people who use language to purposefully demean and diminish me as a means of raising their own value. But, this is a big subject with many different aspects than the type of verbal abuse dealt with in this particular book. So, I will check out other books by Elgin to see if one is more focused on how to deal with abuse from people who really are trying to hurt me, and succeeding."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"Elgin's book brought tears to my eyes as I recognized myself in the examples provided in her book. What I liked best about this book is that I began to see that my relationship with my former husband was not my only instance of horrific verbal abuse. It forced me to admit to myself that all of my intimate relationships with men have been verbally abusive; and I came to recognize that verbal violence was a part of my regular communication with my siblings and my mother. What could this mean? I began to see that I was in fact the common denominator. This is not to say that I deserve verbal abuse or that it is my fault. The only coping skills I knew were to fall into my verbal abusers traps by pleading and debating. Not to mention the emotional aftermath of feeling like a worthless human being. Elgin provided me with an excellent selection of new verbal strategies. While it would be great if these verbal skills have an effect on the abusers in my life the real victory is that I will now have more control over how I react to the verbal abuse. I will now no longer be reduced to a mewling child begging for forgiveness for the rainy weather that somehow was my fault. What I struggled with was Elgin's implication that these systems are infallible. I think that presentation is dangerously flawed. Part of my abuse cycle is that my abusers had me convinced that my love was the most important thing in their world. I would therefore forgive them, believe them and accept their abuse because I felt responsible for loving them. \\"He loves me,\\" I would think, \\"underneath it all he is a good person and he needs me.\\" Therefore I endured these relationships and repeated my abuse cycle. Elgin unfortunately gave strength to that misconception. As I stated, I cried from this book because my first thoughts were ones of guilt: \\"If only I had this book sooner; I could have saved my marriage!\\" But I do know that even Elgin could not have helped me there. The truth is you cannot change another person with your own actions. You only have control of your own self. An abuser must ultimately accept responsibility for the pain that they cause. I do understand that the abuser inflicts pain to mask their own, but I know very few abusers who are willing to face their demons and change. I am excited to try her techniques in my life and begin empowering myself. However, abuse of any kind I will not tolerate anymore. In my situation, divorce was my only option. Sometimes the only way to end the abuse is to say goodbye. I wish Elgin had addressed that issue."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"I picked up this book one day hoping to find hope that I wasn't the crazy one in my past abusive relationship. Through constant self-afflicting blame for my abuse I thought Elgin's work would shed some light upon my despair. Although the title in itself was profound and sold me to begin with I found it to be very disappointing. I felt even more worse than before closing yet another book aimed toward my self-blame I just couldn't handle anylonger. I haven't picked it up since and have actually disregarded Elgin's great accomplishment since her last work.Apparently she has never been in an abusive situation with a man or woman with whom there are no ways to manipulate any possible scenario headed towards verbal abuse. No matter how excellent or advanced one's communication skills are developed, there is no logical way around the abuser's chosen victim. Yes, as humans we all hold the potential to become abusive in our ways, but there is certainly a difference between a person who is rational and one who simply is not. Amongst abusers the more you try to rationalize with them the closer you are to escalating the abuse at hand. So, the true matter at hand in abusive situations is control. But isn't that what these tactics are, in which Elgin proposses? To actually take control of a scenario before it reaches abuse? I feel it only teaches victims how to manipulate, control and learn to turn the tables in adopting abusive actions themselves. We need peace of mind for our children and our emotional wellbeing, not more violence........."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"I didn't find any of Elgin's suggestions helpful. As a victim of verbal abuse, I can't believe she expects people to respond to abuse in such a way, and her idea that a few well-chosen words will stop an abuser is ludicrous. She also leaves out one important thing: even if this were to work, her methods don't include confronting your abuser or making him/her own up to being an abuser. Not exactly empowering! I found this book to be a complete waste of my money."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"The author makes some very good points about it taking two people to participate in a negative verbal exchange. She wants the victim of verbal abuse to not feel completely helpless, that said, she doesn't claim that this will fix an abusive relationship but focuses on the linguistics of the exchange. The techniques she shares to neutralize the conversation as opposed to \\"feeding the abusive verbal loop\\" are very helpful. I wish there were less repetition of certain philosophies and more and varied examples of each technique. I felt the organization of the concepts was a bit scattered... i.e. a \\"note\\" about the effect on children caught as observers at the end of a completely unrelated chapter when in an earlier chapter she seemed to suggest that she would touch on this topic in greater detail later. It may just be my learning style, but I found this book harder to read because of the way the topics and unrelated subtopics were arranged. I found myself skipping around a lot in the book to make sense of it. Overall some great ideas to try. By the way, not one of the techniques involves stating plainly to the abuser that, \\"you can't say that to me!\\""},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"This book has some good examples of how to communicate better with others, and strategies for defusing potential conflict before it escalates.Miler's Law is a good reminder to actually lisen to what is being said, rather than adding your own perceptions to the speaker's words. The three-part message is a well-known and effective tool for communicating a request and the book provides a variation on that.The techniques in this book would be helpful with someone who is 'normal' and having trouble communicating and expressing themselves, however this won't work with people that are abusive because abuse is not about communication, it instead is about power and control over another and someone trying to get their way.Sadly, in the couple Suzette uses as her example, they don't have a communication issue, the husband is a bully and is constantly berating his wife and I think it is important to differentiate this. No quick retort or defusing response is going to stop him bullying her or take responsibility for his actions and change his behaviour."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"I have to admit, I haven't even finished the book yet. That's because it became clear to me right away that Elgin isn't writing about \\"verbal abuse\\", she's writing about how to deal with rude comments from other people. That's kind of like offering an aerobic kick-boxing class to a woman whose husband beats her and telling her that should solve her marital problems.True abusers will not respond to Elgin's techniques the way she suggests they will. That should be your first clue that you're in an abusive relationship - this stuff doesn't work. Yes, Elgin's suggestions will have some positive effects (and is worth reading for those), but the abuse will not stop. In fact, it could even get worse as you begin to feel more empowered and the abuser senses he is losing control over you.If you suspect you are in a verbally abusive relationship, GET HELP. See a therapist and read Evans' \\"The Verbally Abusive Relationship\\" or something else about REAL verbal abuse. You can find your way out, it's just not in this book.Good luck."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"There are some abusive people in this world who are simply self-absorbed. The example given in the excerpt was so infuriating, I don't think I could buy the book. How about, &quot;Make your own blessed dinner, honey. What are you making us tonight? I work hard all day, too.&quot;Sorry, couldn't resist."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"I just wanted to echo the words of the reader from Minneapolis who pointed out that the concept promoted here, that anyone can be successful with this method, is wrong, is dead right! In other words, great book, and well worth trying very hard at. But - be aware as you read this that there are people with something called Narcissistic Personality Disorder who cannot change because they are unable to experience empathy. And empathy is fundamental to &quot;real&quot; human relationships, fundamental to having someone understand how something feels to you. I suffered for too many years trying to make this approach work. It did me a lot of good, I admit, but it didn't change my abuser's behavior. He stopped doing certain things and started doing others. And I felt so terribly guilty about that, when in fact he really was whacked out and incapable of change. Thank goodness I finally found a therapist who specializes in abuse to help me figure this out. So please - read this book and try it. It can do you a world of good. But also be aware of the limitations of being able to change someone else. The only real goal should be changing yourself, which is great. And if they don't change then, it's time to leave, because nobody but nobody can or should put up with continuing abuse."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"Elgin states in the beginning of this book that this is the work that her whole &quot;Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense&quot; series has been building up to. I would agree, in that this is a solid guide for those suffering from verbal abuse.There's nothing in this book that will make you jump up and shout &quot;Eureka! That's the solution!&quot; But the truth is that there probably is no such solution.What you WILL get from the book is a practical framework that you can build on to improve the situation. And, almost as important, to help you avoid the trial-and-error of trying out ways that don't really help in the long run.I might have given this book 4 stars, but one other thing makes me push it up to 5: the attitude the book encourages toward the verbal abuser. Other books for victims of verbal abuse engender a lot of negative feelings, sometimes to the point of hate-mongering. This book, however, helps you manage the situation without encouraging ill-will."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"From reading the reviews, some of the reviewers haven't read the book, it is obvious. Many of the complaints actually agree with the perspective of the book.For example someone complains that the book is about &quot;mastery of slick responses to throw the attacker off guard.&quot; That is not what the book is about. None of the responses are slick, none of the responses have to do with throwing anyone off guard. None of them are about fighting, instead they are all about relationships.Or the complaint that Elgin simplifies it all to &quot;the pain is all in your head&quot; -- Elgin is one of the few people who really believes that verbal abuse can kill you and it is terrible to have to endure. She never simplifies it to &quot;it is all in your head, you can just learn to ignore it&quot; -- in fact she teaches the exact opposit.I think that many of the reviewers are just reacting against books in this genre -- the same reason that Elgin wrote the one great book of its kind for normal people trying to deal with these problems while in the midst of them (her other books deal with related issues, but this one book is for the non-professional in real life home situations).What she does is go over how you can deal with abuse from people who are not mentally ill and with whom you deal in day to day and family relationships -- all recognizing that verbal abuse is a feedback loop, something many people do not know. The books teach how you can dampen the feedback loop instead of intensifing it, and by dampening it, control and remove it from relationships.My mother found this book invaluable for dealing with some people who had her at her wits end.Consider that when there is abuse in a situation not controlled by mental illness you can do one of two things: you can intensify the situation or you can defuse it. Elgin, in an eight step program of solid steps and approaches, goes over how to train yourself to recognize and defuse verbal violence without blaming yourself and without minimizing the harm that verbal abuse causes people.The techniques work. Over forty years of implementation and practice demonstrate that they work. In my practice I've given about fifty or more copies of her books for that very reason. The thing that marks this book from all of her others is that it is a program for teaching normal human beings how to use the techniques and how to escape the prison of abusive verbal loops that can destroy otherwise valuable relationships.If there is hope, then this is the book."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"When you read this book carefully, you learn that what this book is really about is how to understand why your communication may be going very wrong - despite your best intentions.If you are being hurt by what you feel are words spoken thoughtlessly, this book is for you. If you want to walk out the door of your home in the morning knowing you have more energy to face the world because you did not have to waste your strength is a fruitless family squabble, this book is for you. If you've always wanted to express yourself and your ideas more clearly and have them be received in the way you intend them, this book is definitely for you.Because what is book is really about is learning precise, yet loving-kind language. This book is about communicating very well without hurting anybody.On page 13, the author of this book, Dr. Suzette Haden Elgin, Ph.D. in Linguistics, shares a remarkable insight. She writes: &quot;Chronic communication breakdown happens when we don't realize the source of a problem is language and we take it for granted that the problem is caused by a _person_.&quot;If language precedes violence (and research shows that it does), it makes such good sense to be able to learn and speak the language and never have to worry about the violence. As a parent, journalist, and teacher for over 30 years, I needed this book. It helped me immensely at home and in my work. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"I was caught in the verbal abuse cycle with my husband and had no way to get out. I blamed him and was miserable. This book brought me to a new level of accoutability and gave me hope for my relationship. I just kept thinking, wow! if I can just follow these 8 steps, I can totally transform our relationship, and it is true! The most uplifting, empowering book on abuse I have ever read. This is a must have book for any relationship!"},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"Elgin's Gentle Art system of Verbal Self-Defense empowers people so they no longer are easy targets of verbal abusers. The verbal abuse is met with systematic resposes based on how language works. This deflects and deescalates the verbal abuse. The abusive person is held accountable when the responses needed to keep the victim role going are not forthcoming. This puts them on notice immediately that things have changed. Verbally abusive people are insecure people who have learned to get temporary relief from their insecure thinking by verbally abusing others. Elgin's system disarms the presupposed claims of the abusive person including &quot;You are a victim, and I will get you to take the bait.&quot;Elgin's Eight Step program is effective. One of the things that naturally occurs as a person understands Elgin's system is that they become calmer, more grounded, and more confident. You use Elgin's system calmly without getting angry at the verbal abuser. You feel better about yourself because you are using your own inner resources (your language) to protect yourself and others."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"While Elgin provides some useful synopses, there are troublesome problems with her approach. The book is useful in identifying characteristics of verbal abuse, and for that it is well worth reading. Verbal and emotional abuse are very difficult to see, especially when one is inside the relationship, and getting clarity about the characteristics is important. What I find troubling is Elgin's tendency to simplify the dynamic, suggesting that the abuse will be stopped if only the recipient of the abuse responds in the right way. That is exactly what his/her abuser has been saying all along! This easily becomes a form of &quot;blame the victim&quot; which most victims of abuse struggle with anyway. They are told they are at fault by their abuser, and now here's another book telling them that if they just communicated in the right way, they wouldn't be abused. They don't need yet another voice telling them they could fix things if they were only good enough. Patricia Evans' book, The Verbally Abusive Relationship, provides more insight into the dynamic in a more helpful way that does not blame the victim. To quote Evans, &quot;The problem is the problem, and the problem is abuse.&quot;"},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"I agree with the reviewer who says that Elgin oversimplifies. It just isn't that easy. The \\"Jerry\\" in her examples seems positively malicious to me, no matter how much Elgin insists that he really loves his wife. With love like that, I'd hate to see loathing! The answer to systematic verbal abuse of this kind--constant erosion of another person's self-esteem by belittling and criticizing, and not only in private but in front of others--is intensive counseling, not mastery of slick responses to throw the attacker off guard. I have a hard time imagining Jerry, as Elgin portrays him, falling for any of these devices and backing off. And I know that men like Jerry exist, because I am presently in the process of divorcing one. If they are determined to hurt you, and to blame you for their failures, they will find a way.On the other hand, the book is excellent when it comes to helping you communicate more effectively with people with whom you aren't intimate and have less emotional capital invested. You may catch yourself falling into the kind of verbal cadences, sarcasm, brown-nosing, and so on, that Elgin describes. I found good info on how to reprimand my children too, without blowing up and verbally beating them into the ground..."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"This writer seems to assume that all verbal abuse stems from miscommunication and that with work from both sides it can be stemmed and that the pain the abusers inflict is only what we perceive it to be. Hogwash. She doesn't seem to take into account that some people are totally mentally incapable of being rational in the heat of their anger. Is it not possible that pain is exactly what the abusers want to inflict? While it does give some valuable ideas of how to deal with &quot;difficult&quot; people and situations and lighterweight marital difficulties, it does not give very realistic advice for a deeply abusive marital relationship. In my own experience, I'd love to know what response Ms. Elgin would have given to my husband who on the day after I had come home from the hospital after giving birth 2 days earlier, walked into the kitchen after work and saw me holding our newborn son while I was cooking dinner at the stove and our 18 month old daughter playing on the floor and remarked &quot;I figured dinner wouldn't be ready&quot; and then proceded into a temper tantrum because his immediate needs were not met. Was my response supposed to be: Honey, I know you've had a hard day at work and you've felt the stress of adding another child to our family too - but things just can't quite be the same for a little while because I need to get used to caring for 2 children now, a newborn baby and an 18 month old child at the same time, - so that is why I'm late with dinner tonight and it was not on the table the minute you stepped into the kitchen. Does Ms. Elgin really believe that a man who is so insensitive to his wife's needs (perhaps she was tired after giving birth 3 days ago and had emotional needs as well) could possibly interact with his wife in a sane and emotionally mature way? In all actuality - I did say something akin to the &quot;perfect&quot; response above, but it didn't make a bit of difference. His intent was to make me feel pain and to put his feeling of stress and pain upon me. It would be wonderful advice if all verbal abusers were rational people - but they are not. I only wish it were so easy."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"I highly recommend this book as an introduction to dealing with verbal abuse. I've found it helpful in two ways 1) I've become more aware of the hidden verbal attacks in common English phrases and have stopped using them myself. This has resulted in my having better relationships with people. 2) I've learned some win/win methods of responding to verbal abuse. This frequently stops the abuse while maintaining good relations with the abuser.I found the techniques especially helpful when I was teaching a high school class. A student would verbally attack me or another student. I would respond with a verbal self-defense technique from the book. The student couldn't believe the attack didn't work (I wasn't enticed into a fight.) and would try the same attack again. After the second attempt, the student realized the attack wasn't going to work and stopped.(Note: Verbal self-defense is for dealing with sane people. An insane person, a sadist or criminal who enjoys harming people, should be referred to a professional.)"},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"I've learned a lot from this book.

That might work with small children, but it doesn't work with abusive spouses. The author's prescription reflects a breathtaking lack of appreciation for what the victims of verbal abuse are subjected to, day in and day out, often for many hours at a time and with no meaningful way to escape, and is quite reminiscent of 'just say no' as a cure for drug addiction. I think that a good deal of the problem comes from the lack of a clear distinction between abuse and occasional crankiness. The author's word games may offer a polite way of deflecting the latter, but as to the former they are a surefire prescription for continuing to be abused. I don't know what the solution is, but you won't find it in this book."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"Many are raised with one parent, or both, who is verbally abusive.

One who \\"hates the male sex,\\" as Patricia Evans and a good portion of her followers irrefutably convey the impression of doing! You could do yourself a tremendous favor by ignoring the reviews about how superior Evans' book is to Elgin's book - as Evans' book is primarily catered to those who have a loathing for the male species, and/or a relentless compulsion to blame any and all of their problems on the \\"big, bad men\\" of the world.Quite the opposite of what some reviewers would lead you to believe: \\"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse\\" offers much more effective responses to putting an end to verbal abuse than the notoriously simplistic \\"STOP IT!\\" and \\"CUT THAT OUT!\\" replies Evans advocates. Which, ironically enough, in many instances only serve to inflame the abuse. How many times have you been witness to grade school bullies ceasing their behavior by the target merely yelling, \\"DON'T DO THAT!\\" and \\"YOU'RE AN ABUSER!\\"Instead, Elgin teaches you how to PRODUCTIVELY communicate with someone who is verbally abusing you, as the more enhanced your communication skills the less your potential of being abused. In fact, by utilizing her wonderful techniques you will find you can greatly diminish or even eradicate the abuse from anyone in your life - family, friends, coworkers, et al - not just the domestic partner.Additionally, Elgin's work (unlike that of Evans) also refrains from depicting all abusers as malevolent \\"dragons\\" who cannot be reasoned with no matter what, because not ALL abusers are alike! And, in enough unions, there are TWO human beings behaving abusively toward each other, so immediately labeling one party the hopeless abuser can do a disservice to both.Otherwise, yes, there are some individuals where no matter what you say or do they will continue to be abusive (i.e., chronic abusers who need therapy but either refuse to get it or refuse to stick with it, those who have mental illness and behavioral disorders, and so on), but in such a scenario all Evans' book will do is encourage you to be angry, hateful, and blaming toward that person - not truly empowered and liberated like Elgin does!"},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"If you've ever been the victim of verbal abuse, you'll find this book very helpful.

I read the reviews for Patricia Evans' books and right or wrong it seemed there was at times a lot of anger projected, however understandably. Apparently her books helped some folks very much and that is good. But my favorite Source of advice says: \\"Do not exchange insult for insult or [what it seems to me was in some of the reviews] rancor for rancor.\\" \\"Do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good.\\" \\"Treat all persons [this means even abusers - though one can respectfully leave them if necessary!] with respect.\\" This means we know we are entitled to be treated with respect too! \\"A gentle answer turns away wrath.\\" \\"In all things, love.\\" If it's not obvious, those quotes are from Scriptures. My humble opinion, if the advice in Elgin's book, and prayer, don't work for a particular person, then okay leave him or her before they hurt you more. This would be even more essential if children are involved, because they should not witness, and possibly learn, or experience the abusive treatment themselves. However, if the lost cause abusers are in your family or work place and you can't get away, distance yourself from them emotionally and physically as much as possible. \\"Do not make friends with an angry person lest you become ensnared in his ways.\\" \\"Anger resides in the lap of fools.\\" \\"He who controls his temper is mightier than one who conquers a city.\\""},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse -- An 8-Step Program","review":"If you want to read a book about verbal abuse that is empowering and teaches linguistic techniques and behaviors to blunt and reduce verbal abuse aimed at you, read this book, and any of the other Elgin books.If you want a book that absolves you of any responsibility, and more importantly, strips any feelings of power you have, then read the books by Patricia Evans.

It's been a while since I read it, but am thinking of reading it again...such a beautiful, if not sad look back on a long and rich life centered in a dry and dusty old Mexico."},{"Title":"The Tiger in the Grass: Stories and Other Inventions","review":"Superlatives aren't powerful enough to describe this book by Harriet Doerr. I read Stones for Ibarra, liked it a lot, so rented The Tiger in the Grass from the library as an audio-book to listen to during a long car trip. Halfway thru, I was exclaiming out loud (all by myself in the car), \`OMG, this is soooo good!' I liked it light years more than the Ibarra book, even. As soon as I got home, I bought a used copy on Amazon for 50 cents plus the usual postage, etc.The first section of this lyrical, oh-so-beautifully written book is a loose memoir, a collection of impassioned memories that she wrote down for her children. She was already old when she published Ibarra, and I believe she was in late 70s or maybe her 80s when she wrote this one.The rest of the book is composed of short pieces that are ethereal essays or somewhat longer semi-autobiographical short stories, vignettes of people she knew while living in Mexico - but all of them rise so far above the usual stuff we read that it's difficult to describe how powerful they all are, once gathered together. It's like, the individual parts are terrific, but put together, the whole is 100x greater than the sum of its part.There's one story, I think it's called Low Tide, and it's a lovely memory of a day at the beach in 1939. The author is an adult with young children, but there's a hint of evil somewhere lurking - then we realize it's the rise of Nazism when the hamburger seller comments about bad times coming and \`that German paperhanger.' At the end of the story, Doerr comments that she wanted time to stand still long enough for her to paint and frame Low Tide, a metaphor for peace and innocence. Lord, I get goosebumps all over again, just trying to paraphrase it for this review.Buy it. Read it. Give it as a gift. Then read it again yourself, and again.Wow."},{"Title":"The Tiger in the Grass: Stories and Other Inventions","review":"I have enjoyed all of Harriet Doerr's books.

This collection of short stories feels like a lot of snippets that she didn't know where to fit into her novels."},{"Title":"Typical American: A Novel","review":"It's only after reading this fascinating book that one fully appreciates the irony intrinsic to the title. This is a book that is thoroughly atypical in virtually all its aspects.Typical American follows the lives of three Chinese immigrants in New York: Ralph Chang, his sister Theresa, and Theresa's roommate Helen, who becomes Ralph's wife. Theresa becomes a doctor, Ralph earns a Ph. D. in mechanical engineering and gets a job teaching at a local college, and Ralph and Helen have two daughters.As they each become caught up in achieving the American dream, they must make difficult choices about the importance of success, family loyalty, and the people they hope to become.Essentially, however, like all immigrant tales, the underlying aspect of the story is one of assimilation. Usually tales of Chinese assimilation into the American mainstream demand the forsaking of Chinese customs; conversely, preservation of Chinese traditions requires the rejection of any possibilities of assimilation. The dramatization of such cultural conflicts has become somewhat formulaic, and Chinese-American writers seem locked in this conventional depiction of the Chinese immigrant experience.Not Gish Jen. In Typical American Gish Jen rewrites the formula that has long dominated Chinese-American immigrant fiction, and complicates firm notions of Chinese and American identities that have been staple elements of that formula.Normally these assimilation tales are multi-generational sagas where the conventional opposition between American and Chinese cultures is usually played out through generational conflicts, in which the older, immigrant generation's insistent preservation of Chinese traditions are pitted against their first -generation offspring's desire to cast off those manacles.Not here. Eschewing this \\"typical\\"' setting for her narrative, Jen breaks from the paradigmatic use of Chinatown that has been a staple of Chinese immigrant narratives. This also removes the Changs from the clutches of parental demands or strict Chinatown societal codes. Rather than settling in an established Chinese community for moral and financial support Ralph, Helen and Theresa remain very isolated in their new life in America. This isolation from the \\"parental' or \\"traditional\\" elements of Chinese culture enables Jen to illustrate the conflicts inherent to cultural assimilation within the context of the individual rather than a group. And, so, while the characters strive mightily to achieve \\"typical American\\" status-the full middle class lifestyle with all the accouterments and benefits that implies-they nevertheless still see many of the traits and behaviors attendant to that lifestyle through Chinese eyes and refer to these behavioral traits in Anglos pejoratively as \\"typical American\\" Behavior. Thus they are in the position of decrying what they actively seek to attain, thus brilliantly illustrating the often schizoid process of assimilation.The first line of the book asserts that this is \\"an American story\\", but in fact this is neither a \\"typical Chinese-immigrant\\" story, nor a \\"\\"typical American\\" one. In the end, no one is \\"typical\\" anything. Ralph's revelation at the end is not the disillusionment of a Chinese nor an American, but simply a man confused by the complexity of the new context that surround him: \\"Kan bu fian. Ting bu fian. He could not always see, could not always hear. He was not what he made up his mind to be.Both Ralph's and Helen's revelations at the end of the book 'are critical moments in which Jen invalidates the generational/ cultural conflict paradigm; she has deftly shown that the notion that the choice that one \\"stay Chinese\\" or \\"become American\\" is an illusion. In fact, the \\"typical\\" immigrant will never be either.This is a wry, ironic, emotionally complex novel that is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Typical American: A Novel","review":"Gish Jen is gifted, no doubt about it. A fantastic line writer, just about every sentence shines. She's funny as hell, too, when she wants to be. Mixing up the humor and the pathos, she can generate some serious amount of emotion from the reader.The characters are very real and the dialogue between them is witty and smart. Jen effortlessly moves between the main characters' (Ralph, Helen, and Theresa) points of views in a close third-person voice, and as an immigrant myself, I found myself relating closely to many of the twists and turns in the plot...though that's not to say that the ideas in this book are immigrant-specific. Not at all, in fact -- the stuff that makes up this novel are broad and universal.But (isn't there always a but?), there's something missing from these pages, and it took me a while to figure it out. What is it? Risk. I don't think Jen takes many risks...or if she does, they don't seem risky enough. It's a solid book, a first novel that any writer would be proud of -- but for me, it didn't have that element of risk (or maybe \\"menace\\" that Raymond Carver often referred to) that really makes (or breaks if done badly) a book.It's definitely worth reading, though, just on writing alone if nothing else (and there's plenty, so read it!)."},{"Title":"Typical American: A Novel","review":"Ralph, Helen, and Theresa immigrated from China to escape political instability in the post-War era. The trio of young ambitious Chinese immigrants slowly transformed into everything they once despised in the typical American as they set out after their dreams and created their own suburban paradise. Ralph, like many of his counterparts, struggled with his visa but mangaged to finished his PhD in mechanical engineering and obtained a university tenure. Together with his wife Helen (introduced to him by his sister Theresa), the young couple set out to make the so-called \\"American dream\\" come way in all possible ways: finding a split-level home in the suburbs of Connecticut, making huge bucks in fast food (America is such a fast food nation), walking dog and sending dog to training school, making excursions into adultery. Theresa studied to become a doctor who later on engaged in an affair with a man. Ironically, as the ambitious trio fulfilled their \\"American dream\\" (ahhhammm) they have become someone whom they despised in the first place-typical American: the typical American no-good, typical American don't-know-how-to-get-along, typical American just-want-to-be-the-center-of-things, typical American no-morals, typical American use-brute-force, typical American just-dumb, typical American no-manners, and typical American eating-junk-and-not-healthy. The trio began to adopt to more American vocabular but still retained their Chinese ways of thinking like \\"xiang ban fa\\"-think of a way. In a way, the American dream has corrupted the trio. Ralph became so money-oriented that he believed he can only fit in the society if he made good money. If he couldn't make a lot of money, he would be dubbed Chinamen. \\"Money, in this country, you have money, you can do anything. You have no money, you are nobody. You are Chinaman! Is that simple!\\" Even Helen, she allowed himself to engage in sexual quickie in her own house behind her husband's back with Grover Ding, who represented a typical American-born-Chinese that was not rooted in any traditional Chinese values. Afterall, the American dream will never be the same again. Gish Jen's writing has astutely portraited a typical immigrant experience through her witty style and choice of waords. As a Chinese-American, I can deeply relate to the Chang's experience-the desire to fit in but at the same time the quest for prosperity, success, and respect. The novel might seem funny but who can really understand immigrants' life struggles if not being one?"},{"Title":"Typical American: A Novel","review":"The immigrant experience in America is well-trodden ground and unfortuntely Gish Jen's Typical American doesn't really add much to this well-established body of literature. Her writing style is good, the story she tells is moderately compelling (if frequently unrealistic) and on, and on, and on. There's nothing wrong with Typical American, but that's hardly a good reason to pick it up and read it. If you're interested in the American immigrant experience, I recommend Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides or Call it Sleep by Henry Roth. If Chinese family life is your interest, Wild Swans by Jung Chang or Life and Death in Shanghai by Nien Chang are far more worthy of your investment of time."},{"Title":"Typical American: A Novel","review":"I saw Gish Jen read and bought Typical American so I could get her signature and say I had a signed copy. So everyone would envy me. I didn't know when I would get around to reading it.But then I started reading it, and it's become an entirely charming, engrossing, compelling page-turner. I have plenty of other things to do, miles to go before I sleep, but I can't quit reading about these people--Ralph, his sister Theresa, and his wife, Helen. What engaging people. And Gish Jen--she's funny, great sense of style to her prose; she's wry and moving both. Gish Jen--please, turn me loose. But no, don't. This is the kind of book that's so enjoyable I don't want it to end. Apart from the pure pleasure of reading, moreover, there's a serious purpose to this book: Gish Jen is doing something important for us, in a vein similar to Maxine Hong Kingston. Jen is redefining what a \\"typical American\\" is. At a number of points, the gradually more Americanized Chinese immigrants at the center of the story scoff at \\"typical Americans\\" for their wastefulness, for their laziness, for many qualities that people from other countries have begun to associate stereotypically (perhaps with some justice) with Americans--satisfied, not wanting to put out too much energy, complacent, arrogant. But in the meantime, Ralph, Theresa, and Helen are themselves becoming \\"typical Americans.\\" Not in the sense they criticize, but in several new senses. On the one hand, they integrate themselves into the revelation of the American dream--the house outside the city, the green lawn, the rewards for hard work, planning, and desiring. On the other hand, they are becoming the \\"typical Americans\\" in the sense that they represent the new Americans who are changing the character of America: from its Euro/Judeo/Christian origins (the people who set aside the Native American tradition) to its new roots in both native peoples (not an issue in this book) and in the new immigrants, who come, struggle in their new environment, have disappointments and successes, individual and cultural quirks, experience resentment and hostility from those who have become settled and consider themselves the rightful \\"owners\\" of the land (I'm thinking of an incident where Ralph takes his family to a ball game and is jeeringly advised to go back to his laundry--he's actually a mechanical engineer with a PhD). These are the new typical American: they arrive from exotic lands speaking a language that has no European connection, and put a new face on the country; but by the same token, they are typical in the old sense, the same sense as the Irish, Germans, Jews, Eastern Europeans, etcetcetc: they come from foreign lands to the place of nearly unlimited opportunity, work hard to establish themselves, and finally begin to reap the fruits of their monumental labors. Thus the title has multiple resonances, both ironic (its references to the complacent entrenched) and, I would almost say, reverent in its compassion--its focus on these very amusing and sympathetic newcomers who genuinely love what they are able to gain (the new home with its many rooms in a new neighborhood) after having lived in near despair and poverty. At one point, after Ralph finally passes a driver's license test, they take a drive to their old apartment building, which, they find, has indeed had part of a wall break off--the very part they feared would crumble when they lived there. They had covered the crack with a filing cabinet. When they removed the cabinet, they discovered blue sky showing through the wall.This book is filled with more imaginative, ironic, amusing incidents and character observations and descriptions than I can possibly enumerate in what is ceasing to be a brief review. I'll just say that the book is a reward at the end of a long day. Read it and be touched."},{"Title":"Typical American: A Novel","review":"My dislike for Ralph, the main character of this novel, marred my reading experience. I also found it too predictable when he fell under the spell of a huckster: everyone could see it would be a disaster except him.However, Ralph's temper and bad choices empahsized how his family was more or less stuck with him, because they were isolated as immigrants in the U.S. I also appreciated the period detail from the 1950s and 1960s, and the subplot about Ralph's sister Theresa.For a more nuanced, likeable story set thirty years later, I prefer Ha Jin's novel A Free Life.

I'd appreciate it."},{"Title":"Typical American: A Novel","review":"I read this book. I didnt LOVE it, but I didnt hate it.It starts off very funny, but tries to hard to offer moral life lessons. It should pick a side (humor or life lessons)and stick to it."},{"Title":"Typical American: A Novel","review":"I purchased this book ages ago at a used book sale (OK, not great condition, 50 cents). I finally got around to reading it this past weekend, and I finished it last night.Like I indicated in my title, it was disappointing. I was expecting more from this debut novel, but it didn't deliver. The characters/situations did not ring true in the least, and the humor that was promised by the blurbs on the cover, well, I personally couldn't locate it.I like stories about the immigrant experience in America. But for a book to be good (for me), the writing has to be fluid, the situations and characters must, absolutely must, ring true, and if it illustrates its themes with at least a soupcon of humor, then you usually have a winner, And last, but most definitely not least, it has to be a book you don't want to put down.If you're on this page I'm sure you're already familiar with Amy Tan. But if not, I heartily recommend her four novels. Here is a list of them, in the order of my favorites:The Joy Luck Club (perfection)The Kitchen God's Wife (perfection)The Bonesetter's DaughterThe Hundred Secret Senses"},{"Title":"Typical American: A Novel","review":"Set in the 1940s, Typical American is about an immigrant named Ralph Chang who planned to come to America temporarily but instead, permanently resided in the U.S. Ralph was faced with most of the difficulties present-day immigrants are faced with such as forgetting to renew his visa, his only proof that allowed him to stay in the U.S. However, Ralph's life became smoother and not long after Ralph settled into America, he got married and began a family. Soon enough, Ralph's family went through many minor problems like most healthy families...until Ralph met Grover Ding, Ralph's friend's tenant. Grover brought major chaos to Ralph's family by the various actions he displayed. Although the beginning of Typical American seemed like an innocent story about Chinese immigrants, the well-written plot soon turned into a more complicated and mature book. For instance, instead of a normal family's ups and downs, the Chang family soon went through much betrayal and several cases of adultery soon took place. Typical American wasn't the nice, innocent story anymore, but a mature adult book. Despite some harmless humor throughout the book, such as Ralph's two young daughters quarreling, I disliked the book because it had some lustful topics at times. Although I liked the book in the beginning, (Ralph's struggles were powerfully intriguing), the middle and latter parts of Typical American were disturbing and ruined my whole positive perspective of the book. (For example, a character in the book committed adultery while another person had an affair.) However, the plot was clearly well-written and advanced with the reader being curious to gain more information. Also, with many jokes and realistic family-life issues, Typical American grasped the reader's attention. So, those who wouldn't be offended by lustful topics would probably enjoy Typical American. Otherwise, those who are innocent-minded and sensitive to lustful issues would probably find this book disturbing."},{"Title":"Typical American: A Novel","review":"the first couple of chapter was interesting. but it got boring after a while. just normal immigrant story."},{"Title":"Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence","review":"I have seen this book on countless discount tables. I finally bought it and read it. This is not a tell all for lesbian nuns who reveal their sexual escapades while cloistered in a convent. This is a collection of stories told by ex nuns about their short stay in convents all across America. It is their story. Their life. Each of these women left for various reasons and all are now fullfilled in their life on the outside as out lesbians. There is nothing cheekie about this book. It is well written and well told. I am glad I finally picked it up and actually read it."},{"Title":"Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence","review":"This book is a stunning collection of beautifully written stories, of how women came to be themselves. Each of these women's journeys was at times painful, always heart wrenching, and always written in her individual voice. This anthology is not to be taken lightly. It is not filled with the lascivious sex that a teenage boy might think, but it is dozens of true stories of evolving women who come to learn who they are, and how they fit with their definition of God. An amazing collection of stories."},{"Title":"Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence","review":"In this book we encounter the biographies and personal photos of numerous nuns or ex-nuns who have \\"come out\\" as lesbians. they talk about how they came into convent life, how they discovered their sexuality, and how that altered their religious life. Very fascinating study.David Rehakauthor of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\""},{"Title":"Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence","review":"I came across Lesbian Nuns in Amok 5th Dispatch and knew I had to read it. Don't expect detailed accounts of physical \\"particular friendships\\", instead it is more about each of their lives inside and sometimes outside their communities. Even though I enjoyed reading it, it did become more or less repetitive. There are several accounts that do stand out and will not easily be forgotten, but many are short and don't go into much detail. I think the most intersting thing about this book is that it shows how the church really was (and maybe still is?), how the church ignored, reacted, diagnosed, and \\"treated\\" these \\"particular friendships\\". This book is worth the time to read it, and read it again."},{"Title":"Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence","review":"I felt compelled to write a review, especially after reading the review by [...]. I was shocked and horrified that she wrote the these women entered religious life for romantic reasons. If you read this book, you will realize the love and commitment these women carried in their hearts for God as they entered their vocations. I think it is sad that just because [...] didn't experience her religious experience like they did, she can't believe their stories. There are too many stories in this book to just write these women off. If anything I think it is a sad but accurate portrayal of how often institionalized religion hurts and controls the people it is called to love. I never aspired to be a nun, but I have experienced both goodness and harm done in the name of religion. This is a must read for critics of the Church who have issue with the religious right as well as the Catholic church. This is also a must read for women everywhere in regards to the effects of patriarchy in society."},{"Title":"Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence","review":"Yes, most of the women who tell their stories in this volume did leave the church but by no means all.

It may not be worth $400 but it's most definitely worth $7!!"},{"Title":"Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence","review":"\\"Lesbian Nuns\\" is not intended as an entertainment piece and is unlikely to interest the casual reader.

Pregnant, she almost dies giving birth to his son, but help comes in the form of a stranger, a stranger her father sent for.Modern OB-GYN, Dr. Angus McPherson is on his way to a delivery at the hospital, when he is flagged down by a man in the rain and goes to help the man's daughter, who is weak from loss of blood after a difficult birth.Angus soon comes to love the young mother, Maria Hallett, and agrees to stay in the past and marry her, to prevent her going to jail accused of witchcraft. Maria reluctantly agrees to the match, but warns him that her heart belongs to Sam Bellamy and she can never love another.Can Angus ever win her love, when Maria is so determined not to forget her pirate? And what would happen to them if Sam ever returns to claim his son and his woman?This is a fast paced, page turning book and I was eager to see what happens next. It is based on a true story, but some things have changed for the book, adding to the story of Maria Hallett, rather than detracting from it.Maria starts off as a bit of a tearaway, but marriage and motherhood have settled her and her transition from child to young woman was deftly handled. The subplots inlcude family feuds and Maria's gradual acceptance by the community who were convinced that she was a witch.The ending was a little abrupt, but it certainly intrigues and would make you want to know what happens in the sequel &quot;Port Call To The Future.&quot;All in all, a very good read.Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Silent Screams"},{"Title":"House Call to the Past","review":"For those of us who have followed Janet's writing over the years, House Call to the Past is a real treat. Drawing on her own family history, Janet has woven a tale of time travel, high drama and romance by focusing on her great grandmother, Maria Hallet as the heroine and the doctor, Angus McPherson, as the hero of the story.Dr. Angus suddenly found himself in the past while on the way to deliver a baby, about to be born to Maria's descendant, Blair Smyth-Black, of Hyannis. He found himself in the year 1713, delivering Maria's child in Yarmouth instead. Maria's child was that of Black Sam Bellamy, with whom Maria was madly in love, even though he was again at sea, and there was a chance she would never see him again. This was just the start of the adventure, as Dr. Angus quickly found that he had to convince the locals that Maria was no witch, then marry her to keep her from death.Black Sam had vowed to come back rich and reclaim his Maria. Dr. Angus vowed to keep it from happening. Maria was torn between the kindness and goodness of Dr. Angus and her love for Bellamy. Eventually Black Sam came to retrieve his Maria and his son, arriving one stormy night aboard his ship, the Whydah.I found the tale to be exciting and one that kept me reading until the last page. Janet has promised a sequel to be titled, Port Call to the Future, where fans will learn just what happened to Black Sam Bellamy. We're all waiting."},{"Title":"House Call to the Past","review":"Maria Hallett was a wild fifteen year old that lived in Yarmouth, Massachusetts (Cape Cod), in the year 1713. While her huge family slept, she would dash into town to spend a few hours at Crosby Tavern. There, Maria would flirt and tease all the customers, but never went to bed with any of them. Until Sam Bellamy. Sam and Maria spent one night together while a storm raged outside. Sam was a sailor with nothing to his name. He told Maria to wait for him. He would return for her as soon as he made his fortune from the sea. To do this, Sam became a pirate.Dr. Angus McPherson is an obstetrician living in Brewster, in the year 1992. As a violent storm rages outside, one of his patients calls to inform him that she has gone into labor. \\"Dr. Angus\\" began his trip to the hospital. However, en route he spies a man, running toward his car from a pasture, frantically waving him down. Angus braves the storm to meet the man half way. John Hallett begs Angus to help his daughter, Maria, who is at his home in the middle of a difficult delivery. Knowing his other patient would be fine, Angus agrees. In no time at all, Dr. Angus realizes he has crossed an invisible barrier and entered the past. He saves Maria's life, and that of her baby boy. Yet before he could leave to recross the pasture and return to 1992, he learns that a council meeting was forming to declare Maria a witch and to kill her. Angus can't explain the strong feelings he has for Maria after such a brief time, but to save her again Angus decides to remain in 1713 and marry her.Maria marries the doctor to save herself, but fully expects to leave him when Black Sam finally returns for her. Angus is just as determined to earn Maria's love, so she would never leave him. The town quickly trusts the new doctor in their area. Learning to trust Maria, an accused witch, is harder. And Maria wasn't really doing anything to help matters. Maria may only be around the age of sixteen, but she is going to have to mature quickly if she ever hopes to be truly happy.**** I found the character of Maria to be extremely vexing, to say the least. Yet considering her age, I think the author made her maturity level realistic. The doctor's character is extremely well done! Most of this story comes from his point of view. As for the people of Yarmouth and its surrounding area, they gave this story a bonus touch. The author took the time to let me, as the reader, understand them and their beliefs. All-in-all, this romance is refreshing and perfect for a beach read or while you are outside enjoying the sunshine.This is Maria and Dr. Angus's story. I understand that Sam has his own story in the next episode \\"Port Call To The Future\\". If it turns out to be as interesting as this story, I will be very happy. We shall soon see. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"House Call to the Past","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is by far my favorite of Ms. Smith's work.

John Hallett, desperate to find help for his pregnant daughter Maria, calls out across time - and obstetrician Angus McPherson answers. With no idea of just how far that walk across an innocent-looking field will take him, as he quickly learns why no midwife or physician from her time will help his new patient give birth.Her fellow villagers in coastal Yarmouth believe that Maria Hallett is a witch. So as the unmarried girl struggles to bear the son of pirate Black Sam Bellamy (who of course is off at sea), no one but her shamed yet loving family wants to come near her.Dr. Angus soon find himself in love with Maria, and offers her the protection that can only come from marriage. For her he willingly remains in the past, learns how to live there, and does his best to teach his bride to love him. But Maria, although she's grateful, has no intention of giving up on Black Sam Bellamy's promised return.Not counting &quot;Brigadoon,&quot; this was my first time travel romance. I've avoided the whole sub-genre because, to be honest, it sounded just plain silly to this lover of hard science fiction. I was agreeably surprised to find myself sitting up until all hours, reading this book straight through to its end, because I simply had to know what would happen to the characters!If you enjoy a mildly spicy romance, with mystery woven into the plot and a touch of magic that's applied with a light hand (just enough to make the story work), you will like this one for sure."},{"Title":"Black Looks: Race and Representation","review":"Until now I have only read excerpts from bell hooks' works. Then I recently saw a C-Span program in which bell hooks led a discussion with a college audience. Reminded of the intriguing excerpts I had read, I chose Black Looks as my first full encounter with this intriguing woman's thoughts.I did not examine the readers' comments on Black Looks until completing the book, but I too would like to take the opportunity to give the book my whole-hearted endorsement for everyone's perusal.Unlike the reader who began a review highlighting his leftist political affiliation and interracial marriage/family, I DO believe that this book was intended for that individual reader, as it was intended for me, a white female -- and for all men and women of all colors, backgrounds, and sexual orientations. One's skin color, (marriage) partner, children, class status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, and gender, among many other characteristics, do not determine one's dedication to overcoming the racist, heterosexist, capitalist patriarchy. Indeed, I think that this idea is a theme running throughout Black Looks, as evidenced in bell hooks' essays on Clarence Thomas and Madonna.I do not find incivility in bell hooks' thoughtful expressions and critiques. Rather, I find a much-needed naming of the incivilities that happen to people in this world, due to various \\"-ism\\"s and those who espouse them.Complaints of \\"bias\\" or \\"slant\\" in bell hooks' essays and other works seem nonsensical to me, when I recall that no human being's thoughts, feelings, and perspective are \\"objective.\\" Moreover, \\"objectivity\\" is not a quality that one desires in cultural criticism, which functions to set forth an alternative point of view that is so often silenced. An individual who feels the need for \\"objectivity\\" in Black Looks might seriously question whether any book, television program, song, or other form of media is \\"objective,\\" including those forms of communication that comprise mass media.I think that an individual who can accept that this book is for him/her can also begin to look at mass media with a more critical gaze, an activity that is sorely needed after the hours of unquestioning consumption of TV/movies that fills the evenings and weekends of many Americans."},{"Title":"Black Looks: Race and Representation","review":"I'm biracial . . . my father is white and my mother is black, Latina, and Asian. hooks makes us look deeply and critically at the linkages of race, class, gender, and sexuality in ways that are painfully honest and moving.

This book is a classic!"},{"Title":"Black Looks: Race and Representation","review":"The cover of this book caught my attention at the library, so I just had to check it out. I must say, Bell Hooks's ideas and opinions are right on the money. She mentions issues such as black male masculinity, feminism, and racism and breaks them down very well. She's not the average traditional black feminist. She's not afraid to talk bad about white folks (like Madonna) and she's brave enough to use the word &quot;white supremacy&quot;; not in a militant way, but more reserved. It's easy to tell she's a liberal, but she's not restricted to traditional left-wing philosophy because of her strong Afro-centric view-points. This is a must read for all Black people, especially Black women who hardly have any intellectual role-model to look up to."},{"Title":"Black Looks: Race and Representation","review":"THIS BOOK IS ANOTHER MANDATORY READING FOR ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN THE EXCHANGE OF CULTURES OF THE INDIGENOUS OF TURTLE ISLAND AND THE AFRICAN, WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON BEFORE THAT THUG COLUMBUS CAME OVER HERE."},{"Title":"Black Looks: Race and Representation","review":"The book speaks for itself.

Originally published as 'The Golden Apples of the Sun,' the collection features 32 of Bradbury's best short stories. In 'The Fog Horn,' the inspiration for the 1953 black and white science fiction classic \`The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms,' the nameless protagonist and his boss are putting in a night's work at a remote lighthouse when the resonating fog horn attracts one of many \`mysteries of the sea.' In the futuristic tale \`The Pedestrian,' Bradbury presents an eerie tale that might make you think twice before you step outside for an evening walk. And in \`A Sound of Thunder' upon which the Peter Hyams film of 2005 is loosely based - very, very loosely - Time Safari, Inc. promises safaris anywhere in time to hunt prehistoric animals. Every precaution is implemented to avoid a time paradox and disturbing history, based on the principle that even the slightest change can cause major changes in the future. Travelers may only shoot animals already predestined for death by natural causes or circumstances at the exact moment and are required to stay on a path that hovers above the ground. Unfortunately for the protagonist, he unintentionally deviates from the path and takes one small errant step...Ray Bradbury, perhaps best-known today for his work \`Fahrenheit 451', had once seized the minds of American readers for decades and inspired many more to follow in his literary footsteps. His stories have been the basis of screenplays for the classic television series \`The Twilight Zone' and \`The Outer Limits,' and feature films such as Franois Truffaut's brilliantly visionary film \`Fahrenheit 451.' His stories are at once imaginatively complex yet simplistic in literary style. If you love science fiction - the imaginative, visionary, thought-provoking, classic form of science fiction - Ray Bradbury is a must for your personal collection."},{"Title":"A Sound of Thunder and Other Stories","review":"This is indeed a wonderful collection of some of Bradbury's best short stories, but as pointed out by other reviewers, it is exactly the same collection as \\"The Golden Apples of the Sun\\", simply reissued under a different title as a movie tie-in (reputed to be one of the worst movies ever made).If you already have \\"Golden Apples\\", don't be fooled by the publisher into thinking this is a new and different book. It's hard enough as it is to collect Bradbury stories without getting a lot of duplication."},{"Title":"A Sound of Thunder and Other Stories","review":"Ray Bradbury is one of the greatest American Science Fiction writers of all time. Yet he does not portray huge battle scenes and alien invasions. He rather, achieves something unique by enthralling the reader without the traditional flash of Science Fiction. Bradbury wrote the story \\"R\\" is for rocket about a family that has little money and dreams of one day riding in a rocket ship. It is the future and rocket travel is a reality, yet a large expense. The father knows he will never be able to give his children this gift. So he instead buys a broken old rocket and puts on an elaborate hoax to give his sons the gift of space travel. This is a very realistic style of science fiction. Bradbury takes you and gives you the common mans perspective from another age. This perspective is then used to drive home the moral of his sorted little tales. He uses low diction and familiar settings to allow the reader to bond with the characters. Then the reader is shown how the characters' lives are drastically different then theirs. The result is of this difference is usually technology. Now the reader experiences the effects first hand due to the relation to the characters. Relatable characters are the strong point of Bradbury's writing and it is what gives him the ability to entertain with simpler shorter stories."},{"Title":"A Sound of Thunder and Other Stories","review":"If you are a fan of Ray Bradbury, you can't go wrong with this collection of short stories.

I have been reading his books for fifty years and have read some three or four times. Great stories."},{"Title":"A Sound of Thunder and Other Stories","review":"Ray Bradbury's genius is probably best summarized as introducing a concept that you no longer regard as science fiction but rather as common sense. A Sound of Thunder, written in 1952, involves time travel with the expressed purpose of hunting extinct animals. The safari guides appear to be aware of the concept that minuscule, infinitesimally small changes, in the past, can alter future events.One of the hunters, a Mr. Eckels, panics at the site of a live T. rex and inadvertently steps on and kills a butterfly. 60+ million years later, the effects are felt. Fast forward to chaos theory and that the flap of a butterfly's wings on one continent can affect weather thousands of miles away. RB invented this!L. Sprague de Camp wrote a similar story \\"A Gun for Dinosaur\\" in 1956, about a safari company that will, in exchange for large sums of money, allow you to hunt dinosaurs. The characters are more concerned with local and immediate consequences and not future events. Both stories are interesting, in their own way."},{"Title":"A Sound of Thunder and Other Stories","review":"These are classic stories.

Interview Skills to Get the Job","review":"As a former HR manager, career coach and consultant, I've read a lot of hiring and selection books.When I received a copy of You're Hired for review, I rolled my eyes and thought, \\"Please, not another book on how to get a job. I've already read the best, like the timeless, What Color is Your Parachute? Fortunately, You're Hired was a nice change of pace. It's concise and focused on key aspects of interviewing for a job, without the fluff.In five chapters with 10 brief Appendices, Epstein discusses three phases of job interviews: Before, During, and After the Interview.-- In Chapter One, Epstein highlights the importance of \\"Creating Right Livelihood\\" in order to craft a satisfying and financially productive career. He shows the reader how to envision and plan this \\"Right Livelihood\\" through a lengthy but useful activity in Appendix A.--In Chapter Two, the author comments on preparation of an effective resume and thoughtful research in order to land an interview.-- In Chapter Three, Mr. Epstein talks about the importance of selling yourself during the interview by being prepared, authentic, confident, and connected with the interviewers.-- Chapter Four highlights the importance of written \\"thank you\\" notes, timely follow-up and declining counter-offers made by one's current employer.-- Chapter Five features a one-page conclusion summarizing the contents of the book.The writing style is down-to-earth and personalized as if Epstein is coaching and encouraging the reader through the process of interviewing. The tone is not pretentious as I've observed in other books of a similar nature. The chapters are well-organized and build upon each other.I didn't understand the relevance of Appendix C on \\"Boolean Searching on the Internet\\" and can't imagine a busy job searcher would actually read those 10 pages that seemed out of place in this guide. I would have found it more helpful to read an additional chapter on networking through associations or organizations in order to discover the \\"hidden\\" job market.Armchair Interviews recommends this book for professionals in career transition or students seeking a concise guide for learning the basics of interviewing for success."},{"Title":"You're Hired!

It is the fifth in the series, copyright 1910 in the original issue.One pleasing aspect of the Tom Swift originals is the manner the writer has of linking the various books. Numerous references are made to the earlier books in the series, to include \\"and his Motorcycle,\\" \\"and his Speedboat,\\" \\"and his Airship,\\" and finally, \\"and his Submarine Boat.\\" Characters we have met earlier in the series reappear, and even characters that will not come back are mentioned. For instance, Captain Weston, from the preceding volume, is briefly described as having gone to Latin America to participate in a revolution.The books are full of humor. For one example, Tom's electric runabout, which is an electric racing car, breaks down during a test run. Tom is forced to ask his hired handyman, Eradicate, to hitch his mule to the car and tow it back to the shops for repair. Tom laments, \\"the fastest car on the roads, pulled by a mule!\\" Alas, Tom passes some of his enemies -- other boys Tom's age -- who subject him to a lively ribbing.Tom has many adventures with his electric car, the most notable being his brave run cross-country to bring replenishments of cash to a failing bank. If Tom cannnot reach the bank by 3:00 p.m., the run on the bank will overwhelm the bank's cash reserves. He is finally rescued from a failed robbery attempt by a band of farmers with pitchforks. So unexpected, so \\"off the wall,\\" and so fun.Unlike some other boys series books I have collected, Tom has a serious girlfriend named Mary Nestor. Tom also has a number of friends who emerge as somewhat developed characters. These include his best chum, Ned Norton, as well as the aging wealthy gentleman Wakefield Damon. One bit of humor is the confusion of the book's author, who sometimes mentions that Mr. Damon is from Waterford, and a chapter later, mentions that his from Waterfield.Is there any science in these books? Remember, this book hit the market in 1910. Actually, there's quite a bit of basic science of the \\"Popular Mechanics\\" variety. Everything Tom designs and builds, from this Electric Runabout to his submarine to his airship, is always the best. Tom is a Horatio Alger type character who -- through grit and education -- pulls himself up by his bootstraps. Late in this series of about 35 books, Tom is president of a highly successful company.One comment -- in this initial series of Tom Swift books everything is \\"electric.\\" There's the \\"electric runabout\\" car, there's the \\"electric rifle,\\" there's the \\"electric locomotive,\\" and so on. Starting in 1955 or so a series began of \\"Tom Swift Jr.\\" These are totally different books, not to be confused with the first series. BUT . . . now the key word is not \\"electric\\" but \\"atomic.\\" These book include titles such as \\" . . . in the Caves of Nuclear Fire\\" and \\" . . . and his Atomic Earth-Blaster.\\" I guess the exciting world of engineering in 1910 was \\"electric\\" -- the days of Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse. Forty years later, we entered the atomic age, so now all the books capture the words \\"nuclear\\" or \\"atomic\\" in the titles.Hope you enjoy the book. One of the better written issues of the original Tom Swift series. I do enjoy these boys books, even though I am a senior citizen \\"boy.\\""},{"Title":"Tom Swift and his electric runabout;: Or, The speediest car on the road, (His The Tom Swift series)","review":"Once again, we find Tom ahead of the curve in various technologies and racing about in an electric car!

Easy to digest. Piaget uses every word in his thesaurus to deliver the most trivial of thoughts. Its a hard read for the average brain.Having said that, Piaget's ideas are solid and have provided this reader a brilliant look into the inner workings of the mind. He explains the how and why of the motives of thought, learning, emotions and an organism's interaction with the world around it.His discussion of \\"perturbances to the equilibrium of an organism's environment\\", ...\\"cause a weighted reaction in an effort to restore balance...\\" is fascinating.I read this book in the late 70's while studying psychology.

The following pages are confined to outlining one view, that based on the formation of 'operations,' and to determing as objectively as possible its place among others which have been put forward.\\"Here are some representative quotations from the book:\\"Every psychological explanation comes sooner or later to lean either on biology or on logic (or on sociology, but this in turn leads to the same alternatives).\\"\\"And, furthermore, even if stages of development simply mark successive approximations of intelligence in its conquest of immutable 'ideas'; what proof have we that the normal adult or the logicians of Russell's school have succeeded in grasping them and will not be continually surpassed by future generations?\\"\\"Formal logic is, according to this view, not an adequate description for the whole of living thought; formal operations constitute solely the structure of the final equilibrium to which concrete operations tend when they are reflected in more general systems linking together the propositions that express them.\\"\\"But, granting all this and admitting that logical thought is necessarily social, the fact remains that the laws of grouping constitute general forms of equilibrium which express both the equilibrium of inter-individual interaction and that of the operations which every socialized individual is capable when he reasons internally in terms of his most personal and original ideas.\\""},{"Title":"Psychology of Intelligence","review":"I purchased this item as a required textbook for a class on cognitive development and education.

Commonly, the book will simply assert that X causes Y without any physical justification as to WHY. Illustratively, when the book touches upon atomic structure, it uses a figure depicting the Bohr model of the atom without any reference to this being a simplification, nor any reference to the &quot;actual&quot; character of atomic orbitals.Additionally, the book is rife with poorly worded problems which are accompanied by answers that seeminly have no correspondence to their respective problems. I did not do a single problem set from the book without finding at least one problem where the answer was just plain wrong. A particularly amusing instance was the assignment of units of area to a dimensionless answer (and NO, the quantity wasn't right, either).STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"The Science and Engineering of Materials, 3rd Edition (PWS Series in Engineering)","review":"The primary feature of Askeland's text is in the speed with which its sections can be read. Unfortunately, this is due to the lack of necessary detail. Difficult concepts are often glossed over, while simpler topics receive undue attention. The example problems don't seem as relevant as they might be, and certainly bear more strongly on the author's skills than on the student's.I may be unfairly comparing this book with Callister's &quot;Materials Science and Engineering,&quot; but given the choice of either as a reference source, I would hesitate to choose Askeland. If you are stuck with the Askeland text for a course, but really need to understand material behavior, then invest in the Callister book as a backup - it will greatly enhance your understanding."},{"Title":"The Science and Engineering of Materials, 3rd Edition (PWS Series in Engineering)","review":"This book covers the brosd spectrum of material science one would expect from an intro level materials class. The book is not valuable as a reference because it has a poor index. The chapter review questions on design are very vague and open ended. If you are looking for a reference book, look elswhere. If you need this for a class then I hope you have a good teacher."},{"Title":"The Science and Engineering of Materials, 3rd Edition (PWS Series in Engineering)","review":"Enjoy the speling errors and, gramatical misstakes on allmost evry, pages. One would suppose after four editions all such errors would have been annihilated. Maybe the mistakes are meant to maintain the reader's vigilance. Perhaps the typos exist so that one day edition 6 might also.It is worth noting, for the reader's insight, that in this edition the author(s) employ the use--or perhaps we should say the \\"overuse\\"--of the English language to generate many sentences for the purpose of yielding simple concepts to the reader, though certainly a few words would suffice. The book is, in a word, wordy.Perhaps this is enough to warrant a grade of one star. In the book's defense, however, the pictures are quite nice... when they happen to be accurate. After noticing glaring truth deficiencies in a few graphs and formulas it becomes difficult to simply accept all of the quite nice pictures as definitive law, though they are certainly enjoyable for aesthetic purposes.To summarize, the book is not recommended for purchasing purposes unless unavoidable. Though the text possesses some merit in its ability to sharpen one's editing skills, that is no reason to spend what textbooks cost."},{"Title":"The Science and Engineering of Materials, 3rd Edition (PWS Series in Engineering)","review":"The text starts with an introduction to crystal structures that is needlessly complicated and do not give the student any sort of explanation as to how crystal structures relate to the topics dicussed later in the text. The questions at the end of each chapter are considerably more difficult than the sample problems in the chapter, making it very tough to learn from if the student is trying to learn solely from the book. Orange highlights are hard to read."},{"Title":"The Science and Engineering of Materials, 3rd Edition (PWS Series in Engineering)","review":"This text is written in a reasonably straight forward style that simplifies understanding some of the concepts explained. I especially enjoyed the chapters on solidification strengthening and polymers.I did have a difficult time finding specific subjects using the index. Compared to the volume of subject matter the index is very small, with typically only 1 referenced page per item. There are several subjects that are explained several different ways, but to find each explanation requires searching through the chapters. this make the book less useful for reading desired material.In general this is an acceptable text book and would be useful for introductory materials classes."},{"Title":"The Science and Engineering of Materials, 3rd Edition (PWS Series in Engineering)","review":"The material is presented as if you already have a strong chemical background. What information is there stops short of explaining it in any type of useful manner. It certainly is not practical information. I purchased it as a Supplier Quality Engineer of Gray Iron Castings and walked away with little that I could use in the REAL world. Metallurgists that I work with confirmed this. The professor of the college course in Material Science discontinued using this book because his student were walking away with very little and he was only referring to this $180 book sporadically as to not confuse the students. Save your money."},{"Title":"The Science and Engineering of Materials, 3rd Edition (PWS Series in Engineering)","review":"Compared to Callister and Ashby, and here's why.I agree with arthem, that this book doesn't go into enough detail for the person that wants to know &quot;why&quot;. But it's not supposed to. It is by no means a chemistry book, so you have to have a SOLID chemistry background/understanding/feeling or you might have a hard time. It takes more of the &quot;cookbook&quot;, need-to-know, macroscopic approach, whereas Callister is more of the theory. My first materials course used the Askeland book, and the third used Callister, and I found it effective to get the overview, then go into the &quot;why&quot; details later. My TA's and Prof's hated Askeland's style, but I don't think they appreciated what it brought to the table....understanding. Understand the concept (i.e. more carbon makes steel stronger), then learn why.Either of them are better than Ashby. I'd write a review on Ashby's books, but that means to be fair I'd have to dig them out, and I'm hoping rats ate them. Too bad too, my profs were rather fond of Ashby.I have to reserve a star for this book, because with a little more info it would be that much better. That, and I remember as a student, the problems were tough, tougher than the text prepared you for.Which reminds me, my exam questions frequently came out of this text in subsequent classes. Ironic since the prof's hated this book. hmm."},{"Title":"The Science and Engineering of Materials, 3rd Edition (PWS Series in Engineering)","review":"This comment I found in the internet:I tried giving this book 0 stars, but it wouldn't let me. Similar to this book, I would like to learn from it, but it won't let me. All it'll be is a reference guide to you once you've actually got some experience in engineering. Even then more than half of it will be dead weight. Cry if you must use this book, and prepare to spend you nights looking up answers to which often there are none.I would also like to add that the organization of the materials is atrocious, the examples in this book are useless, and reading the all the material will probably make you barf unless you have a driving passion for every material science topic known to man. Which I must say, it managed to drive away all interest in this subject I once had. Thus this book is counter productive, and serves no purpose but to be a great obstacle to the great majority of students's desire to learn.I learned only from looking everything up myself, which follows, any book that can be easily substituted with the random searches on the internet is not a text book at all, and is in fact an unfortunate byproduct of deforestation."},{"Title":"The Science and Engineering of Materials, 3rd Edition (PWS Series in Engineering)","review":"Inside Front Cover: The characteristic exponent of ten for the speed of light, c, should be +8 or 8 and not -8.

Descriptions of lattice structures contained scant information on any structure other than Face-Centered Cubic structures or Base-Centered Cubic structures. The book did not provide adequate reasoning behind the formation of Diamond centered cubic structures, of importance when dealing with ceramic materials. Ambiguous explanation of the Hexagonal close packed structure lead to difficulty understanding what effects stucture causes.I viewed a previous edition of this textbook, under a different author, and found diagrams showing full crystal structures instead of single unit cells. I should find the diagrams I need for this in my materials book, I do not understand why they were not included.The examples used seem silly, such as asking the reader what materials should be used on the space shuttle. At the point in the book the questions are asked, one can only assume the reader has no idea unless they watched a space shuttle documentary or read about the subject themselves. They will be able to provide requirements of the materials, but spitting out names at the reader without delving into the why of the materials selection does the reader great harm.

The best parts are when he's shooting fish in a barrel (Kenny G, John Tesh, Cats..but honestly who needs to be told this is bad). However, his take on pop music is completely clueless. The Billy Joel section is typical. An entire chapter goes by of listing songs that he thinks are bad... and not a shred of rhyme or reason. He seems to be entirely concentrating on the lyrics and ignoring the fact that in popular songs the music is what matters. The reason Billy Joel, Elton John and ABBA are popular is that they have written lots of catchy memorable melodies. If there's something wrong with that Queenan hasn't revealed it here."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"This book, in fact, caused me to laugh aloud on numerous occasions. Queenan in an unmerciful critic who is usually right on point and doesn't ease up. One of his best tools is the ability to juxtapose several categories of \\"bad\\" into unusual combinations and then compare the result favorably to one known quantity. One line I recall above all was something to the effect of anticipating some upcoming event with as much enthusiasm as Queenan would have for seeing a performance of MacBeth with the lead role played by Don Knotts. That one had me recommending the book to coworkers and loaning my copy out. No borrower was any less enthusiastic about it than I was.Queenan's focus of attack is popular culture and there probably hasn't been such a pointed critique in the area since Ortega y Gasset in Revolt of the Masses. Queenan, of course, is not writing philosophy or historical critique but he does the same things with humor and sarcasm and maybe is more effective for it. He has written a number of other worthy books on generally similar themes, but Red Lobster is considerably the best of the lot as it doesn't run out of steam at the end (which, if anything, is Queenan's shortcoming as an author). He takes on the role of the little boy who shouts that the Emporer has no clothes, but does so with a detailed description of what is actually there, warts and all, with a cleverness of prose that just isn't seen often enough today in a world of political correctness. The last equivalent but isolated example I can think of was Truman Capote's description of a popular Hollywood novelist's work as \\"not writing but just typing.\\" For real distilled wit, this is one not to be missed."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Lighten up folks, we're not talking about anything particularly profound here!

I just found this a well-written, funny book which does not have to be taken too seriously (unless the reader insists on doing so, at his own peril), but isn't all hot air either.There are good laughs galore, both in the writing style and the excerpts from lyrics and songs (some of which, heaven forbid, are hilarious), but sometimes you get the feeling that the author is determined to be as offensive as he can, if only for dramatic effect. In the final analysis, though, he is not waxing lyrical about total non-points, and there really is such a thing as bad taste. It's useless to deny that the lowest, commonest, kitschest things appeal to the largest number of people - for by now we know this is practically a law cast in stone, it's part of the human condition.I don't think the &quot;elitist&quot; accusation holds water - it only means one is not supposed to say Beethoven is great and Sarah Brightman is yucky because oh dear that would be so stuck-up and not at all nice to the less privileged members of our society.I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"I cannot imagine spending an evening with this man.

This has resulted in gradual homogonization, &quot;dumbing down&quot; of all art forms.In &quot;Red Lobster..&quot; Kammen's cultural famine becomes columnist Joe Queenan's acerbic Admiral's feast. Queenan, former Philadelphian and TV Guide employee (like yours truly), not to mention self-professed highbrow, searched Broadway to Branson, Paris to Cleveland for the pandering, crass, and schmaltzy in books, film, food, theater, and TV. His is a fun, fast read with handfuls of name checks, infuriating depending on how much your preferences clash with Queenan's often sneering opinions.Queenan saves special criticism for the overwritten books of Deepak Chopra and Robert James Waller, overcooked meals at TGI Fridays and Taco Bell, overwrought music of AC giants John Tesh, Billy Joel, and Kenny G (missing the horrid Bette Midler but praising her former employee, Barry Manilow), and overdone sequels to movies that shouldn't have had a I, let alone a II-VII. His most vicious vitriol is for overproduced Broadway plays like &quot;Jeckyll &amp; Hyde&quot; and &quot;Cats,&quot; (from which Queenan enters and exits his lowbrow luau).You'll disagree with Queenan, often and vocally. His opinions of doo-wop music and the films of Mel Brooks miss the point and, for doo-wop at least, are borderline racist. The same for his views of Branson except for Andy Williams (who receives Queenan's highest praise: &quot;no schmaltz whatsoever&quot;). But &quot;Red Lobster&quot; remains entertaining regardless of your entertainment choices; his takes on live audience reactions, and his praise of older performers, may have you asking, &quot;Why did I like...?&quot; He won't change your mind, but despite offensive language and annoying prose style, he will have you using it. Read it, then write your own sequel."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Dear me, I am as much a snob as the next one, but really, this book left me cold. What let me down was that Queenan spent more time telling me X, Y, and Z sucked without ever really exploring why, and what about our culture encourages such suckiness. After a while it became so repetitive (this sucks, that sucks, etc.) and completely lacking in insight."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Joe Queenan's pen has always had a large amount of poison in it and in Red Lobster, White Trash &amp; the Blue Lagoon, it spills out in buckets. The premise of the book is that Mr. Queenan is immersing himself in pop culture phenomenon like Cats to find out why something so bad is loved by millions. He goes to Andrew Lloyd Weber plays, listens to music like Michael Bolton, goes to Red Lobsters and heads out to the entertainment wasteland in Branson, Missouri. The description of his journey out to Branson is priceless and classic Queenan. He eventually becomes addicted to these things and he tries to climb out of this entertainment death pit. If you enjoy a cynical writer and someone not afraid to offend, then Joe Queenan is your man."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Why would we need an actual book to tell us that the works reviewed by Joe Queenan are atrocious? Does he think that the audience to which he may appeal are these culturally benighted figures laboring under the delusion that the performers reviewed here aren't hacks?1. How much does it take to recognize that Billy Joel is a Long Island cornball and that his status as a stsple of classic rock stations is hardly indicative of great talent? Any semi-literate person can recognize how inane \\"Piano Man\\" is lyrically. Does this merit a book? No.2. Jackie Collins' novels. Once again, hardly a revelation.3. Branson, Missouri. The same.A clich&eacute; is appropriate here, and that clich&eacute; is, \\"Shooting fish in a barrel.\\" Really, Joe, if you wanted to provide insights that would shake the foundations of culture, why not argue against something that is held in esteem by people who are actually educated? Shaw did it with Shakespeare; not every Ingmar Bergman piece has been esteemed as a masterpiece; Wagner has his detractors,etc.In the end, one is hardly impressed with someone who has the \\"insight\\" to tell us that Red Lobster and the Olive Garden are low-quality chain restaurants.

Admittedly, I found the topic interesting so I decided to purchase it. Queenan pulls out all the stops lashing into everything from Red Lobster to Billy Joel. He delivers written tirades that delve into almost every major category of society. The reason I disliked the book wasn't because of its content. In fact, I agreed on a lot of the things he tore apart. I, too, have no desire to see &quot;Cats&quot; and Steven Seagal is the worst actor since Mark Hamill. My parents are going to Branson, MO for their 35th anniversary and I continously chide them for that. So we do agree on a lot of the same issues. My displeasure of his book came from his condescending and pretentious attitude. He displays a &quot;holier than thou attitude&quot; which really becomes intolerable. I love sarcasm but can Mr. Queenan really dislike all of these things?"},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"but side-splittingly, bowel-pinchingly funny nonetheless. Queenan's ability to skewer people --his sheer power to just _unload_-- is what drives this book. It's page after page of vitriolic commentary on Americana, and although the tone never changes (he writes like a frustrated pop culture critic...oh, wait...that's because he is one), it's still an absolute thrill. Just a laff-riut.Sure, there are times when he strikes close to home, and you feel like unloading on the author himself. (&quot;Hey, Queenan! Hop on down from yer little East Coast throne of self-indulgence and chat with the mortals! Maybe we read pop novels because WE ENJOY THEM! How's that intellectually taxing job at TV Guide going, by the way?&quot;) But as long as you engage that third brain cell, and have the ability to laugh at yourself, then this book is a must-read. It's a real peach."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"This is a very funny book. (A good thing, I suppose, since Mr. Queenan makes his living as a humorist!) The author is intelligent, observant, and witty. He skewers the bad and the merely mediocre in various categories: film, television, theater, music, restaurant chains, etc. One caveat- Mr. Queenan ranges far and wide in his quest for the Holy Grail of garbage. He is bound to hit on some things that you happen to like. If that's going to bother you, you may not like this book. If you can shrug it off and just get your jollies from the bits you agree with, then you should enjoy this book. As an example: Mr. Queenan administers a well-deserved thrashing to His Satanic Majesty, Phil Collins. On the other hand, he equates (unfairly, in my obviously subjective opinion) Billy Joel with Mr. Collins. He also doesn't have much good to say about Cat Stevens, Yanni, Kenny G., Toto, John Tesh, Travis Tritt, or Garth Brooks. In the realm of the family restaurant, he trashes Red Lobster and The Olive Garden, but likes Sizzlers and Bob's Big Boy. Well, you get the idea. If you enjoy most popular culture, this book probably isn't for you. If, on the other hand, you think most of the stuff out there is not going into any time capsules for the edification of aliens, you'll have a good time. Here's a &quot;test sentence&quot; to see if you like the style. The victim of this particular rant is Michael Bolton: &quot;And having to sit there and listen while this Kmart Joe Cocker mutilates 'You Send Me' is like sitting through a performance of 'King Lear' with Don Knotts in the title role.&quot; Or, try this one: &quot;Red Lobster, I quickly learned, was a chain geared toward people who think of themselves as a little bit too upscale for Roy Rogers.&quot; I think the above excerpts give you a pretty good taste of the flavor of the prose. One other red flag might be worth waving: although Mr. Queenan doesn't actually use what are so quaintly termed &quot;dirty words,&quot; he does cruise around the outskirts of that particular linguistic neighborhood (using equivalent slang terms, for example). Again, as with &quot;sacred cows,&quot; if not-so-poetic license of this sort bothers you, you may want to stay away. Otherwise, get a copy of this book, grab your towel and sunblock, and hit the beach and settle in for a fast, funny read. And, oh yes, don't forget your Phil Collins CD's..."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Joe Queenan is a writer who knows how to put the &quot;I&quot; in irony. Red Lobster, White Trash and the Blue Lagoon is a very bad book, and one can only suppose the results are intentional.How else to explain the smug patter, the oh so self-indulgent glibness of the urban sophisticate as he plumbs the shallows of American popular culture? It is, after all, only a joke: a two hundred page gag played on the unsuspecting reader, no doubt himself an urban sophisticate. &quot;You want a few cheap laughs,&quot; smirks the author, &quot;about how bad really bad entertainment can be? Well, guess what, you Kronos Quartet listening, Umberto Eco reading twit -- you're holding a prime example of it in your over manicured hands right now!&quot;Like a less italianate Dante, a slower Swift, Queenan chronicles his &quot;odyssey&quot; (how literate!) from a Broadway viewing of Cats to that seventh circle of schlock, Branson, Missouri, all the while brooding about the increas! ingly wretched state of his cultural soul. And there, you see, is the whole point. This isn't a book about the self-evident worthlessness of, say, Tom Clancy novels; it's about Joe Queenan. Posturing as a modern day Mencken decrying the new boobeoisie, Queenan instead dishes up a sort of cut-rate Hunter S. Thompson, navel gazing his way through the junkyard without benefit of controlled substances.Are there clever lines scattered throughout the book? Yes. Do they suffice to sustain the reader's effort (let alone expense)? No. In a world already over full with Suckiness (Queenan's pet term) RL, WT &amp; BL only adds its widow's mite to the pile, as the author almost certainly knows.More chablis, anyone?"},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"I'll tell you why -- because Queenan systematically and remorselessly attacks EVERY pop culture icon.

And his latest work doesn't disappoint. From real bad movies to the collected works of Billy Joel; from ubiquitous chain eateries to *Cats*; and from the music halls of Branson, Missouri, to the best seller lists of American fiction, Queenan has a blast attacking the bloated sacred cows of low-brow American culture. A very funny book."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. I read it assuming that Queenan had some kind of insight to provide into bad American culture. But the book primarily reads like a laundry list of bad food, bad movies, bad television and other things that Queenan does not like. Rarely does he explain WHY these things are bad, in his opinion. And the book is terribly disorganized, with no real rhyme or reason to it. He thinks that hyperbole is funny and can substitute for insight. But he's wrong.Around a quarter of the way through the book I reached the point where Queenan declared that the United States should apologize to the world for its culture \\"just as the Germans had to apologize for mustard gas, Auschwitz, and Hosrt Buccholz.\\" This is obviously parody--exaggeration to make a point. It was at this moment that I expected Queenan to rally to a defense of American culture, to demonstrate that the people who make this kind of argument--that Red Lobster and movie sequels are as bad as the Holocaust--are not only effete snobs out of touch with human beings, but downright crazy. I expected him to turn the tables on the cultural critics. But he did no such thing. He just kept listing things that he did not like and occasionally mentioning one thing that he expected to hate but actually enjoyed (like Sizzler steak house or Cleveland). Thus, what should have been a turning point for the book is just another bit of absurd argumentation, intended for a cheap laugh but not to make a larger point.A big problem is that he lists these things and simply expects his reader to agree with him, as if it is self-evident and therefore needs no further explanation. If he says that Billy Joel and the sitcom Friends both are junk, we are supposed to nod our heads and say \\"Yes, we agree.\\" But he never goes into details. He never tells us what exactly makes them so bad, or what defines \\"good\\" from \\"bad\\" culture. This is not simply a case of disagreeing with his choices--I agree that many of the things he picks on are awful. But Queenan never really makes an _argument_ that you can agree or disagree with. His argument is little more sophisticated than a burp.For example, Queenan spends several pages on Billy Joel, but never does anything more than list his albums and his songs and assures us that they are really awful. Okay, why? And why is your opinion more valid than the singer's millions of fans? Is there an aspect of Billy Joel's music that Queenan is missing? He doesn't care, he has simply formed an opinion and he's going to stick with it without explaining it.If his examples of bad American culture are so self-evident, then how come lots of people disagree with him? This habit becomes untenable when he attacks subjects that are widely regarded by his fellow movie and television critics as examples of good movies or television shows. The best critics can actually convince their readers that things they like are flawed, ore really not very good. Queenan never even tries.What Queenan also misses is the fact that almost nobody who produces what he considers to be lousy movies or television or music actually intended to produce lousy movies or television. This is the \\"Ed Wood\\" problem. Ed Wood made some truly lousy movies, but he enthusiastically thought that he was making great films. Queenan never bothers to explore how come this self-delusion occurs. Is there something in the human psyche (or the American psyche in particular) that blinds people to the quality of their own work?Other cultural critics have reveled in bad American culture. Joe Bob Briggs could be hilarious with his Drive-In Movie Reviews, as he argued about what made a bad movie truly enjoyable. P.J. O'Rourke could also skewer various aspects of American society, while still explaining why he thought it was superior to places that he hated, like France or Berlin. Queenan is entitled to feel that American culture stinks, but he should at least provide some justification for his opinion. Failing to do so seems awfully arrogant.Queenan never really goes anywhere with the subject and shows no interest in digging any deeper into the nature of mass culture. He flies to France and discovers that they show the same dumb sitcoms we see in the U.S. But he never explains why, if this stuff is so bad, it is still popular in France, a country that he implies should know what good culture is. (And I bet that if he changed the channel, he would discover that the French can producer their own awful sitcoms. Americans do not have a monopoly on bad taste.) Is there some deeper Truth to be explored here? Is there something about American culture, even BAD American culture (perhaps ESPECIALLY bad American culture), that allows it to transcend borders? Why is it that France, India, or Turkey do not have the same ability to export their culture around the world? Could it be that American culture, even when it is bad, has some universal appeal that Queenan has missed?Yes, Queenan wants to seem like a curmudgeon. But it really looks like he was being lazy when he wrote this book, as if shouting his opinion with harsh language could suffice for reasonable argument. He never really bothered to think about his subject and instead just turned the book into a list of all the things he did not like. Great...."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Let me start by saying that I agree with many of Joe Queenan's observations and, even when I don't agree, I understand where he's coming from. I enjoy listening to Billy Joel and Elton John, but I also understand that their music is just that ... something light and easy to listen to. That doesn't make it bad, just inconsequential. Unfortunately, Queenan equates inconsequential with bad as only an elitist can.Elitism is not, however, the reason I gave up on this book less than halfway through. I gave up because Queenan never stops to explain what he dislikes about that which he pillories. It's just one long rant. Movies are deemed bad solely because of who's in them. Albums are deemed bad solely because of who made them. There is no insight here; no analysis of how on earth Kenny G. could have enjoyed the fleeting fame he did or what possesses people to watch Adam Sandler movies; just a petty tirade against all that is inconsequential."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Queenan is a good trash talker - he has a marvelous way with words - but his criticism of modern culture is at times tiresome and repetitive."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"For a self-confessed cultural snob, Queenan doesn't seem to know much about the methodologies of good criticism. While an undeniably gifted rhetorician, Queenan is in rather shallow water indeed. By presenting no standard for his attacks except for some arbitrary mythical aesthetic that he declines to share, his rantings don't have any basis in any discernible paradigm of taste. Queenan simply spits out his bile with little concern for organization or insight. He comes to no grand conlusion and when at a loss for a valid objection, he devolves into the 'this sucks because it sucks' type of thing. His targets range from the too easy (Yanni, John Tesh, Cats), to the hopelessly out of date (Molly Ringwald, Love Story...Love Story!?). And some just seem out of place considering who their surrounded by (Billy Joel). Good crticism is noted for clarity of structure and rigor of thought.

However; for the criticism to ring true it has to be unbiased and unaffected by the business interests so responsible for our tawdry culture. I was reading this book while visiting the eastern epicenter of American kitsch (I assume the western one is Las Vegas), Disney World. No where in Queenans work is there any reference to Disney's shallow and vulgar dissemination of culture -- an obvious and glaring omission. Why? The obvious answer is that the book is published by Disney's print house, Hyperion. Need I say more? Queenan trashing Disney would be like the Tomorrowland employee ansering me honestly when I asked him to show me which ladies' room the &quot;Tomorrowland Baby&quot; was born (and discarded) in. (By the way, the T-Land guy said he didn't know what I was talking about and nervously laughed.)Queenan's book is filled with paragraph upon paragraph of mindlessness taken out of context. I could do the same with &quot;Red Lobster,&quot; but I won't. It takes more than that to be persuasive and enlightening. It also suffers from sloppiness. In one chapter, the author tries to demonstrate his open-mindedness by praising Sizzler and its waiters from the Ivory Coast. By the chapter's conclusion the memorable waiters have become Sierra Leonean.Save your money.

However, in a land overflowing with material for his book, Queenan is guilty of being repetitive and mean spirited in his attacks. The 2nd half of the book meanders and loses steam rapidly. I couldn't wait to put it down. Queenan's talents lie in the short columns and bits he does on Imus. For someone who grew up in Philadelphia and North Philadelphia at that, he displays an amazing amount of snobbery and elitism. Get off your high horse, Joe! You write for People magazine, the bible of kitsch! This is an account of a writer who has significant problems dealing with his past.

It's true that much of the popular US culture nearly sinks to cesspool level, and Joe minces no words.His thoughts on the Noise Pollution (disguised as \\"pop music\\") are right on. After all, it is virtually impossible nowadays to go into any retail business (including banks) without being bombarded with the racket. But..some comments are simply not funny, and even more tasteless than the \\"artists\\" derided in the book. Turn to page 55 where the cast from \\"St Elmo's Fire is compared, after much thought, to the Big Shots at a 1934 Nuremburg Party Rally...Similar cheap shots infect a book that should have been a borderline classic..Unfortunately, Joe's smug, unfunny side is enough to nearly make one ready to toss this book exactly where he would like to toss so many of objects of his own derision."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"I found Joe Queenan's book to be that rarity, written words that are truly laugh out loud funny, Nevertheless, I will conceed that his writing could be an acquired taste.

Queenan spares no medium; books, videos, concerts, cds, movies, restaurants, Broadway shows; they are all the victims of his biting wit. Even when h was trashing something that I like, I enjoyed his insights. And because he also writes it all in a bit of a winking manner and he keeps it under 200 total pages, it doesn't become overbearing.This was the first Queenan that I have read (I bought it based on hearing him on Don Imus's radio show).

Just as Queenan notes his disappointment at schlock that isn't really bad enough, I must register my disappointment at passages that don't sizzle enough or tiresome redundancies. He seems funniest with the quick character sketch or the telling detail (Joan Collins and Liza Manelli are pilloried with gusto and great comic timing.) Queenan is less impressive with his much repeated and exaggerated persona--the guy who's gone to the depths of banality as he goes a-swimming in the soup that is bland American pop culture. We get it, Joe, this was a Herculean task, but stick with character barbs. The low-lifes around Atlantic City gaming tables; the various &quot;Kenny's&quot;, Rachel Welch. A good book, but long by one-half. For my money, I think &quot;Balsamic Dreams,&quot; Queenan's roast of Baby Boombers of a certain counter-culture turn now turned mainstream, is much better."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Joe Queenan's writing still has that &quot;life-affirming malice&quot; he admitted to in &lt;i&gt;If You're Talking to Me...&lt;/i&gt;, and he skewers a diverse array of deserving targets with style. I laughed nonstop while reading the book, and cringed in recognition at more than one passage. It's a fun read, so long as you're secure in your own personal taste. Those of you who consider Stephen King and Red Lobster the apogees of literature and cuisine respectively would do well to be defensive: your taste is bad, and the author does a wonderful job in illustrating precisely how bad it is. Unless you enjoy being skewered as much as you apparently enjoy bad seafood, you'll want to pass."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Anyone not amused by this wonderful little volume is either moronic or depressingly bourgeois. If agreeing with Mr. Queenan qualifies one as an effete intellectual snob, then I will wear the badge with honor and distinction.Mr. Queenan DOES NOT hate America; he hates our culture of mediocrity. And he hates it with style. People who complain that his assertions are to broad or his opinions uninformed entirely miss the point of this book. We are as ridiculous as we are willing to make ourselves, and he knows it.Let this be a lesson to the defenders of Americana. The elite and aristocratic have a weapon... wit.

I laughed out loud in the car and drove around town before going home so that i could keep the radio on. I bought the book. I laughed out loud. As my wife slept I lay next to her reading the part about Patrick Swayze. I laughed out loud.Not two days after I finished the book, one of my employees mentioned that she and her boyfriend loved Phil Collins. I asked why. &quot;Because his lyrics are so easy to remember&quot; I'd met the boyfriend before and he also happened to fit the profile of a Kenny G man (relief pitcher haircut and personality to match.For that matter, so did she). &quot;How 'bout Kenny G? You guys like Kenny G?&quot; &quot;Oh yeah&quot; she fairly cried out. &quot;We love his stuff.We have a bunch of his stuff at home. Why?&quot; I told her there'd been a survey. She left and I laughed out loud.I wish he'd spent more time blasting Sammy Davis Jr. I know he's dead and can't defend himself but Queenan doesn't appear to be the type of person who would let a thing like that stop him. Also,unless I missed something, he never attacked &quot;Bridges Of Madison County&quot; and should be called on the carpet for it. Other than that, I loved the book.

David Cassidy in Vegas. and the kicker - Branson, Missouri, where old has-beens and never-wheres go to die. This is one of the best books about our stupendously stupid culture ever produced, and while some may bristle at Mr. Queenan's snobbish attitude, they need to try and find a sense of humor.

Who does Joe Queenen think that he is? His lazy, unoriginal, uninformed &quot;analysis&quot; of popular culture consisted of his cliched, cynical mocking of a lifestyle not his own.

This book chronicles is climbing down from his pedestal and trying to find out what makes people like such \\"lowbrow\\" items such as Red Lobster, John Tesh, Yanni, Cats and a host of other things.While down with us peons, Mr. Queenan discovers there is a lot to like about modern culture and that he has never taken the time to look. Throughout the book he discovers various places, Las Vegas included, that attract him to want more. He only snaps out of his downward spiral when he goes to Branson, Missouri.This book is laugh out load funny and full of fantastic insults. I only wish I could write and compose quips of half the level of Mr. Queenan. In addition, many readers have missed the finer points of the book, in which he not only lampoons himself, but also the items he is discovering. For instance, when discussing books written by Joan Collins, he turns his writing into the style used by Joan Collins.This is an absolutely brilliant book that can be read on many levels. It is sure to insult some, but if you have a sense of humor you will find it funny. Lighten up, read it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Just because the man's last name contains a royal title does not give him the right to berate American society. If he doesn't like America and all it stands for, he should jump into the Doloren time machine back to 19th century Europe. &quot;Joe Queenan's America&quot; does not belong to him alone. America is a free country, and we're all entitled to our pop cultures--good or bad. The right to choose between the Opera or Chris Farley movies is our choice! Do NOT buy this book. His Royal Highness doesn't deserve the royalties."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"I picked up Queenan's \\"Red Lobster\\" book after hearing a favorable review on NPR and was thrilled to discover that someone was finally willing to expose the utter classlessness of the staples of \\"unculturalized\\" Americans. And they are all here - Red Lobster, The Olive Garden, Kenny G, Robert James Waller, Stephen King, et al. Queenan observes in a most deft manner how these sacred cows achieve success not my being excellent, but by appearing to be excellent. In short, they sell it and there's always a fool to buy it.It's a worthy endeavor because let's face it - Kenny G is NOT jazz. Not even smooth jazz. Andrew Lloyd Webber IS incredibly overrated. The Olive Garden is not a \\"fancy restaurant\\" no matter how much your Aunt Meg dresses up before you take her there. And the main problem is not the entities themselves, but the fact that most Americans ALLOW this continued celebration mediocrity due to sheer laziness. In truth, every twenty or thirty-something female who tearfully devoured \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" probably never bothered to pick up a copy of \\"Madame Bovary.\\" If she had, she would certainly see that she'd been ripped off by a hack.Of course, some of this comes down to simple opinion. As Queenan criticizes Rush (the band, not the talk-show idiot), he admits to not even being able to remember a single Rush song - and loses a little credibility for taking an easy stab at art rock. But upon finishing \\"Red Lobster,\\" I was disappointed on two levels. One, for all his cultural snobbishness, Queenan never once sells his side of the equation. What is so much better about HIS tastes, other than the fact that they help him perpetuate the appearance of a refined New Yorker? There's not a hint. Two, in his observations, Queenan seems completely lost on the concept of guilty pleasures. I consider myself a fairly intelligent guy, but I also have those moments when I listen to Kiss and watch an episode of Hawaii 5-0. Why not? It doesn't define me, but boy is it ever entertaining!That said, this is a good read, especially for anyone who had to suffer through a single note from Yanni in any circumstance."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"My pointed sense of cynical humor just about matches Joe Queenan's to a tee--I thought I'd just reveal that bias now and get it out of the way. &quot;Red Lobster&quot; is a surgical expose of Queenan's foray into pop culture, but let's face it--it's also snobbery to the nth degree. Insightful snobbery, sharply written snobbery, downright enjoyable snobbery--but snobbery nonetheless. For that reason alone, &quot;Red Lobster&quot; is not going to be everyone's cup of tea.But it sure as hell was mine. Queenan's skewering of pop culture icons is pretty thorough and pretty hysterical (I just wish he waited for the &quot;Titanic&quot; phenomenon before he wrote this book), but it's almost unrelenting. However, he's forced to admit that at least a couple of those things he expected to hate really aren't that bad after all--chiefly because those things don't pretend to be anything more than they are. Queenan doesn't have a problem with simple, chinzy and shallow--just as long as it isn't pretentious.That is Queenan's real gripe with most pop culture--shallow stuff wrapped up as high art. The best chapter by far deals with literary hacks, and delivers the finest backhanded complementary essay I've ever heard in my life! His tirades on such things are often poisonous--but come on. In your heart, you know he's right."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"It takes someone with balls to come out against musicals like 'Cats' and 'Phantom'. Three cheers for supercynic Joe Queenan who has those guts, and plenty to spare, as his poisoned pen appropriately lashes out at the worst of the mediocre, making for the best reflection on the last century I have heard of or could have even imagined. I was in tears numerous times laughing and relishing numerous Queenan insights, most of which offered me solace that my own pecular, singular, and admittedly UNpopular personal taste isn't at all unwarranted. This book is the truth spoken by one who voices the feelings of many who might(as myself) run the risk of excommunication for voicing opinions contrary to those of a highly defensive public. True, Queenan does peck off the so-called 'talents' of easy targets like musicians John Tesh and Kenny G, author Robert James Waller, and car-accident-of-a-TV-talk-show-host Geraldo Rivera. But there are hidden whoppers of philosophical revelation between the covers of this light reader as well which are sure to delight anyone who grew up thinking for themselves. If you, like me, have always had a problem being subjected to the folks in our society who walk around preening and gushing about having seen the latest Andrew Lloyd Weber extravaganza, buy this book NOW! After I read it I felt a hundred times better for having risked public humiliation in voicing my severe dislike of the film 'Titanic' (utter blasphemy to DeCaprio fans let alone anyone in Hollywood who has sold out his/her integrity to the machine that makes such monstrosities). Queenan ingeniously relates his own corruption-by-self-exposure to a Jekyll/Hyde tragedy. As he is absorbed into this world of trash and cultural squalor he can only want more. And his excursions as Hyde can be called nothing less than deliciously decadent. I'd happily toast Queenan with one of his very own &quot;Suck Cocktails&quot; for this hilarious effort. WARNING: Anyone offended by this book should calm down and try to realize the simple truth that just because something is popular doesn't EVER mean it is actually Any Good."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Queenan set an extremely peculiar task for himself in writing this book: he would spend a year reading books, watching movies, and listening to music that he desperately wanted NOT to read, watch, or hear. Masochism on this scale is rare even in the back rooms of adult bookstores.Although Queenan is a good writer and actualy made me laugh out loud a couple of times, there are two fatal flaws that doom the project.He's certainly not the first to tackle the subject mattter. Early in the 20th century H. L. Menken made the statement that \\"Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American middle class,\\" and used the term \\"booboise\\" to describe this group. Then in 1964 Susan Sontag's \\"Notes on Camp\\" came on the scene.Worse yet, he confuses fact and opinion. He uses the terms \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" in describing popular culture, terms that are more properly used in the realm of morality.Billy Joel and Phil Collins are singers. That is a fact. Billy Joel and Phil Collins are bad singers. That is an opinion. Queenan's, not mine.His targets are so easy. Michael Bolton, THE CELESTINE PROPHECY, the musical CATS, Kenny G., Joan Collins, Joe Pesci, Renaissance Fairs, Molly Ringwald, CANNONBALL RUN 2.Along the way he finds some things that he enjoys more than he expected to. Sizzler Restaurants, CHILD'S PLAY, and Barry Manilow are unexpected sources of pleasure to him.Although I'm often in agreement with Queenan's opinions, there's no real need for him to express them. What is admired in the arts is very much a product of the time in which the art is produced. Edward Bulwer-Lytton, who opened his novel PAUL CLIFFORD with the immortal phrase, \\"It was a dark and stormy night,\\" was highly admired in the 19th century; today his name is on a prize given by San Jose State University for authors who deliberately produce the worst writing they can for the competition.Queenan sets himself as the authority, oops, make that The Authority, the supreme arbiter of taste. This could be fun in a magazine article; at 194 pages he wears out his welcome.As I read, I finally remembered where I had heard this particular cricket perched on my shoulder. The 1960's. A Houston station would broadcast a double feature of 1950's horror movies. My mother would sit up and offer a running commentary on the acting, writing and directing of these movies (she taught Drama at the college level so they may have really grated on her). I ignored her and kept on watching. Finally, around midnight she'd weary of this and go to bed. I could get another bottle of Coke and more Doritos and watch the second feature in peace.If the publishers really wanted to have fun, they should go to a NASCAR Race or Untimate Fighting Championship and find a good old boy with his gimme cap on backward. Pay him to watch Bergman films (Ingmar, not Ingrid), listen to string quartets and read Umberto Eco for a year. That could be fun."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"About two years ago Joe Queenan appeared on the Conan O'Brien show and in a hilarious monologue plugged a forthcoming book about his tour through the worst of popular culture. Unfortunately, this book is a letdown despite a great premise and a few funny moments. Its thinness suggests that Queenan tried to stretch out a magazine article to book-length, quitting once he reached 200 pages. Even at that length there are dumb errors, such as his comment that in &quot;Halloween V&quot; even Jason seems tired of being Jason. The killer of the &quot;Halloween&quot; series is Michael, while Jason is from &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;. Sloppy.Queenan's shotgun approach, which explores some subjects in depth but only touches upon others, undermines the book. For example, in the chapter on bad novels, he says that Patricia Cornwell is good for a few &quot;howlers&quot; per book. This implies that he has read at least one Cornwell novel, but does he tell us what these &quot;howlers&quot; are? Does he quote from her books or summarize her plots to prove that she is a bad writer? No, he just moves on to his next victim. If he can do a multi-paragraph dissection of &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; (one of the funnier parts of the book), surely he can do better for Cornwell than this hit and run. Other times he is irritatingly vague. He says that bad writers use highbrow quotes as epigraphs to class up their books, and cites Stephen King's use of a Goya quote in &quot;The Shining&quot;. But does he consider King a bad writer? We never find out, because Queenan's too busy mocking King's blurb production to bother with the man's novels. (Incidentally, the cover of Queenan's book has blurbs from respected humorists. Is he the only blurb-worthy writer in the universe?)When it comes to horror fiction, it's unclear if Queenan read any further than the cover blurbs. He groups the plots of the entire genre into broad categories that don't resemble anything currently available in the field. Like all genre fiction, horror attracts its share of hacks, but it isn't all just &quot;creepy monsters in the basement&quot; either. In using such an absurdly broad brush, Queenan tries to be ironic but merely sounds uninformed.For much of the book, Queenan plays it safe, as when he attacks John Tesh, &quot;Cats&quot;, and Kenny G. Even after admitting that everyone in the know regards Tesh's music as bilge, Queenan brings nothing new to the table. Without spending a dime you can watch Jay Leno trash Tesh and Kenny G, so why pay for more of the same? And why does he exhume the cinematic corpses of &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; and &quot;St. Elmo's Fire&quot;? Not only are these films yesterday's news, they're last decade's news. His commentary isn't even funny; it feels phoned in. For a truly funny take on 80's and early 90's culture, I recommend &quot;Generation ECCH!&quot; by Jason Cohen and Michael Krugman. It's everything Queenan's book tries to be.The book is at its best when Queenan breaks new ground. Here his narrative becomes more energetic and less perfunctory. His critiques of &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;, David Cassidy's Vegas show, and Joan Collins' novel are funny and insightful. These segments work because Queenan isn't merely echoing sentiments that you can hear on any late night talk show. He shines a flashlight on areas of culture you might not have seen before. The book could have used more of this.Another flaw is the tone. Queenan tries to be ironic and edgy, but instead sounds snotty and irritable. An example is his comment that James Michener's audience has to move its lips while reading his books. He tries to excuse his attitude by describing himself as an &quot;elitist.&quot; But as he repeatedly cites his credentials (he speaks French, he listens to Elvis Costello, he watches Belgian movies), it sounds as if he is protesting too much. He can't seem to reconcile his highbrow tastes with his enjoyment of a Ken Follett novel or a meal at the Sizzler. Instead of enjoying these experiences on their own level, he condescendingly tells us that they weren't as bad as he had expected. Nor can he accept the fact that not everybody shares his tastes; consequently, when he has a bad time at Red Lobster or Atlantic City, he criticizes the consumers of trashy culture rather than the purveyors. The book could have used a little insight as to why people choose low- and middlebrow entertainment. Queenan has the tools to do this -see his reviews for The American Spectator, or his book &quot;If You're Talking to Me, Your Career Must Be in Trouble.&quot; But instead he plays it safe - again.Joe Queenan once referred to himself as a &quot;hatchet man&quot; critic. This book would have been much better if he had left his hatchet home and used a scalpel."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"I liked the first half of this book. I liked parts of the second half of the book. I just wish that it had gone a bit deeper then the \\"I saw this awful show/play/movie and it was bad....\\" approach. The latter chapters could best be described as more of the same.I did find the book to be at times laugh out loud funny and I generally agreed with his observations about the general dirth of real culture in much of what passes for entertainment. But, ripping Branson for lack of culture is an easy lay-up. Same with John Tesh, much of Vegas, and the people who think Red Lobster qualifies as a fine dining establishment. (I did laugh out loud at his commentary on the looks he got for wearing shorts and t-shirt to the Red Lobster.)The book is average. There are enough parts that are funny to overcome a little drag at the end. For that reason, I'd recommend it's worth a read, and a quick read at that, for those who simply don't understand the popularity of authors like VC Andrews (my favorite section of the book) and what passes as popular music. What could have made the book a bit stronger, in my opinion, is some perspective on these shows/concerts/movies from the people who seemingly enjoy it.Perhaps he could have even added a bit of history on our country's cultural evolution. I for one would have liked to understand how we've reached a point where PBS would view a John Tesh concert as a major fundraising broadcast."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Then this book is for you. A professional writer, Queenan can't find a stronger word than \\"suck\\" for everything he dislikes? That sucks.Although Queenan occasionally puts together a real humdinger of a doozy of a quip, for the most part, his course in suckiness consists of holding himself superior to the lowbrow population that determines so much of American culture. Throughout the book there seems to run an undertone of bitterness that Queenan himself hasn't become the household name that Billy Joel, the Eagles, Cats, or even James Michener has. And because he holds these in such contempt, Queenan reveals himself to be worse than those people who visit Branson, eat at Red Lobster, and read Jackie Collins novels. While those people enjoy their lives and probably don't mind if Queenan enjoys his effete, psuedo-intellectual existence, there is one main difference. The former group is willing to let Queenan join in their experiences, welcoming him to enjoy their pleasures. But my guess is that if the tables were turned and some of the great unwashed were to try to take part in Queenan's haughty society, there would be nothing but rejection and scorn. I pity a man who cannot enjoy a variety of levels of entertainment. His world is far poorer than mine. I can relax to \\"Peaceful, Easy Feeling\\" or \\"Piano Man\\" one evening, and still watch or read \\"King Lear\\" the following evening with equal pleasure. Not so the superior Queenan. Sad."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"When I first read Joe Queenan, I thought he was about the funniest writer on the planet. He is still very funny and very talented, but his shtick can get just a bit old, and fast.This book started as an article, and if you can, I would track that article down and save yourself the money and the time it takes to read this very slim yet somehow plodding hatchet job on anything popular for Middle America.This subject was stinging and hilarious as an article, running the perfect length and not overstaying its venomous welcome.But as the book drags on, Queenan is so relentless with his targets that the reader feels a backlash coming. Sometimes it seems like the mere mention of &quot;Tony Orlando&quot; or &quot;Phil Collins&quot; is supposed to be enough to make you laugh and understand how disgruntled Queenan is. And simply the word &quot;suck&quot; is used and used again to describe everything Queenan doesn't like. Okay, Joe, we get it. It's a bit tired to read page after page of insulting &quot;middle American huckleberries&quot;, etc. I guess if people are not as fortunate, intelligent, or rich as Queenan, they're more or less despicable cretins to be mocked by the admitted &quot;cultural effete&quot;.Another problem is that many of Queenan's references are either already outdated or beyond obvious. The entertainment industry does the job for him when cheap targets like Steve Guttenberg or Joe Piscopo are chewed up and spit out by the industry itself once it has no use for them. The vast majority of figures like this really do wind up just going away, and why? Because the audiences--the middle Americans Queenan loves ripping to make himself sound smarter--disgard their product. Queenan's biggest problem is with crap that poses as art, and he even admits that certain cheese is not so bad, as long as it's aware that it's cheese (as he discovers that Manilow is a good entertainer, if a cheeseball). However, I did find it a bit nauseating when our intrepid author, who has immersed himself in popular culture and become addicted, needs to take a trip to France to cleanse himself and rediscover real beauty and culture. Can you say vomit?It's very, very funny at times, and the index is hilarious. I wouldn't pay much for this book again; you may be able to track his rants down online."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"I have had a soft spot in my heart for Joe Queenan ever since I stumbled across If You're Talking To Me Your Career Must Be In Trouble, his collection of search and destroy movie criticism. His two subsequent books (Imperial Caddy and The Unkindest Cut) did little or nothing for me. The latter was based on the protagonist (Queenan) going to extraordinary lengths to make a jackass of himself, a tried and true form of humor that leaves me cold even in expert hands. The former was yet another involved Dan Quale joke, and I'm at least nominally a Republican. Still, I held out some hope that Queenan's new book Red Lobster, White Trash, and the Blue Lagoon would live up to Talking. It doesn't, quite. The central problem is that Queenan expects the spectacle of a previously sophisticated man wallowing in the mass culture to be inherantly funny. He is condescending about nearly everything, and thereby fails to make a number of important distinctions. He goes on at some length about three moderately priced chain retaurants; Red Lobster, Sizzler, and The Olive Garden. He is startled that Sizzler is as good as it is because he doesn't stop to realize that by and large a steak house is a steak house. The primary differences between Sizzler and Ruth's Chris Steak House is a slightly better grade of beef and a $50 surcharge. The food in both is so basic that it would take real talent to do it badly. By contrast Red Lobster deals in seafood, an altogether more delicate matter. A mediocre steak is merely tough. Mediocre lobster is inedible at best and frequently deadly. In between these two extreems lies The Olive Garden. To someone accustomed to the best Italian food in New York the fare is a poor substitute but it is miles above S'barro, a distinction that Queenan misses entirely. The three chains are not competing with the output of the best chefs in their class, they are competing with Denny's. Sizzler and The Olive Garden do so successfully, improving on the steak and spagetti platters respectively. Red Lobster does not manage to improve on Denny's seafood platter. If Queenan had taken note of this he could have made the grade as a man of some insight. As it is he merely comes across as a snob. Similarly Queenan goes to some lengths to skewer the Broadway production of Victor/Victoria . Unfortunately he is so busy comparing the (Awful) performances by Julie Andrews, Liza Minnelli, and Rachel Welch that he fails to put his finger on the show's disasterous flaw. The Movie was watchable only because of the performance of Robert Preston as an aging homosexual humbug. Lacking Preston the Broadway show was doomed by the basic taciness of the premise. Had Queenan noticed he could have drawn parallels with S.O.B. , another Blake Edwards fiasco rendered marginally watchable by Preston. Lacking that insight he is left thrashing about at nothing much. Queenan gets a few things right. Wayne Newton does continue to pack \`em in in \`Vegas bacause he is an Old Trooper. He knows how to put on a show, and even if you don't like the show you have to respect the showman. But Queenan apparently cannot recognize Showmanship outside of a narrow range of perrennial headliners (Wayne Newton, Barry Manilow, Andy Williams, Jerry Lewis). None of these are GREAT ENTERTAINERS because none of them produces much in the way of content, but they are all good at form for the sake of form. Queenan is always demanding content of forms that are poor at sustaining it. He is also hard on people who do not push the envelope. It is a very rare entertainer who can consistantly reach a new level, but that does not mean that the ones who have a command of the level they are on are contemptable. Queenan lumps the merely competant in with the imbecile. He cannot see that Donny Osmond is worse than Billy Joel; a workhorse who is good at what he does, and knows his limitations. By contrast Barbara Streisand (whom Queenan also cannot stand) was a good singer, and then a fair commedienne. She could have stopped at either one and maintained some level of respect. Unfortunately she failed to appreciate the limits of her form, and has become a byword in the field of schlock dramatism. In the end this is Queenan's failure: he expects every broadway production to be on a par with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Thus he cannot diferentiate between Victor/Victoria (a limp drag comedy bereft of its trick wheel) and Cats (A costumed spectacle that is ment to be nothing more than what it is). In Queenan we have the failure of the Intellectual Critic, the inability to criticize a thing on its actual merits."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Queenan takes a look at contemporary America circa 1999 and makes belabored, uninsightful, derisive remarks about what he sees and he laughs at his own wit, expecting you to laugh along.

Having heard from people who have been there, Queenan hits it on the mark -- washed-up acts play to the blue-haired crowd and perform their &quot;hits&quot; up front, fearful that that the majority of the audience might be dead before the second act!!! Queenan is also on the mark regarding &quot;Cats&quot; on Broadway. I have spent a long time wondering WHY people would pay to see this show and now, thanks to Queenan, I know -- it's the publicity!!! You're an out-of-towner and have no idea what you're doing in the Big Apple so you go see &quot;Cats.&quot; When all is said and done &quot;Cats&quot; will be the longest-running show on Broadway, but it won't have nearly the impact &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; had because it doesn't have the HEART of that show."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Queenan's &quot;Red Lobster ...&quot; is unique because of the manner with which he quantifies trash. Just when I'd begun to think I was OK, he speared one of my sacred bovines.No longer is it acceptable to just be bad -- Joe teaches us that we must really work at it. He deserves a case of Boone's Farm and the collected recordings of Zamfir for this literate, engrossing exploration into the depths of our dumbed-down existance."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"I have met the man of my dreams, and his name is Joe Queenan.Nasty, mean-spirited, and dead-on accurate, this skewering of the worst of American trash culture shows what a finely-honed pen can do. The high point is Queenan's well-deserved blasting of the V.C.

Too much, far too much complaining, and not enough &quot;HA HA's.&quot; I need more &quot;HA HA's,&quot; Mr. Queenan. You need more reviews of &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; and less of &quot;Cats sucks.&quot; And I do not mean for those comments to be taken literialy; just use them as a spring board...

The main problem is that he spends too much time saying that things suck, but only infrequently delves into why. When he does, as in his summary of the book &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;, he is a genius comic writer, but most of the time he just describes things as sucking, which gets a little old after awhile."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"This book was really funny, but who is this author to claim to be an elitist anyway???

I'm glad I didn't buy it.

Not until this one. I took it to the doctor's office to read while waiting, and after my appointment I had to pull over and find a Dumpster because I didn't even want the thing in the car. My personal beef: Queenan includes all horror fiction in his definition of &quot;trash&quot; without appearing to have read any of it very carefully. I read a lot of horror fiction (and sometimes write it), and I'll be the first to admit that a lot of it is idiotic crap -- but I don't believe that Peter Straub, Dan Simmons, and Clive Barker deserve to be mindlessly included in that definition. In his attempt to show how smart and above-it-all he is, Queenan comes off looking stupider than the stuff he means to skewer."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"The parts of this book that weren't painfully obvious were simply dull and reveal Queenan's desperate calculation. Does he really think that anybody who would read an alleged critique of bad art would need to be informed that 'Cats' is not good musical theater, that V.C. Andrews was a bad writer or that Yanni, John Tesh, and Kenny G are attrocious? One wonders what audience Queenan had in mind anyway? For that matter, lumping Billy Joel in with the aforementioned is simply Queenan's concession that the rest of his book is a pointless exercise in preaching to the gospel. So he foolishly chose a popular songwriter who has been praised by everybody from Tony Bennett to Philip Glass, and made a desperate attempt to have at least say ONE target that might provoke the slightest argument from his readers. At least it might have if Queenan had even the slightest semblance of depth to his circular contumely. Painfully aware that he had little or no basis for his diatribe against Joel, he simply ran through the songs people would know and, without rhyme or reason, pronounced that they 'suck'. Well folks, how often do you get insight like that? This book is simply a must-read for all those who would receive the news that 'The Cannonball Run 2' was a bad film as a stunning revelation"},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Heard Queenan for the first time on NPR and he made me laugh.

Queenan repeatedly makes it clear that his beef is not in fact with &quot;Cats&quot; or Danielle Steele or Kenny G, but with the people who enjoy them. The pseudo-hip notion that lack of sophistication is a good excuse for contempt ought to be buried with the decade that gave it birth. As for Queenan, these latter-day Menckens ought to pay a little more attention to how the master ended his days. You can't douse everybody in sight with hatred without splattering yourself too.

His Red Lobster critique is written with vigor and talent.

His observations on pop culture are dead-on. He says what everyone thinks but no one dares to say. And says it better than anyone."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"This book is not elitist. Brother Queenan speaks the simple truth. We all should know by now that, in a perfect world, Michael Bolton, Kenny G and Yanni (not to mention the esteemed Mr. Tesh) should, at present, form the nucleus of a truly mediocre lounge band playing weeknights at a Ramada Inn in Des Moines. Unfortunately, as those gushing reviews of The Horse Wisperer on this very site indicate, many in the American public are unwilling to recognize the fact that their pop-subculture predilections do not rank in the same cosmos with true art. Pardon me for saying so, but Queenan ought to be issued the Congressional Medal of Honor for not showing the common, overly egalitarian tendency to spare the delicate feelings of a few misguided Celestine Prophets. The stuff is miserably bad. You can read or listen to it. You can even like it. But you are forbade from calling it other than what it is: drivel. God Bless Joe Queenan for saying so. Ahmen."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"I heard author Queenan read from this book last night. It is hilarious and his deadpan delivery was perfectly cynical; I went home and read the book cover to cover. Almost every line in the book is extremely funny. After admitting that I've seen &quot;Cats&quot; 5 times, I expected violence, but he simply smiled benevolently. He describes himself as mean, but he's a pussycat, you should pardon the expression. The only other writer who generates this much laughter from me is David Sidaris."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"I know he probably doesn't care if people think he's a jerk, but the point here is that he comes off just plain foolish. And BORING. At a thin length, barely over 200 pages this book needs many sittings to get through Queenan's drivel. Cats is bad. So is Red Lobster. So is John Tesh. Wow, what a revelation. Maybe Queenan was living so far outside the normal world that all of these statements really ARE a revelation to him. How about something slightly more intelligent than &quot;it sucks&quot; or &quot;that song sucks and everyone knows that.&quot; Right Joe. Go back to the suburbs with your Elvis Costello records and continue to write for that intellectual journal known as TV Guide. The most embarassing moments have to come when he goes to France with his family and tries to be serious with us for a moment about &quot;good culture&quot;. I guess if we all read Andre Gide and watched black and white Belgian films we would be slightly smarter than the legions of Dean Koontz fans, huh? Wait for a used copy of the paperback."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"I heard a radio interview with the author and thought that his quips about popular culture would be the icing on the cake of a much more substantial, humerous book. The radio interview was like a movie preview that contains all the decent parts of a bad movie. What I found on reading the book were too many conclusory &quot;this sucks&quot; remarks. You can get this kind of analysis on any junior high school playground.Queenan taking on Red Lobster, Kenny G, John Tesh and Cats is like shooting fish in a barrel. I wish he would try a little harder next time."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"All right, maybe it's just me but I bought the book and looked forward to an intelligent trashing of our popular culture. Now, I am just as uncomfortable with Barry Manilow as the next effete snob and I can also agree that the dishes prepared by a Red Lobster are only marginally related to fresh seafood. I can also agree to disagree on which of the other &quot;icons&quot; of pop culture are of little or no value. What bothered me about the book was the sanctimonius manner in which it was presented. Athough there surely is some room for differences of opinion, I do not understand why the he attacks his prey with such vitriol.In all fairness, I only was able to get through about two thirds of the book and found that I could just not go on. It would have been much more palatable if his attempts at humor were wittier and less in the manner of personal attacks on those involved in &quot;culture non grata&quot;. Mr. Queenan has taken a good idea but only scratched the surface of some of the very real issues related to popular culture. This book would have had much more promise if it was less of a personal diatribe and more of a reasoned critique but then, perhaps the books appeal lies more in the author's opinions. I took this book on vacation last week along with Bill Bryson's &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;. Bryson writes mainly about travel but includes a goodly amount of comment on popular culture world wide. I have read almost everything that he has written and although Bryson can certainly get &quot;earthy&quot; in his prose, he does it in a self effacing way which naturally brings a smile to one's face."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"Red Lobster, White Trash and the Blue Lagoon, by Joe Queenan, is yet another hilarious book by him. I've loved the other two books by him that I've read, but this one is different. First, it's a whole book rather than a collection of essays. Secondly, it's short, only 188 pages. This surprised me until I actually read it. But it is still just as funny as I know Queenan can be.In this book, he starts on a pop-culture odyssey and has a hard time coming back from it. Unlike Odysseus' odyssey, though, he doesn't have a family (or a wife) waiting for him back home while he journeys. Instead, he drags them along with him, kicking and screaming. He's always been sort of a snob, sneering at various popular items that he wouldn't be caught dead attending or visiting. Everything that he's always loathed from afar, he decides that he must now experience. He's getting bored with his intellectual life, and he wants to see how \\"the masses\\" live. So he dives in to the deep end, starting off with seeing \\"Cats\\" on Broadway. He's managed to avoid even thinking about it for 14 years, but now he decides he has to see it. It is an eye-opening experience, and one that's just the gateway to the pop culture Hades. Soon, he's listening to Michael Bolton and Kenny G, going to Red Lobster and Taco Bell, and generally becoming one of us. Internally, he's a bit sickened by the whole thing, but soon he becomes addicted to it. He can't live without getting up at 8:00 in the morning for \\"Starsky & Hutch.\\" His is a journey between Scylla and Charibdis and around the island of the Sirens. He will find himself in dangerous waters, almost dying (well, his brain, anyway). And what a ride it is.Queenan definitely has a way with words. He's also very abrasive and condescending at times, so he's not for everybody. He insults a lot of popular things in this book. If you're like me, you'll find yourself laughing uproariously even when he's going after something you really like. There will be other times when you'll be nodding your head in complete agreement (most likely when he's talking about Michael Bolton). He can be an acquired taste, though, so you may want to leaf through the book before buying it, just to make sure. Don't worry where you leaf to. Wherever you go, he'll be going after something. However, if you find you don't mind this, his style of writing is incredible. It flows very easily and reads very quickly. I read this book in three sessions and it didn't take more than 45 minutes each time (and for me, that's fast). I found myself unable to put it down.Probably the funniest bit in the whole book is when he has a dream about a world-wide conspiracy of morons taking over the world. He thought originally that it was just random, that morons were all over the place but they weren't organized. But then he's drafted to infiltrate the moron brigade and find out what they're planning. His indoctrination (which he's already started by going on this journey) is intense, and his life hinges on his familiarity with the television show \\"Touched by and Angel.\\" This sequence lasts for about three pages, and it is truly hilarious. Another bit that stands out are his description of seeing \\"Victor Victoria\\" on stage three times in a couple months, with three different stars: Julie Andrews, Liza Minnelli and Raquel Welch. Very hideous, but very outrageous. Even his 13-year-old daughter, who he drags to Minnelli's show, knows that something is wrong here.He outdoes himself when he goes to Vegas, though. One of his main themes once he starts down this road is that a number of the things he sees and places he goes to have a certain \\"scheissenbedauern,\\" or the feeling that something really stinks, but doesn't stink as much as you secretly hoped it would. He finds himself disappointed by the mediocrity of so much that he experiences, when he wanted it to be truly horrible. Vegas was a good example, and he has some really complimentary things to say about Wayne Newton (and Barry Manilow in an earlier section). Too many things are just bad, rather than being mind-blowingly awful. This does not apply to his visit to Branson, Missouri, and this visit almost cures him of his addiction.This is a hilarious book, and watching Joe sink deeper and deeper into the depths of pop culture, to the point where he can't get himself out of it, is very interesting. However, the book does have a couple of shortcomings. Both of these are actually alleviated by mitigating factors or are easily solvable. The first is that the book is so short. This sort of ruins the entertainment value of the book and makes you wonder about spending that kind of money for a 188 page book. However, after reading it, I completely understand. As good as the book is, I don't think it could have supported much more length. The second problem is that the wisecracks and insults of things that you might happen to enjoy (like \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" for me) can get a bit old after awhile if you're reading it all in one sitting. The solution for that, though, is to put it down for a little while and take a break. Easily solved.I really enjoyed this book, and this view of popular culture from an \\"outside\\" source. If you're in the mood to laugh and you find that Queenan is to your taste, this is another excellent example of his writing. Give it a try. Just take it in smaller doses then usual.David Roy"},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"While there is much to recommend in this biting book, it is worth the price alone for the full-frontal assault on that sacred institution of kitsch, the musical &quot;Cats.&quot; To quote Queenan: &quot;This was pure pain. This was sheer torture. 'Cats' really was the worst thing on the entire planet.&quot; Considering the garbage Queenan encountered on his journey (from the mind-numbing music of Michael Bolton to the shallow spirituality of Deepak Chopra), it is worth noting that everything comes back to this painfully banal musical wasteland. Queenan, more than anyone, appreciates guilty pleasures and the allure of bad taste, but his mission, to discover why it is that Americans abhor the noble and the grand in their artistic indulgences, is certainly no pleasure cruise. We are a nation that embraces trash and most frightening of all, we find no need to apologize for it."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"This book could have been a funny, nasty little read. Instead, it only offered three or four good laughs and half a dozen insights. Even though the chapter is one of the funniest, everyone alright knows that Cannonball Run II is BAD. Ditto for Branson, MO and John Tesh. It's when Queenan is tearing down sacred cows that he is at his best. Particularly nasty were the (well-deserved) attacks on Billy Joel and the author of The Bridges of Madison County. Too often, however, the author just lists things that he thought &quot;sucked&quot; rather than explaining why they sucked. He also makes sure we know that he had good taste before his misadventures in writing this book. Elvis Costello recieved more mentions in this book than in his autobiography. Queenan is a much funnier man being interviewed than on paper. The book's only redeeming quality? Queenan found Evil Dead II to be &quot;watchable.&quot;"},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"This book is not bashful about insulting what many consider to be our cultural icons of the last 60 years. I don't agree with every tirade in this book, but even when i did not I still laughed at his sarcasm and meat axe approach to looking at what entertains us and what we consider of value in entertainment. He looks at authors, entertainers, and chain restaurants with an eye that cuts to the chase, much of it is disposable nonsense, that is eventually recycled in cultural deserts like Bransom Mo. He describes the \\"entertainment\\" hangers on as they desperately try to find a silver lining in their dwindling appeal. He does not spare popular authors either, as he actually quotes passages from their mass marketed drivel. Only one thing got me. I read this book a few years ago, and at that time the author had just produced a memoir. He ridicules semi-famous media stars for their formulaic attempts at selling memoirs. The reviews i read of the authors memoir sounds very similar to what he was trashing. either he decided to sell out or he has become immune to his own criticisms.

Look, Danielle Steel, (or is it Steele -- who cares?)will earn millions this year. Kenny G has sold millions of CDs, whereas Richard Thompson has probably sold a few thousand. Cher is charging $75.00 for a concert ticket this summer and the show barely lasts 90 minutes. Stop the madness!!But really, the sad thing is that his book -- like many other critiques of American bad taste -- will probably only REACH very few people that it is targeted towards.But maybe, somewhere, somehow, ONE culturally-challenged person read this book...they were transformed...they got all their Kenny G CDs together...they put them in pile and lit them with lighter fluid a la Hendrix at Monterey...they saw the light..."},{"Title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, & the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America","review":"What a joy to find that I am not alone in my distaste for Billy Joel's songs and Stephen King's novels. &quot;We Didn't Start the Fire&quot; indeed!

You know they're probably not going to rise to previous levels of crumminess, but it's admirable to see them keep swinging away at it anyway.At one point Queenan mentions listening to an underrated cello musician's CD.

She yearned for her own mother, the first Alice Lee Roosevelt, who died on the very day of her birth &amp; never quite understood her father's reluctance to speak of her.

His characters include, among others, a gay prosecuting attorney, a defendant who's an anti-Christian Jewish chiropractor, his own anti-semitic defense attorney, and a judge high on antihistamines. Taking place in the city outside the courtroom is a shallow Peace Conference called to resolve Arab/Israeli conflict in the Middle East. The key question at the comedy's heart and put to the squabbling people in the courtroom is, \\"How can you have peace in the Middle East when you can't have peace in your home?\\" The judge dreams or remembers a film featuring \\"a clean land untroubled by pollution. Untouched by strife. With liberty and compassion for all its citizens.\\" This utopian land is then destroyed by a Godzilla like lizard. Within the comedy, the human squabblers in the courtroom -i.e. all the characters - are their own Godzillas and render any scheme for the universal improvement of mankindillusory. Mamet's vision here is Aristophanic or Swiftian; satirically observing its representatives in the play, he refuses to romanticize the damned human race.The vivacity of the comedy springs by and large from its verbal brilliance, specifically through the speed and accuracy with which the characters go for each other's jugulars. One late entering character, for example, who is an actual M.D. goes after the chiropractor, addressing him as a thing rather than a person, asking \\"Is it mad because it didn't get into medical school...?\\" Not to be outdone, the chiropractor naturally begins to physically strangle the doctor, while getting in as the last word, \\"Cure cancer you arrogant f***!\\" Peace in the Middle East? Yeah, right!The old canard that used to be routinely applied to Chekhov's plays, that they were plotless, is fairly often applied with equal injustice to Mamet's these days. If one peers an inch beneath the surface of the four scenes of \\"Romance,\\" it's hard not to be struck by the increasing revelations that emerge from each of the skillfully placed encounters between the characters. Under the surface of apparent disorder and frenzy, something starts, grows, and comes to a satisfying resolution. If this isn't adroit plot construction, I have no idea what else it could be."},{"Title":"Romance","review":"As a reviewer for Daily Variety for seven years, I came to enjoy the characters, ideas, and theatricality of David Mamet's plays that I saw and judged. I became a fan. As I came to write my own plays, I saw intimately that the root of character is through what they DO, yet the stage is made up mostly of what people say. Mamet is often praised for his dialogue, but his plays are active--his characters do things, including swearing, cheating, conniving, dreaming, and scheming. If you're an aspiring playwright or simply a fan of theatre, READ one of his plays and see how few stage directions he gives and how often the dialogue is interrupted, yet you get a strong picture of what's happening. Notice how much his characters do. Feel the subtext that emerges. His dramas are often known for their tension. \\"Romance,\\" a comedy, you might expect to be far different, but there's still plenty of tension. All his dramas have humor, and here there's just more--delightfully more. When I saw \\"Romance\\" at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, I laughed a lot and guessed how much fun he surely had writing it. There's even a spot where a character parodies Mamet's love for the F word--absolutely hilarious. At first I thought of \\"Romance\\" as Mamet Lite, but the play stayed with me, and I bought it to read. In it, he pushes the envelope of hyperbole and soars. Consider, too, what the title means to what you experience in the play. There's plenty to chew on."},{"Title":"Romance","review":"Mamet is one of my five favorite dialogue playwrights. (Mamet, Sorkin, JHHK, Whedon, QT) And this play is one of my favorite Mamet plays. I bought this and Redbelt. If you've never heard of David Mamet, I don't think you will be reading this review. I own every play and movie Mamet ever wrote. And I put this amoung his funniest.If I was still in college, I would direct this. I directed Speed-The-Plow, American Buffalo, The Woods, and Oh Hell, all within two years. And I wish Romance would have been out back then.

As an avid theater goer since the early 1960's,both on and off (and off,off) Broadway, I try to see almost everything of dramatic interest. I've noticed that as Mamet's movie projects have improved, some of his stage offerings have been outright stinkers over the last ten years and I avoided catching up with this. I was wrong, Romance, which seems to come out of some boulevard farce format is the funniest piece of theater I've seen this century. He takes a mechanical, tired plot and lifts it into a fiercely humourous, biting comedy with something in it to offend almost everybody. I wondered where Mamet the playwright had been hiding and he's alive and well. This is also a perfect counterpoint to his purported swing to the right that seems to be taking place in his latest book of essays. Anyway, a great play, beautifully crafted and paced, and a better argument against smothering political correctness than any essay he's ever written. I was in a playhouse filled with a rainbow coalition of a bourgeois audience which seemed to just explode with laughter at the way Mamet, the cast and director, had stripped off the masks of his bourgeois characters and their compromises and hypocrisies and made us laugh at how we were so much like them. What a breath of fresh air! This was like a Ben Jonson comedy of all things, with all the fools exposing and revealing themselves in a public arena in the last act. As in his best work in theater and film, it was a pleasure to walk out with a spirit of liberation and renewed energy instead of acrid bitterness which usually accompanies any serious attempts to show us who we are and how we live now."},{"Title":"Romance","review":"With regard to the Kindle Edition, there are multiple errors in the text (such as replacing \\"?\\" with \\"}\\" and multiple formatting errors. It is not acceptable to run a copy of the book through a crappy OCR, slap it up on the web, and charge $12.00 for it.

(Ricky Jay, whom I used to work with--sort of--I mean our offices were next door to each other--but anyways--Ricky Jay once told me that he knew many people that knew a lot about Mamet, but I was almost freaky.) So, I was very worried about Mr. Mamet after the mess that is FAUSTUS. It appeared that Mamet got sick of people telling him what a wonderful ear for dialogue he has, or making jokes about his love of the \\"F\\" word (e.g., both Neil Simon and The Simpsons have satirized our man for this) and so he decided to start writing in this arrogant neo-Victorian manner to show the world that he knows far more big words than the rest of us. This style seemed to work well in BOSTON MARRIAGE and much of his prose, but FAUSTUS was just a disaster. (No wonder Jude Law, whom I believe asked him to write it, ended up turning it down and performing in the Marlowe version.) But the good news is that our old Mamet is back with ROMANCE. I'm only giving it four stars because it appears that Mamet has decided to stop caring about plots, but oh my word, what a juicy, profanity-filled joy this play is. I've seen it in both New York and L.A. and nearly peed myself both times. By the way, I know that Mamet has criticized people who supposedly love his plays but wish that they had plots, so I guess I'm amongst that crowd. But he's still my man, especially after this work."},{"Title":"Thesaurus of English words and phrases: Classified and arranged so as to facilitate the expression of ideas and to assist in literary composition","review":"The first thing you should know about this edition is that it is NOT arranged alphabetically like a dictionary. Rather it is arranged categorically according to ideas, with the intention of aiding in literary composition, as the title page states.This is apparently the first American Edition of Roget's Thesaurus, first printed in 1933. I came across it when my mom brought it home from a book sale. I didn't think much of it until I realized the organization was competely different than what we are now used to. At first it seemed like a royal hassle. However, now that I've spent some time with it over the years, I would not go back to the alphabetical set-up. In fact, almost any time I write creatively, I have this book by my side.There are six basic classifications outlined in the contents.I. Abstract RelationsII. SpaceIII. MatterIV. IntellectV. VolitionVI. AffectionsIn turn, these each have various divisions and subdivisions. At first it is a dizzying, yet dazzling, organization, making it seem impossible to find anything. However, there is a fairly extensive index at the back; if you're looking for synonyms of a specific word, you can start there. The benefit of the set-up is that it affords almost endless cross-referencing. It's impossible not to find a plethora of related words. Additionally, since it is a fairly old edition, there is an extravagant supply of words that are essentially out of use. Each individual word entry has its synonyms listed according to parts of speech: Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, and also Phrases, which can be anything from literary references to foreign phrases to colloquialisms and slang sayings. For the avid word-lover, this volume is an absolutely inexhaustible treasury.

In that book, the authors argued persuasively that Earth is indeed far different than the great majority of planets: complex life arose and flourished. They contend that simple life, bacteria, is fairly common and developed early in the life of this planet. Complex life, plants and animals, is exceedingly rare. It came about four billion years after the planet formed. In the sequel, the Life and Death of Planet Earth, Ward and Brownlee argue that complex life is now in the long process of dying out. They describe how the various complex processes that drive the ecology of Earth will die out leaving progressively simpler organisms behind. The authors describe how evolutionary progress from hardy bacteria to humankind will recapitulate itself to last days when the last fragment of life ends with the red giant phase of the Sun.There are three major climatic events in the future history of the earth: the continuing ice age that we are in. The present warm phase is now being temporarily put on hold by the rapid increase in carbon dioxide due to human activity. This will end with then next round of glaciations will end human civilization. This glacial phase will end around five million years from now. It will end permanently when the plate tectonics will push the northern continents away from the poles. The next event will be the recombination of the continents to form the super-continent once again. The recreation of Pangaea will cause the greatest extinction in the planets history due to the disastrous effect it will have on climate. This will end the reign of complex life. The last great event will be the continuous brightening of the Sun as it reaches it end in life. The oceans will disappear. Finally in the most remote parts of the polar areas the last flicker of simple, bacterial life will die. The Sun, now in its red giant phase, will finally consume the remains of earth in its distended atmosphere. Not only will complex life be ended on earth, it may be ended in a vast section of the galaxy if not the universe.In a surprise, Ward and Brownlee contend that it will be the lack of carbon dioxide not its surplus will be the culprit in the destruction of complex life. It is being inexorably being locked up in limestone and other carbonates. Already plant life has attempted to adapt to the slow drop in carbon dioxide levels by adapting to new form of photosynthesis called C-4 (used by grasses, cacti, and palm trees). The older form of photosynthesis C-3 used by conifers, flowers, and vines will asphyxiate first leaving a bizarre new world. However, adaptation will end and plants will die out completely cutting off the oxygen supply for animals. At the same time, the diversity of life has been declining for the last two hundred million years. It will continue to decline as the world continues to become more hostile.The book is exceptionally well written. Ward uses the death of his mother from old age to describe how, while not \\"living\\", the Earth is the machine of many complex processes and as death comes each process gives out finally failing altogether. The authors don't describe anything radical, just the obvious conclusions from the evidence found by them and other scientists. Against this background, as the authors made the case in Rare Earth, there will be no salvation from the stars. We'll die alone in this solar system. My criticism is they offer no fixes to this. All alternatives are radically too expensive and difficult for humanity to do. Travel to and terraforming of another planet is and always be out of the question. They even assume that somehow humankind manages to hang on for the billion or so years final processes take place. They do advocate trying to leave a legacy to other civilizations. But really are there any other civilizations in the Universe to read our tombstone?"},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"It might be that professors Ward and Brownlee are working on a new genre: non-fiction science fiction. Instead of speculations embedded in story form they speculate about the future in a narrative without plot or characterization or other elements of the story form. Of course they are not the only writers doing this, but they are among the best in a growing industry.Well, what about it? I gave up reading most science fiction years ago because either the story elements were wooden or the science was ridiculous (or both). It is not easy to be simultaneously a master story teller and a polymath of science. We know that (e.g.) Asimov, Clarke and Sagan were exceptions and were able to combine both tale and cutting edge knowledge very well, and in some cases spectacularly well. But their world is gone. Today's science is much more complex. To write convincingly about the future it is not enough to be a world expert in one's chosen field. The future is influenced by science of all kinds; consequently it is requisite that one be an expert in a number of scientific disciplines just to avoid naive projections.So it is natural that Peter Ward, who is a geologist and zoologist, (and, by the way, a sometimes poetic prose stylist, witness his expositions in Future Evolution [2001]), and Brownlee, who is an astronomer and NASA scientist, might join forces to augment their individual expertise; and that they might eschew the story form in writing about the future.At any rate, this is an excellent book of speculation about the future of our planet aimed at a general readership. It is a fine follow-up to their Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe (2000). As in that book their conclusions are pessimistic. They concluded in Rare Earth that we are probably alone in the galaxy; here they conclude that we will go extinct without getting beyond our solar system. This bleak prognosis should not unduly trouble us however since our demise by their calculation is at least millions of years in the future, possibly hundreds of millions of years. In fact their scenario reverses the biological experience of the planet: things will get hotter and drier until life necessarily retreats back into the ocean, and then as the oceans evaporate, life forms regress from the complex to the simple until the only life left on the planet is single-celled, as it was three billion years ago. And then of course the sun expands into a red giant and the earth is burned to a crisp.Is there any escape? Not according to Ward and Brownlee who argue effectively that it is unlikely that we will acquire the ability and the will to even terra form Mars or other places in the Solar System. The idea that we might become interstellar travelers is also quashed as being impractical in the extreme. They conclude &quot;Interstellar travel will likely never happen, meaning we are stranded in this solar system forever.&quot; (p. 207)While I tend to agree with Ward and Brownlee for the most part, as I did with their conclusions in Rare Earth, I think we should realize that their argument in part is a bit beside the point since in millions of years (at most)--not tens of millions, not hundreds of millions and certainly not billions of years--we will no longer be human anyway. The average life span of a species is something like a million years. Because of the incredibly rapid pace of cultural evolution it is highly unlikely that humans as presently constituted will be around in even a thousand years. Some people think we will be part software and part machine before this century is out. Also as science fiction writers have pointed out, the constraints on our species as presently constituted (in terms of our ability to travel in space and to influence cosmic processes) may not apply to the creatures we are becoming.Ward and Brownlee do not consider this point of view, most likely because it would be extraneous to the scope of their book. So some of their ideas should be considered as stimulative and consciousness-raising, not definitive. As they acknowledge in the epilogue, &quot;Prophecy is a risky business...&quot; (p. 210) Furthermore, most of their material is on the purely physical changes that will take place on planet earth as it evolves toward its ultimate fate, and I have no doubt that the picture that Ward and Brownlee present is as accurate as present knowledge allows.I was especially intrigued by their discussion of the return of the once and future supercontinent, Gondwanaland, and how its reconfiguration will affect earth's climate. Their exposition on the carbon dioxide cycle and the end of plant life when the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere falls below 10 ppm was also fascinating. The chapter asking the question, &quot;What Trace Will We Leave?&quot; really gives the lie to human vanity, reminding me of the sentiments in Shelley's poem &quot;Ozymandias.&quot; If anything, Ward and Brownlee are even more pessimistic than the poet, pointing out that our proud &quot;messages in a bottle&quot; sent into interstellar space are not likely to impact &quot;a planet within a trillion years,&quot; by which time there won't be any planets. (p. 186)While most of the book is very well written and edited, some of the sentences in the later chapters are less carefully constructed. There are even some gaffs. For example on page 192 they repeat an error from their previous book, stating that there are &quot;between 200 million and 300 million&quot; stars in our galaxy, when the number is more like 100 billion plus. Also on page 194 they give the Drake Equation enhanced with new terms they think appropriate, but in fact the equation is without explanation shorter than Drake's Equation given on page 192."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"It takes a certain amount of fortitude to confront your own doom. Ward and Brownlee, having acutely described life's beginnings in &quot;Rare Earth&quot;, here portray the mechanisms of its end. With the course of life's evolution revealed in the work of many researchers, depicting the finale has rarely been attempted. Recent studies of the past have given the authors the tools for forecasting the future. They use the history of the planet to suggest the &quot;tape of life&quot; will be rerun - backwards. Changing conditions will reduce the options life has to continue surviving. As a swelling sun and dehydrating Earth limit choices, life will revert to simpler, hardier forms. At some point, although far in the future, life's opportunities will end. A bleak barren world will likely be consumed by Sol's energetic transformation into a red giant star. A lifeless planet will either skirt the circumference of that swollen star or be consumed in its fires.Although a fiery conclusion is the ultimate finale, there are many intermediate steps along the path. Ice, which has covered our planet many times in the past, is shown here as one of the major signs of the impending finish. Seas withdraw from coastlines and habitat zones shrink dramatically. Weather patterns undergo massive changes from what we experience. The authors use &quot;time transport&quot; techniques to enable you to envision the impact of these drastic variations. You visit future scenarios where plant life's extinction has taken herbivores with it. Grasses exist for a bit, but it's too desolate for complex grazers to enjoy them. Harsh winds scream across those savannahs, dehydrating the soil until the grasses, too, finally expire. These conditions, Ward and Brownlee contend, have likely already begun. The peak of plant diversity may already be behind us. Animal extinctions, accelerated by our presence, must surely follow.What of humanity, then? Raised with the ideal that we are evolution's &quot;purpose&quot;, we believe we can overcome nature's greatest challenges. It's clear that even our esteemed technology must fall short of coping with an overheating Sun. The authors, who have dealt with extinctions in the past, deal ambiguously with the logic of human continuation to a distant future. While most species survive for a few million years, they suggest we will still be present when vast changes begin. They weigh the issues of our possible escape from the doomed planet in terms of will, available resources, advanced technologies and likely havens. All come up somehow short. A bleak prospect indeed.The authors' expressive style captures your attention throughout. Not an academic study, yet still a serious assessment, this book will keep your attention throughout. With the new science of astrobiology as their foundation, little of their narrative is idle speculation. They write with authority, yet present their theme as a drama. Actors come and go, struggle to maintain their roles, but succumb in tragic circumstances. Referring to this book as compelling reading is almost damning with faint praise. While the scenarios are projected billions of years in the future, we can initiate many of the processes through carelessness.Incorporating many ideas and research information in a mere 200 pages is a major accomplishment. Ward and Brownlee, with their wide knowledge and almost florid style have produced a fine work. As a summary of geology, astrophysics, evolutionary biology and atmospheric sciences, this is a unique and admirable synthesis. If there is anything to fault, it is the strong reliance on the resources used in their previous collaboration - a minor flaw in such a comprehensive study.

The book did this magnificently. In short, I learned a lot.In some respects, the book is depressing. I wanted to imagine that we are part of the beginning. The book illustrates that perhaps we are closer to the end. I put myself in the next ice age, which could arrive any time, according to the authors, and in the inferno of the distant future. Of course, I won't be there, but the descriptions of these future times made them easy to visualize. By piecing together accepted scientific principles and knowledge, the story of the future of planet Earth is convincing. The only question is what impact we, humans, will have; probably small.I have recommended this to all my friends.

The authors claim that one-day earth will be just like Mars, a barren wasteland. Future ice ages will insure a migration to the equator or perhaps space as earth begins creeping into its geriatric period. Topics like global warming are evaluated in a different light by analyzing the super-long millenniums haul not the short time several decade approach normally discussed. This leads to conclusions that global warming, for instance, might delay the aging process, but the planet is ultimately doomedPeter Ward and Dan Brownlee have written a terrific look that hooks the reader from the start and keeps their attention throughout. The key is that the writers do not scornfully look down at their audience, but assumes the reader can think and comprehend the inevitability of their scientifically based messages of gloom and doom.

I found it interesting, and philosophically quite provocative. A very good 4-star book, plus a bonus star from me for being exactly what it said it would be: a speculative ride through \\"the life and death of planet earth.\\"I do not know how well regarded the authors' basic premises will be among their scientific peers. To me, their hypotheses and ideas made sense. And they came up with very engaging scenes to bring the topics to life: for example, comparing and contrasting the dying of an elderly woman in a hospital with the dying of a planet/solar system. Or describing the likely experience of a catastrophic meteor hitting the earth, from the viewpoint of mammals on the ground hundreds of miles away.I read the book very quickly in the past few days, and will now enjoy reading it again more thoughtfully."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"I have read a number of books by Ward, either as single author or as co-author, and I have never been disappointed. This book is certainly no exception. Using up-to-date information, the authors discuss the evolution of life on earth as a function of evolving environmental, geological and astrophysical conditions. Then, they project the further evolution of these conditions into the distant future - from climate changes and future ice ages to the sun's transformation into a white dwarf - and discuss the anticipated effects on all forms of life on earth and on the earth itself. The book's only possible shortcoming that I can think of is that, in these forecasts, not enough credit has been given to the human element. Humans are well known to have the ability to modify their environment to their satisfaction. Based on the tremendous advances in science and technology over the past few centuries, one would expect a (possibly exponential) continuation of these advances well into the next few centuries, if not millennia - assuming, of course, there are no major setbacks. Consequently, humans may be able to delay, or prevent, at least some of the anticipated catastrophes. As is usual in Ward's books, the writing is clear, authoritative, friendly and engaging. An excellent read! The ultimate fate of humanity, as painted by the authors, does indeed look rather grim; but time will tell how well humanity makes out. Fortunately, we, as individuals, will not be here to find out."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"While this book does have a few errors that should have been picked up before printing and distributing, the overall content of the book is fascinating and keeps the reader entertained throughout the entire reading experience. I used to read books to fall asleep, but I couldn't put this one down. Not only did they do a good job of helping you imagine what they are discussing, but they also made it understandable to the average Joe. I thought this book's concept of the whole subject, along with the manner in which it was presented was a compelling mixture. I would suggest this book to anyone who has the slightest curiosity about the future of our Earth.Even though they end with a bleak and ravaged earth, there are many steps along the way that show how interesting the planet's demise will be, from a strictly observational view. The planet covered in ice, which has happened a few times in the past, is shown here as one of the greater signs of an \\"Apocalypse\\". Water levels recede from the shores and areas that can support life wither away and die completely. The monumentous changes in the weather across the globe affecting the biosphere in major ways. The authors do a spectacular job of bringing you to the scene and helping you imagine it for yourself. The future's lack of plants kills the animals that eat them. Some plants exist for a short while but are not a decent source of nutrients for the other living beings. Heavy winds tear across the plains, devastating the soil until those plants finally expire. The authors try to show how these things have already been set in to motion and could be starting to show as we speak. The number of plant species has begun its decline, heralding the beginning of animal extinctions, which we are not helping to avoid with the way we live on this earth.Through their use of the language, along with their knowledge of Astrology, Biology, Chemistry, and Geology, they float you through time. From the beginning of the earth as a giant molten rock, they slowly show us how they believe the earth has come to be in its present form. We see life as we know it slowly fade as the authors take us into their vision of the abysmal future that awaits our gentle planet and all its inhabitants. With the past, present and future looking so grim, one is entranced by the words of these men.The authors discuss the evolution of life on earth throughout the evolving environmental, geological and astrophysical conditions. Then project further in time, using these theoretical conditions, into the distant future. From climate changes and ice ages all the way up to the sun's eventual growth into what is known as a \\"White Dwarf.\\" They discuss the theoretical effects on all forms of life in the earth's biosphere and on the earth itself. They do not really get into humanity's involvement. Humans have the ability to modify their environment for the better or for the worse. Based on the advances in science and technology over the past few hundred years, one could expect these advances to continue to grow well into the next few centuries. Humans may be able to prevent, if not delay, at least some of the abysmal consequences. The ultimate fate of humanity, as portrayed by the authors, does indeed look rather bleak; but time will tell how well we humans make out in the end.I enjoyed being put in the moment that Ward and Brownlee were describing. I also enjoyed their take no heckling attitude, especially because I believe much more in scientific evidence than faith in something more powerful. The Authors' sense of perspective and their cynicism towards those who don't fully believe in the scientific evidence provide in their book allowed me a genuinely entertaining reading experience."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"I have very mixed emotions about this book. Peter Ward, professor of geological science at the University of Washington, and Donald Brownlee, professor of astronomy, also at the University of Washington, here present a gripping and disturbing scenario of the Earth's natural history, and its future as a mirror-image of its past. All other things being equal, this should have been an enthralling work, one I'd have been more than happy to acquire for my personal library in spite of a very restricted book-buying budget.Two things kept me from doing so: a number of scientific errors which neither of the authors had any right to make in the first place; and much more numerous problems with syntatctical errors, from grammatical errors and dropped-stitch omissions of prepositions and so forth to stylistic errors and clumsy sentence constructions.As an example of the first -- there are several such, but this one was even more egregious, given that Donald Brownless is an astronomer and should know better -- on p. 133, it is asserted that the frequency of Mars oppositions, times when Earth is on a line determined by Mars and the Sun, when Mars is closer to us than at any other times in its biennial revolution around the Sun, is 18 months. In fact, Mars oppositions occur at intervals of some 26 months -- two years and two months. Greatest elongations of Venus, on the other hand, when Venus is at her farthest point east in the sky from the Sun, occur at intervals of about 18 months. In essence, the authors have here switched the orbit of the God of War with that of the God of Love -- a boner that no astronomer should have made.Then there are the syntactical problems. Again, I will give just one example. Occuring on p. 138, it is as follows: \\"When global surface temperatures reach the disastrous 60 degrees C that will end most animal life [on Earth], the water vapor concentration in the troposphere will be 20 percent and the planet's 'cold trap' will essentially cease effectively to keep the oceans from streaming into space.\\" Why not simply say, for that last phrase \\"will effectively cease to keep the oceans . . .\\"? The original uses too many words to present the idea, creating confusion rather than facilitating communication -- and communication between author and reader is, after all, what writing is all about.There is a host of similar problems throughout this work. Perhaps the book was rushed into print so quickly that there was not enough time to thoroughly proofread it. I hope that was the case -- the disturbing alternative is that the authors don't know how either to write or proofread properly, and perhaps aren't as proficient in their respective sciences as they should be. I don't think that is the case; Peter Ward has written several books which were well-written as well as knowledgeable, and I would imagine the same is true of Donald Brownless.I hope the authors bring out a second edition of this work, thoroughly proofread, with all errors eliminated. It would be a very valuable addition to anyone's personal science library, and the jewels of scientific thought it presents to the reader even now would at last have a setting worthy of them."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"Wow, talk about depressing, although I don't know why it should be. Anyone who studies earth history with anything like a rational scientific interest knows that the planet will eventually cease to exist. Most of us don't plan on being here when it does. In fact, those of us with a background in paleontology might be willing to lay odds on whether the human race will survive to anything like a time \\"close\\" to the final days.Basically the authors-and probably mostly Peter Ward-have given the last hours of planet earth the aura of a human death. In fact, Ward compares it graphically to the death of his own elderly mother, a gradual failure of all systems. While I found this very depressing, I found the concept of reverse evolution-if one can say that there is a \\"progress\\" to evolution-back to its beginnings an intriguing one; much like the \\"big bounce\\" concept in cosmology. In looking at the probable decline of our sun and of the living conditions of the planet because of it, one should find it unsurprising that life will evolve to simpler forms as a matter of entrenchment. With respect to the other possible ends to life on the planet, the death by fire in the form of asteroid impact has been done to death by the media over the past decade, while recently death by ice in the form of renewed glaciation is now gaining its fair share of film time.In many respects the book is a continuation of Ward and Brownlee's earlier collaboration for Rare Earth, and repeats the assessment of what conditions favor life in general and intelligent life in particular. In both books the Drake equation is studied in detail with less of a rose tinted perspective. Basically The Life and Death of Planet Earth, like Rare Earth, points out the possibility that life at its most basic might be common enough in the cosmos but that what we see around us now on planet earth might not be. In short, once gone the magnificent experiement might truely be over.Interesting follow up to Rare Earth."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"This is THE perfect book for those that hate SUV's, dispise Republicans, love political correctness, and don't care about accuracy. If inaccuracies and blatant science nonsense offend you, this book will offend you."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"This is another tiresome cavalcade of misinterpretations and phony data. There's no global warming going on, other than the results of our sole source of heat -- the Sun with its variable output. There's no gradualist mechanism which can produce miles deep glaciers in areas where summers climb to 70 degrees, leave alone 80 or 90 degrees. In order to produce ice of that depth, excessive heat in a short (months, weeks, days) timeframe is needed to create water vapor sufficient to cause such levels of precipitation.Photosynthesis isn't a necessity of life. In fact, due to the greater complexity of plants at the cellular level, it's unlikely that plants existed before animals. Chemical processes other than photosynthesis go on today, and its ridiculously unlikely (from a Darwinian, materialist, reductionist perspective) that it didn't go on in the past.Louis Frank et al have shown that small comets arriving round the clock delivered enough water to fill our seas to their current depth during the estimated lifetime of the Earth. Considering that bombardments must have been more common at one time, there's no reason to believe that Earth's conditions don't change due to short term (though rare or unique) natural events.Considering that there's no evidence that sealevels were once much higher than they are now, and that the Antarctic ice is less than three million years old, there is simply no way for the Earth to have maintained any kind of conditions for very long periods. Earth is not Mars, nor is it Venus. After producing another monumental house of cards in _Rare Earth_, one would think that the authors would at least stick to the premise that Earth's conditions are unique."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"Truth be told, I'm quite familiar with the scenario of the Earth's future obliteration due to the inexorable process of entropy, on the planet and in the Sun itself. Nevertheless, the book greatly expanded on this knowledge, highlighting the latest discoveries and theory, and all the while presenting them in a wonderfully readable, engaging style.There are a few forgettable typos and inaccuracies, at least in the text I read, but they are not at all distracting from the overall theme of the book: that the Earth, and particularly its biosphere is doomed to regress to primitivism before its final annihilation, in a sort of reverse parody of life's advancement thus far. If there is one detail that prevents it from getting five stars, it's the chapter on asteroid impacts and gamma ray bursts. Though interesting, asteroid impacts have been covered thoroughly by numerous other works, while the possible role of GRBs in mass extinctions is too hypothetical to be very useful, IMO. In short, I felt this chapter interrupted the flow of the book and distracted it from the theme; that's just my opinion though, and I could be wrong.All in all though, this is a great book that I highly recommend, especially to neophytes to the topic.P.S.--Though I haven't read Rare Earth yet, from what I know of it I definitely agree with the authors: This book is really a companion to Rare Earth, and both should probably be read together as a set."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"Just got done reading Rare Earth ( 5 stars see my review) by the same authors. Peter Ward is a Paleontologist and Donald Brownlee is an Astronomer. Together they use their collective expertise to create 2 great books. Both books read well, have no boring parts and are page burners. The reader wants to learn more. Read both books in two days each.We see in The Life and Death of Planet Earth the different past ages and how long it took for primitive one cell life to evolve and then the great difficulty for planets and animals to evolve and last man. We see how fragile the planet is and the past extinctions where up to 90% of life at that time became extinct. We see ice ages and glaciers cooling the earth and greenhouse gases from Vulcanism and Plate Tectonics to keep earth warmer. We see a series of warming and cooling with different plants and animal becoming extinct. Later we see the loss of CO2 in the atmosphere, death of plants and animals. Finally only bacteria and single cell organisms left. We see the loss of the oceans until finally the earth is so hot all life perishes. Much later the sun expands into a red giant and swallows and destroys the Earth. Peter shows us the different cycles the earth has...CO2, water, Continent development and weathering and how each contribute to keep earth's climate in a range for liquid water to exist and plants and animals to survive.Lots more!Donald shows use the death of stars, our sun becoming a red giant and swallowing up most of the inner planets including Earth, super novas, gamma ray bursts and more. Lots of ways our fragile Earth can be destroyed.Later the authors tell us different ways we might try to escape Earth's final destruction. One go to Mars and terraform it. Two, move the Earth by deflecting comets and using their gravitational assist to move the Earth into Mar's orbit but first moving Mars out of the way. Seems far fetched to me. Then seeding different far away planets with our DNA and lastly the difficulty in stellar rocket travel.I liked the part where we are told yes the world will end just like every human being. Enjoy, protect and cherish the planet while we can. A very interesting book, on a fascinating subject with input from a paleontologist and an astronomer. 5 stars and recommended."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"Although this book has been billed as a sequel to \`Rare Earth', it nicely summarizes the information in that book before delving into its distant future prognostications. It is probably best read first as an overview. Like \`Rare Earth', it inspires the reader with awe for how many things had to go right for us to exist as well as a humbling sense of perspective on the human experience. Also like \`Rare Earth', the book suffers from a lack of imagination in places, particularly an underestimation of the ingenuity of organic evolution given the timescales involved (in their defence, this is a problem for anyone bold enough to extrapolate so far from the present and they confess as much).I do agree with their assessment that the human species (assuming we survive even that long) is unlikely to escape the coming solar inferno given the physical barriers to interstellar travel and the unlikelihood of stumbling across another planet suitable for long term habitation. We were forged by the earth and we will share in its fate. One cannot come away from this book without gaining a deeper reverence for our celestial home. Staring into the abyss isn't for everyone, but I find it makes me all the more appreciative of the time that we have. This book succeeds on that level."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"Obviously this book is fairly short and not completely comprehensive. When I first took a look at it I was skeptical. However, it turns out this is a real gem if you like to think about big issues. This book basically covers what will happen to the earth as a planet over the rest of its lifetime, often using examples from earth's past as evidence for what could happen in the future. Of course as the authors admit, a lot of this is guesswork, but the point of the book isn't to give an accurate prediction of exactly when, hundreds of millions of years from now, life will die off. With that in mind, you will really enjoy this book. It is full off all kinds of little tidbits of information to think about and ideas that will almost certainly make you say, \\"I never knew that\\" or \\"I never thought about it like that before.\\" This book really isn't about global warming or any other environmental issue. A few oblique comments are made regarding climate and environment, but that's not at all the point of this book. However, if you are one of those people who think about past conditions when considering current climate discussions, this book may have some answers or perspectives for you. Anyway, among other things, the authors of this book discuss when they think the planet may get to the point of not being able to sustain different kinds of life, when the oceans might dissappear, when the sun may expand and what it will mean, what prospects life or a heritage of life might have of escaping all this and so on. I think one of the most suprising assertions for me was the idea that life on earth may be closer to the end than the beginning in terms of geological time.

Geology is a subject which has the capacity to incorporate just about any other branch of science - in an historical sense, and this is what Ward and Brownlee have set out to do! And the result is a fascinating example living up to Hutton's assessment, \\"The past is the key to the present\\" - and the future!Combining their astrobiological and geological backgrounds enables Ward and Brownlee to examine recent research in both their disciplines to present a rather complete picture of how our planet evolved, and how it may end. For any geologist with an interest in SF, there may be very little new here. The only thing I was vaguely disappointed about was they didn't mention the role Antarctica plays in our current climate, preferring to attribute it all to the formation of the Himalayas. If there is anything that can be guaranteed in geology, it is that there is not one process acting at any one time causing things!But that aside, I think the authors shone brilliantly at describing everything in a way which easily conjures up the imagery in your mind without being too verbose. Sometimes they use anologies, but most of the time, they used facts - and current facts as well! Kudos as well for looking into space for some speculation on what will happen to our planet - and galaxy - and how it impacts on life.(Would have liked to have had mention of our solar system bobbing up and down through the galactic plane and ice age/asteroid impact through time, but alas...)I think the book only fell down towards the end there where they got a little bit waffly and little bit negative. Sure, they say, we are scientists and it is us who are reasonable and logical while Science Fiction is for the unrealistic, but... I still think humans have a long way to go with science and who knows what new twists in physics we'll unearth. Afterall, at one time, black holes didn't exits, then when they were proven to exist, nothing escaped their gravity well, and then even that got recently recanted. Just like in geology there are many process which result in an outcome, there are undoubtedly many more refinements to the laws of physics waiting to be discovered. At least the authors put forward some good ideas, even if they tended to rubbish them...Overall though, a very interesting book; it paints a decent 'unifying' picture for those with an earth science interest, and it is simply fascinating and very understandable for those who are simply interested in science!"},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"The ideas exposed in this book may not be shared by all astrobiologists/scientists however I find its Earth systems approach highly valuable, taking the reader through the thinking process behind most current astrobiological hypothesis on the evolution of a habitable planet.

In particular, I am fascinated by evolution, cosmology and astronomy. That's what makes this book so compelling. Few authors have been able to match such good writing with such compelling subject matter (Timothy Ferris has; notably, Stephen Hawking has not).Yes, there are some editing errors, but they do not detract in any substantive way from the book.The reviewer who indicated the authors were writing some political tome aimed at the global warming denialists, Republicans, etc. has obviously not read the book. If anything, Ward and Brownlee tend to skim over the short-term impact of human-introduced greenhouse gases. In fact, the book's sweeping timescale largely subsumes that issue. Where it is discussed, it is done so in an even-handed way. I do wish they would have added a chapter to hit harder the short-term consequences of human activity on the environment - not because I have a political agenda, but because I have an interest in the science of it.Those minor criticisms aside, with Rare Earth, and now with this book, Ward and Brownlee have made major contributions to the public's understanding of their respective disciplines.In short, I would say Life and Death and Rare Earth are two of the most influential books I have read in recent years."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"Maybe enjoyable is a strange word to use when the book's subject is the end of all life and of our pretty blue planet but the book was easy to read as it charted its way to the hypothetical end. The author mixed information with description and I was drawn in as a spectator through the narrative as the earth was formed and became habitable.Chapter by chapter the earth came to resemble the planet I know, then continued to change until I saw the final bleak lifeless landscape waiting to be vaporized by the Sun's final burnout.The subject, coined astrobiology, is the study of a planet's life cycle, from birth to death, the conditions each stage offers and the kind of life it is likely to support. The duration of the phase of planetary life supportive of human-type life is a relatively short part of the whole, and may be already on the decline. But that is geologic time, our great grandchildren are unlikely to be affected.The author's freely offer that this is a baby science and the theories are likely to be challenged and overturned as it becomes recognized.

Compared to 'Rare Earth' the writing is more general in nature, almost as if the book were written very quickly. I wanted the english measurements vs the metric ones being the layman that I am which I on occasion got but I'm too lazy to make conversions. ie: -65 degrees celsius is the temperature of the stratosphere when it begins but -65 degrees celsius has no meaning to me. I want to know the fahrenheit degrees and since I'm lazy, I still haven't done the conversion because I'm not a college student. Comparing the death of planet earth to Peter's dying grandmother was very sad and a little creepy. The anology may turn out to be right on the money but writing about it even now I'm feeling creeped out. There are a good number of ideas presented but not in any real detail. An example would be the intriguing notion of when plate tectonics might end due to a slowing of upwardly rising heat. A little more background would have been appreciated because the idea is so interesting but these are the kind of things that happen when you're writing to a strict deadline.

Some patterns are weird, some beautiful. Think of watching one for an hour, with that hour symbolizing the 4.5 billion year history of our earth. On this kaleidoscope-clock, the dinosaursvanished 50 seconds ago; and intelligent human life -- homo sapiens, which began about 100,000 years ago -- is a one-tenthof a second click of that kaleidoscopic clock.On this basis, all 5,000 years of human history is a one two-hundred-and-fiftieth second of this kaleidoscope of time. That's less than the shutter click of most cameras. In comparison, dinosaurs lived for about one minute, 40 seconds. Hopefully, this sets the age of the earth in perspective.Despite global warming, which may stall the inevitable, Ward and Brownlee suggest the normal conditions for the past and next 2.5 million years is what we call the Ice Ages. They contend the return of the Ice Age \\"will effectively end the world as weknow it -- and potentially end human civilization as well.\\"Interesting, if true.They paint a grim picture of the future within the next few thousand years. They have gathered a mass of sophisticated data to support their premise, and come up with \\"phlogiston\\" theory of the fate of the Earth. For those who don't remember, whenphlogiston was added to an ore it produced a metal, and when taken away the result was an oxide. It was a nice simple wayto explain dozens of puzzles. Before that, of course, fire contained a mysterious property which passed through solid materials to change the properties of a metal.My point is not that Ward and Brownlee are wrong. They offer a fascinating view of a fascinating, they would say grim, futurewithin a few thousand years. My point is that humans have an increasing capacity for intelligence, and during the next fewthousand years our science of today will come to be seen as outdated as the phlogiston of 250 years ago.It's what makes their book so fascinating, and relevant. Let's assume everything they write about comes true. The challengethen is how do we live in dramatically different conditions. They offer the elements of a fascinating mystery, which is anintriguing look into the potential future of the Earth; like any good who-done-it, readers are left to devise their own scenario for how people of the future will cope.Much of the book seems predicated on the \\"chaos\\" theory, in which a butterfly flaps its wings in Rio de Janeiro and sets aircurrents in motion which eventually build up into a hurricane which devastates the coast of Florida. Okay. That happens. Butthere are millions of butterflies in Brazil, and we don't get millions of hurricanes every year. There are literally a million other scenarios, and I suspect Ward and Brownlee offer the worst-case one.Well, as anyone who lives in Florida knows, you can't rule out hurricanes. But, intelligent construction and other measures canvastly reduce the real damage of a hurricane. Or you can choose to live elsewhere. That is the value of intelligence. Granted,future humans may choose to do as modern Floridians and take a chance the hurricanes will pass by elsewhere.Intelligence is difficult to assess. President John F. Kennedy committed the United States to spending $100 billion (in today'sdollars) on the Apollo Moon program. President George Bush is spending as much or more on the invasion and occupation ofIraq. The debate has barely begun on which is more beneficial to America.Even at that, today's \\"least intelligent solution\\" is immensely more intelligent than answers of a thousand years ago. In general, people have gotten pretty smart during the past few thousand years.This book is a fascinating tour-de-force of the potential disasters facing life in our spot in the universe. Given enough time, the disaster scenarios will eventually come true. It reminds me of the cartoon of the physicist, standing in front of a mass of blackboards filled with abstruse equations and one final notation \\"Then a miracle occurs\\" which resolves it all.Well, to me, the intelligence of life today is pretty much of a miracle. What if the first prokaryotes, the very first bacterial life on Earth some some 3.8 billion years ago, had read this book and decided that life and intelligence was a dead-end. Fortunatelythey didn't, and so Ward and Brownlee and all the rest of us are here today and we've made our Earth into a pretty interestingplace.Should we quit now? Will the next 3.8 billion years be any duller?

The second book is 2005's Life As We Do Not Know It: The NASA Search For (And Synthesis Of) Alien Life.On the positive side, both books are better works than Gorgon. On the negative side, neither are, in any way, shape nor form, first class books of science, although both books fail for different reasons. That stated, let me just comment on a problem many science books have, and that is their lengthy subtitles. Most are simply pretentious, and as is the case with the second book, was the parenthetical really necessary, especially considering that NASA's search for alien life really has little to do with ward's book, which is more or less Ward's own pat on the back for believing he has come up with new ideas and classifications for life on earth, even though he has not, to this time, offered his \`research' up to peer review; instead trying to gain public acclamation for his ideas, so many of which are retreads from not only earlier speculations by scientists, but from science fiction writers as early as the 1930s. This seems to be a recurring problem in Ward's books- his own overweening belief in his scientific knowledge, and a narcissism devoted to his own existence above the science he examines.Fortunately, while that infects a good deal of Life As We Do Not Know It, it is far less recurrent in his co-authored text, The Life And Death Of Planet Earth. Still, even that book has some manifest flaws. Chief among them is the reliance on one of the oldest logical fallacies- that being the Fallacy of Uninterrupted Trends. While this may be a necessity for science fiction, for science fact, it's inexcusable. The idea behind Ward's and Brownlee's book is that life on earth- at least complex life, has only a few hundred million years to go, at best, before the earth slowly reverts, over the next five to seven billion years, to former states it had during its infancy, with bacterial life being the last thing remaining, as the sun becomes a red giant and burns earth to a cinder. In short, while the physical mass of the planet is still less than half its eventual age, life as we know it is in senescenceThese predictions are based upon supposed \`known facts,' which they see as rising levels of certain gases in the earth's atmosphere, and an increase in the brightness of the sun. Yet, the patterns of star development are still in their infancy, and life, more complex than it was in the past (although the duo gives some arguments against that- complexity in terms of diversity vs. in terms of individuals and species), also seems to exhibit a greater stranglehold over the biosphere than was previously thought. By its nature, evolution is unpredictable, so how future life might evolve- especially if aided by our superhuman descendents, to cope with such changes is a crapshoot, at best. In short, the arguments used by Ward and Brownlee are akin to reading an ancient text claiming that the moon will never be reached."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Planet Earth : How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World","review":"I was disappointed.

The author gives both sides of the story although in the end it's apparent he is biased in favor of a name change. Now that I've read the book, I wholeheartedly agree."},{"Title":"Redskins: Racial Slur or Symbol of Success","review":"Dr. Stapleton has tackled an extremely unpopular subject, more so now that Washington is basking in the glow of its new and dynamic coach Steve Spurrier. The problem is that no matter who coaches this team, and no matter who plays on the team, its name is still a horrible racial slur. The name has been around so long, and has been seen so many times in headlines and heard on so many sportscast, that it is difficult to realize that the name is indeed a despicable insult to an entire race of people."},{"Title":"Redskins: Racial Slur or Symbol of Success","review":"This monograph should be accepted as the definitive source for readers interested in obtaining a full and balanced analysis of a single question: is the term 'redskin' in common usage a racial slur, or is it something else? The question is considered here in semantic and cultural terms. The author provides a thoughtful guide to the informed usage of this term for persons who want to avoid its careless use in speech and in print. For if you use a word, or hear it, over and over and over, then take the trouble to know what it means."},{"Title":"Redskins: Racial Slur or Symbol of Success","review":"The author purports to be objective, but one only needs to read about five pages to see that he is just another one of the wild-eyed political correctness whiners out to censor speech that they don't like. The author largely just rehashes the tired old arguments made by the political correctness lobbyists seeking to force pro teams like the Washington Redskins not to use Native American-related names. But this guy, obviously seeking a new twist to justify publishing his book, also attacks the team's logo because it contains feathers, which he assumes are Eagle feathers. This, he claims, is a sacrilege. (One wonders why he didn't also attack the name of the Philadelphia Eagles on this rationale, but thank God for small favors). The Redskins owner has said numerous times that the name will not change because it was intended as an honor (how many sports franchises do you know that choose a nickname seeking to reflect dishonor on the team?). Even the author concedes that most people, including many Native Americans, could care less about these nicknames, or the logo for that matter. So why the fuss? What we have here, pure and simple, is a small group of p.c. activists seeking, for their own purposes (fundraising perhaps?) to impose their narrow views of right and wrong upon the overwhelming majority. Sorry, Mr. Stapleton, but the good old USA doesn't work that way. Your book is wrongheaded, superfluous and just plain inane. But aside from the content, the book contains numerous typos and obvious errors. Just one example, the book quotes NBA hall of famer Wes Unseld on the subject of a nickname change by his &quot;alma mater,&quot; the University of Miami of Ohio. Well, that's nice, but Wes Unseld didn't attend the University of Miami of Ohio, he attended Louisville. And I seriously doubt he ever commented on the nickname of the University of Miami's sports teams. All in all, this book is a disaster. A &quot;1&quot; rating is really too generous."},{"Title":"Redskins: Racial Slur or Symbol of Success","review":"This book is laughable and will only be appreciated by the most far out political correctness wackos, i.e, the type who refer to a \\"manhole\\" as a \\"personhole\\"."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Tai Chi Circle: Journey to Enlightenment","review":"I read this book without any prior knowledge of Tai Chi, and enjoyed every word of it.

No one can afford NOT to read this book; it's subject matter is too important. After you read this book you'll appreciate why we have it so great in America, because America has actually applied the political ideals that other countries only talk about. In CLASSICS you are able to read the most famous works of the world's most famous philosophers; a word about each is due: Plato, the Father of Philosophy, the Jewel in the Crown, still my very favorite philosopher. Learn that doing right is the path to happiness. Learn about justice, moderation, courage, and wisdom; Aristotle: learn about the importance of moderation in everything, and the importance of establishing, and preserving, a middle class; Epicurus: no comment; Epictetus: the father of Stoicism, a great philosophy for ignoring the world but if you live by this philosophy, don't be surprised if you wake up one day completely disenfranchised!; Augustine: no comment; Machiavelli: always a pleasure to read; learn how the world really is, as opposed to the way we'd like it to be; Hobbes: this guy must have been paid by the word, because he took several hundred pages to say what could have been surmised in one sentence: man is always at war. Locke: a brilliant discussion of the origin of property-a must read!; Hume: not very impressive; Rousseau: excellent; shows that civilization, rather than being the solution, may actually be the problem!; Kant: difficult to comprehend; Mill: excellent insights on liberty; I personally think Thomas Paine did a better job discussing liberty; Marx: hard to believe that people bought the Manifesto, but desperate times called for desperate measures; you can't leave people scrapping for crumbs and expect to reign for long; &quot;On the Jewish Question&quot; is an excellent essay on the importance of having a wall of separation between church and state; Nietzsche: understand why Hitler employed his philosophy so effectively to burn books, and then to burn people. Learn that living is appropriating, and understand the difference between slave morality and master morality.

As a wannabe who has fantasized for years about becoming an artist (and famous), Paul's book grounded me in the reality of how most artist's lives must be. Everything he said was logical and real, and made me consider just what it takes to be a truly successful artist. Do I think I have these qualities within myself? I don't know. But I do think that Paul hits on the essence of what constitutes the needs of the artist within.I could relate to many of his personal experiences, and found myself nodding in agreement to the words of a fellow traveller. Paul writes in first person, directly addressing the reader, much in the manner of a Salinger or Brautigan. His easy style is a joy. I look forward to many great fiction works from the writer of this important non-fiction work. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a struggling artist within."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"I was delighted to read Living the Artist's Life because I was stunned, as a parent, to attend our son's graduation from art school and to see all those, well, &quot;different&quot; people.

And what a joy to discover our artist is not all that different after all! He's just very talented and creative. It's a fascinating book, and I was thrilled to think Paul Dorrell &quot;made it&quot; with his dream too, after all that hard, hard work!"},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"\\"Living the Artist's Life\\" is a compassionate and honest handbook for artists. Dorrell's descriptions of his attempts to sell art to restaurant browsers in his first gallery were hilarious. I've been there, and the fact that he was able to get past these frustrations and create success for his artists gives us all hope. Simply reading in print that what visual artists do is as important as what a teacher or doctor does is the kind of encouragement we all need to keep going, and the kind of encouragement we get very little of in America. He addresses many aspects of creative work that other such books don't, and the practical tips - considering the source, are invaluable."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"What a great, refreshing book! This is the voice of an untypical art dealer/novelist who not only has paid many dues, but who knows that we all pay them at varying levels throughout our lives. That is an essential part of an artist's development, though we don't often like to admit it. Dorrell confronts this issue, and many others, with head-on passion, and yet is encouraging about the challenge-which is wholly apart from his guidance about dealing with galleries, commissions, art snobs and the like. I feel fortunate that such an accomplished gallery owner shared his struggles so openly. It's apparent that he values artists far more than he does profit.I recommended the book to a friend in Santa Fe, who recommended it to her sister in LA. A worthwhile journey."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"I wish I had found this book when I was a student; it's profound in its basic approach. I now have a modest reputation as a painter, however, the preamble suggested in the book was not suggested when I was younger.

In an inviting colloquial style, Dorrell offers both practical advice on 'getting yourself out there' and provides an almost unimaginable personal testament to the unbeatable blend of heart and perseverance. He has a perspective as the prospective exhibitor that is no less empathetic toward the aspiring artist.

As an artist, prepare yourself for a welcome challenge . . . and an indelible change through this book."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"The most valuable information--by far--in this book comes in the form of frankness. Dorrell gives hard $$ numbers and percentages regarding sales, commissions, and other dealings. This, undoubtedly, will be eye-opening for some. I really enjoyed seeing this stuff in black-and-white. Yes, we hear numbers here and there, but it's still nice to see it in print and straight from someone in the business. His sections on statements and bios I found to be very weak. And some things (like \\"newsletters\\") seem to be an afterthought. But that's not what this book is for. It will 1) prove you're not alone in living the artist's life and 2) give you enormous respect for gallerists and the hardships that some of them endure for their art and their artists. It's a very easy read and you'll appreciate the candor of this Midwestern gallery dealer."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"I found this book very useful.

The author was quite bold and interesting with his answers and I had high hopes for the book.40 pages into Living The Artist's Life, I felt like I was living Paul Dorrell's life and it was not pleasant. While his prose is breezy, it is mostly lugubrious and occasionally manic.Dorrell's stories of depression and workaholism at the expense of his family (even going as far as to not reveal the troubled financial condition of the gallery to his wife while he slams back whiskey after a long day) are embarrassing. His editor should have pulled in the reins.Dorrell preaches against the use of alcohol and drugs in a manner reminiscent of a recent graduate of a 30-day rehab stint or the religiosity of somebody who wears their 12 Step program on their sleeve. This part served no practical purpose in the book and turned me off.As for the art advice, it was towards the end of the book and mostly boilerplate. Any experienced amateur artist or recent art school graduate would probably be better off with a book like \\"The Business Of Being An Artist\\" if they want to make the leap and to find a good CPA to talk to about business matters."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"I found the author to be self-serving in his writing. Nobody REALLY wants to hear about his boozing and depression.

He has empathy for the artist as he himself is a writer who knows full well the emotional toll of working for years unknown and in isolation. And he is open about the struggles he endured in starting an art gallery and keeping its doors open. Artists, who face a pack of their own challenges, need to become aware of the hurdles facing art dealers.The book contains useful, practical advice for the visual artist, but its greatest value is in how it humanizes the image of the art dealer. For so many younger artists the art dealer seems often an impossibly mysterious and difficult figure. Dorrell's book brings the artist reader a far more understandable picture. He writes a lively and insightful, often painfully funny tale.And he shares both the pleasures and the pain and vulnerability of those of living in the art world. I think any artist who reads the book will have a much easier time relating to the dealer as whole person. And as a partner in the delicate business of helping people become collectors of the arist's work. This is no small thing!

He doesn't dwell on the negative, but gives inspiration and great advice on how to be succesful as an artist."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"I found this book to be an enjoyable read. After reading many different marketing books in the past years, this one has a human aspect to it that others do not. It is an enjoyable read, with novel aspects. It gives insight into the author's personal story and a window into the gallery owner's issues. There is great advice and samples of the \\"how to's\\" of marketing an art career. It provides good ideas and examples for working a career that has no real rules to \\"making it\\". It acknowledges hard work and perseverence as a necessity to being \\"successful\\"."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"I have read this book twice and now use it as a research and reference guide. As an artist 'living the artist's life' this book has been a gold mine of information, dos and don'ts, and general reference for any artist out there trying to make a living from his/her craft. Paul Dorrell is a writer and gallery owner and his life's experiences and struggles are meshed into the life's of many artists.This book deserves the attention of all artists: writers, painters, performers who are all out there trying to make it. It was comforting on one hand to know there are many like myself taking the same directions, and yet a little scary to know others have gone the same paths as I have.Any artist full of doubts, depressions, rejections, and wondering where they go from here; read this book and use it as your daily bible. This is the greatist book I could ever read as an artist and an individual trying to succeed in the oh so diificult world of art."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"Good book - at its best where he narrates his own personal travails as a gallery owner, promoter of artists' work, and an aspiring writer - held my interest even though my own bent is more directed to the field of creative writing (though for myself I work - happily - in the world of financial services on Wall Street: got tired of the geography of my existence being defined by the distance from my hand to my mouth) and I would certainly recommend it to the attention of any one working in or attempting to break into the world of the visual arts. There are some very instructive chapters providing practical advice and encouragement on how to best to represent oneself in this world and words of advice on what to do/ what not to do. It took a couple of chapters for me to warm up to it but his narrative flows fairly smoothly thereafter and, as mentioned, engaged me most with his personal narrative. Strong recommendation to anybody interested in the visual arts, aspiring to work in that world or, for that matter, those already engaged in efforts to promote themselves and their work."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"Mr. Dorrell offers a personable, inspirational guide to personal success as an artist, using a self-deprecating, humorous, and sincere memoir of his own journey as an art dealer and writer. This book was insightful and truly conveyed the author's love for his work and his artistic clients, as well as his desire to assist aspiring artists."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"Dorrell's words come at a time when so many artists hunger for this type of direction and guidance. Never has an artist been so open and engaging with the reader with regards to the technical and personal requirements needed for today's artistic development. Paul Dorrell, fully qualified in his life long experiences, bears his soul and in doing so offers himself as a lantern for all aspiring artists. This book is a must read where artist professional practices are discussed, and for all artists and non-artists interested in an honestly reflective story about the validation for life."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"I thought this overview of the art scene to be very readable and, after ten years as a landscape painter, rang true from a business perspective. I enjoyed the author's philosophizing best but there are some practical tips as well. People who are accustomed to the political correctness and posturing of academia and the avant guard are going to find this book a little too frank for their tastes. Dorrell writes to the point and has a midwesterner's impatience for inauthenticity which will rub some the wrong way. I found the honesty refreshing.This book isn't really a how-to. It is more a biography of one man's navigation through the treacherous waters of the fine art business. I found it so fascinating I read it in two days."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"As an artist and former gallery owner, I recognised much in the candid and heart-rending story of Paul's rise in the art world. The good news is that this book has a happy ending, and the message of the book is that it is possible to make a career in the art world if you persevere. And grow some thick skin.I'm sure other artists will feel that this book was written for them, as I did. Paul's frankness regarding depression, rejection and despondance will sound familiar to a lot of artists. He offers no-nonsense advice on handling these all too common factors in the process of creation - like the friend who tells you to get up, dust yourself off and get back on the horse every time you fall off.Paul also offers sound advice on approaching galleries - which worked for me recently - and outlines basic contracts and agreements. He discusses some of the other business aspects of selling art which I think will be helpful and enlightening to both artists and gallery owners - such as insurance, promotion, and sales etc. He also gives examples of prices - very helpful information which most people are unwilling to talk about.I suspect I'll be reading this book again in a month, a year, and five years time. We all need a bit of practical advice in this difficult career (whether you choose it or it chooses you) and I highly recommend this book to any creative person, or spouse of creative person to help them understand the craziness that is the artists life."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"OK, I admit it; I thought my art would sell itself (I wish) but on the recommendation of a friend, I bought Living the Artist's Life by Paul Dorrell. It turned out to be a great blue print for those of us who know how to create art, but not not so much how to market our art. Not only is it full of truly useful information from a person who makes it his business to help artists succeed; it's also a fun and intellectual read. This digital age of social media continues to change the playing ground at a rapid pace. Paul's newly revised version builds on his first book and contains real stuff you need to keep current. My advice: go straight to the revised version. You'll be a step ahead, energized and ready to create more art."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"I Found the reading Extremely Insightful, Full of Looking at the Art world in the Facts of the Master's! Listening to Paul, Going almost around the entire world, to see Feel in-person the Different works of Art.

Last, I found the Struggles of Real Life that he Suffered Even to the point of the honesty was very welcome. seeing feeling all the trials more over his learning process, was in fact showed in me, that sometimes something else is at hand. Plus what is in our Sole's The love, from all sides! Opened my eye's into what has to be, even for the Masters! Very hard yet in the long run, So Filling! All I am able to say is Thank you!"},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"Wonderful book for not only artists but everyone who loves art.It was my number 1 book of the year!"},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"Our niece gave us this book because we are opening an art gallery and art agency business. The timing was perfect. The greatest fear in starting a new business is not knowing what questions to ask. Dorrell's book gave us a set of questions and suggested answers. Reading this book is like sitting in my favorite coffee house and listening to a cousin who has been there and wants to make sure we don't make the same mistakes. Because he is \\"family,\\" he is not afraid to share his mistakes, even the depression. I have read this book three times and have underlined, highlighted, folded corners of pages and written in the margins. These I have read more to focus on my own problems in starting my art agency. My wife is the artist and has also read this book on a much different level and marked more pages for us to share. When we first read the book, we had to read passages out loud that were so relevant to us that they jumped off the page. We have given this book to our friends and family (most not artists) so they can understand where we are now. What comes through in Dorrell's book is the hard work of art. Art is messy, solitary, unforgiving and misunderstood. Art is challenging, uplifting, educational, and rewarding. Artists, agents, and people who buy art need the ability understand both sides of art for a realistic appreciation of what is being looked at and (hopefully) bought. I recommend this book to all those who want to appreciate the creative process."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"Boy do I feel like a sucker, this is likely the most useless, \\"living the art life\\" type of book I have ever read. Mr. Dorrell uses this book mainly as a platform for his ego-rich, self serving anecdotes and know it all type of advise and opinions. Have you ever been to a party with one guy who just \\"knows\\" everything and can not wait for an opportunity to tell you his opinion on anything ... that is how this book reads. It was irritating to say the least. If you have any art degree or have been to art school or have ever done anything art related at all, you already know whatever practical advice you can squeeze out of this book.If you want good inspirational books on \\"living the artist life\\" pick up Art & Fear by David Bayles and Ted Orland (amazing book), The Shape of Content by Ben Shahn or The Art Spirit by Robert Henri. If you want to run an art business, it sounds cheesy but pick up How to Start a Home Based Crafts Business by Kenn Oberrecht, very practical and no-nonsense - not just for crafts."},{"Title":"Living the Artist's Life","review":"The writer is obviously in love with himself and his own writing. You slog through unending commentary about himself and generalizations about who and what artists are. Anyone who has been in this business for any length of time will recognize this guy has a lot to learn and little to offer.Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Adobe Indesign Cs2 Hands-on Training","review":"This book is a process oriented tutorial that teaches readers core principles, techniques, and tips in a hands-on training format. That's a lot of words. What it really means is that this book is aimed at the beginning to intermediate user and is intended to get him started with the 20% of the software that he will really use 80% of the time. It uses a combination of text with drawings of what the screen should look like, and even a few short QuickTime movies (on a CD-ROM that comes with the book) that show some processes that are difficult to explain with words and static pictures.The book does not require any previous experience with page layout programs. However, if you have experience with QuarkXPress or PageMaker, the first chapter talks about using your experience to give you a head start with InDesign.By chapter 2 you are looking at the pretty butterfly on the InDesign Welcome Screen and quickly moving on to the InDesign workspace. One problem beginners often have with InDesign is keeping track of all the palettes, toolboxes, and shortcuts. Chapter 2 also talks about these and helps you get the workspace set up the way it's comfortable for you.The subsequent chapters are about what you would expect, chapters on text, on bringing in graphics, on vector artwork. By the end of the book you'll know enough to use InDesign to product the documents you need. And you'll find it easier to read the manual to find out the more advanced features you will need from time to time."},{"Title":"Adobe Indesign Cs2 Hands-on Training","review":"I work for an architect firm in which we used the old Pagemaker for doing our marketing and proposals brochures. We upgraded to Indesign CS2. I have never had any formal training in using Pagemaker or any marketing software. I simply edited over previous brochures to launch my new projects. So I really felt overwhelmed when I first opened the software and didn't know where to begin. I went to a large book store and took off the shelf every training book I could find on learning InDesign CS2. There were a couple dozen books out there. I choose this book because I could relate to it. It explains very clearly everything you need to know to get started using it. It has pictures or diagrams on just about every page showing you exactly where to go and how to do what they are explaining. Then you are directed to a practice exercise or video (on the training disk which comes with the book) to reinforce what you have learned. In my opinion if you are \\"green\\" to this software this is the best book for the average lay person. I even tried taking an 8 week class on InDesign CS2 which used the Adobe \\"Classroom In A Book\\". I ended up dropping the class because I thought I could learn more efficiently on my own using this book. I can't tell you exactly why but I did not like Adobe's Classroom In a Book as well as Brian Wood's Hands-On Training."},{"Title":"Adobe Indesign Cs2 Hands-on Training","review":"If you are a new InDesign user and/or do not understand concepts like bleed & slug/kerning &leading;, then read Lynda.com's Hands On Training (HOT) first. Otherwise, you may want to consider Adobe's Classroom in a Book. HOT does a better job of covering the basics and the included videos are superb. But Classroom in a Book is also excellent and carries you a bit further than does HOT, particularly if you are producing a book with chapters.In addition to reading both of these texts, I went through the entire Total Training Video Workshop that ships with the CS2 and found it less useful than the books but still interesting and helpful. I also subscribed to Lynda.com's online video training (after watching all the free movies first) which may be the easiest way to pick up tips or understand something you can't quite qet. Neither of the two books (nor Adobe's own literature) were particularly useful at explaining the Bridge or Version Cue but videos on Lynda.com's website that helped me understand how to use them."},{"Title":"Adobe Indesign Cs2 Hands-on Training","review":"Having bought excellent training CDs from Lynda.com in the past, I was happy to see that the company expanded into book publishing with the InDesign CS2 book by Brian Wood.The book itself is very well written and thoughtfully organized, but another huge advantage is the inclusion of training videos and PDFs that go a long way in helping users get grounded in InDesign CS2.This book represents an excellent value. The inclusion of exercise files based on actual projects is a far superior way to learn the program than some of the basic, generic instruction found in \\"Visual Quickstart\\" books, although those books are reasonably priced and do convey a lot of information. I've bought and value those books.But Brian Wood's book is the state-of-the-art in InDesign instruction, a fitting companion to a phenomenal page design program. If you want to learn InDesign at a reasonable price, this is the only way to go."},{"Title":"Adobe Indesign Cs2 Hands-on Training","review":"This book is absolutely the best resource if you've never used InDesign. I spent 6 weeks in a course in which we were told to do things but never why or the alternatives. I wish I hadn't spent the time or the money of the course as the first 100 pages got my head wrapped around basic concepts the course was supposed to do. I should have realized when I was initially confused and not getting answers to turn to a product from lynda.com as the books and training are superior to anything on the market."},{"Title":"Adobe Indesign Cs2 Hands-on Training","review":"If you're serious about learning InDesign this is a good place to start. It has a nice blend of basic exercises, bonus exercises, demo movies, and printed information. If you are a hands-on type learner you will enjoy and benefit from Hand-On Training. This book is exactly what I was looking for - straight forward, enjoyable, and practical.Excellent!"},{"Title":"Adobe Indesign Cs2 Hands-on Training","review":"I'm with a non-profit organization, and I was selected to do the publicity for our regional conference in 2008. Needed to produce a few mailers and a program that would eventually be sent to a printshop. I didn't have a clue, as how do use Adobe Indesign.This book takes nothing for granted, and steps back to the beginner level, making it very easy to follow along during all the exercises. Includes book with lessons and CD with lesson exercises, plus how-to movies."},{"Title":"Adobe Indesign Cs2 Hands-on Training","review":"This book is phenomenal! After purchasing several different manuals covering the various main components of Adobe Creative Suite 2 (Illustrator CS2, InDesign CS2, Photoshop CS2 and GoLive CS2) I found myself wishing that Lynda.com published a Hands-On Training book for every component of CS2. The combination of Brian Wood's clear writing style and the included bonus exercises and demo movies made me feel like I had my own personal InDesign instructor right beside me. Everyone who wants to learn InDesign from the comfort of their own desk should have a copy of this book. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Adobe Indesign Cs2 Hands-on Training","review":"I am only on Chapter 4 of this book but have found so many things I love about it I wanted to write a review before I forget.1. I appreciate that the authors explain technical terms--he does not assume that the reader comes from a publishing background. For example, in describing the character formatting controls and functions (page 81) the author defines what they mean. \\"Kerning field: Adjusts the space between two letters\\" I cannot tell you how refreshing this is for someone lacking a publishing background. Most online help and manuals would often have something like \\"enables you to adjust the kerning\\".2. The book uses pictures appropriately to show key details to help you understand the task. I especially appreciated how he used pictures to demonstrate the effects of \\"fixed column width\\" versus no fixed column width.3. It's great having all of the sample files on the CD, including both the completed file and the start file. This makes it so much easier to understand what the end product is for the sample.4. The book is loaded with time-saving tips, such as how to quickly change the entire textbox font or other character properties and how to quickly select a sentence or paragraph.5. The author gives tips for how to undo or fix common mistakes and problems.I am learning using InDesign CS3 so there might be some features not covered in this book, but all of what I have done so far matches well with the book, so the basics do not seem to have changed."},{"Title":"Adobe Indesign Cs2 Hands-on Training","review":"Book and CD arrived in great time and in great condition.Thank you!"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"My mother had this book for one of her college courses while I was in junior high so I gave it a try and loved it. It came up as a recommendation for me on Amazon recently and I went to dig it out but couldn't find it so I ordered a new copy. I just finished it and ten years later it was even better than I remember (being that I'm that much older and that much wiser.) This book is a classic and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys an honest, gritty and above all, true story of growing up on the streets."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Me being a proud PuertoRican living in New York City, it's difficult living in the city with the everyday problems in the streets. This book relates to every Latino or African American growing up in the streets. The protagonist Piri is growing up in Spanish Harlem with his family. growing up in the His brother goes through everything with him. If you are ghetto streets of New York you know what is going on and what you've got to live with every day of your life. Piri Thomas lives his young life going through the mean streets of Spanish Harlem. He is a very creative character with knowledge about his streets and he makes positive decisions about the situations he runs into in his life.This book is very good for anyone to read and realize their life is not to be taken granted, especially if you're growing up in the ghetto of America. I recommend this book for everyone who hasn't read it yet to experience life in the ghetto and walk through Piri's shoes. This book is good. It is one of the best I have ever read and I was hooked on it once I realized that I could relate to it. I was in the mind zone of Piri and it was like I was feeling the streets at the moment and Piri's pain and his way of living and surviving because I know it's not easy growing up in the ghetto. ."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Piri Thomas is a great writer. From the First page this book had me hooked. His writing is so descriptive it was like watching a movie in my head....As he describes his early life and adolescents in the barrio you feels as thou your right there...He holds nothing back, the language is raw and he keeps it real.... I would definitly recommend this book......A++"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Very compelling. Piri Thomas does an excellent job in depicting the struggle of a black Puerto Rican in New York. Touching and Inspirational."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Book Review: Down These Mean StreetsWe recommend this book because Piri Thomas wrote the book in a way that you can visualize the story. This book is interesting because it talks about a young Latino's life growing up in the streets of Harlem New York in the 30's. However Piri the main character in the story gets discriminated throughout his young life for being a black Puerto Rican. We think this book has some strong scenes suitable for children under 13. Little by little the story gets interesting to the point where you don't want to stop reading. To conclude, this story is a good autobiography to learn from"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I remember reading this book for the first time in 1970. I was an eight grader at JHS 117 on 109th Street in East Harlem. Those were difficult times in El Barrio, especially for poor minority teenagers. Picking up this book up again and reading it was like experiencing it for the first time. You see it magnified once you have really lived life! There was so much that I really did not clearly understand as a 14-year-old as I do now. My heart mourns for all of our sisters and brothers who were lost in the struggle to grow and be what they could have become despite that terrible disease of man, Racism. Thank you Peri. I think that because of your book, you inspired many brothers and sisters to write about their experiences in New York as Puerto Ricans."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"TODAYS TROUBLED YOUTH CAN RELATE TO PIRI'S EXPERIENCE. I HAVE READ THIS TO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEY ARE AMAZED THAT IT WAS WRITTEN 30 YEARS AGO. A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO WORKS WITH TROUBLED TEENS."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I read this book about 28 years ago when I was in JHS in Brooklyn, NYC. I enjoyed reading this autobiography. I also went through racial problems too while growing up. I grew up with Puerto Rican's and my family is from South America. I can relate with Piri, because by me being hispanic & hanging with my PR peeps and my Afro-American peeps, I got jumped so many times by the Italians. I learned how to defend myself & fight. Piri's writing is hardcore & doesn't hold anything back. I couldn't put the book down, mind you, I didn't like to read as a kid but after I read this book, I was happy that I did read it & did my book report for school. I got an A+ I remember. The way Piri Thomas wrote his book; makes you feel like you are actually living it with him. There are many parts where I got emotional, sad, angry because I went through something similar in the late 70's. I have always wanted to meet Piri Thomas in person, and thank him for such a wonderful book he wrote and to tell him, I also, felt his pain and treat him to a good home cooked PR/Hispanic dinner. It's alright though because Mr. Piri Thomas, left an everlasting impression on me. I would recommend everyone to read this book regardless of any race or nationality. It was very well written and Piri expressed himself with true honesty. I love, love, love this book and I now want it on my mobile kindle now. Mr. Piri Thomas if you ever read this review, please, let it be known, that I am writing this with all my heart. Peace be with you & all.

Love it."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This book &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; by Piri Thomas is absouletly amazing. It depicts a emotional and physical journey through the eyes of a confused and curious Puert Rican American.Not only does the novel describe events and situations that any and all races can relate to but it reveals emotions that everyone is challeneged with throughout there life. I felt that I was experiencing the same emotions as Piri and having this kind of connection with an author definetly defines a well-written book. I am certain that anyone will enjoy this book and maybe learn from it just like I have.Thanks Alot to Piri for having written an excellent book and for having the courage to allow many readers to enter another world."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK I DONT HAVE TOO MUCH TIME TO READ BUT WHEN I STARTED READING THIS BOOK I MADE TIME."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Priri Thomas didn't have a lot going for him. He lived in East Harlem, a rough neighborhood even in the 1930's. His color barred him from well-paid jobs. His African roots made him unwanted by his Cuban and Puerto Rican relatives. Lastly, his father was a brute.The book begins with Piri running out of the house because he's angry. Angry at his father for hitting him. Angry that his father hit him kust for spilling something. Angry that his father is always hitting him. But soon he's scared; the streets are dark, the streets are cold, he's hungry, and like any little kid, he really just wants to be home with people that love him.Bill Cosby once said that in his day, you couldn't skip school because \\"there was an eye behind every drawn curtain.\\" But even in his day, some parents abused and neglected their children. Those were the children that skipped school, lived on the streets, and joined gangs as a substitute for family.It's like my grandfather used to, there never were any \\"good old days.\\""},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Down These Mean Streets is the story of Piri Thomas' journey into adulthood. The book is set in Spanish Harlem in the 1940s. The author's writing style is refreshing and lyrical. He uses some Spanish words here and there(readers might find the glossary in the back of the book helpful), and kicks in a few slang words as well, which makes the dialogs that much more genuine.Piri struggles through poverty, family troubles, and desperately wanting to belong. He fights with being a dark skinned Puerto Rican during a time when racism was strong, and trying to find his place as neither black nor white. Piri did some not-so-good things in his life, being in a gang, drug addiction, and armed robbery among other things, but throughout it all it is easy to tell that Piri is a good guy at heart.Overall, this is a captivating story. You might find yourself wondering what you would have done faced with the same situations. I even found myself rooting for Piri at times. This book is still a very accurate depiction of \\"the hoods\\" of New York, despite being published for the first time about 40 years ago.I was sad to have to finish the book, and in the end I felt like I knew Piri. I look forward to re-reading this book over the years. It is truly a classic. Everyone should read it. Anyone can find something in the story that they will be able to relate to."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I've read this book more than a few times and have taught it to different level readers a few extra times. There was one high school student who came to me after the book was done and told me, \\"This is the first book I ever finished.\\" Even if it's not the first book you've read, you'll find writing that is fearless, honest, and powerful.

The teacher handed out a booklet of one of the chapters in this book. I thought that the chapter was absolutely funny, so I showed it to a couple of my friends. The chapter he handed out was called Alien Turf. I felt that there are sometimes in your life that you don't really fit in, and that there is always somebody that is going to give you a hard time. In this case Piri was the new kid on the block, and he was of a different race from everyone else. His family were the only Puerto Ricans that lived in an Italian neighborhood. He was picked on by a group of young Italians and in the end after the battle with these guys, they all became good friends in the end. After this chapter I had to read the book Down These Mean Streets.The book is outstanding. I have never read something that gives you so many emotions and vivid images in your head. He describes what he goes through in a completely understandable and detailed way. You are able to just picture it in you head, like a movie, or television show, or you even could feel it like something you've been through.I recommend this book for anyone who's not read it yet. This book is interesting. You could understand the way he details everything, and it's going to affect you in many different ways. (Emotionally and mentally)."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I was raised in New York and as I get older I love to read what people have written about their experiences living there.

The author grabs your attention immediately and never loses his readers through his excellent use of vivid imagery, Spanish vocabulary and phrases, profanity, and detailed emotional prose. One can easily get a mental picture of the action described in this book's pages.Down These Mean Streets tells the story of a dark-complected Puerto Rican/Cuban who is viewed by the outside world as Black, rather than Latino. Thomas is the target of racial hostility and bigotry throughout his young life, which fuels his internal rage and anger at the world. To make matters worse, Piri's father is a straight-up accomodationist who believes it honorable to cow-tow to white society - something that leads Piri to lose respect for his dad.I agree with a previous reviewer who said that this book has much in common with The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Having read both, I notice parallel's in Piri's and Malcolm's lives: both encountered harsh racial prejudice and discrimination early in life which lead them into criminal enterprise, both had life-altering experiences in prison, and both had serious questions about their personal identities due to their complexions.This is one of my favorite books I have ever read. It is a must read for anyone with an interest in Puerto Rican studies, racial/ethnic relations, or urban literature. I guarantee this book will keep you captivated. I hope one day soon they turn this classic book into a motion picture."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I think that this book should be required for all Puerto Rican people who live in New York. This book talks about what it was like to grow up in New York in the 1940s and 1950s. I think that this book does a good job explaining the experiences of a family. Also it talks about what Piri Thomas does and what kind of problems he is involved with, like drugs, in gangs, and that's very similar of what is going on now. I think people who don't want to be in a real trouble should read this book. I enjoyed the when Piri Thomas was sleeping out of his house because I imaging what can happen to me if I do the same things. This is the best book for anyone who is interested in learning about what is like for a Puerto Rican family to live in New York City."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I loved this book it was comforting and very honest 50 million thumbs up! if u liked this book you'll love always running!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This is a raw, no holds barred book written by a veteran of the street life. Drug dealing, hustling, pimping, robbing, criminal's pride, prison life, redemption--it's all here, but not in any sensationalized way--it's written from the heart by a man who offers no excuses for what he did but at the same time fully shows the allure that the thug life can have for impoverished communities. It is also a historically valuable document of the Puerto Rican community in New York during the 1950s and 60s, written by an insider. Insightful stuff, fully deserving of its reputation."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"If you liked the movie &quot;Basketball Diaries&quot; , or just enjoy well written biographies , written by genuine New Yorkers , this is it.

Down these Mean Streets is about the search for identity in Spanish Harlem. You will not put the book down till the end. Then you wont know whether to laugh or cry or both!"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"A brutally honest story that is hard to put down. My favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This is a sort of \\"autobiography\\" based on Piri Thomas' life in Spanish Harlem. Thomas, a Puerto Rican, becomes involved in drugs, crime, and violence -- then ending up in prison. The manner in which he describes the events make you feel as though you've been there. It's a really ugly scene, but it's told extremely well and will keep you reading. The writing is so candid it's refreshing."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"\\"Down These Mean Streets\\" gets you three books for the price of one.The first book is true to its title: a young man's coming of age along the dangerous byways of Spanish Harlem.Here we see the perils associated with traversing the concrete jungle, the need for toughness and concomitant death of tenderness in youth.Author Piri Thomas details what life was like for Puerto Ricans moving into what had been an Italian neighborhood and the Italians' response to their displacement.Thomas was born in the 1920s, so that the time covered here ranges from the '30s to, perhaps, the early '50s, rendering his once hip track of new-lit jargon and streetjabber something of a timepiece.Thomas' novel came out in 1967 and one can imagine the liberal chic set of Mayor John Lindsay's New York jumping like cats to nip at his rough-edged peek beneath the shiny Big Apple's skin.Although this kind of literature has become stock in the book trade (James Frey anyone?), Thomas' autobiographical recounting of life among the rough Puerto Rican boys on his street can still shock.His detached description of when the bored kids willingly go up to the apartment of some transvestites for homosexual interaction, pot, and booze, is rather striking and unsettling.The second \\"book\\" deals with young Piri's identity crisis. One which can be extended to all the Puerto Ricans of his time.highwayscribery is ignorant of what they are thinking today, but in Thomas's time, there was much ado over skin color, the islanders running from evening black to lily white as they do.Thomas' problem was that he was darker, while his brothers were white. As a Puerto Rican, he did not, at first, view himself as being in the same boat as the African-Americans with whom his people crowded Harlem.But when the family makes an escape to suburban Long Island, Piri comes in for a bit of a shock, and slinks back to \\"El Barrio\\" with a severe chip on his shoulder and a deeper sense of shared experience with the American Negro.This issue is aired-out in discussions with folks of different skin pigmentation, each of whom expresses a unique understanding of the related questions. For this reviewer, it went on a little too long, and seemed a little self-indulgent.Especially for a young man confronted with the serious matter of economic survival in a cruel and unforgiving city.Nonetheless, Thomas' youthful obsession generates an anger which serves as bridge to the third book, which is a jail tale.Identity issues unresolved, his skin color serving him poorly in prejudiced city, the young man goes on a crime spree, again remarkable for its matter-of-fact execution, which lands him in the state penitentiary.Perhaps it was novel at the time, but today his efforts to maintain a tough guy's rep -- primarily to avoid being sodomized by bigger, harder criminals (no pun intended) -- while rehabilitating himself with a little Nation of Islam cant and some in-house masonry training are now familiar fodder.Thomas' attempt to forge a street-seasoned prose is uneven. He never really finds a groove and seems almost relieved to let more articulate characters do some of the heavy lifting where the expression of complex ideas is involved.Nonetheless, he succeeds in engaging the reader, pulling of that time-tested trick of getting people to root for a guy doing bad things, by peeling back the hard layers and revealing a human and worthy heart."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This book was in perfect condition when I received it. My only issue with my purchase was when I received it. The only option for shipping when I ordered was standard shipping, not sure why?? Anyway it took about two weeks to get to me. All in all, it was worth the wait."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This was a required reading for a college class for grandson. Not the type of book he really enjoys reading on a regular day."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This is a hard book to figure. It's so simple and poorly written it would seem to be for slow readers or middle schoolers, yet the filthy language makes its questionable for unsophisticated readers.There is a huge problem with the narration. Mr. Thomas is writing 10 years after the story ends, when he is supposedly a changed and more educated man, but throughout the story reverts to his uneducated gangland Spanish, I guess to keep it real. Throughout, he is incredibly violent, thoughtless, race obsessed, and self absorbed. Yet he offers no apologies to the family members or innocent bystanders he's hurt. He refers to his illegitimate son, but never gets back to him. Ironically, his family tried to better the situation by moving out to Long Island, but he ran back the world of crime and poverty, supposedly because two white kids said something that hurt his feelings.Apparently in prison, and afterward, he dabbled in religion to help get himself straight, yet he makes no clear statement of what his new beliefs are. In one troubling scene he counsels with a black Muslim inmate who constantly refers to whites as devils. In the end, he does not convert to Islam, but seems to have no problem with this form of racism. The story ends with him tempted to share heroin with a junky and barely pulling himself away. This hardly shows him to be a changed man, and we have no idea what's happened since. He constantly refers to Trina, his love interest, but never gives us any feeling for what sets her apart. He mentions she's pretty, but he's apparently not motivated by lust, since he bangs other women throughout while saving her for marriage. Despite his constant mention of her, we really know nothing about her.In the afterword, written in 1997, 68 year Mr. Thomas seems to have learned nothing, blaming the problems of the inner city on racism and the Clinton era welfare reforms. Naturally, there's no mention of single parent families, welfare dependency, radical Islam, or the Balkanization of the American identity as having anything to do with the continued miseries. Guess he knows politically where his bread gets buttered.It's not a bad read, but it has no educational value and does not belong in a school curriculum."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I first heard this man, Mr. Piri Thomas, speak in the spring of 1993 at Cal State University at Hayward. I was so moved (as a high school student) that I had our school (California High School) invite him to speak at our &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; day on June 4th, 1993. I loved his poetic 'realness' - and it was the first time I felt really empowered as a person of color living in a largely suburban environment.His experience and insight was so raw and so 'real'. In this autobiography, Mr. Thomas addresses issues of racial identity (he was dark skinned, but his brother was lighter skinned/more white looking) and how racism affected him as a Puerto Recan. It describes him growing up in Spanish Harlem, NY, moving down the coast, meeting friends and some crazy situations. I remember him really hitting rock bottom, and then coming out in the end. I always looked forward to reading on.I read somewhere that R&amp;B singer Brian McKnight considers this his favorite book. That's when I knew I just wasn't being easily impressed. This is an excellent life story, well written, and a must read for anyone interested in the topic of racial identity. Yes, we are all individuals, but we should never deny our heritage...thank you Mr. Piri Thomas. I feel nothing but the deepest respect for you...thanks for your vision, insight and generosity.Knyte (Trust Me)P.S. If I could give more than five stars...I would"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"\\"Down These Mean Streets,\\" by Piri Thomas, tells a story of growing up as a dark-skinned Puerto Rican in New York City. First published in 1967, the book has been re-issued in a 30th anniversary edition with an afterword by the author.The book opens in 1941, with 12-year old Piri living in New York with his family. The narrative recounts his growth into manhood; we accompany Piri as he gets into fights, uses illegal drugs, becomes a violent criminal, spends time in prison, and experiences conflict within his own family.This is a raw, powerful book. Thomas has a vigorous, muscular prose style that incorporates many Spanish terms (readers may find the glossary at the end of the book useful). The book raises many questions about racial and ethnic identity as Piri has relationships with many different people of various colors and cultures. Thomas also explores the interconnections of race and religion, and vividly portrays the subculture of prison life.This is an essential book for anyone interested in the Puerto Rican experience on the U.S. mainland. The book has a lot in common with \\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X.\\" Also recommended as a companion text: Miguel Pinero's play \\"Short Eyes.\\""},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I read this wonderful book over 15 years ago. Although most of its details have faded with time, its impact has not. As a Puerto Rican male growing up in the Bronx, I could certainly relate to much of what Piri Thomas was describing. But &quot;Mean Streets&quot; is so powerful and gripping, that anyone who reads it will be moved and mesmorized. This is truly a modern-day classic that will surely withstand the test of time. Its lessons are appropriate for all youth everywhere and always."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This is a remarkable book. Mr.Thomas you did your thang! This is the first real grown- up book I read back in 1995. I was sooo open I wanted to know everything that happened next. Piri was Wild! And knowing that this is an autobiography it's even more exciting. I love the way he represented the areas I've lived in or even went to school in. Piri told life how it really was and how it took him to learn about it. Growing up in Spanish Harlem put me on to a lot of Hispanics denying their African culture. It's true how some parents like Piri had act the same way as they did.I had the pleasure of meeting Piri Thomas at my school in Spanish Harlem also it was remarkable to picture such a character then really see him face to face although he was much much older. But it was still amazing. This book is Raw and it an absolute page turner let me tell you from a young Black teenager in Harlem THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK, AN ABSOLUTE PAGE TURNER!"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This is one of the first books I read, and it was very moving, touching and powerful for me. Being Boricua (Puerto Rican), born and raised in NYC's El Barrio, myself, and coming up on the same streets Piri lived on and wrote about made this book that much more special and personal for me. I was virtually able to re-live Piri's life through his book and eyes, albiet 50+ years later.Piri's writing style is icy clear, lucid, and sometimes pretty raw. He writes so artfully that the entire book becomes like an epic saga, one powerful movie in your mind! It's a story of unvarnished reality. Piri pulls no punches. (I'm imagining you should probably be 15+ or so to read this.) You'll laugh, cry, get angry and go on a roller coaster of emotions with DTMS. I was so moved and touched by Piri's work, that I read all of his other books, and developed a new outlook and perspective on everything from writing, to self identity, and dignity (one of Piri's faves).Buy Down These Mean Streets, in English or Spanish (Por Estas Calles Bravas), and pass it on. (I GUARANTEE you'll love it!) Piri is one of our first...and one of our best! The man's been p'al carajo and back, and tells it all in his unique Boricua style (often imitated, never duplicated).I developed a lot of affection and love for Brother Piri, and was even fortunate enough to meet the Living Legend and have him over our home for an unforgettable dinner as our guest, where my entire familia, friends and neighbors (who I all got to read his books) all had the pleasure of meeting the larger than life Piri!Much love, and respect to Brother Piri and and all of you, mi gente! (...)"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"&quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; by Piri Thomas is a truly captivating book. Me myself being Black and Puerto Rican and growing up in New York, I was able to identify with so many of his feelings and the way he handled them. I felt as if I was right in the middle of the scene, sometimes wanting to comfort him in his shortcomings and to let him know he wasn't the only one confused on which role to play. This book was so good that I finished it in a time span of 3 days and will recommend it to anyone who's longing for knowledge of insight of a Black Puerto Rican or Latino growing up in NYC."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This has to be one of the most important books in Newyorican literature. Equally as beautifully written as, Esmeralda Santiago's \\"When I Was Puerto Rican\\". And Like Santiago's book, this one belongs in every Puerto Rican home. The book is powerful, raw, and holds nothing back. This is the autobiography of Piri Thomas, a Puerto Rican growing up in the harsh streets of Spanish Harlem. His harsh and troublesome relationship with his father. His early loss of his mother. Growing up with his friends in a gang, drugs, facing racism, incarceration, and at the end. Healing and growing.This book was given to me by a School Counselor in High School, and it has been with me ever since. Working with Street teenagers, I have also followed the tradition of my school councilor, and have given it to a few kids from the neighborhood who have never read an entire book in their whole lives. Afterwards, they have come back and thanked me. This is one of those books that hits the mark.Piri Thomas's \\"Down These mean Streets\\" holds an important spot in my library, it is a book that should be read, by all young men, no matter your backgrounds. It shows that no matter how harsh life may be, no matter how many bad cards life deals you, or how many harsh blows it throws at you, there is always hope. If Piri Thoma, as well as my self made it out of the streets alive, and live today in Peace, anyone can. Highly Recomended."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"It caught my eye as soon as I started reading it. It's about a boy living in &quot;El Barrio&quot;. It explains his life and how he deals with the streets. If you you read SpiderTown and thought it was good than you ain't seen nothing yet. It's garuanteed to make you want to read more and more."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"this book was required reading when i was in junior high school in NY 25 years ago, and it left quite an impression on me. i'll never forget the issues of color amoungst his own race that the author struggled with and how he dealt with them."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Piri Thomas captures the essence of the Puerto Rican struggle to establish identity in the melting pot of the world. What made it particularly hard for Piri was his skin color. In Spanish countries it is possible to be black and Puerto Rican, Dominican, Venezuelan or what have you. Sadly many Hispanics (especially Puerto Rican), discovered that in addition to having a different culture, the skin color also represented a much deeper problem. We get a glimpse at life in the heart of Spanish Harlem, the good, the bad and the ugly. The reader will be entertained as Piri walks you through the intricacies of 'el barrio'. He holds nothing back!In the end this is a complex novel that can only make you proud to be Hispanic."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"If you want to hear the truth about the old days, here it is. This was a perfect example of what many people in El Barrio saw and/or did. Its so real that if you read certain passages slowly, and then close your eyes, you could actually see how it went down. This book can help you look deep and realize that we, in this day and age, have it 50 times better than our fathers and grandfathers. Lets thank our stars and our parents. Praise to you \\"Don\\" Piri."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This book is about a boy who grows up in the streets of Harlen, New York. He goes through lots of life changing experiences that change the way his life will go. One of the main events would be when he begins to sell drugs. That isn't the only thing. Many things come around make him have to choose to go the good or the bad way. This is a good book for people who have grown up in the same evironment as he did.I would recomend this book to anybody who has had it hard when they grew up. I could have somewhat relate to him but not completely. I figure this book is good for teenage boys and maybe some adults. It all depends on your choice of book. If you are looking for a book to sit and read on your spare time, this is a good one."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I thought that piri thomas wrote a great book. his life was very complicated not only with people but his own family. piri's Father was always hitting him and didn't treat him like his other brothers and sisters. Piri went through alot and he shared it in this book. I decided to read this book becuz my sister read this book in her english class and she said it was a good book. i decided to read it and i thought wow! this man has gone through alot. People treat people [in a disrespectful manner] sometimes but i mean this was too much. During his childhood people kept saying just becuz he is black it makes him black but he was pureto rican.i think people can be cold hearted sometimes for doing something like this. Piri is also sent to jail becuz of shooting a cop. he also loses his mother who was sick. his father threw him out of the house and piri didn't really care anymore. Piri also taking drugs which get way out of hand and he gets sick and stays at his friends house so he can get better. he also experiences sex with many woman. he even gets one pregnant and he doesn't love her he love another girl her name is trina. I think piri wrote this book for these reasons to show you he got involed with a wrong group and the way people can be to someone who is black. he was always wondering why couldn't he be like his brothers and sisters white not black. he wanted to be treated like every white person treated each other. he also started to get offended when people called him mean names and i know everyone would get mad if they called you watever he wrote in the book.i think this book was great and this book should be for kids a little older than my age becuz you have to understand this book about piri's life. I think kids in 10th grade like my sister should read it. you wouldn't want to put down this great book."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This is an intense no holds barred glimpse into the ugly world of drugs, addiction, self-analysis,and the criminal world. The author gives the reader a realistic view into the world that was apart of his daily existance while growing up in Spanish Harlem. He also makes a self-realization about his ethnic identity and his addiction to drugs. He shares his thoughts about being involved in the criminal elements that seemed to be all around him. The author offers graphic images of his experiences in Spanish Harlem, that remains with the reader long after finishing the book. The author's family struggles and his disappointing moments are things that most kids today experience in their lives. I believe this book can serve as an inspiration to anyone who has felt they were an outsider while growing up in a tough neighborhood."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"It's worth reading now AND again.

This is one of the great pieces of Latino-American literature, and it will remain so for decades to come, if not forever.This is a tale of life in the big city and growing up as an outsider. If you were the first family of color to move into a neighborhood, this book tells your story. If you grew up in a barrio, this book tells your story. If you have ever been hooked on drugs, gangs, the street, this book tells yours story. If you made it out, albeit with a few scrapes, this is your story. It is the tale of all Latinos in one book. It is the Latino experience in America. And that's why it needs to be read. Schools should make it required reading, parents should encourage it as summer reading (however, make sure your kids are mature enough to deal with some of the stronger material included).Buy it, read it, love it. It'll happen."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Piri really comes down to you in this book. He gives you a good insight of how life was living in Spanish Harlem back in the days.

It is in great condition and I received sooner rather than later. Grateful to the house I purchased it from. Thank you."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Down These Mean StreetsEven though the language Piri Thomas uses throughout most of this book is dated, it doesn't matter. We know we're reading about a young gangster who grew up in Spanish Harlem in the 40's and 50's. He also grew up as a Morenito, a black Puero Rican. He got his racial identity from his father, a Moreno, although all of his other siblings resembled their mother who was clearly a white Puerto Rican. Thus, the book tells a lot about racial prejudice, a young man whose parents seemed to have almost no control over him and who is looking for where he belongs in this country of his. The book is so powerful and it deals not only with the issues of race, but also drug addiction, infidelity, death, prison, and the gangster life. It also deals with redemption, great loss, and learning the hard way, but still learning. I wanted to write to Piri Thomas to let him know that I loved his book so much, but I was reading about him on Amazon and found out that he had passed away only a month before I finished his book. I cried throughout the book, but I also cried when I read that he had passed away after what was a very hard life. I ended up giving this book to one of my students who had fought with an alcohol addiction and a hard life for many years and is black and a recovering alcoholic now. I hope he gets something out of it. This book could easily be made into a movie and I think it should be and now is the time if ever."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Great reading. Growing up in East Harlem New York and readinis this book makes for a \\"blast to the past\\". You will be transported back in time and revisit many similar events that had taken place in your own personal history. Check it out for yourself and you will see what I mean."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I read this book when I was maybe 12 years old, in 1967. I had to get \\"special permission\\" from the Philadelphia public library to check it out. I recall the librarian advising me that the content was \\"rather rough,\\" and asking if I was sure I could handle it. I was sure, and I loved it.In his memoir, Piri Thomas makes personal his experience growing up in the barrio in Harlem. His mean streets jump to life for the reader. Sights and sounds are real. You see what he sees, feel what he feels: streets shining in the rain--sometimes dark and empty, dangerous; sometimes alive with neighbors and kids. You suffer with him as he untangles the threads of his relationship with his father, and as he learns to differentiate between machismo and manhood. And you live in prison with him, struggling to survive in a system built to destroy him.The descriptive form of the writing, the music in the narrative, the beat and cadence, all make this the most readable of books. You will live in it for days, maybe years, after you finish, and you will likely read it again.While the language in \\"Down These Mean Streets\\" may at times seem dated, the message is not. (Junot Diaz describes in more current vernacular the Dominican experience in New York and New Jersey.) In fact, any American immigrant from today or past decades could tell a similar story about surviving in a new place. Few, though, can tell it with the same impact as Piri Thomas."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"My boyfriend love this book. I glad I was able to get it for his birthday...Thanks"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This book is written so well that you can feel the streets and his life as he felt them, it is as if you were living through that era and through his experiences with him. If you lived through that era or have experienced some of the things he did in your life it brings you back to your own childhood with a nostalgic feeling. It does have some curses which I don't really care for, it is the way he expresses specific feelings, or things he or others specifically expressed at that time, but fortunately is not that much. It has that NYC streets authenticity; the story was written decades ago but certain parts feel as if they were written yesterday. It is an excellent book that is straight forward and hard to put down once you get into it; by the time you know it, you're done."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Down These Mean Streets was a breakthrough book for Latinos. For a Chicano like me, it was like the Autobiography of Malcolm X was for African Americans. Even though Thomas was writing about an East coast that I have never known, I felt like this was the first book to make me aware that there were experiences that were like mine that weren't only mine. Like the Chicano poet Ricardo Sanchez, anger was something political but dealt with best through poetic words and language."},{"Title":"Outer Perimeter","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;First Evidence&quot; and anxiously awaited the sequel. &quot;Outer Perimiter&quot; was good, but the plot was too dependent on &quot;First Evidence&quot;. If you haven't read the first book, this one will not make much sense. I find the plot of this &quot;series&quot; interesting and exciting, and most of the characters well developed. However I was hoping that &quot;Outer Perimeter would advance the plot more than it did. About half of the book was a retelling of events in the first installment. Mr. Goddard is an excellent writer and has provided many great thriller stories. This plot line has great potential. I hope the next installment, if there is one, will advance the plot and provide closure to some of the plot lines."},{"Title":"Outer Perimeter","review":"Being the sequel to one of the most suspenseful books I've ever read, (First Evidence) I expected a lot. I didn't get quite what I expected but it was an engaging read. For the most part, this book fills in the gaps from &quot;First Evidence.&quot; It explains a lot and makes you go, &quot;Oh yeah.&quot; You must, however, read the first book or you will be lost. &quot;Outer Perimeter&quot; started slow but built it's intrigue bit by bit. Several times, I thought of putting it down but it finally grabbed me. Most books fizzle by the last third. This one takes off like a UFO! The ending didn't grab me but it makes me think he may be thinking of writing another one. (Sidenote: It's interesting that three recent novels all have &quot;black panthers/jaguars&quot; as a nemesis. &lt;Temple by Matt Reilly, Amazonia by James Rollins, and this book&gt; Have I missed a wildlife trend?)"},{"Title":"Outer Perimeter","review":"The author gives us no reason to care about anyone in this novel. We don't get to know the people and, even at the end, we don't know how much of what is described in (what we will loosely define as) &quot;the plot&quot; is real. I found the writing ragged with the plot loose and all over the place. Ken Goddard has not thought deeply about this book before he wrote it, in my opinion.

I did not know this was one of a series. I was lost during the first third of the book trying to fathom out reasons for the actions and fears of the characters. No mention of a prior book anywhere. Lots of questions go unanswered at the end of a chapter then show up later as a flashback or a narrative as to what had happened. I may have enjoyed the book more if I had read the first of the series. I'm not really a science fiction type although some parts were plausable. I found the ending to be irritating, with unresolved questions. I doubt if I will by the next in the series if one come out."},{"Title":"Outer Perimeter","review":"I really enjoyed this read.You really put a lot of excitement into your books, Mr. Goddard.Please e-mail me as to when your next part of this series is coming out.Thank-you"},{"Title":"Outer Perimeter","review":"This is my second book by Goddard that I have read - this one being the sequel to his earlier First Evidence book about First Contact with an alien species. I had this book for a long time before I finally started to read it and once I did, I moved through it more quickly than I had suspected I would. I found this book to be more engaging than his first story, probably because I knew the underlying premise. This story set in Oregon where a cop who is a CSI guy worries about being attacked by some alien baddies and runs around trying to deal with their activities to regain their lost alien comrades.With the recent successfull TV series about CSI stuff, this book matched well and perhaps better with the current CSI interest. Characters were believable and the story flowed well. My only disappointment was in the ending, in that like a lot of books and authors, the end came too quickly and seemed to beg more. It was not an ending that made you feel like a sequel was hiding there, it just seemed to lack a satisfying ending.That said, I still found this book very entertaining and thus my 4-star score."},{"Title":"Outer Perimeter","review":"...we join this X-Files in progress, and finish because there is nothing else on...Yes, I was another who purchased this book after reading the cover, where there is no mention of it being a sequel.

The tale is solid, but unfortunately there are a few issues prevent it from delivering on its promise.The Black Arrow, first published as a serial in 1883 and as a novel in 1888, follows the adventures of Dick Shelton as he discovers that his guardian may be responsible for the death of his father and seeks justice, attempts to rescue his betrothed from the clutches of said guardian, and gets swept up in the tumult of the War of the Roses.Shelton comes across throughout the book as mostly naive and occasionally cruel and self-centered, and he seems to blunder from one encounter to the next. In short, it's hard to really root for him or care about him, as he has few redeeming qualities, but he's also just not that interesting, either. I've read other books where the main characters aren't exactly heroes (such as George R.R. Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice series), but in those cases, the main characters were at least plotting and scheming and being actively devious, which is entertaining. Shelton shows a bit of character growth at the end of the novel, showing regret about some of the dubious actions he took while trying to rescue his betrothed, but it isn't enough to redeem him as an interesting character.Another downside to the book is the disjointed nature of it. It feels very episodic, as if Stevenson approached each chapter thinking, \\"Okay, what trouble can Dick Shelton get into next?\\" This precludes any sort of build-up of tension, and also results in a limit to how much each episode is affected by those that came earlier. When I started reading the book, I was not aware that it had first been serialized, but by the time I finished it, I guessed it had, as it read like a collection of episodes, and I'm aware it was common practice at the time (Stevenson's Treasure Island was first published serially in the same magazine as The Black Arrow, and even Charles Dickens released his work that way).The old fashioned language was a difficulty in getting into the book. I was reminded of watching a Shakespearean play, where it takes you a scene or two to really get into the old language and follow along relatively clearly. I had no trouble with the similarly jargon-laden and old fashioned Treasure Island. Maybe I just speak pirate better than I do knight.The best parts of the book are the action scenes. These are strong, and helps redeem some of the other shortcomings of the novel. There are chases through forests, spying and sneaking, one on one combats, and large battles.I think I'm probably being harder on this book than it might deserve because I'm holding up against Stevenson's other work. It's okay, it just lacks the life and energy of Treasure Island or the creepy tension of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and isn't the same sort of genre-defining work as those two stories.I listened to the audio version read by Shelly Frasier. Frasier doesn't stand out with this book, though she isn't inherently bad, either, and I wouldn't avoid her in other productions. I didn't especially care for her reading this book, though, primarily because 95% of the characters are male, and having to decipher her narrow range of fake male voices to track who was speaking on top of following along with the difficult language wasn't an ideal combination.The Black Arrow is a solid book that has the misfortune to have been written by an author with other fantastic books that outshine it. If you like medieval stories, you'll probably enjoy The Black Arrow, but I can't recommend it to the general reader like I can Treasure Island or Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.If you're interested, check out my reviews Stevenson's Treasure Island and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde here on Amazon for more of my thoughts on those works."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"A little bit hard to get into but worth the read!!!A great page-turner, the begining's a little unclear untill you've read it, so I would suggest re-reading the first chapter or two after you finnish it!!!"},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"I'm usually rather picky with what I read, so I was almost struck when I found myself getting into this book.

After the &quot;Winetou&quot; that was the best book."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"This is a good book but not the best of Stevenson's adventure novels. Intended to be a bildungsroman a la Kidnapped, it is set in Medieval England during the Wars of the Roses. The character development is not as good as several of Stevenson's other novels and the plot seems more schematic. In terms of creating a historically vivid setting. Stevenson did better with 18th century Scotland than with this period of English history."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"Book review-Black arrowThe Black arrow starts off very, very slow. It picks up at the end, thankfully. The book is a long one, at first it's very hard to follow. The plot also gets better as you get deeper into the book. It's a good book if you want to read something over a long period of time. The story takes place in at the time of the War of the Roses and follows the book's hero Dick. This book is clearly an action book. The main character, Dick is likeable enough. In this book, Dick encounters the Black arrow, a battle, a castle and more. This isn't one of Robert Louis Stevenson's best books, but yet is respectable. The original book was written in French and translated so it's got some weird words. Maybe some people would rank it higher, I'm a young guy so I may think it's hard to follow. For me, it's just too long and difficult to follow to be a really good book. Stevenson though has got some good books out there,though, including: Treasure Island, Kidnapped and more."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"This book is one of the best I've read. It is what every book about the middle ages should be and more, with suspense, action, disguises, escapes, and of course, the occasional love scene. Robert Louis Stevenson lived in the mid-1800s, and is renowned for his many works, includingTreasure Island, Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, andKidnapped. The Black Arrow, written originally for a magazine, was written after a serious illness in Stevenson, and was published right after Treasure Island.Dick Shelton, a boy of sixteen, is quickly thrust into the conflict of the War of the Roses. He battles against almost any kind of evil - bloodthirsty pirates, a murderous priest, and even his own legal gaurdian - Sir Daniel Brackley. Through the whole book Dick strives to become a knight, and to rescue his true love. The Black Arrow is a sure winner for 6th graders and up."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"The Black Arrow is, without a doubt, one of my all time favorite books, just as Robert Louis Stevenson is one of my all time favorite authors. I find it hard to believe that The Black Arrow is probably the least well know of his great adventure novels (the others being, of course, Treasure Island and Kidnapped), as it is certainly the best as far as I am concerned. As far as the story goes, it is one of the most entertaining plots that I have ever encountered. It is filled with more twists and turns than I would have thought possible, but remains very clear and fast paced. The characters are wonderful, as is the description and the writing itself. Granted, some of the language is a bit archaic, but I feel that this adds a lot to the authenticity of the story.The Black Arrow is not a very easy read at first, but once you get into it it really flies by. It is as entertaining, exciting, and intriguing book as you will find, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"This gorgeous edition of \\"THE BLACK ARROW\\" is a reissue of the book first published by Charles Scribner's Sons ,with N.C.

Within this story we encounter knights, and a band of outlaws (ala Robin Hood). We have disguises, archery, battles, betrayal, revenge, friendship, honor, and love. What more could you ask for in an adventure?Though it was a fun story, it didn't have the depth of plot or character that I look for in my reading. Instead we follow Richard on what seems an aimless journey of one adventure after another. Richard often finds himself in tight situations and just when he escapes he finds himself in another. Written like a serial (probably was), Richard seems to hardly have time to take a breath before something new and exciting is happening again. Although this type of writing is great for a serial, leaving the reader with a cliff hanger at the end of each section, it doesn't lead to a unified feeling within the work. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the story and have fun reading it along the way; it is just that to me it seemed just a fun adventure story. It was fun to read, but didn't leave me with a lasting impression or emotion."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"Set against the backdrop of the Wars of the Roses, The Black Arrow is an intriguing look at the life of young Richard Shelton. Richard's life is shaken when he realizes that those he had thought to be his friends are really his enemies, and he is forced to make choices that will determine the course of his life. Although the characters are well-developed and the plot is fascinating, this book is not for the squeemish or lazy reader. The description is not only vivid, it is often gorey. The language is sometimes difficult and a dictionary might prove quite handy. But anyone looking for a well-written, action-packed classic should read this book."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"...that buckles every swash imaginable.

We read this book as a read aloud for our family reading time and our kids loved the story which has plenty of adventure and intrigue and also a good deal of humor. The story fits well for boys and girls, as one of the main characters and a significant secondary character are young women. Mom and Dad loved the story as well, but the kids definitely couldn't wait for the next reading time. The language is a bit dated, which at first challenges the readers (mom and dad) but it adds authenticity to the tale."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"I picked up The Black Arrow on speculation, driven by three considerations - it was written by Robert Louis Stevenson, I had vague but good memories of the old TV series the Black Arrow and well it was going cheap at a jumble sale.The Black Arrow relates the adventures of Richard Shelton, a orphan and ward of Sir Daniel a landed knight and veteran warrior of questionable loyalty who has been successfully negotiating the War of the Roses siding with either York or Lancaster based upon who is on top and who is currently providing the best opportunity for material advancement. The only cloud on Sir Daniel's horizon is the mysterious order of the \\"Black Arrow\\", a band of outlaws who have previously been injured by Sir Daniel and who have now sworn themselves to his death and the death of his supporters. Although initially Sir Daniel's loyal ally, Dick eventually becomes aware that Sir Daniel may in fact be responsible for his fathers death. Forced to flee from Sir Daniel's house (and his true love in the form of Joanna another ward of Sir Daniel's), Richard joins the order of the black arrow and swear vengeance for his fathers death. What follows is a series of adventures with espionage, fencing, shipwrecks and many deaths, culminating in Dick joining forces with the Yorkist forces lead by Richard of Gloucester at the battle of Shoresby, where they confront the forces of Lancaster including Sir Daniel.So why do I say that this is not quite what I expected? Well I was expecting in Dick, a hero from your standard boys own adventure, you know the type brave to a fault, a strong fighter, smart and wise beyond his years and completely moral. Instead Stevenson defied my expectation by presenting Dick as brave and strong and honorable, but not terribly smart, capable of making very bad decisions which have a terrible affect upon the lives of those around him, someone whose lack of experience means that he is regularly trumped by his opponents. And although in the end, Richard is knight and married to his love, he is judged by Richard of Gloucester as a man who I will go no further a man who has reached his natural level of advancement a judgment which I found myself agreeing with."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"In this book you can read about knights, soldiers, action, treachery, and other things from the middle ages. I thought that it was a pretty good book, but I only got into it after a while. I had to read it for school, so I couldn't give up, but I was wary of the lack of \\"interesting-ness\\" when I first started. I would reccomend this book to you, but you should beware that you may not be interested for a while. If you are a person who doesn't like a book that takes a while, I would not reccomend this to you. But if you don't mind having to read something a while, I would reccomend this to you. (Sorry if I keep repeating myself.)"},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"With the War of the Roses as its backdrop, The Black Arrow blends the romance of young love and the excitement of its hero's initiation into war and politics. The theme of loyalty runs throughout--loyalty to parents, guardians, leaders, followers, lovers, and oneself.England's loyalties are divided between Lancaster and York, although the distinction makes little difference to the country's more practical citizens. \\"It is the ruin of this kind land,\\" a woman said. \\"If the barons live at war, ploughfolk must eat roots.\\" When the naive young hero, Richard Shelton, reassures her that men \\"cannot better die than for their natural lord,\\" another man points out, \\"No natural lord of mine . . . I followed the Walsinghams . . . And now I must side with Brackley! It was the law that did it; call ye that natural?\\"Despite young Dick's idealism, which makes him faithful to his guardian and to the men with whom he has served, and despite many disturbing rumors, it soon becomes apparent that most men are loyal primarily to their self-interests, whether they seek power like Richard Crookback or favor and riches like Dick's guardian, Sir Daniel Brackley. Even the mysterious \\"Jon Amend-All\\" of the black arrow, whose objective is to revenge himself and his friends on Brackley, is found collecting rents from Brackley's cottagers, acknowledging that they will suffer the hardship of having to pay twice. The man behind \\"Jon Amend-All\\" is no beneficent Robin Hood, but as cold and crafty a political operative as Brackley himself.Brackley's loyalties are soon explained. \\"I lie in Kettley till I have sure tidings of the war, and then ride to join me with the conqueror . . . Tosspot and Shuttle-wit run in, but my Lord Good-Counsel sits o' one side, waiting.\\" As Clipsby says, \\"For, indeed, he is one that goes to bed Lancaster and gets up York.\\"Fleeing from one danger into another, Dick finally understands that he cannot trust Brackley simply because he is Dick's guardian, or even Ellis Duckworth as his savior and protector. The only person upon whom he can rely is the girl he loves, who, ironically, was intended to be his wife in one of Brackley's financial maneuvers. The black arrow flies from Tunstall Forest to Kettley, then through wetlands back through Tunstall to the Moat House and on to Shoreby, with treachery and the threat of war hanging over all.With every adventure, Dick's loyalty turns more inward on himself and his heart's desire. He is loyal to York because Ellis Duckworth is and Daniel Brackley isn't. When he finds himself rapidly in and out of Richard Crookback's favor, he is \\"neither glad nor sorry.\\" Danger and treachery transform Dick into a more mature man who recognizes that loyalty is neither won nor lost so easily or quickly. In one of the novel's strangest and weakest scenes, he proves his loyalty to his bride-to-be by rejecting the advances of her best friend, peculiar as they are.The series of events that makes Dick a man is his theft of the Good Hope, its subsequent destruction, and the death of the captain's man, Tom. \\"Dick's heart smote him at what he heard. Until that moment he had not perhaps thought twice of the poor skipper who had been ruined by the loss of the Good Hope; so careless, in those days, were men who wore arms of the goods and interests of their inferiors . . .\\" Dick achieves his aims, but at the cost of many lives and the prosperity of the innocent Arblaster, who mourns \\"my man Tom\\" until the end of his days.As a protagonist, Dick is refreshingly and painfully human, at least outside battle. While brave, he lacks the ability to pick up on clues that are obvious to his less-sheltered acquaintances, including those about the true nature of Jack Matcham. He suffers remorse for what he has done and begins to ask others like Ellis Duckworth to reconsider their course. He has the mercy that Richard Crookback and Brackley lack.Whatever its historical flaws (some of which Stevenson points out in footnotes), The Black Arrow is beautifully written, with well-drawn characters, a plot that rarely stalls, realistically bloody battle scenes, and dialogue that is often poetic without being jarring. While not Stevenson's greatest effort, The Black Arrow is exciting and fun for anyone of any age who loves a solid historical drama."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"The book black arrow reminded me of the stories about Robin Hood. I think that Robert Louis Stevenson just took the story of Robin Hood and added more things to it. Robert Louis Stevenson had a good idea about it. the story had more depht to it than Robin Hood. the way he describe the one chariter makes him look like Robin Hood, because of the way he is dressed. I thought that the book was prety good. The book could have been better."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"The main thing that made me rate this 1 star is that there are no /good/ characters, for whom I could really cheer.There are a few characters who are completely bad and are shown as such, but there are other characters who are the \\"good guys\\" yet their whole focus is revenge, so that they murder some people and steal from others. Richard deceives people so that he can steal their ship and seems to be confused on such matters as loyalty and truth. He does choose not to kill his arch enemy (despite that person's many wicked deeds), but at other times he kills people merely because they seem to be a danger to him. Once it is called into question whether this is right or not, but the characters are distracted and turn to other matters. Richard does repent of some of the things he has done, when he realizes that it can not be remedied (that was my favorite part of the book).Therefore, while this tale is interesting and makes a few good points, the careless killing, poorly written romance and poor ideals made me strongly dislike it.However, it is very interesting, particularly because of the older English used, so if you don't mind betrayal, violence, and lack of morals, it could be a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"The book, The Black Arrow, by Robert Louis Stevenson, did not grab my attention. Although it had some exciting events in the story, for the most part I was unable to appreciate them because i didn't know what was happening or what anything was about. The book had some confusing twists and turns which were hard to follow. So, I would not recommend this book to most people , because, to me, it was hard to follow and because of that, boring. this book is about a young man named Richard Shelton. He was born loyal to the House of Lancaster but found himself torn between his loyalty to his master and joining a band of outlaws called the Black Arrow, led by a dashing young man named Ellis Duckworth. Shelton goes through many adventures with many partners and friends. The problem is he doesn't know who he can trust. He has been betrayed and swindled, but he doesn't stop putting his faith in people who he thinks he can trust. One person he knows he can trust is Joanna Sedley. She was a lost love in his life which he later encountered. Throughout the book he is chasing, tracking and looking for her. There is certain types of people that would enjoy this book. If they can keep their attention and comprehend very well I think they might like this book very much. Because if you can follow the plot I'm sure it will be very exciting. So, if you fall into that category I would recommend this book to you. But if you are like me and you need a book that is full of adventure from the get go, and have some trouble following books, I would not recommend the Black Arrow."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"The Black Arrow was an enjoyable, fast-paced adventure novel. The protagonist was flawed in a way that made him believable and likable. Best of all, his flaws serve the reader as subtle cautionary tales against haste and violence while still providing a very entertaining read.Written for adolescents, I expect that the novel's period-style language would be somewhat difficult for younger readers today although I do think that the lessons are valuable enough that young people should be encouraged to at least attempt what is otherwise a not very challenging read. The ending, the change in the protagonist's goals and his realizations about his own actions were very satisfying.Additionally, I found the free Kindle edition to be adequate and free from distracting format errors or other issues."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"This copy of Stevenson's excellent historical fiction piece is particularly attractive from the photo on the front cover, but the size is unusually wide and thin.

Worst of all, the print is unusually small. I'm by no means far-sighted and the print is still too small. Enough to make eyes sore small.Recommend the story and dissapointed at this copy.

I did enjoy Black Arrow, but I found it to be the least enjoyable of these four medieval-themed novels. All three others exceeded Black Arrow in these respects:- Level and accuracy of historical detail. The other works really immerse you in the period and allow you to experience the history. In contrast, Black Arrow merely uses the history as the backdrop, and even plays loose with facts.- Compelling characters and captivating story. I just didn't find Black Arrow's characters or story quite as riveting as the others.Overall: I enjoyed this work and I'm glad I read it. If you're looking for a historical novel from the medieval period, there are better ones out there. If instead you're simply looking for a good adventure, you'll definitely enjoy this. By the way, having read Treasure Island, I definitely think Black Arrow is not the author's best work."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses","review":"The book I chose to read for my book report was the Black Arrow.

It is one of the very few works Of Stevenson and probably one of the best. It is an excellent mix of romance, drama and action, and is guaranteed to hold your interest. It is Stevensons only work in the field of Romance/Drama and is a work to rival such classics as The Three Musketeers and The Man in the Iron Mask.

However, it adds the elements of a young and romantic pair of lovers. I would reccomend this book both for the adolescent who has progressed beyond Stevenson's more famous books as well as those of us who are still romantics at heart and miss the days of King Arthur or the Code of Chivalry.

I can count two. The first is the dialogue, which is a little too self-consciously archaic, and the second is the fact that the second half of the book isn't quite as good as the first.Other than that? This book has it all. Fencing! Fighting! True love! Revenge! Beautiful ladies!The book starts off pretty quickly. After a few introductory scenes, we get into the first and best part of the book, which sees the hero and um, a friend, running for their lives through the forest. Stevenson's genius is evident here as he mixes action, suspense, character development, and mystery seamlessly together.After this, the action slows down slightly, but the plot twists, surprises, battles, and excitement keep coming. The hero is human and relatable, the heroine fills her Spirited Heroine quota with as much gusto as the Damsel In Distress requirements. The Drunken Ex-Monk Sidekick is lovable and shrewd; the Greenwood Outlaw is magnificently protrayed; and there are special cameos by Richard of Gloucester and the heroine's talkative best friend.This book has everything. Swordfights? Forced marches? Lurking in the undergrowth? A damsel in distress? A girl disguised as a boy? A storm at sea? An interrupted wedding? Outlaws? Spies? Treacherous uncles?

A Lie of the Mind is always everyone's favorite Shepard play. I have curiously never heard playwrights mention Fool for Love, Buried Child, or Curse of the Starving Class which are much more popular with actors and directors (and the Pulitzer Committee). True West is sometimes a favorite for its tight X-shaped structure. But, A Lie of the Mind has a gorgeous ensemble feel, interwining the lives of two troubled families into an alcoholic and violent aria of tortured love. I have seen it performed twice and seen actors work on each individual scene as class work so it haunts me a lot and never fails to astonish. The play has a heartbeat and sweet warm flesh. It also has one of the most dramatic and involving beginning scenes ever penned. A must read for playwrights interested in writing ensemble pieces."},{"Title":"A Lie of the Mind (Plume)","review":"I love this play!

Even the characters that seem to be the most put together have their own weaknesses and foibles. Shepard has done a very good job of constructing the scenes in a logical manner, appropriately switching between the homes of two different, yet strongly connected families. One of the crowning achievements of this drama is that it draws you in and makes you feel for the characters of the two midwestern families, especially Beth, the now-mentally damaged wife of Jake. I have not seen this play performed but if the written play can draw you the reader in so deeply, I can only imagine what the performed piece can do to the audience. I highly reccomend this drama to anyone who loves to read well-written plays."},{"Title":"A Lie of the Mind (Plume)","review":"I bought this for my daughter who read it and is using an excerpt from it for her musical theater auditions.

If you want to be exposed to the greatness of Shepard, stick with &quot;Buried Child&quot; or &quot;Fool for Love&quot; -- even &quot;Curse of the Starving Class&quot; shines far above this work."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"This omnibus edition of _The Black Mountain_, _Before Midnight_, and _If Death Ever Slept_ is titled _Three Trumps_ only because three cases are covered, and because somewhere along the line Stout and his publishers got into the habit of naming his omnibuses (omnibi?) in a card-playing style, even though few if any of the stories therein had any significant connection with cards._The Black Mountain_ (1954) was the 24th Wolfe book, and is one of the few cases Wolfe concerned himself with solely for personal reasons: the story opens with Archie answering the office telephone, then breaking the news to Wolfe that Marko Vukcic - Wolfe's oldest, closest friend - has been found murdered. Marko, it turns out, had been supporting the resistance movement against the Communist regime back in Montenegro. Wolfe had warned Marko of the risks he was running with his high-profile activities, and the dangers appear to have come home to roost. Even Wolfe's adopted daughter (introduced and last seen in _Over My Dead Body_, so if you haven't read that book, her appearance here may be a bit of a shock) turns up to berate Wolfe a little for not helping the resistance more, and soon she, too, is found dead. By the time Wolfe identifies the murderer, the killer has already fled the country for Montenegro - Wolfe receives a cryptic message to that effect, stating that the killer is within sight of 'the Black Mountain' from which the country takes its name.Wolfe very nearly refuses to take Archie along, because for once *Archie* will be a fish out of water; his street smarts and better physical condition notwithstanding, Archie only speaks English, and Montenegro is completely alien to him. Archie, however, isn't about to let Wolfe traipse off into Montenegro alone, of course._Before Midnight_ (1955) was the 25th Wolfe book, with no mention of the Montenegrin adventures of the previous book or the fallout from Marko's death, although other stories set in the 1950s mention Wolfe's duties as an executor, and his insistence that Marko's restaurant, Rusterman's, be kept up to standard while he acted as trustee. By contrast, Wolfe is in _Before Midnight_ solely for the money. His client is the advertising firm LBA (Lippert, Buff, and Assa); the rising star running their biggest advertising campaign - a gigantic cosmetic historical trivia contest launching Pour Amour perfume - has just been murdered. (Some of the contest questions are sprinkled through the book, including the corresponding answers, although not usually together; the later ones should give the reader a run for his/her money.)Not, you understand, that the partners really *care* who killed Louis Dahlmann; the real problem is that a few hours before he was murdered, he passed out the tie-breaking contest questions to the 5 finalists, then brandished a piece of paper from his wallet, saying it held the answers. When Dahlmann's corpse was found, the paper was missing, and LBA wants to be able to point to the thief, disavow that set of questions, and keep the contest from turning into a nightmare. Of course, as Inspector Cramer points out, it'll be tough for Wolfe to find the thief without fingering the murderer. :)_If Death Ever Slept_ (1957) was the 28th Wolfe book, and like _Too Many Women_ before it, begins with a cold war in the brownstone, which results in Wolfe accepting a job that involves Archie taking an undercover assignment - in this case, one that involves having Archie move out for the duration to take a job as Otis Jarrell's private secretary, as a cover for finding out how his daughter-in-law has been sabotaging his business interests. (Jarrell doesn't like Susan for various personal reasons, and would really like Wolfe and Archie to break up his son's marriage, but Wolfe draws the line at that sort of thing.) The puzzle is more fair to the reader than that in _Too Many Women_, although there's a large lump (fortunately just one lump) of timetable information that makes unexciting reading. On the plus side, the stormy atmosphere in the brownstone has more interesting causes and side effects than that in _Too Many Women_. :)For more detailed discussion of the individual works herein, see reviews of the 3 separate books; no changes were made to include them here. They have few points in common, not even being 3 back-to-back books in publication order. While they're no worse here than taken separately, this omnibus edition provides no added value."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"The Nero Wolfe stories by Rex Stout are timeless. Nero Wolfe is a fat, bad-tempered genius detective who almost never leaves his brownstone mansion in New York. The stories are told through his self-styled man-Friday, Archie Goodwin. Archie is Wolfe's foil: witty, active, and charming to the ladies.In &quot;If Death Ever Slept&quot; Archie leaves the brownstone to go undercover as a secretary to a rich and important financier. It's classic mystery stuff -- a house full of suspects, some of whom get killed off as the story progresses and enough clever banter to keep you interested between the murders.And that's exactly what I want in a mystery. Mysteries are supposed to be about clever people. There should be someone clever enough to think they can get away with murder. And there needs to be someone cleverer than that to catch them. Clever people should have clever dialogue. I'm not much a spine-tingling suspense mystery buff. I read mysteries for the fun of it. There has to be humour. Murder should be a funny business.The other important characteristic of a good murder is that it should be a struggle to figure out who did it. All the clues should be there to find but it should be far from obvious.If Death Ever Slept has the humour but it only partially succeeds on the mystery/clue front. I enjoyed the ride to the end. But once I'd finished the book I realised that for the last third of the book I had paid only scant attention to who the murder might be. When it came I wasn't surprised or gratified because I wasn't really interested any more.I think I just like being in the comfortable brownstone with Wolfe and Archie eating good food, sitting in comfortable chairs and discussing the intriguing business of murder. In this book, I had absolutely no connection with either the victims or the killer.Still, I enjoyed it as I enjoy almost all Nero Wolfe books."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Just finished this book and my overall reaction was ... yawn. All the elements are there -- Archie, Fritz, Wolfe, beer, orchids, etc. But this is one of the later books in the series and there's a certain ennui evident. The mystery seemed over plotted, the characters under developed, and any genuine charm was missing. Of course even subpar Nero Wolfe is entertaining, so I'm not sorry I read it. I just enjoyed the earlier books so much more, and seeing the series go downhill is depressing."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"When a millionaire approaches Nero Wolfe with a plan to expose his daughter-in-law as a snake, using insider information to make a profit at his own expense, Wolfe is tempted to brush the man off. Sadly for him, he and Archie Goodwin have just had a fight, and in a fit of pique he allows Archie to go off to the man's house. However, it soon becomes apparent that something strange is going on at the Jarrell house, and when it leads to murder, Wolfe becomes determined to let nothing stand in the way of his getting to the bottom of things...no matter the cost.I have become something of a Nero Wolfe fan, having only discovered him over the last year. This book is another gem in author Rex Stout's crown! As always, Nero Wolfe is fascinatingly eccentric, and Archie Goodwin is a source of great fun with his witty banter. The mystery itself was very good, and the story and characters very interesting.What can I say? It's a great book, and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Okay, some of the elements of this book are a little silly -- like the dead squirrel poem -- but again, I'm trying to get into the Nero Wolfe fan mind, and this book pushed me just a wee bit closer. I find Wolfe just plain irritating, but the star of the show for me continues to be Archie, who really does underestimate himself. Well, this was book 3 for me; on to book 4."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"When Otis Jarrell came to see famed detective Nero Wolfe he did not realize that his cause was hopeless. He wanted Wolfe to investigate a domestic matter, the fact that Jarrell's problem was his daughter-in-law rather than his wife did not impress Wolfe. When Jarrell suggested that Archie move into his penthouse undercover though Wolfe decided to accept the case because he and Archie were annoyed with each other. The ten thousand dollar retainer didn't hurt either.Needless to say shortly after Archie took up his post in the Jarrell household things began to get complicated, first a break-in and theft, then a murder leading Nero to disrupt his routine, call in all the troops, join forces with a FEMALE colleague and leaving Fritz to guard the brownstone's door for the night. In the end of course, Wolfe triumphs.This is one of the later entries into the series. The situations have all occured before, the banter between the detectives has become a bit worn, life at the brownstone has been examined many times in the past and the action in this one is a bit slow. Even with all of this a visit to the Wolfe establishment is not to be missed. This is a must for fans of the series and not a bad place to start for anyone new even if it is not one of the best."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Unlike Archie's last such assignment (in _Too Many Women_, written 10 years before this book), this case gives the reader a decent chance to solve the puzzle.Ordinarily, Wolfe wouldn't ask where Archie's been when he comes in at 2 a.m. But when Archie walked out on Lily Rowan's party because she'd invited some people he didn't like, she started calling the brownstone, starting at 8 p.m. and ending at 1:30 (\\"So I, not you, have spent the evening with her, and I haven't enjoyed it.\\") The conversation went downhill from there, so when Otis Jarrell appeared for his first appointment with Wolfe the next day, he got the benefit of a rather stormy atmosphere, with Wolfe exerting himself to be pleasant, just to show that nothing's wrong with *him*. (To be fair, the brown envelope with $10000, cash, offered as a retainer, might have helped.)Unfortunately for the exchequer, what Jarrell wants is to break up his son's marriage: Wyman married \\"a snake\\", and Jarrell believes that Susan has leaked damaging business information to his competitors several times. He wants to pass Archie off as a replacement for his own newly fired secretary, Jim Eber, until Wolfe and Archie come up with the goods. Archie's beginning to feel sorry for the rejection Jarrell has coming at this point - not only a near-divorce case, but depriving Wolfe of his services indefinitely - when Wolfe responds, \\"You realize, Mr. Jarrell, that there could be no commitment as to how long he would stay there.\\" Archie, always a quick thinker, runs with this rather than squawking, and \\"Alan Green\\" becomes Jarrell's secretary.Archie's new assignment palls very quickly. But matters become deadly serious when someone bypasses the security cameras in Jarrell's office to steal Jarrell's own gun, and Jarrell is too fixated on Susan as a suspect to get serious about finding it. Then matters escalate to plain deadly...Leavening the mix of emotional relationships and industrial espionage are several timetables distilled from police reports, but they're provided in one big block so that you can ignore them at your own peril if you prefer. (Personally, I can enjoy this one just fine without worrying much about trying to work out the puzzle.) More interesting points include: Jarrell's daughter Lois, who (despite writing the poem from which the book's title is taken) is one of the 3 best dancers Archie's ever escorted; the measures taken by Archie to appear as Alan Green when the group is interviewed by Wolfe; and how Wolfe manages to escalate their quarrel to a new and more frightening level. :)"},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"\\"If Death Ever Slept\\" is a Nero Wolfe novel by Rex Stout. This book was written in 1957. As in all the Wolfe books it is narrated by Wolfe's assistant, Archie Goodwin. Otis Jarrell hires Nero Wolfe to find something that can get his daughter-in-law, Susan, out of his house. Archie goes undercover at the Jarrell house posing as Jarrell's new secretary under the name of Alan Green. Archie interviews everyone in the household to find anything on Susan that would get her out. While he is still investigating, Jarrell's former secretary, James Eber, is found murdered with a .38 revolver. Jarrell discovers that his gun which is also a .38 is missing. Two days later, Corey Brigham, a business associate of Jarrell's is found murdered also with a .38 and is presumed by the same gun that killed Eber. Nero Wolfe, with the aid of Archie and other detectives, solves the case is his usual fashion by assembling all the suspects as he announces the murderer. The title comes from a poem written by Lois Jarrell, the daughter of Otis. She has killed a squirrel and wrote the poem in remorse. A strange title, but a very good Nero Wolfe novel. I really enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Perfectly agreeable novel, until the denouement; the reader is not privy to information necessary to solve the case, and the solution relies on Wolfe's assorted henchmen and colleagues accomplishing a bit of routine work better than the police would. Perfectly ridiculous."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Although there's a lot of funny dialogue between Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin at the beginning of this book, the story as a whole seemed rote, as if the author were going through familiar motions without heart. In this story millionaire Otis Jarrell hires Wolfe to discover whether his (Jarrell's) daughter-in-law is stealing business secrets and selling them elsewhere. In order to uncover the truth, Wolfe has Archie take a job as Jarrell's secretary and move into the Jarrell penthouse. Archie does, and then murder follows. More than one. The mystery is solved at the end when Wolfe interviews the suspects and presents a piece of evidence given him by Inspector Cramer. Worth reading if you're a Nero and Archie fan. Maybe even if you're not and just want the taste of a 1950s mystery with lots of wit and cleverness."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Thanks to Amazon and their ability to find old, out-of-print copies of books, I now have the entire Nero Wolfe series by Rex Stout. I've been reading them since I was a teen and still love to sit down with one to relax, smile and go back to a period very different from the one in which we live. Real Americana from the 1930's to 1975, in a mystery format.

I always enjoy the banter between Wolfe and Archie and in this book we see how far both are willing to take an argument. I try to solve the mysteries but that is not my primary reason for reading Nero Wolfe. Stout writes well; his characters are often eccentric if not downright bizarre; even the secondary recurring characters are interesting and he writes about a New York City I would have loved to know. Nero Wolfe and Stout are both class acts and should be savored just as Wolfe savors Fritz's meals."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Nero Wolfe is hired to get the dirt on the daughter-in-law of a multimillionaire, and Archie is pressed into undercover service at the millionaire's home. Archie meets an interesting cast of family, friends and servents, and then the fun starts when a gun is missing. Then bang - a murder. Then bang - another murder. Wolfe uses his wit and the motion of Goodwin, Panzer, etc to gather evidence and solve the crimes. I especially enjoyed Wolfe's wit when it came to his exchanges with Inspector Cramer. Stout writes in a very interesting style, unlike most popular fiction."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Most of the time a job that involves marriage is something that Nero Wolfe does not like to deal with. It is like a cross to a post-Dracula vampire. But in the end, kicking and screaming, he ends up taking a job to help a rich man kick out his daughter-in-law. And ends in a murder case.A murder that Archie may get blamed for! A good read for a slow or rainy day. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Author Rex Stout presents a delightful central concept showcasing one of mystery fiction's most unlikely yet enduring partnerships, that of rotund master detective Nero Wolfe and his smartalecky sidekick Archie Goodwin, who does all the legwork and narrating. Magnificent Manhattan ambiance and clever offhand dialogue abound, as does an appreciation for the finer things, like orchids, shad roe with creole sauce, and a second bottle of beer.\\"If Death Ever Slept\\" showcases these strengths, but as a murder mystery, it's neither plausible nor interesting. Wolfe is hired by a wealthy Manhattanite (vaguely described as a \\"capitalist\\" in \\"Who's Who\\") to investigate his daughter-in-law, whom he suspects of stealing business secrets. Archie poses as the man's new secretary, and finds himself \\"in a hive of predators and parasites\\" with the former including at least one person armed with a .38 and no compunction against using it.This should be good stuff, fine company for a rainy night, but the characters never gel into anything interesting, just stereotypes. You don't feel anything for them or their situations, not even when one of them is murdered. The pace is sloggy. \\"If Death Ever Slept\\" is an luxurious ambiance bath, and those that treasure Goodwin's funny lines and wry observational humor are well-served (About being caught in his room with his shoes off: \\"Conferring in bare feet with a man who is properly shod may not put you at a disadvantage, but it seems to.\\") Alas, it never engages the reader as a story.I had problems with the way Wolfe and Goodwin took the law into their own hands, tampering with a crime scene and then parsing over legalities while people died. Normally when the cops show up all out of sorts at Wolfe's brownstone stoop, you are supposed to relish the moment the fat man puts them in their place, but this time the pair meddles with a police investigation that's on the right track while Nero and Archie haven't a clue.Also, Archie's practiced patter wears thin after a while. He's got a great set of wisecracks, but nothing in this story seems to bother him, so why should we care? We already have a setpiece scenario, with all the stock characters in their stock situations, so any bit of empathy we can get from our humble narrator will help. But the most he offers is that the client's daughter does a mean rumba.Nero Wolfe books are usually good to great, and this at least is at times pretty funny. But it's far from Stout's best. If you read this and nothing else, give Stout another chance. And if you are looking for your first Nero Wolfe, there's at least a couple dozen better bets than this."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Stout creates a female character here who writes a poem. She is moved to write it because she has killed a squirrel and is mourning its loss. Her turn of phrase is \\"If Death Ever Slept...\\"This supposes, of course, that death never sleeps. The conceptual buzz much informs this book. As detective fiction goes, it is leisurely and ruminative, so I give it only the two stars you see. However, I enjoyed its characterizations of the relationships in \\"the family.\\" Archie's insecurities and professional jealousy are never better described than they are here, and the other extended family members are given a good airing.But why did she write it? If it was because she felt bad about the squirrel and wants to share, she almost succeeds. There is too little satisfaction at the conclusion of this one; its tone of futility and moral loss rival the way the reader feels at the end of \\"Fer-de-Lance.\\""},{"Title":"If Only You Could Read My Mind: A Guide to Help Couples Understand Each Other and Connect","review":"The cartoon of a couple each reaching past the other is what attracted me to pick up this book. Then when I flipped through it and saw that it was Psychological Type based, I bought it for my collection.This is a book that a couple therapist wrote and had published to fill a need. It is something a couple could take away with them and are likely to read. Usually the couple can understand the concepts in the therapist's office but when they get back home the ideas get rather fuzzy. This book is short enough with lots of examples that it is likely to be read and understood.There is a movement within the type community to look at the whole type and its complexity, but most of us working in the trenches are still dealing with helping people understand the differences within the eight preferences. Usually we don't have them long enough to get into anything more complex than the difference between being an introvert and an extrovert, etc.This book does just that. It looks at how relationships have changed over the years due to changing roles of men and women. Then it devotes a chapter to each of the dimensions of behaviour with lots of short examples of dialogue. The last four chapters deal with better listening techniques, how to be understood, dealing with anger and criticism, and other difficult communication issues. Each of these relates to the information on type gained in the previous chapters.This is a book I would recommend to professionals and casual readers. The professionals can gain some additional anecdotes they can use in their sessions and it is a book to recommend to their clients. The casual reader can also just pick it up, read it and gain some useful insights without having someone more knowledgeable to interpret it...."},{"Title":"Pequenas epifanias: Cronicas, 1986/1995 (Portuguese Edition)","review":"This is a type of journal.

TLS is the best pop-psychoanalysis book I read since &quot;Games people play&quot; by Eric Bern (very strongly recommended as well). I became fascinated with the idea of Cliff Notes on psychoanalysis after reading Think like a shrink article in Sep/Oct 98 Popular Psychology by Emanuel Rosen.The article was so good and so much in the face of current media thinking about personality, that I clipped it and reread it many times in the last 3 years. It also started with a tantalizing sentence that an author is writing a book on the same topic, so every time I read the article I checked the Amazon for the book. Finally the book came out this summer and exceeded all my expectations. TLS is divided into 100 chapters, not more than two pages each, and each one describing a key psychoanalytic principle and titled with hilarious anti-PC statement such as Woman who angle for male attention may never have hooked maternal affection.. and Don Juan had an absent father, or Too much love may mean hate; too much hate may mean love; or Beware unsolicited denials etc. Just reading the titles is worth the price of the book. I have to note here that the book is written weaker than the article, because the article was an absolute gem with 21 most important principles packed on 5 journal pages, with each principle being explained in 2-5 info-packed sentences. In the book the author has the luxury of spreading 100 principles into 230 pages, so the writing is not as tight. But the bottom line is that you will have a very good grasp of psychoanalysis (and yourself) after reading the book."},{"Title":"Think Like a Shrink: 100 Principles for Seeing Deeply into Yourself and Others","review":"I am one of those people that EVERYONE likes to come and talk to me about their problems.

The book is conveniently broken down into 100 basic principles, each briefly stated and written in a relaxed, good humored, contemporary style.

This one comes the closest; in Paradise Postponed, Mortimer follows a disparate group of characters from the Second World War up through the late 1960s, using their stories to reflect developments in England during the same period. As you might expect from the creator of Rumpole, there's also an interesting mystery, but the real focus is on the relationships and dynamics between the characters, as Mortimer centers on a young man from a working class background who eventually becomes a powerful politician. Mortimer has an uncanny knack for creating characters who are believable, quirky individuals, and he makes us care about their struggles. The dialogue crackles, which one might expect since Mortimer was writing the TV adaptation of Paradise Postponed at the same time he was writing the novel. Paradise Postponed has had two sequels, which don't have quite the same scope either in terms of character development or time period covered.What surprises me is that the TV adaptation of Paradise Postponed has never been released on video, at least in the U.S. There'd be a large market for it."},{"Title":"Paradise Postponed (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"John Mortimer is brilliant, and there can be no two ways about that. He is a cynic and he is a wit, and talented enough for that to put him almost in the company of Swift. He was also a lawyer, there is usually a legal thread even in his non-Rumpole novels, and there is one here, the mysterious case of a clergyman's will which seems to have left his entire fortune to a very unexpected and unwelcome beneficiary.I found the plot-line in this novel very good indeed. The main mystery is cleared up in a very unexpected way, all hints and suggestions really lead somewhere, and while I suppose I would have to call it contrived, it is clever enough to be convincing in its own way. It is clever in the sense of being complex, but also in the way that Mortimer keeps switching the time-focus between different eras. He takes us from the start of Attlee's Labour government in 1945 all the way to the reign of Margaret in the 80's. The story of the will would not by itself have required a 40-year elapse. What requires that is the introduction of Leslie Titmuss, depicted starting with his modest boyhood and ending, in this book, with his fictional presence in Thatcher's cabinet. It needs no great legal genius to perceive that he is going to be good for a few more books, and so, of course, it has turned out.So there is a political angle too, and if you know your author you will have expected that. He was one kind of leftist, and a kind that I greatly like. He had a privileged background, and he was \`anti' just by nature. He was a rationalist and he was a libertarian. He found the toffs with origins similar to his own to be absurd and repulsive, but he was no Orwell, no wholesale convert to some other side. The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady are sisters under the skin, after all. It's a human skin, and it's humanity in general that is prone to being absurd.The characterisation is largely drawn from a political slant, therefore. Mortimer is not pushing any party-political programme all the same. Just describe some Young Conservatives, I suppose, and further comment would be superfluous. However the reverend himself, whose strange-seeming will forms the core of the narrative, is depicted as a self-caricaturing lefty, while Mortimer is conspicuously restrained in anything that might be construed as hostility to Titmuss, whose views must have been in many respects antithetical to his own. Malcolm Muggeridge, in his latter days as a born-again Christian and reactionary, had an excellent description for a whole tranche of C of E clergymen of this period, with their \`feeble-minded confusion of the Christian faith with better housing, shorter hours of work, the United Nations and opposition to apartheid.' These are the polar examples. The others - I found them brilliantly drawn and developed altogether.However in Mortimer there is always a good deal of social commentary, with minor characters put there for the overall picture and not for themselves. In many ways this is the best thing in the book, and it comes mainly at the beginning. You can't tell me that the schoolmates of Fred and Henry at their fictitious public school in East Anglia are not drawn from life. Mortimer attended Harrow School (as did Churchill), and they used to tell them there that the wind from the Urals hit Harrow-on-the-Hill without encountering any intermediate obstruction. Mortimer borrows this piece of lore for his school here in the book, so I infer that the incidental personae who come and go in the first chapter or two are real, with only the names changed to protect the questionably innocent. In particular there was apparently one boy who had a premature 5-o'clock shadow and was a great masturbator. He features in just a sentence or two, is never heard of again, and one is left wondering whether his onanistic eminence was a matter of a record level of activity, or whether he needed both hands simultaneously for the job, or exactly what it was. Somebody still alive might still remember.The style of writing is of course delightful, but I caught Mortimer recycling a sentence that I had heard him use on television at least once, to the effect that there is no pleasure worth denying oneself for the sake of a few years in a sunset home in Weston-super-Mare. Poor old Weston-super-Mare. It is 60 years since I was there last, but having been warned off in this way I am electing to manage my later years by attending a gymnasium and eating and drinking less. Advancing age makes the latter pleasures less attractive anyway, to me at least. The book also features an elderly doctor who is largely there for the purpose of saying witty things, rather like Lord whatsisname in A Picture of Dorian Gray. This is entirely welcome. The doctor belongs properly in the narrative, and I would only utter a mild remonstrance for the pageful of his bons mots that is only there because Mortimer could not fit them into the story.Behind the upper-middle-class English flippancy there is also a darker side to all this, and mentioning the doctor above reminds me of that. To me, it is all a potent brew, and I recommend the book thoroughly. Sir John Mortimer left our society only recently, but not before he had used at least one of his books to sound a coded but powerful warning of the threats to liberty that were being enacted by the over-plausible and endlessly self-justifying Tony Blair. The libertarian mentality runs through Mortimer's output, the threats to liberty depend on the eternal vigilance that is trumpeted so often by some of the people who threaten liberty most and are trying to hijack the vocabulary to their own political cause. Mortimer is good for our mental health."},{"Title":"Paradise Postponed (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This novel is quite a lark in the reading of it. The dialogue, for which Mortimer has an uncanny ear, sparkles with wit, and the characters all come across as both believably quotidian and quirky. Mortimer also manages to deftly sketch the changes in English society between the war years and 1985 into the background of all these intertwined goings-on. What fun!Oh yes, there's also the mystery of the will of Simeon Simcox, late pacifist, socialist vicar which bequeaths all to weaselly Conservative Cabinet MP Leslie Titmuss. The narrative is a bit rum on this point in that the said Simeon Simcox is actually alive throughout most of the novel as the story backtracks through time or rather hopscotches around it - more often than not from paragraph to paragraph, with no clear demarcation given - which takes a bit of getting used to, whilst also keeping the reader on his/her toes.A very lively, satisfactory read indeed, except that one is still left pondering why exactly the Bertrand Russell reading, seemingly atheistical Simcox became a vicar in the first place. Oh well, it's just as well to have something on which to chew after one turns the last pages.Mortimer is particularly deft in employing literary quotations to summarise entire sections of the book. The Kierkegaard quote summarising Part Three might well be employed to give the prospective reader an idea of the entire book's underlying theme and motif:\\"Life must be lived forwards, but it can only be understood backwards.\\""},{"Title":"Paradise Postponed (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is the first of what became known of the Rapstone Chronicles trilogy* and basically covers the life of an English Thatcherite Conservative politician, Leslie Titmuss, who is obviously based on Norman Tebbitt, and his alter ego, a doctor called Fred Simcox who is an idealized version of the kind of figure that Mortimer portrayed himself as being.The books appeared during the administrations of Margaret Thatcher, whom Mortimer despised. They describe how a rural district close to London developed over the second half of the 20th century and eventually lost its charm and authenticity at the hands of Thatcherism, personified by Titmuss.The story allows Mortimer to poke fun and ridicule things he did not like, such as people being ambitious, restrictions on smoking and foxhunting, and town planning while upholding things he liked, such as the freedom to smoke, drink, have illicit love affairs and opt for a humdrum life in the country. The last volume tapers into the Blair years when the Labour Party ditched any pretence at being socialist and allows Mortimer to mock \\"New\\" Labour.The trilogy is peopled with a large cast, including trendy clergymen, crooked businessmen, hopeless aristocrats, pushy PR types, absurd conservationists and various other goodies and baddies.Unfortunately, none of the characters has a fraction of the energy or originality of those found in Mortimer's best works - Dunster, Summer's Lease (with the unforgettable Haverford Downs) and A Voyage Round my Father.Titmuss has no presence and his Machiavellian antics wielding power behind the scenes ring hollow. Fred Simcox is a mere cut out and the women these two fall in and out of love with are willowy models from Pre-Raphaelite paintings.Like many of Mortimer's works, this first volume contains is a mystery story that centers on a will and, at least, has a purpose but the other two are tired and repetitive.*Paradise Postponed, Titmuss Regained, The Sound of Trumpets"},{"Title":"Paradise Postponed (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"John Mortimer's 1985 hilarious long novel is not as well known outside of the UK as his Rumpole stories, but it fully deserves to be. Fittingly, Mortimer constructed this portrait of England during the forty years after the war as a mystery, which gives his satirical wanderings a real narrative drive because it's difficult to guess why, indeed, the \\"Red Rector of Rapstone,\\" Simeon Simcox, leaves his fortune in his family brewery shares not to his two adult sons but rather to the loathsome Thatcherite Cabinet Minister Leslie Titmuss. The untangling of this mystery allows Mortimer to move back and forth in time between the sons unraveling the mystery and all that led before it: we see how the Simcoxes and the other inhabitants of the Rapstone Valley (including Titmuss himself, originally the son of a brewery worker brought up to the rectory to clear nettles from the garden) involve themselves in the changes wrought in England since the war, from the austerity of the Atlee government to the optimism of the Macmillan years to the austerities of the early 70s under Heath and finally to the smug saber-rattling of the Thatcher era.The cast of characters is terrific (my favorite is the snobbish Lady Fanner, who cannot stand her clumsy and unhappy daughter Charlotte), and in the best of the English tradition of the comic novel of manners (exemplified by Austen, Oliphant, Trollope, Meredith, Forster, Waugh, and Angus Wilson), the characters are allowed multiple sides to them--even the odious Titmuss himself. There are great setpieces, several of which involve the gentle attempts of Simeon Simcox to please a child that go disastrously awry and which made me laugh out loud. I worried near the end of the novel that Mortimer's attempts to make this novel too much of an allegory for the inheritance of England would make it too programmatic by the end, but though perhaps his points about the Thatcher era are hammered home a little too insistently at times the whole thing comes off as a huge success."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Basic and Mainstream Movements of Square Dancing: More Than 450 Illustrations","review":"I used a copy of this handbook over 20 years ago when I first learned to square dance.

So, my experience of reading how Martin Luther spoke to his barber about his prayer life was of even greater interest to me. This little book speaks to what we can learn from Luther's letter.I found it touching that Martin Luther cared enough about his barber that he wrote a 40-page letter in response to his questions concerning prayer. Luther wrote 40 pages out of a pastoral concern; not with the purpose of being published. Either Luther was not very precise in his writing, or he really cared for his barber. Knowing a bit of Luther's writing style, probably both.My haircut was with a woman that I had never met before, and now, whose name I don't even remember. And since we're moving soon, I won't likely meet her again. While it wasn't the purpose of the twenty page tract to emphasize Luther's ministerial methods, it nonetheless struck me that Luther must have frequented the same shop enough for the barber to feel comfortable to ask Luther about his prayer life. In a world where we may only visit a particular stylist once, it made me think about missed ministerial opportunities. In an effort to frame our lives around consumer driven needs, we may be missing relational opportunities for sharing Christ with others.More than anything else, the tract emphasized to me that prayer is not about covering a large amount of ground, but rather, going deeper, using even familiar prompts. Having just completed a study of Calvin and Luther's catechisms, it's interesting that Luther indeed practiced what he preached. Luther framed his catechism around the Lord's Prayer, the Apostolic Creed, and the Decalogue. So, it's quite interesting that he recommends the same framework for this disciple's prayer life.I also found it interesting that Luther essentially framed his prayer life around the discipline of meditation. Using his 4-garland-strands of Thanksgiving, Confession, Prayer, and Action, he could meditate on one verse for quite a period of time. Moreover, it was a helpful corrective to be reminded by Luther that we should willingly listen in our prayer lives. Or, to use Luther's phrase, to allow the Holy Spirit to \\"preach to your heart.\\"Luther was not only a person of prayer, but a person who was sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit. He was led by the Holy Spirit not only to go deeper in holy contemplation, but also to allow his meditation to lead him to action. It's profound that this Reformation hero, who clearly had a deep prayer life, had time even to guide his barber in the art of prayer. Unquestionably, it was his prayer life that even made him sensitive to the needs of his barber."},{"Title":"Never Tell","review":"Analise Glover was a young, brilliant, yet &quot;different&quot; child with a promising career ahead of her until she meets Nathan Rhodes, a professor at Callenwolde University where her parents have sent her to study linguistics. Noticing her brilliance in the art of words, languages, and understanding them, Nathan takes her under his wings, convinces her that her work isn't good enough, and tells her to change her major to psychology. He encloses her in his world, belittling her and brainwashing her to believe she has no one but him to turn to.One dreadful night years later, she catches him in the midst of something so horrible, she flees to a cabin he once took her to. He follows her and when they confront each other, a big fight ensues. The end result is that he loses control of the gun, it goes off and when she awakens, he is dead. Analise calls her only friend to help her dispose of the body.Years later, Analise has turned herself into Dr. Erin Abbott, a criminal psychology professor at a college in New Orleans. She's hid herself under a shroud of frumpy clothing and refused to let anyone get close to her. When she receives a letter filled with obituaries and clues detailing several murders, she knows her past is back to haunt her and takes the information to the police. Unfortunately, they don't really believe her and why a killer would single her out leaving her clues that she claims only she can see.Reporter/Journalist Gabriel Moss, on the other hand, is sure that her story of the ABC Murders will save his dying newspaper. Thrusting himself in her life, he immediately sees through her charade and wants to find out what she's hiding. Their partnership is set amidst lies and secrets, yet they join forces to find the killer. What ensues is an emotional race against time to identify and stop the killer from adding victims to his list.Action-packed and suspenseful, Selena Montgomery immediately draws in the reader and keeps a consistent hold through the pages of NEVER TELL. Going from the present to the past and back again, we're able to relive Erin's earlier life and find out exactly why she's holding tight to her secrets. The sensual attraction between Erin and Gabriel fits perfectly and allows us to see all dimensions of their character. What I really loved about the story was the suspense. While reading, you have no idea who the killer is until you actually read it once it's revealed. Additionally, Montgomery has written a story that transcends race and lands solidly as a book I'd recommend to anyone.Reviewed by Tee C.

However, overhearing the discussion, Bayou Ledger reporter-owner Gabriel Moss thinks he might have a story to save his fledgling newspaper in the professor and the \\"ABC murders\\". Reluctantly Erin agrees to partner with Gabe to uncover the identity of a killer as she expects to be the last victim. As they work together, they fall in love, but she feels that she could never stay with anyone permanently because of all the traumas she suffered.Romantic suspense readers will not only appreciate this exciting serial killer romance, but will also tell peers how good an author Selena Montgomery is. The story line is fast-paced and filled with action as Erin deciphers the clues that the culprit sends her way. She struggles to identify the murderer as the evidence points to Nathan who is a dead man. However, no one else could know what the killer knows except Nathan and her. She also doesn't know what to do about her growing love for Gabe.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Never Tell","review":"As the typical smart person bombarded by books, TV, and movies, it is pretty hard to surprise me with the identity of the \\"bad guy\\" at the end of the story. Selena Montgomery tricks me more than once throughout this book, which is quite a feat! Not to mention, I learned a few words. I love her heroine, who is beautiful despite herself (wouldn't we all like our natural beauty to shine like that?) and who is not afraid to use her intelligence to pursue the life she wants and protect herself. Yet another wonderful thriller from Ms. Montgomery, this book had me staying up way too late b/c I kept going on to the next chapter!"},{"Title":"Never Tell","review":"NEVER TELL is an edge of your seat murder-mystery-romance thriller, uniting criminal psychology professor, Dr Erin Abbott, with Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and news paper owner, Gabriel Moss. Both are on the trail of a killer preying on the men and women of New Orleans in what is dubbed the \\"ABC Murders\\". I was totally absorbed by the time the twisted motive and killers identity was revealed. This book proves Ms. Montgomery is truly fine tuning her craft.As the city of New Orleans becomes a pawn for a killers bizarre plan of retribution. Dr. Erin Abbott finds her anonymity threatened when she begins to receive mail containing clues that cleaverly links the past she wants to forget, with seemingly random murders within the city.Initially, Erin tries to report her knowledge to the police without revealing her connection, but she nor her theory are given credibility. Gabriel Moss's gut reaction to the details he overhears is not so easy for him to dismiss. He is positive the good doctor is harboring more than her ability to decipher the abstract evidence.Although police disregard her claim, Erin is locked in a game of words with a killer playing out their revenge. As Gabe follows Erin for the story he's sure will be big, she is not eager for his attention to the case or to her. But while seeking to uncover the story behind the ABC Murders and save his struggling Ledger, Gabe also hopes to uncover the beauty the good doctor is hiding beneath her ill fitting and unfashionable attire.As the horror of Erin's past is reflected in the terror of the present, I felt the victims fear as realization of their impending death permeated their final thoughts. I visualized Nathan's indelible paranoia escalate in witness to Analise's linguistic genius. I cried for Analise who sought the acceptance and security of her demented captor. I felt the despair of this unique prodigee' whose gift amazed the greatest scholars. I applauded Sebastian's love and loyality for the lifelong bond nearly destroyed by envy and jealousy. I admired Gabriel's committment to protect the woman he loved from the secret of her past. I was overjoyed when Erin finally found a love that would cherish and heal her for all time.BRAVO, Selena.

This first volume contains two such papers. The first, by Dr. Gary Macy one of the editors of this series, presents the evidence for the ordination of women in the early Middle Ages. This evidence, however, is set in the larger context of the changing definition of ordination that took place in the twelfth-century.Up until the twelfth-century, the Latin terms, ordo (order), ordinatio (ordination), and ordinare (to ordain) indicated one's role in the church or the society at large and the ritual which celebrated and effected the installment of a person into such a role. Since women as well as men fulfilled important roles in church and society, they were considered be \\"ordained\\" into these positions as much as were men. Thus, a king was said to be \\"ordained\\" when he was crowned king and so was a queen. An abbot was \\"ordained\\" when he was installed as abbot and so was an abbess. A deacon was \\"ordained\\" into the diaconate and so was a deaconess.This changed in the twelfth-century when theologians and canonists began to insist that the only \\"true\\" ordination was an ordination to those roles which served at the altar, that is, the subdiaconate, the diaconate and the presbyterate. Further, only men could serve in these roles. In order to explain the many ancient sources that referred to the ordination of kings, queens, abbots, abbesses and deaconesses, the canonists held that these were merely blessings and not true ordinations. The ancient sources had been sadly inexact in their terminology. These arguments so completely won the day that scholars, such as Fr. Martin, could state that \\"there were, of course, no ordinations of women to Holy Orders during this period.\\" Fr. Martin is referring, as the readers of his paper would certainly understand, to ordination in the sense that it has been used since the twelfth-century. In this sense, true sacramental ordination can only take place when a person is accepted into the orders of subdeacon, deacon, or priest; roles limited from the twelfth-century to males.Dr. Macy's article, which originally appeared in Theological Studies, 61 (September, 2000): 481-507, gives the background to the earlier understanding of ordination and discusses some of the controversy surrounding the change in the definition of ordination which occurred in the twelfth-century. Dr. Macy further makes the point that merely establishing that the church once considered women to be properly and sacramentally ordained in the past does not immediately argue for or against ordaining women in the present. The Christian church has done many things in the past which Christians now would be loath to imitate, for instance, the Crusades or the inquisitions. Of course, Christians in the past have also done many admirable things present Christians might do well to revive. The question of which practices from the past we in the present ought to imitate (and which practices in the present should be abandoned) must be examined carefully and conscientiously and prayerfully based on the best discernment of the Spirit for present circumstances. Dr. Macy's article, then, is included to provide a general introduction to the history of ordination in Christian history that is essential for understanding of the changing role of women's status in Christian ministry and the relationship of such a history for the modern question of the ordination of women.Fr. Martin's learned and detailed study takes up the question of the ordination of women after women had already been excluded from the ordained ministry. Originally published in the Spanish Dominican journal of theology, Fr. Martin's impressive study has until now been extremely difficult for audiences to obtain, particularly in the United States. Fr. Martin presents here an amazing array of sources, proving that there was a continuous interest in the question of why women could not be ordained. In fact, the question was a reoccurring concern of theologians from the thirteenth through the sixteenth-centuries, precisely at a time when women had already been excluded from sacramental ordination. The many authors discussed by Fr. Martin were concerned with giving a reasonable explanation as to why women were so excluded from the ordained ministry since there seemed to be no obvious reason why this should be done. The problem was compounded by the fact that these authors were aware of sources which referred to women as ordained.As Fr. Martin demonstrates, there seems to have been no one consistent reason given for the exclusion of women from ordination and that many of the reasons given by modern Christians for not ordaining women differ from those of the later Middle Ages. Perhaps, the several reasons offered never quite justified the current practice and so had to be constantly refined and reasserted by each new generation of scholars. In any case, Fr. Martin's article provides an invaluable guide to the social, political, and theological background to the centuries-old Christian practice of excluding women from sacramental ordination."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"Catherine Anderson is one author you won't forget and fans of this gifted author will welcome the return of her favorite family - the Coulters. In MY SUNSHINE, Anderson delivers an incredibly poignant contemporary bursting with her usual flare. This is one author who continues to push the romance genre forward by blending sweetness with remarkable insight.Isaiah Coulter is the youngest Coulter -- successful, attractive, and very desirable. Isaiah has his life planned, and his planned life does not include a wife - at least not anytime soon! Veterinary medicine is a demanding field!Laura Townsend is attractive and very lonely. Once Laura Townsend was an environmental scientist, today she is happy to be a kennel keeper at the Coulter Animal Clinic. Laura Townsend refuses to dwell on life's \`what ifs' and instead lives each day within a sunny outlook.Ms. Anderson develops a wonderful, warm romance for Isaiah and Laura. Isaiah realizes his life is empty and little Miss Sunshine is the antidote. Laura would love to be in Isaiah's life, but Laura is also a realist. She has aphasia, five years ago a diving accident damaged her brain's left lobe, and sadly Laura realizes she must deny Isaiah. What Isaiah needs is an accomplished woman, who can complete his potential, he must not settle for less.MY SUNSHINE is an admirable read. Catherine Anderson writes with respect and shrewdness for the aphasia condition. Again I discovered Anderson can bring her reader a new understanding for a perplexing condition. Anderson's books are always worthy of notice and MY SUNSHINE is very noticeable. Grade: A-This review is based on an Advanced Reading Copy.Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"Last year I polled all my reading friends in November and had them email me the name of their favorite book for the year and their comments. I printed them all out and sent them with my Christmas cards to all my avid reader friends. They all loved the idea. When it came time to choose mine, I picked this one. I read it once and then a couple of months later read it again. I don't read weighty books, I read for light entertainment and so I don't ask a lot of a book. There have been some real disappointments even with my relaxed standards! And there have been some that I have really enjoyed, but this one stood out over all that I had gone through in 2005, probably close to 300 books.I have enjoyed all of Ms. Anderson's books, some more than others, but all were worth the read, and this brothers series has been totally enjoyable. I am sure that critics are right that there are probably MORE obstacles than are presented, but this is fiction and I know that not every heroine in real life is drop dead gorgeous and not every dream man is perfect like these guys, I know I am not reading about real life and enjoy the fantasy. Why can't this also be a world where handicapped is not as hard as in real life? I think the idea of addressing it and giving people an opportunity to think about it spreads a little more compassion and understanding than we have right now. Every time I write a review after reading the nay sayers who have written before me I just want to point out its fiction!!! Perhaps these people who find these books wanting ought to begin shopping in higher literary planes and leave the simple stuff to us more simple readers???"},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"I just recently started reading Catherine Anderson's contemporary romances (I love historical romances, never really was into modern romances, but Catherine's great writing \\"Keegan's lady\\", \\"Annie's Song\\", \\"Summer breeze\\", encouraged me to check out her contemporary love stories).I must say that while I really like this book, it is not Catherine's best. The premise of the story is unique, and the storyline had so much promise, but the book was slow the first 200+ pages. And there was so much concentration of vet work. I mean sure, healing animals is important, but the way Isaiah's work was portrayed, it was blown out of proportion.This book could have been shortened by at least a hundred pages. It takes Isaiah so long to realize that he loves Laura (it happens somewhere at 300+ pages). Had the story been shortened by at least a hundred pages, and had the romance started earlier, at least somewhere before 300+ pages, this would have been a great story.Nonetheless this is a good and enjoyable read, the last hundred pages are wonderful, and five star worthy."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"I started reading about the Coulter Family in late 04 because it was a romance involving horses (which is so rare to find.) As I read the story Bright Eyes I got so hooked that I had to continue reading the entire series. The one main thing I like about the series is that every woman in the story is not and I repeat NOT a barbie doll. Everytime I read a romance novel the woman is always a real life barbie doll. The women in this series all have something wrong, be it divorced with kids, a paraplegic, or have trouble speaking like myself, they're all average women. That in itself is hard to find.Another thing I love about Anderson's books is that she writes so well that it litterally pulls you into the story to the point that you stop to go do something and you're shocked to find out that hours have passed since you picked up the book, it's amazing, you really do feel like your right there with the characters.Reading Catherine's books have really reaffirmed my faith in love, being hurt everytime I've ever been in a relationship I can totally understand where her lady's are comming from. When I'm feeling down in that way all I have to do is pick up one of her books and when I'm done I realize I'm not alone. She's the perfect voice."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"Five years ago, environmental research scientist Laura Townsend nearly lost her life in a swimming accident when she hit her head on a rock. She suffered aphasia, a form of brain damage that affects language. Since then she lives in Crystal Falls, Oregon off her disability check supplemented by odd jobs like walking dogs for people.Veterinarian Isaiah Coulter cannot say no to his mother so when she asks him to hire Laura, he agrees to interview her. He realizes that she is ideal for the job so they agree to a trial period. As he observes her gentle healing touch that his clients seem to respond to, Isaiah falls in love; Laura reciprocates but believes he deserves a complete woman not someone who cannot remember how to say her name.MY SUNSHINE is an enjoyable contemporary romance starring a unique protagonist who has retained her intelligence, but suffered brain damage that has impaired her verbal communication skills. The story line is superb when the plot concentrates on Laura's struggles on the job and in her changing relationship with her boss. However an unnecessary bizarre spin of suspense takes away from the fabulous prime theme of an inspirational person overcoming her impairment through encouragement, caring and love.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"5th book in the Coulter family series.I actually read this book first over a year ago. It was one of the first few non-Nora Roberts romances I read. After reading Bright Eyes and Blue Skies, I figured I'd skim through it so I could catch some of the connections that I'd missed the first time around from not having read the preceding books. Instead, I pretty much ended up re-reading the entire book.My Sunshine focuses on Isaiah Coulter, who runs a veterinary hospital with his twin brother Tucker. Mary, the Coulter family matriarch, convinces Isaiah to interview the granddaughter of a friend for a kennel keeper job. Five years earlier, Laura had been happy and successful, but then a freak accident when diving into a river causes permanent brain damage. As a result, she suffers from a condition known as aphasia which affects her ability to read, write, and speak. She has made great strides since her accident, and underneath it all she is still the intelligent woman she once was, but her condition is permanent. She will always have speech problems and have difficulty reading and writing. Because of this, she can no longer do most jobs and is forced to do more menial jobs. She loves animals though and Mary gets her an interview at the animal hospital. Isaiah is wary, having trouble believing a woman with brain damage could perform the necessary duties of a kennel keeper, but he is quickly surprised by her, and is immediately draw to her perseverance in the face of adversity, her cheerful attitude, love of animals, and her beauty. They develop of close friendship, with both of them fighting deeper feelings; Isaiah because he believes he is not ready for a serious relationship, and Laura because she believes he deserves someone better than her. Eventually, they give in to their feelings, but all is not well because someone has is it in for Laura.My Sunshine is a wonderful romance. Anderson has a real knack for these kinds of stories. It's a real change of pace to read about characters with problems such as brain damage or blindness. It's nice to read a story that shows that just because tragedy has forever changed someone's life, they still can find happiness.Laura and Isaiah are a great couple. There friendship is a great base for a romantic relationship. You're just really drawn to these characters throughout the story. The bit of suspense is a nice addition to the story. It's adds a little extra meat.The first time I read this book, I liked it, but I didn't fully appreciate it. I was still pretty new to the overall romance genre, and was too focused on certain story aspects. But now that I've spent a year reading all different kinds of romances, I can look at this book more objectively. And I ended up liking it more. Definitely a great read in the romance/drama category.I know that there have been some criticisms of this book, along with Blue Skies, and Phantom Waltz (the 1st Coulter story) about their realism in dealing with disabled characters, but the fact of the matter is, unless you suffer from the affliction yourself, you are going to have a hard time in making a book truly realistic. You can do all the research you want, but you're still going to miss somewhere. Maybe Anderson's books lack a little realism, maybe not, but for the average reader, everything works.Rating: 4 / 5"},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"Ok... looks like a rather bizarre theme that Catherine Anderson has going on. Her heroines have huge impediments to overcome - blindness, spinal cord damage and now brain damage! But I love a good struggle and I loved Laura in this book. She sees life differently since a diving accident deprived her of some intellectual abilities. Her mind is sound; just the interpretation of it is skewed. Although her view of the world is rather nave and childlike - it is so enjoyable to watch her bring happiness to those around her. How could Isaiah (her boss), a well educated man, be so taken by her? But he is. Like other Anderson heroes, it is love at first sight - but he fights the attraction! After all, there is a written code about fraternizing with co-workers.You will root for Laura in all the trials she endures. Getting the job in the veterinarian's office as a kennel worker was one big hurdle and keeping it another. She has made one mistake with the food; and yet another with leaving a kennel door open! But she insists to Isaiah that it wasn't her - and that she has an eerie feeling someone else is in the building when she works the night shift. Will he believe her? Is there someone sinister out to get Laura?The romance and intimacy which you know will eventually occur is wonderful and sweet. But Laura will walk away from it all because Isaiah needs someone accomplished and charming; not someone \\"stupid\\" like her. How will it all work out in the end? I was captivated by all the main and secondary characters and the warm Coulter family. Of course I am endeavoring to obtain and read the entire series.

I can hardly wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"I couldn't come up with something to describe how this book made me feel. I read the whole thing, so it at least deserves a 3 star vote; however, Isaiah and Laura really didn't have any internal conflicts with one another: they were TOO perfect together.Love is about a challenge, trying to figure out the pros and cons of a potential lover... sacrificing some of yourself to find true love.The two leads seem to take EVRYTHING the other did in stride. There was hardly any awkwardness between them and there SHOULD have been with Laura having aphasia, something I'd never heard of. Even the most accepting people in life are curious about abnormalities. It's not a crime to indulge that curiosity at times.The conflict between them was external-- and really weird outside help, too. Belinda was psychotic and there was only one time where I saw a hint that she had a problem with Laura. She seemed to be one of those at work that thought she was a great person.I just wanted more contact between Laura and Belinda and we rarely had any until the end.Tucker was crude. I'm supposed to want to read his story after he was such a jerk with a woman with a disablity? As typical Catherine Anderson, I'm sure his lady friend will have something not right with her.The first few books I've read by Catherine Anderson were good books, BUT she goes over the top with the couples. Sometimes things out of their mouths border on unrealistic.I even stopped reading one of her books after the lead character fell HEAD OVER HEELS in love with a woman he'd just met, a woman with a baby that he'd met on a railroad car. He'd been homeless for awhile, was rich, and then turned his whole life around to be a rich and normal guy again after meeting this woman the FIRST day. WTF? That book was entitled Baby Love. I strongly suggest not wasting money on that book.Bright Eyes was another one that was OK, but the best friend of the lead character Carly was UNBELIEVABLE! If I knew someone like this I'd be crazy to hang with them. Catherine has the potential for a really good read if she'd leave some of the insanity out of them.This book had started to annoy me but I kept reading. It really isn't one of her best. The best I've read by her was Only By Your Touch. That was an awesome book, and even though it contained the notion of magic, it was written extremely well.But sadly the others have gotten too sappy and too predictable for me. I don't think I'll read another book by this author."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"This is one of my favorite love stories. It is so refreshing to read a story where the heroine is not the modle of perfection physically and no one writes these types for stories like Catherine Anderson. She has a true gift for pulling at your heart strings. I could read this book over and over... and I do. Just love it!"},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"I loved the idea of this book, I liked the characters (I thought they were extremely sweet together), & I've always had a special fondness for Anderson's Coulter Family Series. However, I don't think she did very much research concerning the care of adult dogs & puppies & day-to-day practices of a vet clinic. My grandmother & mother are both dog breeders. My grandmother has raised poodles for thirty years. My mother has raised dogs (cocker spaniels, poodles, bloodhounds, chihuahuas, & schnauzers) for twenty-five years. I'm twenty-one, so that's well over my entire life. I have been deeply involved in the business since before I could even walk or talk. There were several errors or really just odd things involving both the care of adult dogs & the care of the puppies. I have helped raise several litters of puppies where either the mother refused to care for the puppies,her milk had gone bad, or the mother had died; the most recent a yorkie puppy a little over a year ago. The following is a list of some of the errors & just plain odd things below:1)Every vet clinic I've been to has always had those metal kennel cages (that always look the same) where they keep the dogs that have just had surgery, have just given birth, are in labor, or still have i.v.'s in them. They also, of course, have the outside or inside kennel pens. I don't think Isaiah had ANY cages for those puposes. A lot of those dogs shouldn't have been in the pens.2)Why did they use doll bottles? Every vet I've ever known has the little bottles made specially for puppies & kittens. If he didn't have any, why didn't they just go to a pet store and buy some? They always have them.3) Why did they buy 13? It seems like it would have made it harder to deal with rather than easier. You only need a few bottles, depending on how many people you have helping. We had a litter of 16 bloodhound pups; Daisy's (the mother) milk went bad. We raised 13 of them from the time that we realized her milk was bad (2 days after birth). 3 of them died shortly after we took over because they were poisoned by Daisy's milk. Believe me, we didn't have 13/16 bottles of formula sitting in our fridge.4) Isaiah fed the puppies w/ a syringe, I believe, @ one time. As a vet he should know not to feed puppies or kittens w/ a syringe or an eye dropper, either. Something about b/c you're controlling the amt. of milk the pup is getting, it can easily leak into the puppy's lungs, cause them to aspirate, & possibly lead to death. Bottles are much safer.5) From what I read, it sounded as if the puppies were \\"doing their business\\" all on their on. Puppies that young have to have help eliminating their waste. They have to be stimulated. That has never been my favorite part of raising puppies.6) A whole litter of puppies generally opens their eyes @ 10-14 days. This book's litter did it @ like 7 days.I really got into the story, the plot, of this book, but I never could see Isaiah as a vet. When you're reading a book, the characters are alive to you. Isaiah just wasn't as alive as he could have been. He didn't know a lot of stuff that he should have known, that he should have had experience with."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"Loved my sunshine. It runs along the same themes as her other books, so don't expect to be amazed with originality or by the small mystery/suspense part of the story. However, I love the way she has female characters who are flawed (not genius supermodels like in most romance novels) yet win out in the end. A great heartwarming read. I read it in one sitting. I will definitely reread this book."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"I've read all of Catherine Anderson's books and I especially like to re-read this one at this time of year because most of the story happened from Halloween to Christmas and it helps get me in the holiday mood. Most of Catherine's books are just too \\"perfect\\", meaning the hero is always too good to be true to be believable. He's usually always over 6 feet tall, handsome, built, sexy, well-educated, already owns a huge house, is in his 30's and single! One thing that really drove me nuts in this book was Catherine's use of the work \\"fabulous\\". Come on! Everything is NOT fabulous! She needs to rotate her adjectives! Another thing that I noticed in all of her books are some of the same sayings such as \\"like a cat in a room full of rockers\\" and \\"clapped eyes on\\", etc., etc. I can see some of the members of the same family using some of the same sayings, but this seems to happen in all of her books. She shouldn't repeat those all the time.All in all, if you like to read romantic fiction to take you away from it all, Catherine Anderson's novels will do that. Just expect them to be sort of like fairy tales."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"Laura Townsend used to be an environmental scientist. Then, five years ago, a diving accident almost killed her. She has spent those years fighting aphasia, the accident's permanent after effect, and she has been remarkably successful thanks to excellent therapy and her own hard work and determination. She functions well enough, at last, to live on her own and work part time - but not as a scientist. Since using language remains a challenge, Laura now cleans houses and walks dogs. When her beloved grandmother's neighbor suggests Laura as a possible kennel keeper for a veterinary hospital jointly owned by that neighbors' twin sons, both veterinarians, Laura lands the job despite Isaiah Coulter's initial reluctance to even consider someone with brain damage. Laura turns his stereotype on its head, and she soon convinces everyone else at the hospital, too, that she can not only do the job; she can do it remarkably well, thanks to her almost uncanny way with animals. Laura is also a beautiful woman whose genuine kindness and upbeat temperament intrigue confirmed bachelor Isaiah in spite of what he considers to be his better judgment. But someone at the clinic does not think as well of Laura as everyone else does, because someone goes to work trying to get Laura fired by making her appear responsible for a series of \\"mistakes\\" that no employer could excuse.Catherine Anderson's romances delight me even though I generally find the genre mind numbing. Her characters have flaws, and yet they quickly make me care what happens to them. I read this book in two evenings. It was great fun!--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of \\"Granite Island\\""},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"Let me start this off by saying that I really don't like books about people overcoming tragedies or handicaps. The characters in those books come off as incredibly saintly, showing how horrible the rest of us are in comparison, because even without terrible things to overcome, we're merely human.Let me assure you, My Sunshine is not that kind of book. The heroine of My Sunshine does indeed have a tragic handicap to overcome. But she's also very human. That makes all the difference.Laura Townsend used to have everything going for her. She was intelligent, and had a brilliant career. Then a head injury resulted in aphasia, meaning the once articulate woman now has trouble saying words of more than two syllables, counting, and can read only the simplest things and only with great difficulty, actually much more than her doctors had expected from her, and accomplished after a great deal of determined work. Now the only job she can get is cleaning up in a veterinarian's office, and that only as a favor to veterinarian Isaiah Taylor's matchmaking mother and her friend.My Sunshine explores this unusual handicap with warmth and sympathy, without ever descending into sappiness. Laura and Isaiah face problems both because of and unrelated to her disability.I knew Catherine Anderson had pulled me in with her previous books, but I was still wary of this one--a brain-damaged heroine? I was expecting Forest Gump. I was wrong, and was very happy to be so."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"I liked this book, I truly did. I have been reading all of the Coulter series and I'll admit, I'm hooked; I will end up reading everything from Anderson that I find. That being said, I could *not* read this book with out recalling the others I have read by this author. A blind woman. An abused woman. A paraplegic. Now someone who can't use language? It really took something away from the book I felt, because all I can see in the heroine is another victim. It's becoming a theme, which makes the story seem more cookie-cutter than beautiful."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"Catherine Anderson always puts out a great story.Laura and Isaiah is another romance with a woman who knows how to stand on her own and a man who is able to appreciate her."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"Love all books of the Coulter Family. Love how Ms. Anderson creates her characters and inter twines them with people disability issues, that's life and it happens and we all deserve love. Thanks so much!"},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"I didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. I'd read previous reviews of the author's work that didn't have such kind words for it, so I didn't go in expecting much. But honestly? Even if it is cliche and formulaic it was still good. Sometimes you just want to read something sugary and unrealistic for the sake of it.And even so, the characters didn't feel entirely like cardboard cutouts. Sure, Laura was the standard pretty heroine who thinks she's not good enough and Isaiah was the perfect hunk in shining armor, but they were cute and likeable and I was rooting for them to get together the whole way through. The Coulter family was a lot of fun, too, even though Tucker grated on my nerves now and then, and the Thanksgiving chapter made me smile. Happy family scenarios are a big weakness of mine. And I liked how their first time together wasn't perfect, too, and that they weren't both virgins. Laura had it right when she said it was good one of them knew what to do.Of course, it has its flaws, two of them which almost made me stop reading. As I mentioned before, Tucker grated on my nerves at times, especially near the end where he told Isaiah all the reasons he shouldn't marry Laura-even AFTER he forgave her and accepted that the incidents around the kennel weren't her fault! Of course, I also didn't care for the way Laura just happened to overhear only that part of the conversation and ran away from the relationship in tears. I know poor communication can happen to any couple, but you'd think Laura would have more confidence in herself and Isaiah's love for her after he's proven time and time again how much she means to him.And of course, the Other Woman with a crush on the hero was the villain all along and a crazy psycho to boot. I'm not sure whether we were supposed to be surprised given how sympathetically she was portrayed all along, or to think \\"I knew it\\" thanks to her insisting the Rainbow Bridge was a crock. Either way, the transformation from helpful friend to man-stealing vamp was clumsy and irritating, and that's not even getting into the sexist implications behind it.But overall this was a good read. Predictable? Yes. Shmaltzy? Of course, it's a romance novel. But there's something to be said for guilty pleasures and good old-fashioned fluff entertainment. The main characters are likeable, the supporting players are colorful, the romance is wonderfully paced and the ending is lovely.Oh, and there's puppies in this book. Lots of puppies. I'm a cat person, but I can't say no to cute dogs."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"This is such a sweet, heartwarming romance. I love that this author's heroines do not usually fit the stereotypical mold. So many of them have real problems. It is awesome to sit down and read a book with girls that have real problems just like myself and my friends do. Isaiah is such a sweetheart. I was wishing that I could be with him by the end of this book. Laura is almost too good to be true, but it manages to work out to be an excellent love story. I would highly recommend to anyone that is a fan of romance."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"I read this book every time I need a pick-me-up. This is such a beautiful love story and I cannot get enough no matter how many times I've read it. This was the book that solidifyed Catherine Anderson as one of my favorite authors and this is an example of Ms. Anderson at her very best. I love the complexity that is Laura and fell in love with Isaiah right along with her. There is nobody else out there who can right a complex heroine like Catherine Anderson and this book leaves me in awe of her talent. This book leaves you feeling warm, happy, and utterly content. I highly reccommend to anyone who loves a good romance."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"I have read all of the books in the Coulter series at least once but My Sunshine is the one that I keep coming back to. I read it every couple months because the story never gets old. From the beginning the story is very sweet and endearing and it's very hard to put down once you have started. The two main characters, Laura and Isaiah, have an instant chemistry that develops slowly through the book into something very real and romantic. Laura is a very intelligent young woman that was reduced to menial jobs because of a brain injury. Isaish is kind enough to give her a chance at his vet clinic as one of the kennel keepers as a favor to his mother. Laura quickly becomes a favorite among the staff and with Isaiah. When 13 puppies face being put down Laura steps in and offers to care for them. Isaiah offers to let her move in with him temporarily because Laura does not have room in her apartment. Over the next couple weeks the two of them fall in love with each other.I love this book because it lets you know that love is possible anywhere and that it can overcome all kinds of obstacles. I highly recommend this book and the rest of the Coulter series."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"The heroine in this story suffers from aphasia because of a brain injury many years ago. Her name is Laura. She has trouble speaking long words. She has trouble counting. She sees some numbers and letters backwards. Despite everything, she has managed to live an independent life and hold a job.She has accepted that men will no longer be interested in her because of her speech problems. She never expects to find love again.Enter our hero - Isaiah - a veterinarian with a warm heart that needs a good woman to take care of him because he stays so busy that he simply forgets to take care of himself. He overlooks the heroine's bad speech and sees her big heart.The story was just a little slow to get going, but it was so worth it. I loved the story. It is incredibly sweet."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"Really enjoyed this book -- Catherine Anderson is one of my favorite authors and this is a great read!"},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"Laura suffered a accident five years prior and as a result, she now has a form of brain damage called aphasia. She can live a pretty normal life, just has a hard time counting and saying 3 word syllables. She comes to work for Isaiah,a veterinarian and a real sweeet guy who has no interest of a relationship for a couple of years yet. As they spend time together, they start falling in love with each other slowly but each deny it. Overall the story was great and there is an underlying mystery that is easy to see who the assailant is (why I gave it a 4), but it was a sweet story. The love scenes were great and I loved that she took the time to develop their relationship and it wasnt at all forced. The only real downside is that it dragged on at times and that Laura sometimes seemed a little too nice. This was my first Coutier family read and I felt lost at times, like I should know some of the other characters, so I recommend that you do not start with this one. I am going back and start the stories at the beginning."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"A book in a series which I wish to own by another of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"Once again a wonderfully written story n the Coulter family series by Catherine Anderson. You won't want to put it down!"},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"This basically feel-good romance between veterinarian Isaiah Coulter and his new employee Laura Townsend, who suffers from aphasia, will probably not be very surprising to Anderson fans. The strategies Laura uses to create a rich and satisfying life for herself were fascinating to me, but I was a little uneasy at the same time; some of the details didn't mesh very well with other things I've read about aphasia.Also, the violence in the main conflict got more intense than I would have liked, and the book struck me as just plain crude in places in its language and comparisons."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"Mixed feelings on this one. I read it on Kindle, after coming across it on several List-mania recommendations.Just an okay read. Disappointing. Fairly boring and predictable. I'd give it 3 stars if it were shorter, without all the filler scenes.I liked the idea of a heroine (Laura) who struggles with aphasia due to a diving accident, limiting her speech, language and verbal memory. Kudos to the author for including such an interesting and unique lead character.However, Anderson was inconsistent in her treatment of the aphasia issue. It's a challenge to write dialogue for a person with a language impairment, but having taken that challenge, it's important to do it right.Nonetheless, I appreciated the aphasia dynamic. It added a lot to the story! :-)I liked Laura and Isaiah. I was rooting for Laura, and happy to see her learn the ropes of a new job. I liked the setting, the veterinary clinic. I liked many of the coworkers at the clinic, and all the animals.I liked Isaiah, too. Glad to see Isaiah get fed. Ha, ha! Why do I like this in books? I don't know, but I am drawn to stories where hungry guys get a good meal. Glad that Isaiah believed in Laura's innocence, despite the evidence.But the story went on and on. At 432 pages, I expect a complex plot, an epic adventure, or a sweeping love story. Not so. This was a mundane plot. Should be only 300 pages, in my view. Predictable, too. No spoilers, but I predicted \\"who dun it\\" early on.Liked the Coulter family, including the warm-hearted matriarch, Mary Coulter.Did NOT appreciate all the religious swear words. More than a dozen occurrences of Christ or Jesus as expletives or intensifiers. More than 50 of Oh God. It offends, plus it did not fit the warm family feel of the rest of the book or the characters.And, I'm sorry to say... the sex scenes were boring. They just did nothing for me. Not sure why, either.Not worth all the hype, in my view."},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"Excellent! This was a hard to put down book,couldn't wait to read the next chapter. I love all of Catherine Anderson's books. she has a way to make you feel all the characters, and may make you think about what's important in life! I love the Coulter family, are there really men like Hank and Zeke and Ryan? I've read every one of her books!"},{"Title":"My Sunshine (Coulter Family)","review":"To me this was a cute love story. Laura and Isaiah aren't your ideal couple at first, but you get to know each one of them and realize they are perfect for each other. I absolutely loved Isaiah because he was able to see Laura's heart and not her condition. This story just reminds me that love can conquer all."},{"Title":"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle: Inspirational Meditations for New Mothers","review":"I have enjoyed reading through this after the birth of all my babies.

This particular volume contains the strips from the years 1957 and 1958 (I bet you didn't get that out of the title).The best thing that I can say is 'it's about time.' And then ask a few questions. Why hasn't this been done before? What's the next strip for which this should be done?I guess that if you don't know 'Peanuts' like if you've been a time warp or something, you'd want to know that this book is complete with Charlie Brown, Snoopy (the hairy face series), Lucy and Linus (Beetoven is here in strength, along with his blanket) and the rest.My only complaint, publish more than two a year.

Only the nine standard characters appear in this book, which is just enough for a baseball team. Charlie Brown remains the main character, but Lucy, Snoopy and Linus are all increasing in popularity. The remaining characters in order of number of appearances from most to least are: Schroeder, Violet, Patty, Shermy, and Pig Pen.There are numerous strips in this collection which have never appeared before, as well as many classics. There are strips on Stereophonic-Fussing, and Hi-Fi-Fussing; many strips on baseball, including classic sequences where the other team refuses to play and just laughs, where the team is able to win when Charlie Brown is sick, and of course where Charlie Brown drops the fly ball that would have won them the championship (it is never explained how the team makes it to the championship); and the start of the signs advertising Beethoven's Birthday including the number of shopping days.As with the previous books of the series, this one leaves the reader eagerly awaiting the next release."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1957- 1958 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"Each year for Christmas I give my husband a new set of theseHe loves them and looks forward to getting the each year"},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1957- 1958 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"Peanuts is still relevant.

This quite pisses me off...Finally, a Peanuts collection in chronological order and nothing left out.

Calvin & Hobbes, Farside, Tintin, Asterix & of course Peanuts.I have the first two, and I'm on my way with Peanuts... It's going to be a long and interesting 11 years..."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1957- 1958 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"This fourth volume shows Peanuts keeping the stride it slowly established over the first six years of its existence. Here the characters pretty much look as they will look for decades to come. The cast also becomes more solidified with Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Schroeder, Pig Pen, and of course Snoopy. Shermy, Violet, and Patty show up far less frequently than earlier. Schulz would add more characters later (most notably Woodstock, Peppermint Patty, and Marcie), but here he established his core cast.Snoopy completely comes into his own here, and his image on the cover couldn't be more appropriate. He appears with startingly more frequency throughout 1957 and 1958. By the end of this volume his top spot gets nearly set in stone. And it's not hard to see why. Here the long transformation from the \\"real\\" pet dog of the early 1950s to an almost surreal fantasm of a dog nears fruition (he still hasn't put on his WWI goggles or quaffed root beer yet, though). The imitations that began in the last volume continue inexorably here. He becomes a polar bear, a pouncing wild animal, a sea monster, he imitates Lucy, he gets called \\"ol' Dime a Dozen\\" and \\"Fuzzy Face\\", he imitates a penguin, and, best of all, a vulture. He also begins to really appreciate classical music (he even accompanies Schroeder on violin), sleeps with his head in his dog dish, and violently whips Linus around by his blanket. The extent of his transformation shows on the January 7th, 1958 strip where Charlie Brown says \\"The teacher told us to make a drawing of a real dog.\\" Snoopy has truly come into his own. And later on, he became the most recognizable character of the Twentieth Century apart from Mickey Mouse.Charlie Brown continues his quest for something meaningful and positive. But, as usual, some snags occur. He singlehandedly loses the baseball championship, is absent for his team's first win, gets tangled up in a truss of kite strings, and says \\"rats!\\" an awful lot. The strip on September 4th, 1957 shows Charlie Brown acquiesing in the very depths of his misery. Linus asks him \\"Doesn't looking at all these stars make you feel sort of insignificant, Charlie Brown?\\" He answers, \\"No, I'm so insignificant already it doesn't bother me.\\" Like most of Peanuts, Schulz brilliantly mixes the sad with the funny.Some of Schulz's legacy also shows in this volume. At least two cartoons appear here that must have provided some inspiration for Bill Watterson, creator of the incredible \\"Calvin And Hobbes\\". A Sunday strip from Jaunary 26, 1958 shows Linus vengefully sculpting a hideous snow monster to devour Lucy's \\"snow bunnies\\".And, on January 18th, 1958 Linus and Charlie Brown wax historical while wiping out on a snowsled. These remind us that Schulz had great influence on more or less all late twentieth century comic strip art. No one yet has emerged from the enormous shadow that \\"Peanuts\\" cast on the medium.One of the volume's absolute highlights is the Feburary 23rd, 1959 Sunday strip. Charlie Brown walks through the neighborhood while the other children scorn, mock, and laugh at him. when he finally arrives home he switches on a radio to hear \\"...and what, in this world, is more delightful than the gay wonderful laughter of little children?\\" He gives the radio a good boot. This masterpiece of a strip encapsulates the entire story of Charlie Brown. And this volume helps encapsulate the legacy left by one of the greatest comic strips ever created. Not only that, \\"Peanuts\\" not only influenced its own medium, but in the 1960s it influenced television, music, Broadway, and humor in general (especially of the self-deprecating sort). As each volume of this great series by Fantagraphics appears, that influence becomes easier and easier to appreciate."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1957- 1958 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"This is the fourth book in a proposed 25 book series that will publish all of the nearly 18,000 strips in Charles Schulz' Peanuts catalog. And again, it is a terrific tribute to two years of the man's work, this time chronicling the years 1957 and 1958. Of the four books published to date, this book had many more strips which I was familiar with than the other three. But there were still quite a few strips that I have never seen before, making it another fun reading experience. The strip quality is better in general in this volume as it appears the publishers had access to quality masters to provide reproductions than they had in previous versions (I only noticed one strip that looked a little blurred in this book). Obviously if you have the other three books, you'll be getting this one and you can expect more of the same great quality.It was also nice to see that the publishers have kept their word where they said that if they found better or more complete strips that they would republish them in future books. In this book, they republish a strip from the second volume where they didn't have a complete strip (they actually had to have an artist draw the missing panels). But somebody out there had the complete strip and it has been republished here and is fully documented.My only complaint about the books is that 2 books a year just isn't fast enough! The year 2016 is a long time to wait for the entire 25 volumes to be complete!"},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1957- 1958 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"In this installment of the Peanuts comic strips from 1957-1958, Charles M. Schulz's world is taking recognizeable shape. Raders who like me were born in the 1950s will begin to recognize the strip as they first read it in the newspapers or in those little 50 cent paperbacks Dell used to put out. Since we now have all the strips instead of just selections, we can see storylines taking complete shape and gags developing and sometimes repeating themselves with new characters and new slants.Charlie Brown has now evolved into the chronically depressed loser we all love, Lucy is the sometimes sadistic fussbudget, Linus the budding philosopher, Schroeder the Beethoven fanatic, and Snoopy is . . . Snoopy. Familiar themes show up for the first time: Snoopy climbs atop his doghouse (in three-quarter view),Charlie Brown crashes kite after kite and loses one ballgame after another (except when he's home sick!), and Lucy pines away for Schroeder, who's obliviously pounding away at his toy piano.There are some tremendously hilarious sequences, such as Snoopy pretending to be a vulture, and some intriguing reminders of the late 1950s in which these strips were created: hula hoops, hi-fis, fears of fall-out and bombs from space. These volumes are appearing six months apart, which is far too long to wait, especially since this one promises that the Great Pumpkin will appear in the next installment. Buy this one now and hope that April will come soon!"},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1957- 1958 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"Why bother to even review a book we all know is great? Fantagraphics Books is doing the world a service by gathering these strips together and leading each volume off with a forward by an interested writer; in this case, Jonathan Franzen. Still, what it's all about is the strips themselves.What I most noticed in this volume is how Snoopy is really coming into himself. More and more, he's becoming an amazing character, with his great reactions. The \\"fuzzy face\\" strips I still remember from reading them as a kid. (And you know, adults still speak a couple times over the course of these two years. I'd forgotten.)Anyway, I'm so happy I started collecting these volumes right away with volume one and I intend to continue collecting them to the end."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1957- 1958 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"Well, actually, once Charles M. Schulz got up to speed, which did not take long, almost every strip was a classic. Charles M. Schulz is the greatest American cartoonist who ever lived. Feel free to quote me! Fantagraphic Books is owed a heaping helping of gratitude for diligence of publication. Forget those previous publishers that dropped strips from the continuity or even printed the same strip twice in the same title. Leaving dates in the strip insures accuracy, precluding omissions. My, if Fantagraphics only printed the Sundays in color, they would deserve 6 stars!! (So, don't be giving away \\"Peanuts Jubilee\\" or other titles that reprinted Sundays in color.) Includes the entire fuzzy-face saga. A must buy for fans, public and school libraries. Hey, academic libraries, bless their pointy little heads, can buy a copy too!"},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1957- 1958 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"This particular installment of our semiannual \\"Peanuts\\" fix catches \\"Peanuts\\" at a point in time when Charles M. Schulz had really begun to hit his stride. Despite a few dated oddities, such as Lucy and Linus spending a week engaged in \\"stereophonic fussing,\\" the numerous mini- and micro-dramas enacted herein have begun to assume familiar contours. Charlie Brown is now firmly established as the ultimate loser and fall-guy, whose \\"soul is full of weeds.\\" He drops a fly ball to lose a \\"championship\\" game (I always wondered how Charlie's team managed to attain that opportunity in the first place, considering how inept they were), fights numerous losing battles with the kite-eating tree, endures constant insults and humiliation at the hands of Lucy, Patty, and Violet, and braves his first \\"official\\" Valentine's Day sans Valentines. (On a more pleasant note, he does begin regular correspondence with his pen-, er, pencil-pal.) Snoopy, meanwhile, has begun to dance and walk upon his hind legs on a regular basis, though he's still recognizably what he himself might call \\"a plain ol' 'dog' dog.\\" Linus is now thoroughly hooked on his blanket, barely surviving both Snoopy's repeated attempts to steal the prized poultice and Lucy's first attempt to wean him from it by force. The direct references to childhood pastimes (aside from that ol' standby, baseball) are beginning to wane as the characters slip more and more regularly into the \\"philosophical\\" mode that would come to be associated with the strip in its next, incredibly lucrative decade. The vast majority of the strips here have been reprinted at some point, making the few \\"no-see-ums\\" all the more intriguing to me. (My favorite among the latter: Linus explaining what appears to be a cowboy-and-Indian \\"fake gunfight\\" as, in fact, a game of \\"liberals and conservatives.\\" What would he be using today, multi-megaton bombs?) This comes with my highest recommendation. Big surprise, eh?"},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1957- 1958 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"There was a time when the newspaper comic strip was HUGE. In the early 1900s, the success of a newspaper was in part due to the comics it featured. That era has long since disappeared, and it often seems that the comic strip is a neglected relic. There are still some good comics out there, but they are getting rarer and the newspapers treat them with less and less respect, cramming many onto a single page that used to hold just a few.Where does Peanuts fit into all this? Well, it is the most popular comic strip of all time. Does any other strip have anything close to its legacy of movies, TV shows, plays, books and merchandise? And happily, it is deserving of its success; it is arguably the best comic strip ever, and certainly one of the top ten or so. As a result, it is not hard to see why the newspapers continue to publish old strips years after its creator, Charles Schulz had died. They don't stop printing it or allow another artist to take it over. The comic strips overall are a pale shadow of what they once were, so repeats of Peanuts can prosper because nothing new can replace them.Volume 4 of the Complete Peanuts is where the characters are really beginning to show their full development. We have Lucy, the champion fussbudget and Linus, her philosophical brother with a dependence on his security blanket. Schroeder is the budding musical genius. Patty, Violet and Shermy are mostly supporting characters at this point; they will be eventually replaced by other characters (but not in this volume).The two key roles, however, are those of Charlie Brown and Snoopy. Snoopy is up to his usual antics, pretending to be a vulture, grabbing at Linus's blanket and relaxing in his water bowl. He also starts his practice of lying on top of his dog house, although his first attempts are not all that successful. Charlie Brown is, well, Charlie Brown, the ultimate loser who the Fates themselves conspire against. Kites won't fly for him, pens constantly smear and if, by some remote chance, his baseball team is doing okay, they heavens themselves will open up and rain out the game. His \\"friends\\" are often cruel to him (with the exception of the benevolent Linus and the aloof Schroeder). In a way, the main theme of Peanuts is defined in the very first strip (in volume 1) when Shermy says, \\"Good old Charlie Brown...How I hate him.\\" This seems to be the way the whole world thinks of this hapless character.Peanuts may seem to some to be just an overrated strip, but I don't think that's so. It may be overly merchandised, but the comic itself is a cornerstone of the genre and one of the most influential strips out there. This volume again shows why Peanuts is one of the all-time greats."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1957- 1958 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"Here the Peanuts gang becomes familiar, as they start hitting the usual topics that would develop and blossom over the years. Every one of the main characters has secured their place, and Snoopy starts his development into the multi-faceted character we know and love.Probably the best thing about the book is that we watch Charles M. Schultz modify and mollify his characters. In 1957, quite a few of the Sunday cartoons show Lucy becoming too much the bully, abusing her younger brother viciously without cause and causing no end of pain to Charlie Brown. During 1958, Lucy develops a vulnerability and Linus becomes more an actor, sometimes getting back at his sister and sometimes causing his sister's temper tantrum (it's easier watching her blow up when she has a cause). Schultz could have blown things with Lucy, but with a few modifications between her and Linus, a balance is made that makes things more interesting.Now, here's to next April, and 1959-1960."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1957- 1958 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"Although there are a few cartoons which had never been published in book form (like hi-fi fussing), most of them could be found in collections like Good Ol' Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Peanuts Revisited, You're Out of Your Mind Charlie Brown, But We Love You Charlie Brown and Peanuts Every Sunday. Charlie Brown is the main character and resumes the role of the melancholy everyman. He writes his pencil pal often (he's not very good with a pen, he explains) and explains his dad is a barber (like Charles Schulz's real father) and his mother is a housewife and he also has a crazy dog named Snoopy. He gets made fun of by everyone and goes to the radio for solace, such as it is (\\"And what can be more delightful than the laughter of little children?\\"). He also catches the baseball and guess what? He drops it. The team goes home and cries- \\"It depresses a manager to see his team cry\\" is his only comment! When he decides to camp out in his backyard, he gets scared by some loud howling (Snoopy, of course!). For Christmas of 1957, the entire Peanuts gang is scowling at Charlie Brown, just because he has his nametag upside down. Snoopy continues to do his impersonations, loves to dance and gets 2 nicknames (neither of them appreciated)- Fuzzy Face and Dime a Dozen (well, he may have a fuzzy face, but Snoopy was never a dime a dozen). Schroeder starts advertising Beethoven's birthday and shows Lucy his pictures from Germany (all of them featuring important landmarks of his hero Beethoven). Lucy, unimpressed, says \\"Why would they be so important if they weren't worth money?\\" Lucy is nominated as honorary chairperson of the National Fussbudget Association. Well deserved? You bet. She usually leads her Greek Chorus (Violet and Patty) to tear down Charlie Brown. Also, she always promises Charlie Brown she won't yank the football away (and he always believes her). When Charlie Brown has trouble flying his kite, Lucy shows her support- \\"Fly, you stupid kite, fly!\\" When Linus has trouble remembering his lines at the Christmas paegant, she knows the right cure! Linus has become more of a philosopher here (\\"Have you ever tried to glue crayons back together?\\") and sometimes gets the best of his older sister Lucy. When she refuses to let him help make snow bunnies, he makes a snow tyranosaurus rex to stomp the bunnies! When she ruins his sand castle sculpture with her bicycle, he uses the pliers to unscrew her bike! He insists on playing baseball with his security blanket and gets annoyed by the question \\"Hey, Linus, does that thumb taste good?\\" Since the Great Pumpkin hadn't yet come into the picture, he joins Charlie Brown and Lucy for tricks or treats (\\"He's not very good with a scissors!\\"). Also, he is seen protesting by climbing the schoolyard fence. \\"I feel a need to be educated. In fact, I demand to be educated!\\" Just as soon as he demands, he holds both hands up in the air and forgets to hold onto the fence and falls headfirst! Pig Pen is made fun for his sloppy appearance and makes the world's dirtiest snowman. Shermy is more of a straight man and would soon be replaced by Linus as Charlie Brown's buddy. While Peanuts had pretty well established itself in 1957-58, transition would occur in 1959."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1957- 1958 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"This book reminds us all how brilliant Peanuts was in the first several decades of its life. Though I felt the strip became less piquant and a bit too \\"nice\\" in its observations about life in the last few years before Schulz' retirement, the early years were sharp and inciteful, as you'll see from this book.Nothing can touch some of the observations in the Peanuts series. I still remember vividly the strip in which Linus excitedly told Charlie Brown about the most amazing football game he had ever seen on TV, in which the home team was trailing with seconds left but courtesy of a miracle play scored with no time left on the clock. Linus breathlessly added how people were pouring out of the stands and how all the home team's players and fans were celebrating together in rapturous joy over what had just happened. Charlie Brown's reply? After a soft \\"oh,\\" he finished the strip with this line: \\"How did the other team feel?\\"Amazing."},{"Title":"The forty-ninth magician,","review":"The 49th Magician has been a favorite of mine since I got my first copy at age 4 in 1971, and remains a favorite for me today at age 40!The story unfolds like I see life unfolding....when you are young (with but 1 magician) life's simplicity is a joy in itself.

The world-renowned author writes from his true experience of the world. This story is autobiographical in nature.This novel takes the reader on a journey of rural India through the eyes of a 16-year old boy .The panorama of the advancing Indian Monsoon adds a melodious romance to the novel. Bonds bold yet touching style of writing combined with the intriguing story and plot make this novel an engaging adventure. Winner of the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize in 1957, this book is a page-turner.Like the Indian bazaar itself, the book is filled with smells, sights, sounds, confusion and subtle organization of ordinary Indian life.Rusty, the hero of the novel is unhappy with his strict guardian &amp; being confined to the declining Euopean community in Dehra Dun Finally, one day he is bold enough to venture into forbidden Indian Territory. He meets ~Somi the Sikh boy. A boy of strange perpetual rejoices, he soon becomes Rustys best friend. ~Ranbir, Hindu by caste, and the strongest wrestler in the bazaar invokes in Rusty a rebellious spirit that earns him his freedom for life. Then there is Suri. Bespectacled and owlish to behold, Suri possesses an almost criminal cunning, and is both respected and despised by all who know him. His interests are confined to people and their privacies; which privacies, when known to Suri, are made public.After running away from home, his newfound friends shelter him and soon he gets a job as an English teacher of Mr. Kapoors son. Mr. Kapoor was once a rich man who has lost his job because of his addiction to alcohol.His only support is his lovely wife Meena who soon takes a special place in Rustys heart. But the most important member of the family is their son Kishan, who also becomes Rustys best friend. They have a lovely time together and Meena gives Rusty the best gift of his life. A lonely room on their houses roof. His very own room! Scarcely furnished, but incredibly close to the Banyan tree, and nature in general. A place he could call home.He called it ~ The room on the Roof_______Review written by- Jatin Vij"},{"Title":"The room on the roof","review":"Ruskin Bond penned this novella when he was only 17 years old in 1951, and I think it is an excellent book for everyone but for young people in particular. The story started in this book is continued in &quot;Vagrants In The Valley&quot;, and if you get this book, I suggest you also get &quot;Vagrants&quot; as it completes and complements this book nicely. Both books are semi-autobiographical and offer a very good glimpse into the &quot;real India&quot;. Although it may be said to lack a certain depth or maturity, the book hold up surprisingly well with repeated readings due to its perennial freshness and wonder. We follow our young hero as he leaves a domineering and hostile, suffocating environment with his English guardian to explore the world beyond the protestant community that he was raised in. He essentially becomes a vagrant, but he discovers his freedom as well, and goes on to make friends with several other street children of the bazaar. He gets his first job, falls in love with an older woman, and grows a good deal in the book, before taking to the road and leaving his hometown when it no longer has anything to offer him. The end of the book will kind of leave you hanging if you don't read the sequel. By itself, I would give this book a three-star rating, but when combined with &quot;Vagrants&quot; I would promote it to a four-star. The innocence of a young writer and the yearning for adventure shine through particularly well in this little delight of a book."},{"Title":"The room on the roof","review":"I read this book as part of my high school curriculum, many years ago. I have read it quite a few times hence. Bond brings out Dehradun so beautifully..."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Based mainly on the strength of the many 5-star reviews at Amazon.com, I purchased this book. While the price was not too bad, the author says he intends to write a simple \\"how-to\\" guide to meditation. While it is in many aspects simple, it is over-written. The structure is simple, while his choice of vocabulary is not. He chooses $5 words, when a $.25 word would be fine. The information could have been presented in a more concise manner, and the book could have been written in one-half to one-third as much space without losing any salient content.While the \\"how-to\\" content was sufficient, the author's rambling was distracting. After a while, I found myself ultimately having to skim for the morcels of good stuff.To the author: Please, next time, spare the editorialising and overuse of adjectives. I also purchased, but have yet to read, \\"Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness : Walking the Buddha's Path\\" (by this author). I hope it does not contain as many words serving only to fill space.

Seriously, find another intro book on meditation. I couldn't believe how the author repeated the same concepts over and over and over and over.

Everything else was meaningless fluff."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I have read only 80% or so of this book and can say with joy that it is one of the most simply beautiful and profound things I have ever read. I think most who pick it up, regardless of age, religious beliefs or lack of such, spiritual practice, travels, education, life experience....will find themselves in these pages. This book makes sense and gives hope. Most everyday people like me may find healthy habits hard to begin and sustain, but this book gives us a clearly stated reason to do so and to believe that our health and well-being will increase with our efforts and good faith, and that we may just bring help to others in the process. It seems to me with my reading so far that the practice here is very much in line, if not in form but in spirit, with many of the world's great religious and spiritual traditions and the very tried and true 12-step programs and other avenues to greater self love, care, and connection, and regard and compassion for others.

This type of meditation is used to gain insight. It does not involve the use of a mantra, but the breath alone, both in and out, is the focus of attention.

My relief was enormous, therefore, when a friend gave me this book by Venerable Henepola Gunaratana! This book is exactly what the title implies...easy to read and understand because it is not written in mystic hokum, rather it is written in plain english. The result is a manual for the beginning student of meditation that is sufficient to get you well on your way to benefitting from the practice of Insight Meditation.In &quot;Mindfulness&quot; you will gain an understanding of what mindfullness is, how to cultivate it both during sitting practice and the rest of the time, tips on how to sit and how to overcome some of the most common distractions (including your feet going to sleep and your back hurting), and what to look for and what to avoid. I have not been practicing meditation for long, and this book was of enormous value in helping me identify the things I was doing that served as barriers to effective insight meditation, as well as giving me ideas on how to enhance the effectiveness of my meditation.This is an extremely practical book for the western practitioner. It draws heavily upon the Buddhist paradigm, but the techniques for effective meditation cross all sect boundaries, and the beginning practitioner of any faith will find this book of enormous benefit. I would strongly encourage the reader to suppliment this book with &quot;The Miracle of Mindfulness&quot; by Thich Nhat Hahn. The two together are a delightfully easy to read but complete and well rounded introduction to the practices of Insight Meditation. If you want to know how but don't want to hire a Yogi to translate, this book is the place to start."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Mindfulness is not an easy concept to explain in words yet H. Gunaratana does a nice job of doing just that. First and foremost, this book is a beginner's guide to the practice of Vipassana (or Insight) meditation. Having it's roots in the Gutama Buddha's life over 2500 years ago, Vipassana meditation is a skill that takes only a short while to learn but a lifetime of dedication to master.The introduction gives a brief look at the roots of the practice and tells the reader that meditation is intrinsically experiential so the best way to get started is to just sit and try it. In the following chapters, Gunaratana helps the reader to understand exactly what meditation is and what it isn't. From there he goes into more detailed instructions as to what your mind and body should be doing while you meditate. This is accompanied with useful tips on dealing with problems that may arise in your practice, including the 5 major hindrances that nearly all meditators face. The book wraps up with a more in depth look at exactly what &quot;mindfulness&quot; is and how to &quot;take it from the cushion&quot; and integrate it into our daily lives.I found this book very easy to read and understand and feel it would be an excellent guide for people just getting into Buddhism and meditation. Already being the owner of a collection of books on Buddhism, this book didn't offer any new revelations but I was extrememly pleased with the sections on mindfulness and have already used some of the author's suggestions on integrating it into daily life. The main reason I did not give the book 5 stars is because it offers much more for the new reader than it does for one with more experience.If you buy this book and still feel like you could use more detailed instructions on meditation, I recommend you also purchase &quot;Change Your Mind: A Practical Guide to Buddhist Meditation&quot; by Paramananda (ISBN: 0904766810)."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I am a rationalist. I am not a mystic. I do not believe in chakras, yogic flying, psychic visions or tantric orgasm. I have a western scientific mind, and a very short patience for BS.I loved this book.Mindfulness in Plain English is a meditation manual that's been brutally stripped of superstitious hokus pokus. It's focused, straight-forward, practical, yet profound. It says what it means and it means what it says. And if you practice, really practice, you'll find the techniques it describes can honestly change your entire outlook on life in a frighteningly short period of time.If you're a skeptic, and you're interested in meditation as a psychological exercise rather than a mystical mystery, you'll do well with this book. If you need your chakras petted, look at any of its 10,000,000 lesser competitors in your local flaky pseudo-eastern bookshop."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I love this book. It is straightforward, thorough, and easy to read. I don't know who Gunaratana is, but he does a great job with this book. Even the layout of the book is clean and simple and pleasant.If you are interested in vipassana or mindfulness meditation, or even zazen, this book is worth reading. It tells you how to do this kind of meditation, and what to do with the problems that come up. It is a practical handbook and it's also fun to read. I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I can tell you with some authority that the techniques Gunaratana describes in this book work, and they are worth applying, even if you don't sit still. You can do your work with mindfulness. You can talk to your child with mindfulness. Anything can be a meditation. Mindfulness in Plain English will show you how. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Nothing I've read comes close to \\"Mindfulness in Plain English.\\" Besides explaining how to meditate, and why to meditate, Gunaratana lays out a lot of the underlying fundamentals of Buddhist thought. He provides by far the best description of nirvana(nibbana) that I've ever seen. Read this description, and you'll feel you understand the concept for the first time.He explains a variety of ways to meditate, details the kinds of problems you'll confront, and offers a variety of methods to deal with those problems. Instead of telling you \\"the\\" way to meditate, he helps you find your way to meditate.That's why this book is one you'll use, rather than just read. It's not like all those other trophy books we read once and then leave out for display, for ourselves or others.His writing style reminds me of the Dalai Lama's; it is eloquent, yet to the point. It's profound, yet practical. His writing is grounded in your immediate experience. It is not abstract, esoteric or grandly philosophical.I can't agree with the notion that this is a fast read. This isn't because it's a difficult read. There is a lot to absorb in a few pages. I found myself wanting to reread many chapters, just so I could articulate it myself. It is a very thought-full book."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Okay, I only gave this 4 stars because there were parts of it where I'd have much appreciated even more information and explanation.That said, I will admit that some of those parts dealt with processes that are hard to explain adequately in a book. But I still sat there at times thinking, \\"what? how, precisely, do I do that?\\" For example, in the section on dealing with problems that crop up during meditation, the author advises the reader to deal with physical pain by relaxing tensed muscles one by one, doing so very thoroughly. Now, that may sound simple to you. Perhaps I'm a dolt. I dunno. But I haven't a clue how to relax each muscle one at a time. I'm constantly amazed to find I have muscles where previously I thought I had none. ;-) I'm supposed to accomplish this muscle relaxation strictly through thought processes? Okay, I believe that's possible, but what do I do? Ack. Right after that, the author advises the reader to continue by going after the mental resistance next.Now, to be fair, the author admits there are no human words to precisely explain this process. And I feel in my gut that he's right, but I'm disgustingly literal and really require precision in explanation in order to think I can get my head around something new and challenging.Have I turned you off? If so, let me now say that I LOVE this book. I've never read anything that so clearly was written to help someone understand how to meditate for insight. The writer takes great care to explain the process as much as he is able to. The stuff that he doesn't explain--well, it's just not enough of a factor to make me dislike this book.After reading this book, you'll find yourself much more prepared to begin insight meditation, to begin walking a path of mindfulness, and hopefully, ultimately a peaceful and compassionate path. The goal of this book is not to teach you how to chant and simply relax (although relaxation is a wonderful side effect). Rather, the goal of this book is to change your life, to help you become more mindful, to see life as you really have it before you, to truly understand so that you can become fully present in that life. The author makes clear that this is a long process, one that will require dedication and courage from the meditator, and I truly respect how clearly he has communicated what will be expected of me.I plan to give copies of this book to people I love."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This book is really good. Text is clear. Nuts and bolts book about how to meditate. I feel good every time I think about this book. Writer is not only good meditation teacher, he is also good writer. If you don't know what to do with your mind, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This book is by far the clearest explanation I've ever read on what meditation is and how to do it (and I've read quite a few). This book covers Vipassana (\\"to see clearly\\"; AKA, Insight) meditation, which is the type of Buddhist meditation practiced in Southeast Asia and India. It's also the type of meditation the Buddha taught. Over the 2500 years Buddhism has existed, other schools have developed, but Vipassana does not conflict with any of them. This is the core of Buddhist teaching.Mindfulness in Plain English explains exactly what meditation is (at least what Vipassana meditation is, although it very briefly explains what other Buddhist meditation systems are about, again very clearly), why it's a worthwhile activity, and how to do it. It also answers the questions that meditators invariably end up asking of teachers. If you have a good meditation teacher, then you SHOULD buy this book. If you want to learn to meditate without relying on an experienced teacher as your guide, you MUST buy this book.I wouldn't call this book a light read. However, it's by no means a difficult read. The author is an EXCELLENT writer, but he's covering what is essentially a technical subject, and it's virtually impossible to cover such a topic in a way that is fun.If you're looking for a light read on Eastern spirituality, I instead strongly suggest Ram Dass' (AKA, Richard Alpert's) delightful, classic book, Be Here Now. I could also suggest, but much less enthusiastically, Autobiography of a Yogi, by Paramahansa Yogananda (whose name I undoubtedly just misspelled). If you want to read an absolutely beautiful, WONDERFULLY-written book, full of great stories, that's a good introduction to Vipassana meditation and, more broadly, the spiritual life, I strongly recommend Jack Kornfield's book, A Path With Heart. If you actually want to learn to meditate, read Mindfulness in Plain English."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is the book which brought my meditation practice into focus and brought me to Theravadan Buddhism. I first read it just after it was published in the early 90s. I have reread it several times since, each time gaining more insight - literally and figuratively. I cannot make the claim that it will have the same effect on you, but as the Buddha might say, try it and see for yourself.I like the precision of Bhante G's writing. This work is far more than a transcript of spoken discourses, like many contemporary Buddhist books. It is specifically created to be read, absorbed, reflected upon and practiced.When I come across a work that effects me so strongly, inevitably I wonder if the writer is as good as his word. I traveled to West Virginia to sit with Bhante G and the other monks and lay people at his monastery. As intellectually stimulating as his book is, sitting with him in the meditation hall was sublime. The man is a true living Buddhist master. He's a great writer too. Read his books."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This book is the best I've seen in explaining what meditation is(and it's not) without any extra religious baggage.The writting style is clear and somtimes humorous. The best part is what is not in the book: eightfold path, dragons, and swords of enlighted warriors. It directly explains why to meditate, how to practice it in a correct way. If you don't have access to a dedicated meditation master (and even if you do), you need this book."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is a very practical book about &quot;insight&quot;. It guides you through practical methods for discovering the internal mechanisms of your mind. These mechanisms in fact are the illusions your mind tries to project to fool you about your perceptions. It explains very simply the difference between the actual perception and what your &quot;everyday's life&quot; perception provides you.Of course meditation is the central tool of the book but the objective is about finding the difference between what you think you're feeling and what you actually feel. The theme of the book is about making you discover the &quot;true reality&quot;, nothing less. It might seem pedantic to state something like this but if you really understand this book you must see the world differently. If not, it means that the author has failed."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is truly a classic, a nuts-and-bolts guide to meditation, and probably the most comprehensive one ever written in terms of advice for dealing with distractions. I have meditated and taught meditation for many years, and realized as I was reading this 20th anniversary edition that I had read it before, about 15 years ago, and found it tremendously helpful at the time, but couldn't fully appreciate everything it had to offer. Reading it now, after more years meditating and teaching, I was truly awe struck at points. He characterizes so many distractions, and methods for dealing with them, in amazing detail.I especially appreciated his descriptions of 'thinking' vs. 'sinking' mind, and his concrete suggestions for dealing with both. I also appreciated his descriptions of the difference between mindfulness and concentration, and the balance that needs to be struck between both, and what happens when they are out of balance. He covers more basic distractions as well, in terms of physical pain, and feeling bored, etc. The brilliance of this book is that it could only have been written by someone like himself that has taught meditation for so many years, and to so many different people, because it seems virtually every possible hurdle is addressed.I think it's worth noting that this is written within the context of the Vipassana Buddhist tradition, so the type of meditation taught is rooted in focus on the breath, and on mindfulness or 'insight' meditation. He does frame this instruction within a Buddhist context, and outlines the Vipassana path to awakening. However, because so much of this book is general advice on meditating, and suggestions for dealing with distractions, this book will be of value even to people who practice or teach other forms of meditation, or are coming to meditation with stress-reduction or other aims besides spiritual. I myself teach chakra/kundalini based meditation, but didn't find this diminished my appreciation for the book - most of the meditation advice would apply to almost any path. Many of the additions/edits to this 20th anniversary edition are meant to clarify the Vipassana context, so that helps with this as well."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I have been attempting to meditate for years, but I have never had a coach or group to work, so I never knew what to \\"do\\". This book is a practical manual to meditating. The author covers just enough theory to let us know why we are doing certain things, without giving us too much information needlessly. I have found it incredibly helpful and for the first time in my life I am meditating on a regular schedule with a purpose. I highly recommend this book for any other beginners out there that want to know how to meditate. This book is concise and highly practical, with the stated goal of the author being that the reader should actually meditate, not just gain some general knowledge of meditating by reading the book. It is exactly what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I found this book to be a wonderfully practical guide to Vipassana. It opens the door, in a helpful, non-jargon way, to this meditation style in a way that anyone can understand. Highly recommended as a possible life-changer."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"As a beginner Buddhist I've read a handful of books regarding Buddhism and mindful living. All too often the books I've read have been more of what I call \\"Buddhist Porn\\". These describe living mindfully, meditating perfectly, and the overall Buddhist spiritual lifestyle with such vivid imagery and gripping storytelling that I can't help but crave to read more. I've picked up book after book, and it seems like the more I read the more confused I get and the further away I get from living a mindful life.Then there is the topic of sitting meditation- Usually a few pages that describes sitting, and then meditating. I've always skipped sitting meditation honestly. I always thought \\"that's way too time consuming... what if my friends catch me?... I'll just meditate throughout my everyday life activities, that's what I'm going for anyways.\\" Well this starts off like all of the other \\"Buddha Porn\\" and then quickly jumps into sitting meditation. It was refreshing to read \\"do this, then this\\" in a concise manner.While all of the other books tend to describe the end product more MINDFULNESS IN PLAIN ENGLISH is like a cookbook that lists all of the key ingredients, alternate ingredients, proportions, and cooking times. It's a recipe book and the key ingredient is Mindfulness through vipassana meditation. The best part is it then shows you some very plausible techniques to incorporate into your daily life to live a more Mindful life- not only the importance and know-how of sitting meditation, but how to bridge these skills into daily activity and therefore live a more mindful life.I will refer back to this book as long as I own it."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I started reading this book in electronic (PDF) form, and liked it a lot, so I got a paper copy. I felt that it spoke directly to me, pointed out the turbulent states of mind in which I kept finding myself, and suggested a way out. So I started my own attempts at practicing what it suggests. I can definitely say it has made a huge difference in my life. I have been practicing for a little over a year now, and I keep going back to reading the book. Each time I do, the ideas seem just a little bit clearer and the mind a bit lighter.I hope you have the same experience of peace and happiness."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable self-help books I have ever read!Mindfulness meditation teaches us how to pay attention to our breathing as a tool to focus while we watch our thoughts without judgment or participation. We simply observe the birth, growth, and death of the short-lived thoughts and let them pass.The objective is to realize the interconnectiveness of all things and appreciate life and our environment for what it is. We learn loving friendliness, compassion, appreciate joy, and equanimity. We learn to fill our hearts with loving thoughts and manifest those thoughts into positive actions through mindfullness.I recommend this book for people who want to be free from fear, tension, anxiety, worry, and restlessness; want to overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life; and want their lives filled with thoughts of loving friendliness, happiness, and peacefullness.This book teaches you about a meditative system that brings wisdom, equanimity, and peace to our lives. I am glad I read it!"},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I have read this and also recommended this book to others.

The book is a manual and trouble shooting guide to shamatha/vipassana meditation. A simple and powerful technique which has gradually and profoundly changed my life for the better.

If you haven't read any other book on Buddhism, this is one that is crucial. The title of the book is a bit of a misnomer. Bhante G. cuts through a lot of the fog and hype and has a gift for explaining in practical language, Buddhism via Mindfulness.I only wished I had found this book ten years ago in my quest. It clearly presents in one book, what I have learned and experienced in that time and I highly recommend it to everyone.With Metta."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I bought this book years ago, and I keep coming back to it when I wish to start a meditation program again. I have other meditation buddhist books, but I rarely ever go back and reread those books.The book is a nuts and bolts on how to meditate; the practice, useful attitude to have, what to do with your body, what to do with your mind, dealing with distractions I, and dealing with distractions 2, and mindfulness versus concentration..The book is excellent, and I find it very helpful since I meditate on my own and have never sought out a teacher..And I don't plan on doing so for awhile. I noticed the author has another book out, deeper mediations or something like that, I will have to check it out...Once I get some money.."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is a good book but IMO some of the language is anything but plain English. For example, Mr. Gunaratana writes:\\"1. Mindfulness sees the true nature of all phenomena.2. It is mindfulness that notices the change.3. Mindfulness is non-superficial awareness. It sees things deeply down below the level of concepts and opinions.4. Mindfulness is not trying to achieve anything. It is just looking. Mindfulness simply accepts whatever is there.\\"In plain English we clarify the subject and predicate. How can mindfulness see, notice, accept or achieve anything? Surely the meditator is the one doing that. I would prefer it if the author had written:1. When we are mindful we see the true nature of all phenomena.2. When mindful, we notice the changes.3. Mindfulness is non-superficial awareness. It helps us see things deeply down below the level of concepts and opinions.4. We are not trying to achieve anything. We are just looking. When practising mindfulness we simply accept whatever is there.Another problem I had was with the affirmations Mr. Gunaratana asks the reader to repeat at the beginning of each meditation session. For example: \\"May I be well, happy, and peaceful. May no harm come to me. May no DIFFICULTIES come to me. May no PROBLEMS come to me. May I always meet with success. May I also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and overcome inevitable DIFFICULTIES, PROBLEMS and failures of life.\\"Hold on here. May no difficulties and problems come to me AND may I be able to meet and overcome the difficulties and problems that come to me? Is there some serious cognitive dissonance going on here or is it just me? Instead, how about this variation of a Tony Robbins affirmation: \\"Everything happens for a reason and a purpose, and it serves me. May I have the patience, courage, understanding, and determination to skillfully deal with what comes to me.\\"Having said the above, I did get one significant insight from the book. Mr. Gunaratana claims that, \\"Seated meditation itself is not the game. It's the practice. The game in which these basic skills are to be applied is the rest of one's experiential existence.\\" This was quite an important distinction for me. Somehow or other I had mistakenly seen meditation as the more important game and my day-to-day life as the secondary practice.According to the author, \\"The most important moment in meditation is the instant you leave the cushion.\\" As someone who does Vipassana this was valuable advice. Our daily living is far more important than time on the cushion. How could I have mixed those wires up!There were also other interesting insights such as, \\"We are simply not paying enough attention to notice that we are not paying attention.\\" This is a good book, IMO though it just needs a little more plain English."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"To start with I should say that this book does not just teach mediatation skills but also explaines a powerful phylosophy (which came to be particularly important to me) at the background of the practice. The phylosophy which is self- and human- centered and at the same time promotes selflessness, kind and humane but undogmatic, inquisitive and lucid. It answers much more questions than all the fancy western theories."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This book is elegant in its simplicity & a wonderful learning tool for the novice.

According to the author, seasoned meditators can meditate for up to four hours each day. If that's the case, I would suggest they get out more.

The vocabulary is easy to understand to all kind of people"},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I had the pleasure of attending a meditation retreat last year and Bhante Gunaratana was the featured teacher. It was a profound experience, and Bhante Gunaratana was very skilled at guiding the participants through mindful reathing and mindful walking. He is a true gem in the world of spirituality, and anyone interested in meditation or the dharma should seek him out.\\"Mindfulness in plain English\\" is a literary accomplishment. From the very first page Bhanta Gunaratana does a wonderful job of engaging the reader in what can easily become a very complicated topic. However, the topic never does become complicated. In fact, the explanations remain simple, concrete, and very direct. It is obvious that Bhante Gunaratana is only interested in the reader understanding the basic ideas of meditation. Follow the breath, return to the breath, again, again, and again. Keep doing so. The rewards are self-evident. This is Bhante Gunaratana's main instruction. It works so well because for the beginning meditator the struggle is against one's own body. Following the breath is very difficult at first, and is always at least somewhat of a challenge after learning the skill. This book is only about these things, in plain English.I find no faults in this book. Bhante Gunaratana even avoids buddhism by and large, which must be difficult as he is a buddhist monk who has studied, pursued, and taught the dharma for the majority of his life. So, if you are not inclined towards buddhism, this book is still an indespensible guide for meditation in general."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is a great book for beginners and meditators early in their search for inner peace and quiet. Very well written and easy to read. Makes you feel good about the search you are on. Great starting point."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Whether a simple reminder for the well-versed or a starting point for the beginning, this is a great book.

Very insightful, informative, & at times humorous. Gunaratana walks the razor's edge between explaining & brief clarity, giving just enough to provide a firm practical foundation. He touches on a sketch of orienting theory lightly enough to provide context without getting too deeply entrenched in Buddhist culture so as to distract from the method & its application possibilities. The wording seems effortlessly Western & familiar. It certainly encourages an easy & fruitful beginning insight meditation & universal friendliness practice."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I've read several books on Buddhism, trying to understand it. I wish I had started with this book. I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Truly a must read for everyone - both Buddhist and non-Buddhist alike.Bhante G is absolutely amazing and speaks to the heart. If you want to learn the truth about peace and life, read his works. Priceless."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This beautiful book is an introduction to Vipassana (or Insight) meditation. As such, it may be the best book of this genre available today. The language is clear, simple, and precise. The first chapter is certainly a superb overview of meditation and mindfulness; chapter 14 on the interrelated roles of concentration and mindfulness in meditation was extremely helpful; and the Afterward on Loving Kindness was a timely addition to the original text. There are phrases and passages within this book that stand as some of the most compelling statements of fundamental principles of Buddhism that I have ever read. Bhante G has made an enormous contribution to the western literature on Buddhism, particularly that literature directed toward those new to the practice of meditation. This volume has become a classic and will remain as such for many decades, if not centuries, to come.So, why four stars? Why not five? Why not six? The reservations I have about this book are highly personal and I doubt that many others would even notice, let alone share, these concerns. So, buy the book. Download it to your Kindle or iPad. And consider the following rantings as those of a cranky old man.First, I found Chapter 2, describing what meditation is not, to be a little disconcerting. It is sad that Bhante G (or his editors) felt it necessary to explain that the purpose of meditation is not to become a psychic, that it is not dangerous, that it is practiced by ordinary people and not just ascetics, that it is not a great way to get high, and that it will not solve all of your problems in a few short weeks. There must be people somewhere who think of meditation in these ways. That is a very scary thought. If you are not one of those people do yourself a favor and skip this chapter.Throughout the book Bhante G uses language like \\"see things as they really are\\". When he, or other Buddhist authors, use this kind of language it makes me want to scream! First, it is not necessary; he uses more descriptive and less provocative language to describe similar phenomena in other parts of his book. This promotes clarity and credibility while wild eyed claims about Reality and Truth do just the opposite. Secondly, anyone who has spent any time at all studying philosophy and science know that claims about Reality must be taken with a grain of salt. At one point in chapter 5 Bhante G does clarify what he means when he uses this language and his explanation makes sense. Unfortunately, this explanation is little more than a brief footnote and most readers, I fear, will continue to attribute the common, ordinary meaning to this language and thus misunderstand what he is saying.At another point Bhante G discusses the goal of meditation as \\"The perfection of all noble and wholesome qualities latent in the subconscious mind\\". At other points he describes the task confronting the novice practitioner in such arduous terms that one wonders why anyone would begin the journey. All of this is true, I just wish Bhante G would tone down his language a little. Also, striving for goals is antithetical to the fundamental process of meditation which is focused on the present moment and surrendering to one's immediate experiences. If there is a goal, it would be much more modest, something like gently returning your attention to your breath when you notice that it has wandered away.Bhante G devotes considerable space to meditation posture, as he should in a manual such as this. He also indicates that it is fine to sit in a chair if that works for you. At a latter point he discusses subtle mental techniques to deal with the pain that most who are new to meditation will experience with traditional postures. I used a traditional posture (Burmese) for some time, and it worked well for normal meditation session of 45 minutes or less. However, during retreats and longer periods of meditation I experienced the pain that is so common with traditional positions. At one point I realized that this pain was unnecessary and did not help my practice. So, I switched to a chair. For those who experience little or no pain during prolonged sitting and those who find the pain tolerable, or even helpful, then they should opt for a traditional position. Everyone else should opt for a chair. During his discussion of pain caused by the traditional postures Bhante G does not even mention the obvious solution, i.e. sit in a chair. This is like describing in detail how to deal with the pain in your head and neglecting to mention that you could just stop banging your head against the wall. It is assumed that if you are serious about meditation you will adopt a traditional posture, which is nonsense, particularly for beginners. Being more explicit about your options regarding posture would improve this section significantly.In Chapter 9 Bhante G provides advice regarding \\"set up\\" exercises prior to beginning a meditation session. The first (I am about to tread the very same path that has been walked by the Buddha and his great and holy disciples...) should be enough to intimidate any novice. It is a wonderful set for serious meditation, I just am not sure that it belongs in a manual for beginners. Secondly, the recitation on Loving Kindness is particularly beautiful, as anyone who has experienced it can attest. The problem is its length, almost five (admittedly short) pages on my iPad. This recitation can constitute an entire meditation session in itself. Lay practitioners must schedule meditation session(s) into their very busy days and adding this recitation may require them to substantially shorten the time for meditation proper. It would have been helpful if Bhante G had offered an alternate form of this recitation that was shorter and less time consuming.Finally, and this is a purely philosophical note, Bhate G repeatedly reminds us that Buddhism sees an extremely close, even intimate relationship between our mind and our body. At one point I believe he goes further and refers to this relationship as one of unity. This second statement is more consistent with our current understanding based on recent develments neuroscience and philosophy of mind. These disciplines are converging and a concensus (though certainly not unanimous agreement) is developing regarding the basic model of materialistic monism. Our mind and our brain are not two distinct entities, they are one. Our experience and our consciousness are not caused by or intimately related to our brain. Our experiences and our consciousness are brain states. This is a difficult concept to get your head around, but so are quantum mechanics and the general theory of relativity. As Buddhism grows in the west it is important that it has intellectual credibility. To achieve this, its language be adapted to that of modern science and philosophy. This will entail an emphasis on the unity of mind and body and the abandonment of language that suggests that the are different entities. In this respect, some of Bhante G's language could use a tune-up.All of these criticisms should be placed in the basic context that I established at the beginning of this review, i.e. this is a really great book, a classic, that will be treasured for decades. As an introduction to mindfulness and insight meditation this may be the best book ever written."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Not quite as easy a read as I was lead to believe in the reviews. But definitely an excellent overview of mindfulness. I liked how it pointed out the pitfalls some beginners run into. I liked how they outlined the variety of ways meditation can be practiced. I would recommend this book to other beginners."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I found this book a wonderful breath of fresh air for those of us who would like to learn how to meditate. I've read a few books and tried a tape... I nearly gave up because I had gotten tired of all the hokey spiritual attempts by their authors. This book reads cleanly and clearly. He explains things thouroughly but not so thouroughly that you fall asleep or give up. Meditation is not easy, it takes time and much effort. He attacks most of the questions that biggining meditators ask. He goes through positions, exercises, modes of thinking, etc. He explains that meditation can be a tool to become more mindful of your existance on this planet. To pay attention to the present and train your mind to overcome the emotional tides that can cloud your vision. No hokey, no false promises."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"The problem with most books on Meditation is that the language they use to describe meditation destroys mindfulness. This book is easy to follow without sacrificing content, which I think is amazing. It doesn't place unnecessary emphasis like other books I have read on citing more credible sources or logically debating truths (which is absolutely useless to the practice of meditation), it simply shows you the path. It is the perfect meditator's handbook, and I would recomend it to anyone I know, meditator or not."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I've been studying spirituality for a long time. The ideas of mindfulness and following the breath were not new to me. Honestly, I thought I knew how to follow the breath. Old news. It turns out that I really didn't, and I'm so glad that Bhante Gunaratana wrote this book and taught me how to do it right. This book has turned me from an eclectic searcher of spirituality, gobbling up new ideas and new techniques with no sign of satisfaction in the discovery to someone who is now much more mindful, peaceful, and more of a finder than a seeker. I have been so inspired that I have decided that Theravada style Vipassana is for me. I am currently looking for a teacher in my area. If I can be taught by Bhante G himself, even better.So many other authors either make meditation seem like a whole lot of sitting around and doing nothing or stretch it out into such metaphysical abstraction that one wonders where the real-world application comes in. Bhante G does none of that.Instead, I felt like I was being guided and taught by a very straight-forward, frank, slightly gruff, but absolutely loving grandfather."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Ven. Gunaratana has written by far the most straight forward, concise, and compassionate guide to the how's and why's of the meditative experience. This is a must have for any Buddhist or anyone who wants to begin meditation. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is a book for which one can only have a great deal of respect but it is heavy going reading. Not really suitable for wimpy meditators. If you have a serious commitment to meditation, and it is not just a fad for you, or something which you find lamentably difficult, then you will probably find the book fantastic, as it does cover just about everything. The thing about meditation though is that you can't really learn how to do it from a book - you need to \\"just do it\\" (and have an in-flesh teacher to consult). I found this book dry and slightly tortuous to read, even if I do recognise it as the real deal."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Excellent book. Love the style and the tone of the book. A must-read for everyone given the stressful times that we live in.As someone who has been battling depression for a long time, this book stabilized my moods like nothing else has. I'm so much more clear-headed and productive thanks to the techniques in the book."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is actually a book about vipassana (insight) meditation and some of the teachings of the Buddha. It offers a better discussion of these topics than most other books that I have read on meditation. Gunaratana's writing style is clear and free from excessive jargon. The book will be understandable to most Americans.Gunaratana makes vipassana meditation seem desirable by discussing its benefits at various places in the book. I have just finished reading it and haven't practiced vipassana meditation yet so I'll mention some examples from the book. Gunaratana says that in vipassana meditation we face up to unpleasantness in our lives rather than avoiding it. We reduce tendencies to be greedy and lethargic. We are reminded of what we are supposed to be doing. We see things as they really are. We see the true nature of all phenomena.Another good aspect of the book is that it includes good instructions for the practice of vipassana meditation and for dealing with problems and distractions during meditation.I give this book five stars for what I mentioned above. But, I want to caution you about a couple of things before you buy this book.First, if you are considering meditation because you want to solve problems in life, vipassana meditation may not be the best place to start. Gunaratana says that vipassana meditation is not a problem-solving technique. More direct approaches for dealing with problems can be found in books such as Coping with Difficult People by Robert M. Bramson, A Guide to the Good Life by William B. Irvine, and A Guide to Rational Living by Albert Ellis. Recommendations in those books are practical. Insight meditation may improve problem solving capability in the long-term, but I think it should be used only after using more direct, reasoned approaches. It is worth noting here that Gunaratana was ordained a Buddhist monk at age 12 - as stated on the back of the book cover. Life in a monastery is unlikely to be as challenging as holding a job in a competitive or difficult situation. So, Gunaratana can't be expected to offer much help in dealing with immediate problems.My second caution is that, while Gunaratana's book is not a complete description of Buddhism, it does espouse some Buddhist beliefs. On page 144, Gunaratana says that if we practice mindfulness, we can perceive that the three prime characteristics which Buddhism advocates are the deepest truths of existence. One of these is selflessness. Gunaratana says that selflessness means that there is an \\"absence of a permanent, unchanging entity that we call Soul or Self.\\" Further, in connection with this, he says that \\"there are really no entities that are unchanging or permanent, only processes.\\" When I have seen Soul and Self capitalized elsewhere, it is a reference to God. So, Buddhism holds that there is no God and/or we do not have souls that exist eternally. This is contradictory to what is said in many holy books. It is also in conflict with what is reported by mystics and by some people who have had near death experiences. This is a great book on meditation, but do we need this religious indoctrination? (The Buddha did not claim to be a god but he is discussed in this book as if he has the role of a savior.)If you are looking for a good overview of meditation and its benefits, I suggest The Relaxation Response by Herbert Benson, MD. Good books on dealing with difficulties in life include those by Albert Ellis and A Guide to the Good Life by William Irvine."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is one of those books that is quite simple on the first read, but reveals a much deeper level of insight as you begin to apply the principles. Mindfulness as a concept is difficult for westerners who have been taught to rationalize everything, but it is an essential skill for seeing things as they truly are. Gunaratana gives the reader a step-by-step system for learning the basics, and introduces Buddhist concepts gently, in a non confrontational way. He is not saying that Vipissana meditation is the only way to experience the world, but that it is one way.This book has changed the way I look at the world, and given me tools to understand what I am experiencing. An incredible value and an incredible book."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I have long been searching for precise instructions on how to meditate.

I learned a lot from the teachings and sitting at the vihara. The one monk who taught me the most recommended this book by Bhante Henepola Gunaratana. It is a practical and insightful guide to meditation. I have learned more from monks than I have from people who adapt meditation to other New Age programs and philosophies. I also read Pema Chodron (an American Buddhist nun), and I appreciate her teaching. If you read this book you will learn that the purpose of meditation is not to &#34;get better&#34; at meditating. You do it to create awareness within yourself. You don't graduate from a program. You don't reach some high level. You just practice. Some days it is easier. Some days it is more difficult. I appreciate this simple approach to meditation. That is exactly what you will find in Bhante Gunaratana's book. He explains what meditation is, what it isn't, and what you can gain from practicing it."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Using simple language that anyone can understand, this book helps explain, define,and bring acute awareness about meditation.

Now after practicing zazen meditation five years I sill feel that this is The Best introduction to meditation.Albeit this books teaches vipassana meditation, it can still be useful for all who pratice so called \\"breath practices\\" (counting breath, following breath) in zazen or other traditions. This because the path from beginning to \\"access consentration\\" is done wery similar ways in all traditions and all beginners have the same problems anyway."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I found this book to be a good basic instruction guide to being mindful and reducing stress and depression and anxiety issues."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I thought since this was the \\"plain english\\" version of mindfulness, it wouldn't be so blah, but it was. Perhaps mindfulness and meditation aren't for me, as I had no intention of becoming a Buddhist. I thought I could just be a more mindful person or live with more intention or something... I guess I don't know what I expected, but this wasn't it. I got halfway through the book and then gave it away to a friend who is a bit more of a \\"free spirit\\" than I am, in hopes she could glean something useful from its pages."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This book is perfect for a person who is interested in learning how to conduct \\"open monitoring\\" meditation.

An important guide along the way to mindfulness."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I have read numerous books on this and related topics.I ve also attended hundreds of meditation meetings.

But it is REALLY helpful if you are ACTUALLY going to meditate on your own. Its in the tradition of Vipassana - like Buddha is beleived to teach his munks an nuns. Svein Gran, Norway."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This book is a Theravadan Buddhist meditation manual emphasizing Vipassana (insight) meditation.

I loved it and will read it again in the future."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"It is an exceptionally good book for people interested in meditation.

I found that this book really helped give me some much needed answers and motivated me to continue the practice of mindfulness. It is written quite simply and easy to read. I thought it was so worthwhile that I bought this book for a friend for her birthday."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It is a very useful book. And it is very well written. The language used in the core chapters dealing with the vipassanna meditation indeed use plain language. The prose is very clear and the key ideas are emphasized repeatedly. There is no room for ambiguity in the text.However, in my opinion, the large chapter on metta which was added later is not of the same quality as the core of the book. It feels as if someone else wrote it. Author should resist writing about personal stories, which is a major fault with typical run-of-the-mill self-help books. Examples include the story about a young girl hugging him at the airport, story about a man failing to reciprocate author's greetings in West Virginia and several others."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Can't say enough about this book. Very good introduction to Vipassana and Buddhist meditation. I have been meditating for over 3 years, in another tradition, but finding the Vipassana/Insight Meditation style more and more attractive. A big reason is this book. The philosophy and language is very easy to understand and can quickly be put into practice (the main point here!).Going to read the follow-up to this book by the same Author, Bhante Henepola Gunaratana, soon. This book represents (to me) the reason I started sitting practice in the first place. Read it and put his recommendations to your practice!"},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"A wonderful first stepping stone kind of a read. Bhante Gunaratana clearly and methodically lays out the groundwork for mindful living and meditation."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is a great book for novice meditators looking to gain an understanding of insight meditation. The book is written in an easy-to-understand language. It is extremely helpful for any beginner to kick off their meditation practice."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is by far the greatest book I have read on meditation. It provides a simple and beautiful explanation of the practice and purposes of insight meditation. Buddhism has existed for more than 2000 years. With such a vast history much could be said about the topic. The author, Bhante Henepola Gunaratana, masterfully stays true to the topic at hand and provides useful examples while avoiding any divergent subjects."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"For years, this book was on my bookshelf, unread. But I don't bemoan that--I read it when the time in my life came that I needed it most. This book started me on the path of the great and holy Buddha. I hope that all people learn the way of loving friendliness."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I love this book, my dad recommended it to me, and even that I have been doing meditation for couple of years, it helped me so much, gave me new tips and understanding. It's a great book for someone who is looking for simple and effective tools and guidelines for their meditation practice, without ideology or religious ideas. I just bought another one for my boyfriend, it's a great book to read of you are just trying to find out what meditation is all about."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Somehow I feel that a long review would be unfaithful to the spirit of this great book. Not since I discovered Alan Watts some ten years ago have I read such clear words in the context of buddhism. You will find great introductions to meditation in your local bookstore, from which I recommend the books of Chogyam Trungpa, his student Pema Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n, the American Surya Das, and last but not least Sogyal Rinpoche (all from the Tibetan tradition). But \\"Mindfulness in Plain English\\" (from the Theravada tradition) stands on a class of its own. If you are a rookie practitioner like me and you do not have the good fortune of having a qualified teacher around, I believe this little manual alone, and discipline, can take you a long way. And you will not exhaust it in one reading. The language is deceptively simple and the book contains some very nuanced discussions (e.g. the distinction between \\"mindfulness\\" and \\"concentration\\" should be required reading to philosophers of the mind; by the way, when will the Searles and the Dennetts ever discover the buddhist insights about consciousness?) This review is long enough: read the book and meditate everyday. You will be better and so will the world."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is an excellent book. It is in plain English. It provides step by step, detailed instruction in how to practice insight meditation and mindfulness. This is the type of meditation that the Buddha describes in his writings.But, in addition to providing the detailed nuts and bolts the author also explains why you should meditate and what you can get out of it.The specificity of the instruction is what sets this book apart. Yes, his is not the only way to do it. But, if you are starting out new this is exactly the type of book that will provide a road map for you. As you read more, attend classes, or a sitting group you can modify your practice. But even with such this book provides much helpful and specific advice of how to do it and what to do when problems arise. Which they will.In addition, the author's explanations of the whys of meditation have a surprising depth on re-read. Surprising because of their straight forward presentation. I've found revisiting the book most helpful."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This book explains the Bhuddist meditation technique vipassana which focuses on breathing. This is in contrast to other techniques which focus on concentrating on a specific object or image. The book can broadly be categorized into three sections - introduction &amp; background, the practice itself, and application to daily life. I found the earlier chapters a bit long-winded, but it is worth reading them to fully understand what this technique is and what it is not. The instructions on how to practice and organize a regular meditation are exceptionally clear. By regular practice of the breathing meditation we can become more aware of life - like moving into the slow lane - and as a result we can learn to appreciate what really matters in life. We can become less greedy and selfish and can delight in the simple and natural things around us. The latter part of the book explores how our lives will change and how to embrace an attitude of &quot;loving friendliness&quot; in all that we do and with all we come into contact with. A great book for helping people to dissolve the stress in their lives and learn to live more meaningfully."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"There are so many wonderful reviews of this book by &quot;regular people,&quot; it's hard to add anything new. This is a book you will read again and again, finding new insights each time. I, too, have a library of books on Buddhism, meditation, mindfulness, etc.; and this one truly is in plain (though beautifully articulate) English. What a stunning contribution to Westerners who are trying to practice this wonderful tradition/philosophy/path/way of life. I so appreciate this book and its author. Thank you."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"How do you even begin to review a book that changed your life? Especially when you can count on one hand, the number of books that have done this. I came to this book during a hard time in my life, having it recommended to help me with dealing with a plague of traumatic experiences that had occured. I came away from this book a changed person; on a path or re-discovery of my spiritual self that I had squashed and hidden for many years. Although based in Buddhist teachings, this book is not a book about Buddhism. It is a book about practical means for dealing with your thoughts, emotions, and all other aspects of living a modern life. It teaches you how to learn about the inner workings of yourself, and as you learn these things, peace results.I am a very practical person. Books that deal with the metaphysical must be practical, simple, and applicable for me to even finish them. This book is all of that and more. The author presents ideas that are almost beyond description with a clarity and practicallity that is only done by someone with years and years of living and teaching what he speaks.The reading is often funny, and hits home in a way that anyone can relate to. One of my favorite quotes about learning meditation comes from this book: in describing meditation during the beginning stages, the author says that as you watch all of the stuff churning and bubbling in your mind: \\"....you will quickly come to realize that you are quite insane.\\" I laugh every time I think of this quote.It is this ability to relate to real people that makes you feel normal, and really understand what he is getting at.Do not get the idea that this book will change you overnight. Not even in a week. What happens, is that if you practice what is taught in this book, a slow, almost inperceptual change starts to occur. You probably won't even notice until several weeks into it. But if you stick with it, and really pay attention to what is happening inside you, you will begin to see small changes in your perception of things; changes that at first may seem so small that you write them off to coincidence. But these changes become more and more frequent, and more and more noticeable, until one day you realize that a transformation has been taking place. I can't put it into words, except to say that this book will transform your very existence and bring you to a place of peace you have never thought possible.This is a master work that should be listed among the most important modern self-help books ever written. All of the Dr. Phil's, Dwayne Dyer's, and other mega-stars of self-help should aspire to works of this greatness."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Having meditated for over 30 years and having digested many books and teachings, I must say that the venerable monk has really done a great job! This book is for the novice and for the long term practictioner. I was delightfully humbled and learned as much as I have ever learned about meditation. HOwever, please don't read this quickly.......digest it, read a few pages every day or so, and practice! You will find a wonderful combination of great fun and serious self-work."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is an excellent book for anyoned wanting to get started in meditation. It covers when to meditate, where to meditate and how to make yourself comfortable enough to accomplish the task. They also give a host of reasons for meditating.Furthermore, it covers in explicit details the processes that the mind goes through and how to work through them to a successful conclusion. The type of meditation covered is vipassana, or mindfullness.Be forwarned, this is definitely a book for beginners. If you are already into a meditation routine you probably will not find much in this book that you have not already experienced and worked through."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Words cannot accurately convey how well this book gets across all of the important ideas about meditation. If you are at all considering meditation or anything close to Eastern philosophy I highly recommend finding a copy.The depth of knowledge Gunaratana possesses is incredible since few have ever managed to capture so much about an action (meditation is ultimately about doing, not conceptualizing) in words. The book is very quiet in tone as opposed to trying to preach any dogma, yet there is much humour here too. Even those with well-worn zafus will enjoy this book; the novice will find the advice invaluable.If you want to have one book about meditation on your shelf, this would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I read Mindfulness in Plain English years ago in the middle '90's, but it's still at the top of my list for anyone serious about meditating. From the beginning until the end, his writing is clear and relevant to the types of problems that come up in one's practice. He distinguishes Vipassana from other approaches to meditation, and is particularly helpful in the way that he guides one through the problems and distractions that come up. One can feel the inspiration behind the teaching. What a gift this book is! May all beings be happy."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"During the past ten years I have acquired and read (or suffered through) just about every book on meditation in print. Would that I had read this one first. Although this is the definitive text on the practice of mindfulness for the novice, even the seasoned practitioner will find much of value in its pages. The discussion on the nature of distraction is without equal in the literature. On the other hand, Ven. Gunaratana's book is not a &quot;how to&quot; book for the meditation technician. One who is unwilling to change one's view of the world will find no encouragement here. All in all, one would have to go to the Mahasatipatthana Sutta to improve on this book. Master it, and there will no need to read any other. It will teach you how to stand, and then to walk, trusting the wisdom inherent in your own feet. After that, you are on your own. &quot;Mindfulness in Plain English&quot; is quite simply the finest book on meditation in the English language."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I've read this book along with his subsequent book, Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness, multiple times and consult parts of both on regularly.I've read over a dozen books about various aspects of Buddhist thought before this one, and this book is the best one about actualizing the practice in one's own life, here and now.I've been meditating for well over a year following the practice outlined in this book, and have grown tremendously. Great things have been said about this book before, and I just want to confirm every one of them.For anyone tired of unhappiness and confusion, take the plunge and read this book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I loved this book after reading great reviews of it. I'd just like to add that it's a great one for giving to friends who are interested in learning about meditation but have no idea where to begin. I gave a copy of this away after a couple I knew both responded positively to it after reading the first few chapters. It's the first book I want to read again to get back to having a daily practice. Meditation is work, but this book addresses the hurdles and pitfalls well and will help you get the ball rolling."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This should be on anyone's shelf that is interested meditation as even an idea to be pursued. This book is low on the &quot;dogma&quot;) if there is such a thing) of Buddhism. Henepola simply shows how to step into meditation is the simplest of ways and how to allow the practice to permeate the non-meditative hours. The Buddhist aspects of mindfulness are treated as evidential facts, simple to understand and realize. The book has been a treat for the skeptic shaman I am."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This book was given to me by a friend when I first started to get interested in meditation. What I loved the most was that it doesn't get all snobby, and leads you to feel like meditation might be something for just about anyone. His descriptions of the way that thoughts cruise through your mind is just fantastic. And the idea of just watching those thoughts go by like boxcars on a train was eye-opening for me. This is a great start if you want to explore (and de-mystify) meditation."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"The book mentions it itself, but I believe it important to say this is Vipassana (Insight) meditation. No tantric chants, or Zen koans.I gave the book 5 stars because I've yet to find something wrong with it. For the neophytes to meditation, as I was, Mindfulness is a very useful book. After explaining what meditation is and isn't, the book soon delves into the practical side of meditation. This part I found the most important. It explains what you should do, what to avoid, how to avoid it, what to do if you end up stagnating, and so on.All in all, if you want a good guide to meditation without any unnecessary fluff, I would go with this book."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I'm no expert on the subject of Mindfulness or Meditation so this book was perfect for me. I've read it three times now, but not because it is hard to understand. I'm just a little dense I guess and need to review the concepts a few times. Anyway, I highly recommend it. The author isn't shoving information down your throat or grandstanding about how awesome mindfulness is. The subject is presented plainly and simply and the reader is encourage to \\"see for themselves.\\""},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"At last, a book on meditation...in plain english!

Anyone, regardless of his/her religion, can benefit and enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is a superb book on Vipassana style (insight) meditation, very practically oriented, but also the best explanation of why you should meditate and what happens when you meditate that I've seen. The author really has managed the job of explaining the inexplicable (since meditation is very much about a pre-symbolic experience of reality). I felt compelled to underline almost every line of this book. I cannot recommend it strongly enough."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This text *IS* all about presenting what can be the very challenging topic of meditation (and particularly Vipassana meditation) in words and language any person truly can understand. Moreover, the author doesn't try to appeal to and appease everyone; he is firm about what Vipassana is and isn't, about what challenges people do experience in meditation and in Vipassana, and about how it is work - but incredibly worthwhile. And while being \\"firm\\" in his language, he is also very compassionate. The text is a great example of work created by an experience and insightful meditator; if you really want to learn to meditate, but have struggled to do so (or are unclear about what \\"meditation\\" really even is), I encourage you to read this book."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Amazon.com is my go to site for the most complete offerings of any books I want to find.

It has a lot to say about what happens in our minds and the impact of this on our lives. One of the things that went on in my mind, however, and this, I noticed put me on my guard as to the degree of any \\"enlightenment\\", shall we say, on the part of the author, was his unskillful habit in the use of third-person pronouns. A good example of this can be found on page 42, paragraph 3. The meditator is variously referred back to as \\"oneself\\", \\"him- or herself\\", \\"she\\", and \\"her\\", all in the space of seven lines! I can only suppose that this an attempt to be politically correct in terms of inclusivity, and positive discrimination towards women. The result is an unfortunate clumsiness. I don't think women need positive discrimination in our writing, and if one wants to be inclusive, just use the third-person plural (they, them, their, themselves) which these days is perfectly acceptable. One should focus on more worthy, urgent forms of gender discrimination such as the workplace, personal relationships, and so on."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Simple Way Great ResultThe Power of Mindfulness remains hidden force behind Theravada buddhism practices.Emotional Intelligence gets attention for the world since Daniel Goleman's best seller books &quot;Emotional Intelligence&quot;.EQ is a pop word since then.This book is a way to practice meditation for improving Self-Awareness.(a component of EQ)Mindfulness is SATI in Pali Language.Simple language will make people easy to read through.However, to get deep understanding , people need a real practice !!!"},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"While it's a good book, it's title is misleading as it's really a primer on how to meditate.

Very easy to understand and extremely straigth forward-truth to the point."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"One third of what you will learn about meditation will come from your teachers and your fellow class and retreat meditators; one third from yourself on your own patient journey - and one third from a good book. That book will sometimes seem the least important third, sometimes the most important part. Having read a shelf full, I find, Mindfulness in Plain English, to be the best available how to meditate guide - it is well written, clear, graceful and it covers all the issues tackled elsewhere.But it leaves out much advice that would have made it much better. 90% of those starting a meditation class drop out - meditation teachers such as Gunaratana rarely seek to find out why and so the small things that get in the way of even the most determined intentions. A good meditation book must tackle them - and Gunaratana like every writer does so only partially.Here is a list of a few of things that could be added.A beginner requires equipment to handle the 20, 30 or 40 minute duration of their meditation -- for example, a timer used in cooking (under something to dim its unpleasant alarm sound), or a CD burnt with silent tracks that end with one of bells. After a few months, time can be estimated by looking at a watch but in the initial days such checking just adds an additional and an unnecessary burden.Ear plugs (motor cyclist shops and internet sites are a good source), or ear muffs (internet sites again check for Bilsom or Peltor brands) might be an idea. Again after a few months, distracting sounds of kids, power tools, TVs in other rooms etc are not a problem, and can even add to the practice, but in the initial stages they add that extra difficulty.I guess that half of those that drop out would not if they were better prepared about these and other small practical issues.Also forget ideas about lotus positions, sitting Buddhas and Nirvana. Instead it is as if you have an old fashioned radio in your head. What is called \`meditation' is simply slowly and patiently learning how to shift its dial off its noisy stations. As you sit, you will find the radio dial keeps drifting back on to news or entertainment broadcasters. But carefully - the radio is delicate and needs a loving touch - you move using a focus upon your breath the dial back to silence. Slowly as you learn to move off the main stations your awareness becomes more sensitive. What was once emptiness is now discovered to be filled with the noise of distant stations and even static. Patiently with increasing tenderness and gentleness you keep moving the dial until you find yourself in awareness not of a silent radio but where you are.This kind of nonBuddhist practical advice is not in this book - or any other. Meditation books do not get written ground up from the problems that cause people to drop out. Nor do they give the practical tips that are soon forgotten by experienced meditators but that beginners need to stay the initial course. Sorry about being so negative about Gunaratana - you will not find a better book. Buy it, retake that mediation class that was dropped or never continued. But do not think meditation has yet to be written about in the way it should."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"My biggest pet peeve in a book is repetition to make a book into a book rather than a pamphlet. Too much repetition and not engaging enough in it's repetition to be considered worthwhile. If you are a true beginner and want to just start meditating, I'd recommend \\"8 Minute Mediation\\". It'll get you going and you can learn more later."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Of all the books that I have read on the subject this book in the most concise, informative, and practical.

It's fun to read as well."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"If anyone wants to get started with meditation, this is the book to read. Other books will take you all over the world only to come back to the very concepts that this book lays out about meditation. Actually meditation is very simple and it is all about focusing your mind on the very now and here. And this books tells the same thing without confusing you with jargons and concepts. But then in the middle of the book, i found the author getting a little distracted with some ancient Buddhist terms and such but then again, I think the author considering that it is a simple concept, meditation and to ensure the books appeals to each and everyone, he had to extend the narrative a little bit. But I highly recommend this book for beginners or intermediates to Meditation like me. Very simply written, very lucid and very compact. A must buy and read for anyone interested in getting into meditation and not just getting into, maintaining and practising meditation on an ongoing basis."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"If you are looking for a book that will broaden your understanding of some of the basics of Buddhism, especially in regard to mindfulness and meditation, a book that will give you some practical guidance regarding your meditation practice, and a book that will encourage you to keep on with your practice even when you are finding it to be frustrating, Bhante G's Mindfulness in Plain English may be for you. I found this volume to be a very worthwhile book, and I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This a very clear and readable statement of what one popular form of basic meditation in the Buddhist tradition is all about and how to do it."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I had been looking for a good book on meditation for some time, and this book was suggested to me. I bought it and found out it is perfect. It is exactly what I had been looking for. Tich Nhat Hanh's instructions are easy to understand. And what is really precious: He makes clear what belongs to his school of thought. He does not go about making statements as if his was the only truth in the world. Also, he explains what meditation is about, and what it is NOT about, so that I perfectly understood what I was getting into. Tich Nhat Hanh does not preach nor tries to convince his readers of anything related to religion. He simply makes meditation crystal clear."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"It's true. Of the forty to fifty books I've read that deal with Buddhism and/or meditation, this is undoubtedly the best. It is very easy to read, but is not simplistic. It is very broad in its coverage, yet manages to delve deeply enough into each subject to give you a good, grounded understanding. It is practical, providing examples of several types of meditation. Best of all, it provides help in answering the questions that most frequently arise in someone who is just starting the practice (or long term practitioners, for that matter). In short, it is a 'must read' book."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"If you want to learn how to meditate, I would recommend this book. The author tackles many aspects of the practice, and thoroughly discusses the problems one might face while attempting to meditate. He also does well to include scientific lingo in discussing how the brain perceives information. This is helpful for beginners because it will dispel any thought they have regarding the metaphysical nature of spirituality and will reveal to them that our nervous system is the beacon from which all things are experieced.There is one thing I would like to advise people new to the subject of Eastern practices. You may get the impression from this and many similar books that life is meaningless, bleak, and that the only way to be happy is to lose any amibition you have to accomplish anything. This is not the case, and you will only see this when you've immersed yourself with this practice and developed a higher level of mental ability. Once you're there, you will be able to accomplish whatever you want because you are no longer afraid of failing. You won't get upset when you strum the wrong string; on the contrary, you will embrace the mistakes and realize that they are all part of the learning experience of life.I used to be very driven when I was younger, but when I started getting involved in Eastern spirituality, I lost most of my fire because I realized that my life would ultimately end. It's one thing to think about it, but when you realize it deeply, it shakes you to the core. I no longer strived to reach the heights of the world because I didn't feel there was a point. However, slowly but surely, the drive that once characterized my personality returned with avengence, and I have become more ambitious than I have ever been. I am in the constant process of improving myself through reading (non-fiction, vocabulary building, writing style, self improvement), meditating, lifting heavy weights, stretching, and I've taken up guitar playing. I want to become the best at it, but I am doing it for myself. I am no longer driven by an obsessive need to be seen as the best by others, the need that subtly haunted me during my basketball days.My main advice to you is to be patient with this practice. There may be a hopeless transition period where you are breaking down the barriers of sludge that have cut you off from who you were always supposed to be, but once they are down, it will be more than worthwhile."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"As stated on page 1 of this book, this is a &quot;how to&quot; manual. It does not expound on the philosophy and theoretical aspects of Buddhism (as is also stated on the first page), but instead explains how one can start the practice of meditation. The concept of mindfulness as the practice of &quot;living in the moment&quot; is presented in an engaging, conversational manner.The first chapter, &quot;Meditation: Why Bother?&quot; establishes the tone that meditation is an effective means to profoundly change the way one approaches life. I happen to follow a faith other than Buddhism, and the principles put forth in this book have a universal appeal that should alienate no one. Additionally, the writing has a contemporary style and the subject is presented as a practice that anyone can cultivate and apply to their daily lives. This is impressive when one considers the author was ordained as a Buddhist monk in 1939 at the age of twelve.Chapters two and three describe what meditation is and what it isn't, giving beginners a clear idea of what they can expect from the rest of the book (and from insight meditation in general). The remainder of the text lays out the specifics of the practice such as how to sit, how to focus on the breath and how to deal with problems and distractions. The final sixty-or-so pages discuss the concept of mindfulness and its application in everyday life, both as a means of self-regard and for the development of relations with others.I highly recommend this book with its clear, engaging instruction and straightforward presentation of mindfulness meditation. It would be a worthy addition to the collection of anyone interested in this topic."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"If meditation can be made simple, this book is it. The author writes in a colloquial, easy to read style, anticipates most of the questions a learner may have about meditation, and takes the reader through an easy to understand step-by-step process. This book is a must read for anyone interested in learning about the mysteries of meditation."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"The only word in this book that is difficult to of prounce is the author's name. It is written as if the author were a native English speaker who hated long words. Somehow, Gunaratana has listened to my mind as I attempted to meditate and has assured me that I am normal. Crazy, yes, but normal. As a 64 year old physician, I am pleased that someone has finally given a clear description of the frantic, chaotic nature of the normal human mind and of a simple way to calm it down."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Well, not literally, but it certainly felt like it saved my life at the time. Here's what happened. About two years ago I decided to go to a Vipassana retreat as part of a trip to Asia. My original destination was a retreat center in Chiang Mai but due to the airport shut-down by protesters in Bangkok I ended up at a small forest monastery near Udon Thani.I arrived at the monastery, and the only English speaking monk showed me to my Kuti (hut) and told me \\"focus on your breath, i'll see you in two days\\" and walked away. I had never meditated in my life. Luckily I had a copy of 'Mindfulness in Plain English' that I had purchased on a whim before I left. The book was more appropriate than I could have known. Bhante Henepola Gunaratana is also from the Theravadan forest tradition - the same as the monastery.This is an excellent book for a first time meditator (or even someone who has been practicing for awhile) and I highly recommend it. I followed his instructions and I 'got it'. For the first time in my life I understood *why* people meditate.I stayed there for ten days and had little human contact during that time. I slept on the floor of my rat infested hut and eat one (just one!) meal a day of alms food gifted by the surrounding residents. It was the experience of a lifetime. Friends look at me like i'm nuts when i say that, but that's okay. I know for certain that my experience would not have been the same if not for having this book with me.I still have much learning to do, but thanks to my monastery experience and this book I have maintained a practice since. Gunaratana has a warmth that shows through in his writing. I still refer to it when I get off target or lose my focus. I've since visited Gunaratana's monastary in West Virginia though I have yet to meet him to thank him personally.Michael Kaminsky, Author,Naked Lens: Video Blogging & Video Journaling to Reclaim the YOU in YouTube"},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"As the other reviewers have noted, this book is clearly written, very practical, and very encouraging. It is a fine nuts-and-bolts manual for meditators, without the baggage of excessive references to Eastern teachings which sometimes bog down other texts. Have no doubt, it is profoundly Buddhist in its approach -- this becomes especially clear at the end.Without question, the best single book on meditation I've found."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is the best book on Buddhist meditation I have ever read. It really explains the technique for vispasana meditation. Which is sitting in a still, comfortable position.(Indian,Lotus, or half lotus for people from the east, westerners can use a comfortable chair, don't touch the back and keep your spine straight with feet flat on the floor).Focus your attention on the breath, it is your focus point. You simply allow thoughts to arise,you simply observe them, you do not emotionally get involved in them. The point of this is to become aware that you are the witnessing presence behind your thoughts. Our goal is to shift our perspective where instead of thoughts causing reactions and becoming engulfed in emotions we become able to observe thoughts and emotions and overcome them by realizing we are not them, we are the awareness only that observes them."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This book is an outstanding piece on how to be mindful. Completely mindful! For those with any doubts, this will clear up any questions along the line of \\"what will mindfulness do for me?\\" or \\"why meditate?\\". Selfish questions we all have. But as far as I know, have never been tackled so completely and directly as in this book.Henepola Gunaratana is so thorough and qualified to be teaching this stuff. You will bring out of these pages a complete understanding of mindfulness and its role in life and meditation. Obviously you will want to eventually bring the illuminating rays of pure mindfulnes/meditation to all aspects of your life. Henepola will help give you the confidence to feel you can make this great spiritual progress. And even though things will always go wrong, this book will help you learn that problems are invaluable learning tools when it comes to \\"waking up\\". That is if you just watch with \\"pure awareness!\\". Just step back, dont meddle and experience with pure awareness, all those troublesome thoughts, feelings and emotions. That is how you see they are transient phantoms that have no power over you. This is liberation, completely openness. Not supression. No one teaches this better than Henepola Gunaratana.Henepola also clears up the fact that some people think mediation is to stop thoughts. It's NOT. It's about becoming more aware of your mental universe. This is more about being a compassionately creative and open being, who deals with problems head on without fear or rejection. Rather than a robot who cant feel or think anything out of its programming range.This book is much more than a meditation guide. It's more than just another \\"buddhism book\\". I bought it for the vipassana instructions, but got a whole lot more. If there was a must read list for the world this would be on it. This book is for anyone."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"The author tells us his book is without frills - the most practical 'naked plain truth' there is. Mindfulness in Plain English certainly sounds like a hands-on guide for those who are learning to meditate all by themselves. It is. Explaining Buddhism for the beginner and Vipassana meditation as the ancient technique for living the psychology of Buddhism is how this book begins. Then the author ( Venerable Henepola Gunaratana - a Sri Lankan monk and international teacher) gets right to work. The table of contents contains chapters like 'What Meditation Isn't', and 'What Meditation Is'. It starts with 'The Practice' and includes 'What to Do With Your Mind', and finally ends up with the obvious 'What's in it for You'. Gunaratana knows what beginners want and delivers it. Now all you have to do is practice."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Confession first: I don't meditate, although I hope to start some day. When I do, this book will be the impetus for it - it is clear, straightforward and truly in plain English. It gives the novice meditator not only the how, but also the why, about meditation in language a layperson can undertsand and absorb. It is particularly strong in clearly delineating the many pitfalls that a meditator may encounter and the way to move beyond them. Very encouraging in its simplicity and straightforward language."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I came across Buddhism and meditation before coming across this book, but after about 12 months practise - including a 5 day retreat - I seemed to be 'stuck' and not moving forward in my meditation practise.I was fortunate enough, at this point, to go to a talk by Bhante G here in New Zealand and found the two hours that he held sway flew by. He was sincere, able to explain his beliefs in simple English, non-dogmatic, modern (despite his eighty years of age) and had a wonderful sense of humour.Next step then was to read his autobiography which gave a fascinating description of his life and his melding Buddhism with daily existence.And so, feeling I knew the person, I read this book as a guide for furthering my meditation practise.And an excellent guide it is - not like one of the usual 'self help' books with teasers and bland summaries, this book details in easy steps and simple explanations, the way to achieve mindfulness in everyday living, whether you are believer in the Buddhist philsophy or not.I hope you find the book as '&iacute;nsightful' as I have."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I've been practicing Vipassana meditation for about 10 years. During this period of time, I read a lot of books and went to a reasonable number of retreats. But I was still missing 'the small picture'. Really. OK, now we are going to get enlightened and all but what do I do during my daily meditation? Concentrate on the breath and that's it? C'mon!This book takes a very pragmatic approach to meditation. It explains every little detail that you need to know when you sit on the meditation mat. And gives you very good understanding of how concentration and insight work together to get you going in the daily practice.But to me, this book gave me much more than that. Probably like every practitioner, I've been frustrated by the fact that most of my time on the mat is spent bringing my attention back to the breath from God knows where it was before. But Bhante explains to us that this is exercising your mindfulness! It is the mindfulness that realized you were in the weeds and it is the same mindfulness that brought you back! This gave me a huge motivation to keep practicing at a time when I felt like I was going nowhere.Then, there are lots of other gems:- The most important moment of your meditation is when you get up off the mat after you are done meditating.-Don't bother with the path. Meditation will find its own path.To summarize, this is the best meditation book I ever read!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I found out about this book after going to B. Gunaratana's meditation center in West Virginia. Before then, I had been introduced to various meditation techniques and had gotten my hands on several meditation books. This one was by far the most simple, straight-forward, and easy to follow. It's incredible to think that the more simple a task is (mindfulness is deceptively \\"easy\\"), the more guidance we need. This book handles all of the tough spots that a beginning meditator faces and without Bhante G's kind, gentle, and wise advice, I would not have come as far as I have in my spiritual and mind growth. I've brought this book for many friends since: I think it is a beautiful gift to give someone and I will have it next to my meditation cushion for years to come. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I have read through this book several times and each reading gives me further insights and pleasure. This is a wonderful book for beginners to insight meditation and is a no-nonsense, action oriented guide to this practice.The author has an engaging style and very deep insight into the PRACTICE of meditation which makes this an invaluable guide.The layout of the book is logical and the material is sufficient for the beginner to get started and deep enough to take him all the way to intermediate and advanced levels."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I have a large library of meditative texts and scriptures and have meditated off and on for many years. This book is the first I have encountered that so thoroughly and simply explored it's subject that it truely is a beginner's manual, a 'How-To'. And yet it serves as a great review for more experienced practitioners. This book was the beginning of a wonderful relationship with the author, who is the most knowledgable yet warm and most approachable teacher I have ever met, in any tradition."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I love Bhante G.'s clear, lucid writing. This book helped me to establish meditation as a daily feature in my life and I will always be grateful for that. First 3 times through I would have given it 5 stars, but as my practice deepened I found myself flipping through pages looking for answers to questions I did not have at the outset. I also was left with a feeling that my meditation was getting \\"dry\\"--the emphasis on Vipassana before proper development of concentration was not the right mix for me. If you are a beginner, this might not make sense. In that case, buy this book and start your practice! If or when you feel the need for more, Thanissaro Bhikku's writings are a tremendous help. His work, as well as that of many other wonderful teachers, can be found at [...]. This free website has thousands of pages of useful information, and is highly recommended to all on the path. If you came to this review because you are thinking of learning meditation--I promise you the effort is more than worth it, and it does not have to involve a lot of physical pain. Make a commitment by purchasing a buckwheat sitting cushion, put it in a prominent place where you can not avoid seeing it. This will add to to your motivation, and make the actual sitting session much more enjoyable. Then go explore your mind!"},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is flat-out the best book on meditation I have ever read. Whether you are a complete novice thinking about starting to meditate, or someone who has meditated for decades, you will find much of value in this book.

An exceptionally well written book that covers all the major topics in a crisp, concise, understandable way."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Reading this book has been extremely valuable to me in helping me refine my meditation practice. Mr. Gunaratana writes with clarity and simplicity, and as a result, this book immediately engages the reader and enables him/her to make use of it in very practical ways. As with other books published by Wisdom Publications, the layout of this book contributes to its readability."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Mindfulness in Plain English is a masterpiece! Anyone who meditates could benefit from this book. If you are a beginner this book can help teach you meditation. If you are a seasoned practitioner this book can help reconfirm the most important goal in meditation: mindfulness."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This book is a must-have if you're interested in the very practical matter of setting up a regular meditation practice. It does a very nice job of providing context and explaining in clear and lucid language what vipassana meditation is and how it can transform your life. However, vipassana meditation is experiential and the proof of the pudding is in the eating. As you put the methods explained in the book into practice, you begin to see bit by tiny bit how unproductively we live our lives and perhaps more importantly, you begin to sense that it is within our power to change it. Don't expect to find instant nirvana, but I can say from personal experience that the effects of a regular practice are real, tangible and life-changing. My copy of this brilliantly written book is dog-eared as I keep returning to it again and again."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is a fantastic book on Mindfulness. It is clearly written (by an expert) and very easy to read and understand.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about Mindfulness."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"There is really no other way to aptly describe this work...

I wasn't exactly looking to develop a serious meditation habit, but during my reading of the book I began to embrace the idea. I read the book and wanted to re-read it fairly soon after finishing, but I loaned it out to someone. I'm eager to get it back and read it again, but I've told someone else they can borrow it! I may have to buy another copy. The book is well-laid-out, covers the subject matter very well, and opened my eyes to a new way of thinking. I'm trying to become a more regular meditator; currently I do it in ten-minute increments a couple of times a week at minimum, but I'm hoping to build from there. Also: I'm currently reading the \\"sequel\\" to this book, called \\"Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness: Walking the Buddha's Path.\\" I'm only in the beginning but I'm finding it on par with \\"Mindfulness in Plain English\\" -- informative and eye-opening, and teaching me things that I feel can impact my everyday thinking (and hopefully result in an overall healthier mind)."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"THIS BOOK ENGAGES THE READER. THERE IS ALSO HUMOR IN THE PART ON MEDITATION AND THE INTERFERENCES THAT COME DURING YOUR ATTEMPTS TO MEDITATE THAT MAKE THE BOOK EVEN MORE ENJOYABLE."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This Book is another must have. It is (in plain english) a insight meditation manual to help the beginner learn and the experienced meditator to review. There is real world advice and explainations that will greatly help you understand how to learn meditation. Though no book can replace a caring and experienced teacher this book can certainly improve your understanding. Also the Book Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness and The Four Foundations of Mindfullness go hand in hand with this one and I reccomend getting all there in order to have a much wider view of the practice. I am truly thankful to Bhante Henepola Gunaratana for writing such a life changing book."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I havent finished the book yet but I feel if I practice the teachings of meditation as offered by the author it will lead to a much more aware and focused life. I really enjoy the way Joseph Goldstein writes and how honest he is about what to expect. So far I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!"},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"As a novice, I learned quite a bit from this book, but the author was a bit repetitive at times for my tastes. It covers the basic of meditation well, but toward the end I simply got tired of the phrase \\"loving friendliness\\" because he repeats it so many times redundantly trying to illustrate his thoughts."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"There is a reason that this work is one of the best-selling mindfulness books of all time. The language is clear, the presentation is organized, and the advice is practical in a way that is completely missed by some of the Swami Dingdong volumes that are out there.Mindfulness is about practice, and one can't practice if one isn't given concrete ways to do it. Doesn't that seem really obvious? Yet I can't count the number of books I have scoped out on \\"mindfulness\\" and \\"mindful meditation\\" that discuss the nuts and bolts of technique in only peripheral and minimal ways.This is a superior text in that regard. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Terms that use 'mindful' have become commonplace in many books. In some way, the meaning has been lost or distorted with New Age and the like adaptations. On the other hand, rare are the instances where a meaningful and practical explanation of this meditation method is given. This book makes no pretense about the method. It inspires the reader to consider the power behind the application of the mind's focus in a meditative state. As this book effectively strips away the extraneous and esoteric impressions you may have developed about mindfulness, you will appreciate just how straightforward the meditative method is. The practical end of the material includes dealing with physical and thought-based distractions, such as legs going to sleep, over-active thoughts and many other common ones. The benefits are discussed and provide a powerful incentive to establish a regular practice. This book is intended to be used. Its author writes in crystal clear language. Its an excellent resource for mindful meditation practices (often found in Vipassana and Shamata). Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"The author's own personality really shines through in this very well written book. It makes you go Hey I want to be like this guy, get me to the mat!Why is it important that the book is well written? Because it is accessible and absorbing. I read it really quickly but afterwards I knew I would be reading it again and again. The title was very well chosen. The book lays everything out in very plain English and it makes you feel like you can do it, that you have no excuses. Other books might say get up early and meditate, be prepared for years of hard work and although well meant (and true) that can be demotivating. This book by contrast inspires you more.Also I had previously only read books on Mahayana Buddhism so this opened my eyes a lot by introducing me to vipassana and in particular the prayers to recite at the start of meditation. I had this hang up that prayers were something for theistic religions but the simple act of wishing well to others including your enemies was really powerful and I felt it really helped my practice.Overall a great book"},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is really is a great book that fills the gap that one might need to start meditating.

And I am truly grateful to those who took time to evaluate and recommend this book.It is definitely a book I would not hesitate to recommend to beginners as well as experienced meditators because Bhante Gunaratana dispenses practical advices, he is not only humorous yet explains many things which sometimes can't be found in other books and that is simply because only one who is truly an expert in this field can give such guidance with ease and yet be entertaining due to his many years of thorough religious study and personal experience in the various classic Buddhist scriptures. He does justice to Buddhism and the practice of Vipassana meditation and for that I am truly grateful to this great meditation master for the many useful insights and benefits I've gained just by reading and practicing his recommendations. He even helped solved one of my meditation woes which bugged me for many years !Good meditation masters are a rare find and Bhante Gunaratana is one of them."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I would recommend mindfulness in plain English anyone starting out in meditation it answers all the typical questions that the beginner might have, you can use this book without a teacher to get started on meditation.

Great books series from Bhante Gunaratana that can guide you to enlightenment."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"I'm very pleased with this purchase.

I loved this book and am giving it to many of my friends. There are other books on Buddhism that I have read and liked, but which got bogged down in stuff that made me want to go to sleep. I never felt that way here, although I'm sure Gunraratana could be very esoteric if he wanted to be. I'd highly recommend it as a guide to being more in each moment and living life to the fullest."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This book deals with the lack of satisfaction we feel I our lives. It is based on Buddhism. Unlike other books, it is very clearly written and easy to understand for an occidental reader.Here is the theory. The problem is not outside us but inside us. We make some mental mistakes. We look at the world in terms of pleasure or suffering. We fight against change and we have a false idea of what \\"me\\" is.But an intellectual understanding is not enough, the practice of meditation is necessary. To mediate, we concentrate on breathing, and we pay attention to thoughts and feelings that disturb this concentration. With time, meditation develops a skill of attention that can transform our daily life."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"This is the greatest book written on do-it- yourself meditation ever written. And that is simply no exaggeration. It's better than reading 1,000 books. Buy it now! It is the trip to happiness. I've seen people follow this path and are so full of joy and happiness that you would simply not believe it! You will become concious. You will experience a bliss that you have never known. You will be indescribably happy. I know this to be true. I've know these people. But... This meditation (insight meditation) has been stripped of all non-necessities in order to get you to nirvana and home as soon as possible. I know. That sounds great. I paid $200 for The Insight Meditation Course and my assigned teacher recommended THIS book for me. And, lol, it's all you need. You don't need any other books. But this path, Theravada Buddhism, is &quot;bare bones&quot; and &quot;no-nonsense&quot;. The only object is to enable you to fill great bliss and joy. Such a joy that you can't even imagine now. But it's &quot;bare bones&quot;. There won't be any God. You can believe in God if you want. But it has nothing to do with this path. No prayer to a Higher Power. You can do that if you want. But this path doesn't advocate it. You simply sit on your butt and learn how to pay attention to the breath come in and leave your nostrils. Each chapter will tell you how to deal with distractions, pain, progress, thoughts, and emotions. Now I can't do this. I want a total path in which I can believe in God. So I am a Self-Realizationist. I just can't seem to last without a path so beautifully pragmatic but doesn't deal with afterlife or God. The other problem that you may find with this book was discovered back East by the meditation master, Jack Kornfield. Over 50% of meditators have trouble sitting steadily because of deep emotional problems. Now the author deals with these. But if you just can't sit for 20 minutes without exploding, what are you going to do? A Matthew Flickstein co-authored this book with the Venerable Henepola Gunaratana. And he has created a book for us &quot;disturbed ones&quot;. Buy it if you simply can't sit. And give it a try. &quot;Journey to the Center&quot; by Matthew Flickstein. The introduction is by the author of &quot;Mindfulness in Plain English&quot;. I started following it. I will give it my total dedication. One small other problem with this book, which is really quite minor. After about two-thirds down the path, you will need guidence from a teacher because the &quot;mind states&quot; that are keeping you from total happiness become very subtle. Don't sweat it! The internet is already providing instruction for people without a teacher! And one Thai teacher told me that you don't even need a teacher. It's best to check up with one, though. As this book states, you can actually get hooked out on &quot;blissful states of mind&quot;. Before the real happiness or freedom is obtained. There. Put this book under your pillow and get rid of all your other books if you can sit, and don't demand a path that advocates a Higher Power."},{"Title":"Mindfulness in Plain English","review":"Definetly a book worth reading if you want to know what mindfulness is.

The Bylaws in this Manual are much more than a mere outline of Mary Baker Eddy's church - they have become the structure of my way of life. As an example, the following from Article VIII, Section 1, entitled &quot;A Rule for Motives and Acts&quot; reads:&quot;Neither animosity nor mere personal attachment should impel the motives or acts of the members of The Mother Church. In Science, divine Love alone governs man; and a Christian Scientist reflects the sweet amenities of Love in rebuking sin, in true brotherliness, charitableness, and forgiveness. The members of this Church should daily watch and pray to be delivered from all evil, from prophesying, judging, condemning, counseling, influencing or being influenced erroneously.&quot;I have found that living by this rule has freed me from numerous illnesses, and also has restored business and personal relationships that had appeared unfixable. It is what cements my marriage and keeps my thought open to infinite possibilities.Being a member of The First Church of Christ, Scientist (also known as The Mother Church) is a constantly renewed committment to practicing brotherly love and forgiveness that is shared by individuals from practically every culture. I am glad to be among them."},{"Title":"Church manual of the First church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Massachusetts","review":"The manual of the mother church is extremely controlling and limiting. Take for instance the by-law that only authorized Christian Science literature can be purchased and read. How does someone get a true view of Christian Science and Eddy if only one slanted side is given. Also note on page 130, the change of citizens to residents. The board of directors petitioned the state of Massachusetts to make a change. The manual states Eddy is \\"Leader\\". Is Eddy or Jesus our Lord and savior your Leader.Helen Wright's book \\"If Mary Baker Eddy's Manual Were Obeyed\\" is an eye opening account of all the changes make to the manual after the death of Eddy.It is sad to see people who blindly follow people like Eddy and are not allowed to hear the real truth of Science and Health and how it came about."},{"Title":"The Bright Side o' Things","review":"If you ever feel that life's getting you down or that the odds are stacked too much against you, sit down for a few minutes and take a look at this beautiful little book.

I read this book because it was brought to my attention that it existed and since none of my family was contacted about the book I wanted to know what he had written. I don't think he had all the facts or that what he does write is as acurate as it could have been. I have written documentation regarding these first racial riots in Columbia,TN that started from a disagreement on February 25, 1946 between a white radio repair man and a black man and his mother that he has never seen. In these articles and letters I have, it is told by the people that were there when situation started and until the trials ended for this event that took place. There is also a letter from Thurgood Marshall to William M. Fleming regarding the trials and his envolment in the first racial riots that caused the trials to happen. I had a very hard time trying to keep who was on what side at the time of the riots and keeping the names with what action. I enjoyed reading the book though as it is about my family. I would like to be able to contact Mr Ikard and talk to him personally. I think it would be very interesting for both of us, as I don't think he knows we are alive."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to Rv Camping in Mexico","review":"Well organized, researched, and interesting to read.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with the content of this book -- it gives you great running advice. But if you've read Better runs, there's not much new to learn from this book. It does contain some new insights, so it still might be worth the purchase if you enjoy reading Henderson's work."},{"Title":"En route,","review":"Anyone who has read &quot;La Bas&quot; (the novel Huysmans wrote before this one) needs to read &quot;En Route&quot;, since the former plumbs the depths of evil, and this one scales the heights of Catholic devotion. It is really the story of a soul struggling to believe, and marked the turning point in Huysmans' life as he embraced Christianity. The scene where he meditates on a large crucifix as it is reflected in the water of a pond is a masterpiece of religious introspection."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Fantasy Worlds: How to Draw the Amazing Worlds of Japanese Comics","review":"\\"M.M. Fantasy Worlds\\" displays hundreds of illustrations by Christopher Hart, and is a good showcase for his approach to Manga. I agree with the reviewer who identified his style as westernized, although this shouldn't discourage a Hart fan.I don't think that this book lives up to the claim, \\"HOW TO DRAW THE AMAZING WORLDS OF JAPANESE COMICS\\" that appears on the cover. Mr. Hart pays ample attention to the steps in creating a selection of character types in his style, but relatively little to the worlds that these characters exist in.That's not to say that his drawings aren't fun to view, and even to study. For example, on page 44 he points out the on-off switch in a medievaloid dungeon's torture device. The astute reader will also find anachronistic lighting fixtures in that illustration. The point being made is that mix-and-match technologies and architectural styles are creative opportunities.However, Mr. Hart seems to offer his opinions as generally accepted principles. On page 65, he says \\"Faeries have wings and elves don't. Faeries also may have antennae, whereas elves never do. And, faeries can be very tiny in size, while elves, ... are not so tiny that they can be held in the palm of the hand....\\" Without going into the 19th century's effect on western culture and the stature of elves, I've got to point out that making undersized elves isn't a universal principle: and probably isn't in the free-wheeling world of Manga.To end on a positive note, Christopher Hart's Manga world is a charming place. The wildly improbable castle and tributary town on page 42 still helps lift my spirits, when I remember how much I paid for the book."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Fantasy Worlds: How to Draw the Amazing Worlds of Japanese Comics","review":"MY SON WAS VERY PLEASED.

For example, you can find knights, faeries, monsters, dragons and even aliens in the book. Plus, topics on evolving medieval weapons, differences between elves and faeries, special effects and even the turnaround section (which tells you how a person looks like when &#8220;turned around) are covered. There&#8217;s also a section telling you what&#8217;s a weak and dynamic drawing looks like, which helps if you&#8217;re interested in honing your manga-drawing craft. Another great section I would like to point out is the &#8220;Castle&#8221; section. The book also covers some different places within the castle, such as the dungeon and drawbridge, and I find this really helpful when drawing the inside of the castle.Unfortunately, there are only one example for most creature, beast or place, which can be rather limiting if you&#8217;re trying to draw the same creature in a different way. However, I think this is where your imagination will come in. Also, I noticed that some of the artworks have a certain &#8220;American&#8221; style (instead of Japanese) to it, but many of the artworks are very nice and attractive.For the serious mangaka-wannabe though, you are better off getting more &#8220;technical&#8221; & \\"Japanese style\\" books such as the &#8220;How to Draw Manga&#8221; Series, but overall, this book will make a great reference or resource book for people interested in fantasy and drawing cartoon/manga."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Fantasy Worlds: How to Draw the Amazing Worlds of Japanese Comics","review":"Quiet honestly the one thing that makes Chrisopher Hart's books on Anime and Manga \\"less\\" than others is the fact that he isn't very good at it. Oh, he makes some good points, especially when comparing American comic drawing with manga style drawing, but there are better books out there.If this is all that is available then you won't be to dissapointed in buying it, but being as they are usually around $20 (at least where I am) then you might want to get your moneys worth and stick around for one of Hikaru Hayashi's many How to Draw Manga books as they are usually more detailed and better drawn."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Fantasy Worlds: How to Draw the Amazing Worlds of Japanese Comics","review":"This books O.K.

He tells you all this stuff, but in doing so I think he might be limiting your imagination by saying &quot;here's how you draw this and that&quot;. Whatever. I think he would be better off by adding &quot;here's the basic anatomy of a person(front and back), here's some armor variations, weapon variations, basic clothing folds, dragon skin options, maybe what a medevial town looks like, and all that.He Does tell you how to do turn arounds, and some of the pictures in this book are dang tight!Maybbe I'm picky, but I think those pictures in there should in pencil so he(Christopher Hart) wouldn't be lording over you with his fancy inked-and-colored pictures.

No bad words.

I grew up reading the Tom Swift Junior series of books and at one time owned all 32 of them (all that had been published up to that point). Somewhere along the line I got an original Tom Swift from 1910 and became hooked. Unfortunately it was difficult to find original hard bound copies of those books. Now that they have been digitized it's much easier and I can go back to that much more innocent time and enjoy the escape fiction of the day. I still keep a look out for the original hard bounds and collect them when I can.The Kindle versions vary in quality, and this one was pretty good. The formatting does not have many places where it is obvious it was formatted for a different size or page format. I have it on my Droid along with several other Tom Swift titles and some of the original Allan Quartermain novels written in the 1890s.The Tom Swift stories are formula books - very predictable in outcome and in chapter presentation - each one ending in a cliff hanger, teasing you to read just one more chapter to find out how Tom escapes this trap.Keep your eyes open - often these are available at no charge, which makes them a real bargain."},{"Title":"Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat: Or, Under the Ocean for Sunken Treasure (Tom Swift, No. 4)","review":"This book is great for people that like boats or submarines.

I had a natural vibrations problem of a curved-beam under rotation (for a wind turbine) and I had no experience in finite elements so I looked at several texts (Bathe, Huebner, Zienkiewicz). For many reasons I picked this book. It was very easy to read, and the organization was amenable to my learning style. The author provides information at just the right moment when you need it, such as different numerical methods for solving these problems. And when you need further details, the reference list is right there for you. His description of the overall formulations, such as variational methods, are very clear and simple, especially if you have been trying to understand these by looking at other texts. And then he segues very well into the application with the finite elements.The first topic I looked at in this book was the derivation of the space frame element, which was exactly what I needed for my vibrations problem. This derivation was in the middle of the text and I was able to understand the development without having to review previous sections.

Both were for liposarcoma, the first in 1995 was imbedded in the small muscle in my axilla (underarm between the bicep and tricep), and the second in March, 2001 in my trapezia(shoulder). Dr. Bloom was recommended to me and my primary physician by a local surgeon in Danbury, CT as one of the top two soft tissue cancer surgeons in the New York area. These operations were both on my right arm, the last being March 20th and I played an hour of tennis yesterday with very little pain. As far as his book, from a layperson's view it is quite interesting to see the incredible detail that the surgeon encounters to ensure not only that the cancer is eliminated, but that the person can still function in the best possible manner once they are healed. My mother had both a colon and liver resection 6 years ago, and now I can visualize what she had done. It is still mysterious to me but I appreciate it more nonetheless. If you are going to have cancer surgery, you may want to consider sending your surgeon an anonymous copy of this book! If you are a surgeon or practioner, this has to help your craft.

He was able to hold up a dark mirror to society, and stare unflinchingly at the organizations, traditions, and political and moral decay that always threaten to drown a civilization. And he spun a great yarn.He is a great candidate for the Graphics Classics series, offering a wealth of short stories and witticisms to inspire illustrators to create, adapt and partner with the great author to produce some original works. Even his shortest story packs a solid wallop, and the one page gems are as good as the more lengthy pieces.This updated edition brings back some of the great yarns from the first edition, with several of the smaller pieces cleared away to make way for a grand adventure staring the irrepressible Tom Sawyer and friends.Included in this collection are:Tom Sawyer Abroad - By far Twain's most famous and enduring character, most of us only know him from \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Huck Finn\\", but he actually made quite a few appearances. This is a Jules Verne inspired tale of Tom, Huck and Jim commandeering a flying machine and heading off for Africa. Illustrated by George Sellas, this adaptation captures the raucous spirit and deeper wisdom inherent in the character.The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County - Possibly the most famous tale in the collection, it is given a straight-forward comic book style adaptation. I vaguely remembered reading this story in Elementary school, and it was a nice way to be re-introduced to it.A Dog's Tale - Without a doubt the stand-out piece in the book, and possibly the best achievement in the entire Graphic Classics series. A stunning adaptation by Lance Tooks adds an additional element to this sad story of a devoted dog and the family with which it lives. The true power of words and pictures is put on display in this adaptation.Advice to Little Girls - An anthology of witticisms each with a different illustrator, revealing the dual-nature of little girls. Sugar and Spice, Naughty and Nice.The Facts Concerning the Recent Carnival of Crime in Connecticut - Twain battles to defeat his own conscience, an intolerable bother since the day he was born. His conscience thinks it is up for the battle...A Curious Pleasure Excursion - Another powerful adaptation, William L. Brown provides woodblock illustrations to illustrate Twain's advertisement for a luxury trip aboard the Comet Coggia!Is He Living or is He Dead? - Simon Gane lends his old-fashioned style to a tale of artistic fame and true talent, as four painters conspire to gain wealth from poverty. The only condition is that one of their number must die in order to become famous.The Mysterious Stranger - Adapted by Richard Geary, a regular of the Graphics Classics series, this story features three young boys who meet a mysterious stranger. The happy visitor announces himself as Satan, and proceeds to show the three boys the true nature of a happy life. Only the dead and insane are free from the world's troubles."},{"Title":"Graphic Classics: Mark Twain (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"One of the joys that I have is my mail box.There are days I open my mail and receive bills, while other days I open packages from Archie, DC, Moonstone, and Graphic Classics. This month, Tom Pomplun has compiled yet another gold standard collection.The 2nd Edition of Mark Twain includes a delightful new adaptation of \\"Tom Sawyer Abroad\\" by Pomplun and George Sellas. I loved the story and art and thought it was a great continuation of Tom Sawyer. Tom and Huck in Egypt certainly could have got into a lot more trouble, but the going home to the States for a corn cob pipe is hilarious!As the notes in the back state about \\"The Mysterious Stranger\\", it certainly exhibits the cynical edge of Twain during his later years. Compelling, yet, it draws on the tenants of atheism and could be used by theological cynics today.Other stories in the volume include \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\", \\"A Dog's Tale\\", \\"Is He Living or Is He Dead?\\", and two clever advice shorts to girls. As a father of two daughters, I wish I had the wisdom and wit Twain had about him. However, smoking is something I don't have any problems with! Just don't book me any comet vacations in the near future either.Thank you for an introduction to the diverse work of Mark Twain. This is one of your strongest volumes to date.Check out www.graphicclassics.com for more information on this great line of books.Tim Lasiuta"},{"Title":"Graphic Classics: Mark Twain (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"My children would start shoving bricks down peoples throats if they read this.

It is somewhat difficult to read, being written in Victorian English, but that adds to its appeal, since its literary complexity gives the reader an idea of how great minds helped science progress to what it is now. This book was long considered the authoritative text on the Great Pyramid, and it is not hard to see why. Its content is exhaustive, and a good example of &quot;a job well done.&quot; I was pleasantly surprised to see how much mathematics, metrology, science, and Judeo-Christian (!) spiritual content exists within the Great Pyramid. Smyth, the then former Royal Astronomer of Scotland, also approaches the various points of view regarding its origin and construction very thoroughly. All in all, this book is worth the effort to read it and I would advise the reader to take his/her time (I spent 10 months on it) with it so that it can be fully enjoyed. What a challenging and neat book!"},{"Title":"The Great Pyramid: Its Secrets and Mysteries Revealed","review":"Piazzi Smyth dedicated his life to understanding the measurements contained in the greatest building in the world, bringing out his discoveries in this 1880 edition totaling 664 pages. The subtitle says it all... \\"The Great Pyramid: Its Secrets and Mysteries Revealed.\\" Unlike all the other large works of man being embellished with statements of accomplishment by the ruler, king or dictator under whose rule it was built, the accomplishment etched in stone or metal plaques, until that edifice falls into ruin, the Grear Pyramid's power to survive is totally amazing. You have to have this book in your collection as the \\"standard\\" by which to judge everything else ever written about it. Smyth was the Astronomer-Royal for all Scotland, dealing with numbers and math on a daily basis, transferred his mind and focus to understand the purpose of its being which, some say, took either 20-years or 100-years to build. He beautifully explains every measure, angle, latitude and longitude, shape, material, etc. in the easily understood language and simple math of the layman, condensed down from his 1867 3-volume work which totaled 1,653 pages. This is the 'bible in stone' from which all other researchers draw their conclusions. I advise you to get this book yourself, and draw your own conclusions.While the entire outer casing has been stripped off because of its heiroglyphic content, there are no writings of any kind in the interior of this structure - the greatest the world has ever seen. Why? Smyth answers in high detail, using his mathematical mind to explain the base measurement, circumference, height, chambers and all the ascending and descending passages to the 'Pyramid Inch.' The two main measures when built were the Egyptian Royal Cubit of 20.625\\" and the Pyramid Cubit of 25.000\\", the latter of which gives us a figure of 365.242\\" Pyr. Cubits for the base. This measure just happens to be the exact measure of time, to three decimal places, in its base measure. In Greek feet measure, it is an even 720' Greek feet, another sign of source measure, that has been attributed to the Greeks by Europeans 200+ years ago, but which came to our textbooks in false assumptions. There are signs that the Pyramid was built 12,000 years ago, and not 4,600 as Egyptologists still claim. You decide.Oh and I almost forgot, we can't build a building today of this magnitude, of this accuracy and intended purpose.The best recommendation I can give for any book is, when I loan it to a friend, who promises to return it on his life... and I never get it back."},{"Title":"The Great Pyramid: Its Secrets and Mysteries Revealed","review":"Having seen many hypothesis put forth about the greatest pyramid, popularly known as Khufu's or Cheops' pyramid, I can only say that this book does the best job by far. Smyth's researches are exacting, practical, logical, and he clearly goes as far as he possibly can in each examination to ask the question of what may have been missed.What several other researchers had done sloppily, out of lack of funds or lack of drive or simple lack of perfectionism, he explores. His resultant calculations, postulations and compilations result in what I firmly believe is the most definitive work in the scientific world of a building which, to me, is very clearly God-planned.A fascinating work!"},{"Title":"The Great Pyramid: Its Secrets and Mysteries Revealed","review":"The book is an excellent work of a man dedicated to His science and religion. Even if you don't agree with Smyths summation, he still evokes one to question......What do we really know??, What if all we've been told about this one pyramid is wrong?? And What can the measurements of the great Pyramid tell us about the original builders knowledge of the world around him. His arguements are strong and yet unheard of by many."},{"Title":"The Great Pyramid: Its Secrets and Mysteries Revealed","review":"The Great Pyramid by Piazzi Smyth shows the state of knowledge regarding the pyramid at the end of the 19th century. On the positive side, Smyth documents the work of others showing how the constant &quot;pi&quot; is contained in the measurements of the pyramid. On the negative side, the author works hard to find &quot;evidence&quot; that the British inch, in fact the entire traditional weights and measures system of England, is derived from the same source as the those used by builders of the Great Pyramid and are thus somehow superior, even sacred, compared to other measurement systems. Smyth goes on to claim that the pyramid is in fact the work of a Canaanite/Israelite culture superior to the Egyptians that apparantly wandered to England. The &quot;Lost Tribe&quot; etc. Finally, the book is full of cultural bias, and even downright insults, against the ancient Egyptian cultures and religions. He constantly compares the wonderful 19th century Judeo-Christian religions with what he calls the profane, ugly, and even evil, Egyptian practices. His endless attacks on these dead religions are strange and disturbing, and makes the book even harder to read than it already is..."},{"Title":"The Great Pyramid: Its Secrets and Mysteries Revealed","review":"VERY INTERESTING BUT VERY DIFFICULT TO READ.

If you ignore the fact that they created a system of measuring to substantiate all of their work that is based on nothing but overactive imaginations and the instructions of God to Moses that no chisel can touch stone used for God's altar then you may be able to buy into this. Otherwise, you, like I will be wishing the authors were still alive so we could pull their brains out through their noses since they seem to have no use for them."},{"Title":"The Great Pyramid: Its Secrets and Mysteries Revealed","review":"Once you get past his odd way of writing it gets interesting"},{"Title":"Ultramarine: Poems","review":"Ultramarine by Raymond Carver, a collection of his poetry, is a gem. With each of my moves I find myself discarding all of my books except for this one. This is the one I hold and keep returning to.While Carver is better known for his short stories, I think it's his poems that communicates his silent emotions. The sparse language of Raymond Carver that is so effective in his short stories is even more powerful in his poetry.If there is anything I would ever recommend, this is it."},{"Title":"Ultramarine: Poems","review":"I saw this book on the shelf for years before I finally picked it up and flipped through it, and once I did, I couldn't put it down for a year. I was familiar with Carver through his short stories, many of which are classics now. But many fiction writers, frankly, make mediocre poets. Carver is an exception. There's not much artifice or self-conscious craft to these pieces -- little experimenting with stanza forms; no rigorous rhyme schemes. The reviews I read of the book by a few contemporary poets were critical (a few quite harshly so). Robert Frost once said, \\"I never like to read anyone who seems to be saying 'Let's see you understand this, you damn fool!'\\" Carver's poems are clear, narrative, and do not try to hide non-content behind obfuscation or any of the other tricks of the trade. Many of the poems reflect his growing (at the time) relationship with Tess Gallagher. Others look back to more turbulent years of his earlier life. But the poems compliment the reader by not trying to insult him or her, and they are a pleasure to read. Highly recommended -- especially for people who love Carver's fiction (this book is also incorporated into \\"All of Us\\", Carver's collected poems)."},{"Title":"Ultramarine: Poems","review":"A wonderful book. Carver's poems (not just this book) are crystal, common, intense, and familiar. They possess all the clear reality of his short stories.

Or any other subject? The potato? The suit? The friend? The dog? The poem?And that's just 50 lines on 2 pages. The book is 140 pages long and contains about 100 poems.The second poem, page 5, is &#34;What You Need For Painting - from a letter by Renoir&#34;. The last three lines are Carver's own story- did he edit Renoir? Paraphrase? Or simply translate into English?&#34;...Indifference to everything except your canvas.The ability to work like a locomotive.An iron will.&#34;Get it?Sure, there's the personal, often sad, redeemed, illuminating, short-story poems of loss and remorse, or rarely joy and optimism. As the back cover blurb says, &#34;No one's brevity is as rich, as complete, as Raymond Carver's.&#34; I can't top that, not the least for its own brevity.I have probably read &#34;The Car&#34; aloud to friends, co-workers and random passers by more than any other poem that I love. More than &#34;Howl&#34; by Alan Ginzberg. More than &#34;The Love-song of J. Alfred Prufrock&#34; OR 'McCavity the Mystery Cat&#34; by T.S. Elliot. More than any of Sharon Olds or A. A. Milne. More than any of &#34;Portable Kisses&#34;, by Tess Gallagher, Carver's wife, to whom Ultramarine was dedicated. Check out the dozens of different teaching guides on the internet, for using &#34;The Car&#34; in a classroom, and ask yourself why your English Literature teacher wasn't hip to this one. For a few bucks, you can have your own copy and read it to your friends.I bought a copy for my brother and his wife. When I delivered it, I read the poem to them. After I stopped, he said, &#34;The car I struck with a hammer. The car *I* struck with a hammer....

I hope that there are more books like this out there, and I hope that you will be the next to buy, read, and review this book!"},{"Title":"Ultramarine: Poems","review":"I often find myself defending Carver as a writer's writer, someone whose craft and voice are just as important as the story itself. He uses the language of the people he writes about to tell their story, and his though he's been labeled a minimalist, his work is more of that of a precisionist. Carver wastes no words, and his portions are perfect. I'd place Carver in the top three short story writers of all time, of anyone's list.His poetry sucks, though. Where his stories are able to carry sparse poetic moments (the drawing at the end of \\"Cathedral\\" or the barber moving his hands through the man's hair in \\"The Calm,\\" to name two) through the strength of the narrative, his poems have almost no narrative to speak of. A poem like \\"Limits\\" is almost successful because Carver spreads it out a bit and lets some sort of form emerge, but even then he relies too heavily on the abstract. He's always used the abstract well, and it's disappointing to see him fail so miserably at mastering that same trait in his poetry. The vast majority of these poems are like the last line of the story \\"Fat\\" (\\"Waiting for what? I'd like to know. My life is going to change. I feel it.\\"), where we are allowed to have the whimsy because we've been set-up for it. His poems begin and end with arbitrary people doing arbitrary things, and they eat their slice of life without sharing.His poems are exactly like his stories: from-the-gut tales of yore as told by an almost-dead Grandfather, the only man who can tell the same story as everyone else, but make it matter. Here's the difference: same Grandpa, same stories, except he's senile now and can only get out bits and pieces. Everything's disjointed and you can only shrug, because even though the story and the people in it probably matter, he's just not convincing enough. That's Carver's poetry."},{"Title":"Hit & Run Trading: The Short-Term Stock Traders Bible","review":"I am a newcomer to stock trading but felt I could make money if I just understood the game.

Out of guilt, I ended up buying the book (also my friend demanded his copy back) and have not had one regret since.

If you look at this book for purely trade setups it is a keeper. There are many that look very good and this will only prove to be true for testing which I plan to do with limited shares to limit my risk. I also liked that he pointed to two other resources (Magee and Schabacker) the originators of pattern trading (Schabacker is the founder of pattern trading).There are some setups that are so specific that they will probably rarely happen. For example, 180 trade shows on day 1 the price is below the 30 and 50 MA, day two the price turns around is over the 30 and 50 ma. For this to happen will be rare, the amount of setups it will show will be few.

This is Jeff Cooper's best-selling first book that has been revered by the trading community since it was first published in 1996.The name \\"Hit and Run\\" is appropriate as Jeff's style is to enter and exit trades on the same day. Years of experience have taught him that it is better to take profits home than risk things going awry by holding on too long. The contents of this book are loaded with daytrading strategies that have been proven to work. The entire trading process is covered from selecting the right stocks to timing the best entries and exits.Getting to the heart of the battle, Jeff discusses over a dozen tactics he uses to capture movement in individual stocks. Every method is illustrated with real examples. Use of price patterns in conjunction with ADX and DI readings are the primary sources for the decision-making. As Jeff says, \\"not all breakouts are created equally.\\" After watching the same processes play out over and over, Jeff has his craft down to a science. Specific rules for entering long or short are laid out very clearly, leaving little room for hesitation. Effective uses of trailing stops are also discussed to ensure profits are maximized.Every one of Cooper's strategies is designed to take full advantage of specific situations that tend to repeat themselves in the market. Expansion Breakouts, 180s, Boomers, and Lizards are trademarked patterns that have stood the test of time. Each chapter is structured to keep the big picture in mind while giving the intricacies of daily setups strict attention to identify high probability entries. Gauging behavior around the 50-day moving average may never be the same after reading these methods.Nothing is ever perfect in the markets, so it is important to have a good understanding of how things really work. Cooper's formulas for identifying risk-adverse setups are brilliantly simple, but it's his wisdom and experience that will help a new trader grasp the principles necessary to make his or her own decisions. One chapter is devoted to Cooper's trading journal so the reader can get a feel for what the business is all about. You will find reading this book is like being given a code to unlock opportunity in the market. Though it is important to keep in mind there is no substitute for discipline and hard work.To quote Jeff, \\"This is not an easy game, especially when a major market move (like the bull market which began in 1982) ends. There are probably fewer full-time professional traders in this country than there are professional athletes. You must be prepared to work as hard and to be as persistent as a professional athlete to become truly successful.\\""},{"Title":"Hit & Run Trading: The Short-Term Stock Traders Bible","review":"I purchased both of Cooper's books and have found that his methods really do work.I highly recommend the books to any short term trader who wants fresh new trading ideas and for those who need a structured game plan.Since I have use his strategies (I especially like the 1-2-3-4 strategy) I have made enough money to trade full time, and actually am trading money for family members.The short term aspect is key in that you will see immediate results if a trade goes your way."},{"Title":"Hit & Run Trading: The Short-Term Stock Traders Bible","review":"I am looking to enter into the world of trading.

I agree that Cooper's book is way overpriced for a book of such shoddy quality and miniscule content. Also most, of his so called &quot;strategies&quot; are nothing more than Japanese Candlestick patterns that have been around for hundreds of years. This guy is profiting handsomely by disguising Japanese Candlestick patterns as his own bar chart &quot;trademarks&quot;, giving the patterns his own distinct names and then reselling them. Steve Nison's classic &quot;Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques&quot; does a better job for a better price. His other strategies such as &quot;Expansion Breakouts&quot; are nothing more than trading range breakouts that have been around forever and can be found in any other technical analysis book.

It costs a little bit more ($122.50 thru Amazon) but well worth it since it offers a bit more detail and better hand-holding for a beginner. They are obviously business associates since their trading strategies fall under the same names and Jeff Cooper had referred to Larry Connors in this book.In &quot;Street Smarts&quot;, there were also better examples of how they manipulated the software to conform to their strategies and the type of software packages they recommended!&quot;Hit and Run&quot; would be a good follow-up and offer slightly new insights to the book &quot;Street Smarts&quot; once you understood the &quot;lingo&quot;. But probably, overall not worth the money since there were many more &quot;Street Smart&quot; strategies that could be used and were better explained by Connors and Raschke."},{"Title":"Hit & Run Trading: The Short-Term Stock Traders Bible","review":"I do not recommend this book. I went ahead and bought the book and read it. He claims it's the \\"trader's bible\\". He does provide ENTRY strategies as well as stops for these entries. He however, spends very little time saying anything useful about money management which is a very important aspect of any trading system. If this was not bad enough and you are smart enough to make your own money management scheme using his entries, you really can not do it, because he DOES NOT provide exit strategies! That is correct, he says it himself that his exits are completely discretionary (page 137). In any event, I went ahead and programmed all but two of this entry strategies (2 of them could not be done since they would require tick data and secondaries info to test them which I did not have - nor was I about to invest getting this data to test his strategies after seeing the bad results I got with the other entry strategies). Since he did not provide exit strategies, I tested several variations with each: exiting the next day at the open, exiting 2, 3, 4, 5 days after the signal. I also tested exiting randomly within the next 1 to 10 days. I did this testing to see if his entry strategies had any merit by themselves. I will not get into describing in detail the results for each. However I will say that NON of his entry strategies are worth investing in, because they make very little money if any at all. Those that did make some money made it when traded over MANY MANY trades (tested over 1500 stocks and averaged 4 trades a day). However, the statistical advantage was so little for winners that by the time you put some commission charge and some slippage (all his entries are stop based) you will definitively reduce the value of your account. Most likely you will just be feeding your brokerage house in the best case. In summary, the entry strategies I tested have no real trading benefit, he provides no money management scheme nor trade exit scheme - so it is not a trading system or strategy.

Our overall feel for this style of trading is that it could work with proper money management and proper filtering. In fact it has to work with proper filtering in an up market because experience tells us that trends experience pull backs and this books contains setups that will get you in to potentially large moves. Perhaps a filter looking for accumulation in the NASDAQ 100 or the S&amp;P 500 would bring solid returns.

I don't think that absolute beginners or investors will benefit from this but traders who know how to find the ADX and the +DI/-DI (that took me the longest time to figure out but it really was easier than I thought, most trading analysis programs carry it as a standard feature).

He argues that this is because thematic approaches often impose a lens upon the reading of the larger Text; they often miss the \`Text' for the \`texts' that make it up. Dempster proposes that instead, biblical theology should strive to acquire its lens from the Text itself, necessitating a belief in the unity of the one Text. Furthermore, if there is unity to the one Text, then questions pertaining to the literary structure of that Text have profound hermeneutical implications. He then proposes that the literary structure perhaps most helpful in determining the central message of the Old Testament is the Tanakh, since it is the oldest such structure and very likely the Bible of Jesus Christ. Discerning a fundamental theme of this text then becomes imperative to the discipline of hermeneutics. When it comes to any such theme(s) in the Hebrew canon, Dempster argues that the central storyline is composed of two main themes, dominion and dynasty, being realized through the house that God is building for David.Get past the introductory chapters and the rubber really hits the road in chapter 3 as he starts with Genesis, showing how Adam and Eve were made God's vice-regents over the land, failed at this task, and were then promised a coming seed to reestablish divine dominion. This proceeds to Abraham who was promised land for his descendants, who would be innumerable. One of these descendants, Jacob, at the end of Genesis then foresees Judah exercising dominion over the whole world. Dempster then walks through the rest of the Hebrew canon showing how the story of Scripture unfolds slowly but surely, with God demonstrating piece by piece what this coming dominion will look like. Israel is delivered from exile, conquers the land and institutes the Davidic dynasty, only to lose the land and find Judah exiled. All along the way, it is evident that the coming seed would serve as a priest-king over the people, who were to be a kingdom of priests and a light to the nations. Dempster argues that the middle of the Tanakh offers reflection on what has happened a view of what is to come.At the beginning of this middle section, Jeremiah states that all it not lost and God is tilling the ground, in essence, in preparation for planting and building. Such building is powerfully visualized for the reader in the book of Daniel, where the coming seed not only reestablishes dominion but also institutes a new world order where righteousness reigns in the place of sin. Before this, however, Dempster shows how the prophet Isaiah offers a stunning twist in the story. Israel must be torn apart because it is a vineyard that has failed and produces bitter grapes. At the same time, there will be a new Israel. The coming servant of the Lord will be different from the kings of the earth and will bring salvation to all nations. He will restore Israel and forgive her sins, bringing this new world order with him.The Hebrew canon then closes with Chronicles, which Dempster stresses ends on a note of eschatological expectancy. The exile in Babylon ends and Israel is commanded to rebuild the destroyed temple. The Tanakh therefore \\"orients its readers to the future. As such the Story is unfinished. The long, dark night of exile awaits a sequel--the dawning of a new light that will radiate to the ends of the earth\\" (227).Dempster then concludes his book with some brief reflections on how these twin themes of dominion and dynasty are immediately picked up in Matthew and begin to be fulfilled typologically all across the New Testament. Jesus brings the Kingdom of God and serves as the new David, the new Israel who does not fail in the wilderness and whose followers serve as a city set on a hill, etc. He is the obedient Son who suffers the curse for the disobedient son, but whose death inaugurates the end and ultimately brings about a new creation.The careful and meticulous demonstration of how the Hebrew canon sheds light on the central theme of the Old Testament, Christ, is both the aim and resounding success of this book. Dempster's rigorous defense of his thesis by highlighting the centrality of the literary structure and narrative concentration of the Tanakh is not easily dismissed or missed. One of the crucial ways he does this is by showing the literary and narrative significance of what have been often overlooked passages.The lengthy genealogies that appear suddenly in the opening chapters of Genesis and the middle of Nehemiah are demonstrated to be elemental in pointing the reader to the flow of history towards its purpose. This is evidenced by the short side-story of Judah at the end of Genesis. A text often seen as of little relevance to those who are text-minded suddenly takes on monumental significance for the Text-minded. The story of Ruth prefigures the inclusion of the Gentiles. The subtle mention of Mordecai as a descendent of Saul in Esther demonstrates both that forgiveness has come even to Saul's house and that God sees to his purpose in history to exterminate the Agagites. The preservation of Joash from Athaliah shows how close the line of Judah comes to being extinguished, yet protected by the providence of God. The apparent randomness of the insertion of details like those of Jehoiakim's at the end of 2 Kings prove to be part of a literary and narrative fabric that is larger than one text. Dempster's work is profoundly effective at demonstrating the unity of Scripture and making a case for the reading of the Old Testament according to its original structure.The only complaint that might be leveled at the book is that it doesn't labor too long on the New Testament evidence for his thesis. The book is a theology of the Hebrew Bible, so it is somewhat understandable that the New Testament only receives four pages' attention. However, given the hermeneutical presuppositions that the author works with, one might like to see this thesis carried out through the whole Text, which would include the New Testament. Dempster uses the four pages of New Testament reflection to great effect, focusing on how these themes are carried out in the New Testament. Nevertheless, the book would likely have profited from an extended discussion of the ordering of the New Testament and how that plays into the overall literary structure of Scripture as a whole. One further minor quibble might be that the author point the way forward towards application for the church. This is a minor quibble because the book essentially helps us to understand the central themes of the Old Testament better and how they anticipate the Lion of Judah found in the New Testament plainly enough. The application can easily be found with the way this book helps us to grasp Scripture more effectively.This book will likely help to legitimate the \`wide-angle lens' of the Tanakh as a launching pad for further studies into the themes of the Old Testament. Quite simply, I don't think I will ever read the \\"normal\\" ordering of the Old Testament found in most bibles again. I believe it simply must be read according to the Hebrew ordering in order to 'get it.' While this book will undoubtedly find its critics amongst those who have prior reservations over the reality or possibility of a Text, it will surely find a place on the desks of those with a thirst for seeing Christ in the Old Testament. The literary/theological approach of this work elucidates the redemptive story and how it anticipates Christ at every turn. As such, it should be read by pastors who desire to faithfully preach Christ from every text or by laypersons who, like Philip in Acts, desire to faithfully demonstrate Christ in all of Scripture."},{"Title":"Dominion and Dynasty: A Biblical Theology of the Hebrew Bible (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"This is without doubt the best book on Old Testament theology that I have yet read. I don't have time for a full review, but in brief, Dempster traces the twin themes of geneology and geography (seed and land/dynasty and dominion) throughout the Old Testament Hebrew canon (the order of the books in Hebrew is different from our English canon) and shows them to be the unifying themes of the Old Testament.Dempster's book did something more for me than even Graeme Goldsworthy's excellent book Gospel and Kingdom (which hitherto has been my favorite book on the Old Testament). Goldsworthy's book gave me an understandable outline of redemptive history in broad brush strokes. And it was invaluable to me, and really the foundation for understanding Dempster's book. But Dempster added to those broad brush strokes color and texture. Whereas Goldsworthy framed the puzzle for me, Dempster started putting significant pieces into place. So, really the two books complimented one another.Be warned: Goldsworthy writes for the layman, but Dempster writes on a more academic level. But that doesn't mean his book is boring. Far from it! It really is one of the most compelling books I've ever read. If you want to read a book that will help you make better sense of the Bible and open your eyes to see just how interwoven the tapesty of the Old Testament actually is, get Dempster. It is a great book and one that I am sure I will return to over and over again for many years."},{"Title":"Dominion and Dynasty: A Biblical Theology of the Hebrew Bible (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"Dempster's work is one of the latest in the New Studies in Biblical Theology Series. Of all the books I have seen in this series, this one is probably the closest to a pure Biblical Theology. Dempster traces two main themes throughout the Hebrew Canon (he adopts a canonical view using the Hebrew canon, not the Septuagint order we have in our English Bibles) of Dominion and Dynasty. The reason I say this is probably the closest to a pure Biblical Theology is because Dempster does not step out of the pages of Scripture to trace these themes. He does not look to historical evidence or other event oriented material, but simply looks at how the Pentateuch sets up the necessity of Messiah and the gift of the land to the people Israel. He then looks at the Prophets and Writings sections of the corpus and sees how they interpret and further realize the hopes for Israel found in the Pentateuch. This book is informative and a great introduction to the Biblical Theology of the Old Testament because of its macroscopic view. It is simple to read which was one of the goals of the series. I encourage anyone just starting to look at the Bible to those who have been doing Biblical Studies for years to read this book. Another great one is Pentateuch as Narrative by John Sailhamer which takes more of a microscopic look at the Pentateuch and its Theology."},{"Title":"Dominion and Dynasty: A Biblical Theology of the Hebrew Bible (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"Dominion and Dynasty: A Theology of the Hebrew Bible by Stephen G. Dempster is 15th in the New Studies in Biblical Theology series by Inter-Varsity Press.The series is aimed at helping thinking Christians understand the Bible better by instructing and edifying, marrying mind and heart. It fulfills this goal. It is a bit academic yet certainly accessible to the \\"thinking\\" person for whom it is written. It is very readable and certainly recommended as a supplement to Bible study, classes stressing the Old Testament, and personal devotional reading in conjunction with Scripture.In his preface, Dempster indicates this work is a result of his looking at the Old Testament for general contours, not details, after being concerned he was missing the forest for the trees. Thus, this book is a welcome supplement to detailed commentaries in which the \\"trees\\" and even their tiniest branches are dissected. There is a place for both, and Dempster provides a valuable counter-balance both for academics and personal reflection.His thesis regarding biblical theology, as described in the introduction, follows: \\"[I]f it can be shown that literary means that this material has not only an implicit literary cohesion but an explicit unity as well, biblical theology may get a fresh hearing.\\" (p. 37) This approach deserves to be heard. The author's understanding of genres makes his reading of the Tanakh \\"literary\\" in the true sense of the word: how the ancient contemporary reader understood the text. And his view of the unity and integrity of the writing echoes Catholic teaching. Reading the Bible with a \\"hermeneutic of charity rather than of suspicion\\" (p.42) presumes unity and coherence of the Word of God. Should we expect anything less?Dempster's thorough survey of the books of the Tanakh really adds value to the reading of the sacred page by providing insights, particularly regarding his overarching theme of \\"dominion and dynasty.\\" The prominence of land and genealogy is no surprise to Christian worshipers and even the casual reader of the Bible (\\"Promised Land\\" and lots of \\"begats\\"). But the author's unique focus on these themes in the Tanakh adds a valuable volume to the literature.Finally, Dempster briefly mentions the New Testament and typology. It immediately brings to mind Augustine's famous quote: \\"The New Testament lies hidden in the Old and the Old Testament is unveiled in the New.\\" (CCC 129) The amount of typology within the Old Testament is enlightening in itself and Dempster does a service in pointing out so much of it. Generally speaking it is not something to which the modern reader is nearly as much attuned as Old vs. New. But touching upon the New Testament makes me look forward to a sequel that treats this in the same depth the author treats the Tanakh."},{"Title":"Dominion and Dynasty: A Biblical Theology of the Hebrew Bible (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"I did not have much exposure to the academic study of the Old Testament before reading this book. I knew the stories and the overall plot line, but I had a lot of gaps in my knowledge and did not know how everything fit together. This book helped with that tremendously. He walks through almost every story of the Old Testament showing how they relate to the others and continue a unified theme all the way through. It can be a little dry as he is doing a lot of analysis of the Hebrew used in different passages, but if you have some patience with it you will greatly benefit from reading Dempster's work."},{"Title":"Dominion and Dynasty: A Biblical Theology of the Hebrew Bible (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"In his hermeneutics text, \\"Understanding and Applying the Bible,\\" Robertson McQuilkin offers three principles for understanding Scripture. The essence of the second of these principles is: \\"Since Scripture is God-breathed..., the unity of its teachings must be sought.\\" In his book Dominion and Dynasty, Stephen Dempster seeks to do just that. He takes a somewhat unique approach to helping the reader understand the Bible by studying the Old Testament in its Hebrew canonical form, or Tanakh. His contribution is to encourage the reader to view the Bible as a book with a storyline. It's a logical approach that Dempster offers in convincing fashion. Rather than reading passages, stories, or individual books as units, viewing the Bible as a book encourages the reader to understand the material in the light of the larger literary context.Dempster traces the dual themes of geography and genealogy (dominion and dynasty) throughout the Hebrew canon, following the order of the books in the Tanakh. However the particular order in which he places the books within that storyline could have used some explanation since they seem to differ from what is found in most Hebrew texts.Dempster writes on an academic level, but his writing style makes it an easy read for the layman. On the whole, Dominion and Dynasty is an excellent book. Dempster has profound insights into the biblical text, carefully pointing out inter-textual connections that he calls \\"echoes.\\" This book is an excellent contribution to Old Testament theology, largely because of its macroscopic view. It will forever change how I read the Old Testament."},{"Title":"Dominion and Dynasty: A Biblical Theology of the Hebrew Bible (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"Unless you are an Old-Testament scholar or someone with a peculiar interest and passion on the Old Testament, it could be a challenge to enjoy reading \\"Dominion and Dynasty.\\" To me personally, I dragged my feet slowly and laboriously as I walked through the book. There are lessons to learn, yet overall, the flavor is somewhat bland. I could not put my finger on why this is the case. It could be the presentation that tends to be more of a scholarly style, considering I am not a Bible scholar. But anyhow, here Prof. Dempster attempts to describe out of a literary study, the big picture of what the Hebrew Bible is about by connecting the dots from each book that composes it. In other words, by studying the trees, not from a ten-thousand foot altitude, an attempt was made to understand what the forest looks like. Another way to say what the goal of a literary study is to understand the big-picture \\"plot, that refers to a meaningful or purposeful arrangement of incidents or events in the text from beginning to end\\" or \\"to achieve a clear understanding of its beginning and ending that will help the reader determine its plan and organization, which clarifies its overall meaning\\" (p.45). The literary study of the Bible is critical, most importantly, \\"... because the Bible is a sacred literature that readers should be serious about enjoying it, learning to understand it as a literature (it may be possible for the Old-Testament, but may not be as easy for the New Testament, particularly when I think of the sequence of the epistles). Since it is not a \`mere' literature, its comprehension is imperative. For believers, the interpretive task is not only validated; it is sanctified\\" (p.26).The Hebrew Bible or Tanakh consists of the same books, but is structured differently from the Old-Testament. It is divided into Torah that most of us are familiar with, that includes Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy), Nevi'im or the Prophets covering Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah and the twelve, and Ketuvim or the Writings, composed of Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Songs of Solomon, Lamentation, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles (p.36). In Section 1, not only the importance of a literary study of the Bible is pointed out, but also various views from different references of the difference of canonical arrangement of Old-Testament and the Tanakh. In general, from the major division, it has the pattern of narrative (Torah) - commentary (Prophets) - narrative (Writings). Further observations for example, that the Old Testament, having the classical Prophets at the end accentuates eschatology while the Tanakh's structure emphasizes ethics. The Old Testament anticipates fulfillment while the Tanakh signifies completion (p.40), which I believe Dempster seems to disagree but does not explicitly write it since at the end of the book, he implies that Chronicles, being the last book of Tanakh, also anticipates fulfillment.It is important to note that \\"the beginning sketches the context, providing background information and introducing the main characters and themes of the work\\" (p.45). Therefore, Genesis account of creation culminated by the creation of Adam and Eve provides this key context of genealogy and dynasty, as well as land - geography and dominion, the loss of land and exile being a peculiar sub-theme of the latter. These are the recurring theme of other major accounts throughout the Tanakh, including the post-deluvian humanity represented by Noah and his family, the calling of Abraham out of Ur in the Chaldees, the liberation of the Israelis from Egypt, Naomi's return from exile, and finally the return from the Babylonian exile, the rebuilding of the city and temple in Jerusalem. The major themes of all of these center around the Davidic dynasty, as well as the loss and re-acquisition of land or dominion. Since the journey in the wilderness, it has been shown over and over again Israel's failure to keep God-given covenant despite them being a chosen nation to represent \\"a new humanity.\\" Yet the Prophets make it clear that God has promised a \\"new David\\" who \\"has fulfilled the covenant requirements, made atonement and established an everlasting covenant with all who accept his free offer to partake his covenant meal\\" (on Isaiah 55:1-2, p.180), also extended to all nations, and whose \\"victory will mark the victory of the saints, who will also receive universal dominions. Humanity will regain the dominion and royal status conferred on it at the beginning\\" (p. 217).The return from the Babylonian exile is not the fulfillment of the restoration of this dominion and royal status since the \\"real exile will not be over until the Messiah comes\\" (p. 225). Somehow it offers hope, however, though it \\"paints a very bleak picture of the restoration and return,\\" (p. 224), at least from \\"the realities depicted in Ezra - Nehemiah - compromise, assimilation to the pagan culture, unfaithfulness, and devotion to their own pursuits instead of the kingdom of God. The spiritual and moral torpor... reinforce the failure of the restoration movement\\" (p. 224). As a conclusion, Chronicles show that \\"Israel is still in exile even though it has returned\\" (p.224). Yet hope never dies because the command to rebuild the temple illustrates the fulfillment of a prophetic hope, that would be \\"a rallying point for a new world order of peace and harmony in which a new David will proclaim the Torah. As Jews make their way up to the temple, spurred on by the Psalms of Ascent (Ps 120-134), the people from the nations will grab the hems of their robes, saying, \`Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with you' (Zech 8:23)\\" (p.227). In the end, as Dempster puts it, the end of Chronicles, and thus, the Tanakh, is a \\"Story (with big \\"S\\") unfinished. The long, dark night of exile awaits a sequel - the dawning of a new light that will radiate to the ends of the earth\\" (p.227). This \\"dawning of a new light\\" is revealed in no other texts than the New Testament that completes the Story of God and his creations from the beginning to end."},{"Title":"Dominion and Dynasty: A Biblical Theology of the Hebrew Bible (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"The book came on time as described by the sender.

It covers every species and subspecies of mammal found in the state of Texas, including marine mammals. The information seemed mostly sound, but there were a few inconsistencies and mistakes presented. The inconsistencies mostly involved the way range maps were presented. In some cases, in species that have undergone range contraction, range maps presented both a historical range and a current range. In other cases they do not (as for black bears).There were also some odd range maps; for instance, the range map for the armadillo shows them inhabiting the whole panhandle, but without any confirmed county sightings recorded for the whole western edge of the panhandle and a good portion of the northen panhandle; about 14 continuous counties were listed as part of it's range without a single sighting in any of them. Their absence from this range would make sense, as the soil is very hard with a caliche base, and there are not a lot of riparian habitats which help the spread of armadillos. I can't swear for sure that they're not here, but I'd like to know why thy listed that part of texas as within the range of the armadillo without any sightings.There is also a case where they list one species of skunk (the hooded I think) as the largest skunk, giving it's maximum weight as 4.5kg, but then list the striped skunk as reaching up to 8kg. One of those statements has to be false...Then, they record the maximum weight of the mountain lion as 220 kg! That would be just shy of 500 lbs, or the size of a tiger. They can reach up to about 220 pounds though--I think a copy editor probably messed up there.On the whole though, a good book--there were some errors but the bulk of the information seems sound was the authors were very thorough, covering reproduction, diets, dental formulas...essentially the basics of the animal's life history in each description."},{"Title":"The mammals of Texas (Bulletin - Texas Parks and Wildlife Department ; no. 41)","review":"Product arrived in excellent condition and ahead of the expected delivery date.

I had a letter like that from Franz today.\\"This opening line from Sanna was a great hook that brought immediacy and a tenseness that rarely dissipates in this well paced, dramatic portraiture of late 1930's Germany. Sanna is a 19 year girl caught between a desire to be flighty, flirty teenager but confronting the reality of a Germany racing full into its darkest period. Irmgard Keun wrote this story in 1937. It must have taken enormous bravery to do so and intelligence to tell it so well.What the reader gets is a story about a girl observing and living in a swirl of increasing intolerance and oppression where one must seek out the proper worldview and express it in thought, voice and action. But what if that worldview keeps changing? She gets confused. Race laws increasingly isolate Jews, artists, political opponents. Neighbors race to tattletale to the Gestapo which now supercedes the police. Families wonder where a father or son or friend has disappeared to. Others hope to curry favor and get ahead by spying and pounding out the new \\"worldview\\" louder.The story itself focused on Sanna and her friends affections for boys and men. They don't differentiate by race or religion but only what drives the heart. Around them is a world far less tolerant that they can barely understand. Kuen's ability to give such innocent voices clarity to the reader while not discrediting their character is a neat trick that works well. They can observe and offer insight without sounding outside their own youth and limitations.The book worked for me as it disposes of the idea that \\"no one knew\\" or that \\"things could have been different\\". No. The Nazi regime was quickly imposing it's will on the people; divided between fervent followers and those to be sent away. They were aiming towards larger far more violent goals that were inescapable. Kuen brilliantly plays this out by introducing 2 English journalists researching the \\"new\\" Germany of which they only see good and can only praise despite all the evidence right before them. It makes a great argument on the ability to live in denial.It's a short book. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"After midnight,","review":"Keun (1905-1983) was neither a precocious waif nor a tough cynical shop girl, like the female protagonists of her novels \\"Child of All Nations\\" and \\"The Artificial Silk Girl\\". Or was she? She certainly 'inhabited' those characters -- wore their psyches like a clinging blouse. That's her quotient of greatness as a novelist, her ability to portray the mentality of a 'common' woman with uncanny plausibility. She does men almost as accurately. But the real-life Irmgard Keun, the woman who hooked up with Alfred D&ouml;blin and Joseph Roth? Was she a sly intellectual from the start or was she someone like Susanne, the heroine of \\"After Midnight\\"? Susanne (Sanna) is patently no intellectual; she's what a Minnesotan would call \\"a smart cookie\\" - an ordinary lower-class 19-year-old German girl with no particular education or ambition other than having her bit of fun and being treated decently. But she's not blinded by glamor or pomp; she's the girly equivalent of the Boy in the fairy tale who blurted out the truth about the Emperor's New Clothes. In this case, the naked Emperor is Adolf Hitler and his entourage, and thus the whole buck-naked viciousness of the Third Reich.Susanne has an older brother, a leftist writer named Algin who has been ostracized by the Nazi publishers. When the ingenue Susanne comes to live with her brother in Frankfurt, her reportage of the ideas she hears in her brother's circle provides author Irmgard Keun with a more explicit 'voice' with which to castigate the Nazi regime, even though Susanne often declares that she doesn't understand all of what she reports, and wishes her brother and her friends would be more cautious about 'shooting off their mouths'. Susanne, the smart-cookie \\"Strassenjunge, cynical beyond her years, has no urge toward 'commitments' in politics or in social life, except for her half-discarded lover Franz, whom she has left behind in Cologne. The novella commences with a letter from Franz, declaring simply that he'll be coming to Frankfurt to see her.\\"After Midnight\\" is, in the end, a love story, though Franz doesn't arrive until late in the narrative. It's also a caustic, unvarnished portrayal of German society/culture in the early years of Nazi governance, seen through the eyes of ordinary Germans of the lower and lower-middle classes. Keun's accomplishment is to make the insanity and viciousness of Nazidom seem, as it must have seemed, both sane and virtuous to the majority of ordinary Germans at the time. How else could such horrors have transpired, unless people accepted them as congruent with mundane civilized life?Let's make this review folksier. You want to get a taste of daily life in Hitler's Third Reich? This little novel tells it like it was."},{"Title":"After midnight,","review":"I was expecting After Midnight to be one of those novels that's not that interesting by itself but sticks in your mind later as a reflection of its times. I'm looking at Mephisto (Klaus Mann) and A Tomb for Boris Davidovich (Danilo Kis) here. Not so for Keun's novel of Nazi Germany, however. I enjoyed the novel while I was reading and still had that feeling of this-is-great-because-it-expresses-pivotal-history. Keun's narrator, Sanna, is deceptively nave. She's young and all absorbed with romance and social relationships and then, boom, she mentions some aspect of Nazi control that's recently come to dominate Keun's characters' lives. The growing effects of Nazism on everyday German society accelerate quickly throughout the novel, with Sanna's life being turned upside down within the course of the two days covered by the story. Like the aforementioned novels concerning authoritarian governments, After Midnight very clearly expresses the life-changing (and life-annihilating) properties of said governments. Unlike the other novels, the central character of After Midnight is one with whom readers can better identify because, at least on the surface, she's just like any other young adult. After Midnight also covers a fairly full spectrum of German lives, from intellectuals to children to Nazi sympathizers to the average people just caught up in it all. The novel even has a satirical character who, like Shakespeare's jesters and other jokesters, is there to provide some comedic relief along with a clear view of what, exactly, is going on. Only this is a book about Nazi Germany, so there's very little relief to be found in these scathing, depressed denouements that will only end in tragedy.On Germany: \\"One dreadful day, revenge will come, and it won't be divine revenge, it will be even more atrocious, more human, more inhuman. And that atrocious revenge which I both desire and fear will necessarily be followed by another atrocious revenge, because the thing that has begun in Germany looks like going on without any hope of an end. Germany is turning on her own axis, a giant wheel dripping blood\\" (p 143). - What I consider to be the most powerful passage of the book."},{"Title":"After midnight,","review":"Melville House's Neversink Library is something that I've been looking forward to for some time, and in particular this release. I enjoyed The Artificial Silk Girl by Keun but After Midnight is the better book. I think the translation is better. There's something surreal about this tale of teenagers trying to live a normal life in the midst of the SS and Nazi Germany.I'm looking forward to the rest of the series when they come out."},{"Title":"After midnight,","review":"Sometimes we happen to come across a little gem of a book that had disappeared, literally, for decades. After Midnight, written by Irmgard Keun in 1937 during her exile in Holland, is just one such book. Now translated into English by the admirable Anthea Bell, the first since the original translation in 1938, it belongs into a select treasure collection of recently re-discovered notable German fiction, written either just before or right after World War II. Each novel depicts, in diverse ways, aspects of ordinary people's daily life during the early years of the Nazi regime. Among these authors we find books by Hans Fallada (eg.Every Man Dies Alone), Hans Keilson (eg.The Death of the Adversary: A Novel) and Irmgard Keun (eg.The Artificial Silk Girl). To this distinct collection of novels by 'contemporary witnesses' we can now add AFTER MIDNIGHT. In some way it can be regarded as a 'prequel' toChild of All Nations: A Novel, written in 1938, that tells the story of one family's life in exile, seen from the perspective of a ten-year old girl.Keun's three novels mentioned above open a window into a time and place that is difficult for us to imagine in detail. Her style is conversational and easy-going, with localisms and vivid images sprinkled in. In this novel, the author endows her narrator, 19-year old Susanne with an independent voice and a mind that roams with great ease between recounting what she hears and observes around her and pondering her own inner thoughts that either add humorous commentary on the people she meets, ask questions, or take her mind to past problems in her young life. Some readers might find Keun's writing a bit too casual and seemingly lightweight for the realities she deals with. However, there is much irony and depth in Susanne's comments and for us readers with hindsight, a wealth of astute observations.Susanne, 'Sanna', has recently arrived in the big city (Frankfurt) to escape the clutches of the Gestapo and to leave her mean-spirited aunt who had denounced her to the authorities together with her first love and now fianc&eacute;, the quiet, diffident Franz. With regret she had to leave him behind... but, as the novel opens, she has finally received a letter announcing that he is on his way to meet her \\"one more time\\"... Sanna worries about that little phrase, but life in the animated society circle of her step-brother Alvin, a popular and affluent writer, and his beautiful, luxurious wife, Liska, is too exciting to worry for long. Sanna is a pretty young woman of the time: enthusiastic, nave and trusting. She is not interested in politics and can just as easily flirt with a man from the SS, the SA or the Jewish doctor, who is one of her brother's friends. Sanna and her close friend Gertie, are often also joined by the funny, sarcastic journalist Heini who is highly entertaining despite, or because of, his falling out of favour with the authorities. He is the first to feel the wind of change and his ironic and witty commentary alone would make the book worth reading. \\"I used to be a quick-witted and humorous journalist\\", he laments. \\"What I believed I had to say, I have said, in my own way and language. Now, in this time of widespread 'word inflation', is it not a pity when a thinking person moves on to total silence?\\" Alvin, in the meantime, has also been included in the Nazi blacklist and can no longer find a publisher; his existence is quickly reduced to nothing and his mind to despair. As the story moves to its dramatic climax - \\"after midnight\\" - the pace in the narration speeds up, the different strands of the story come together, overlap and ...Keun's novel is first of all a fascinating document for its time. Yet, it is more also. It is an entertaining story to read that, with her typical light and ironic touch, provides us with a highly perceptive portrayal of a society on the cusp of disaster. Keun has filled her story with some memorable characters and their discussions on where the country is headed brings out different points of view, not all presented with the same level of seriousness as the Jewish doctor's consideration of possible exile, a move that does not appeal to Heini:\\"... poor &eacute;migr&eacute;. [...] You will become a torment to yourself and a burden to others. The roofs that you see have not been built for you. The bread that you smell, is not being baked for you. And the language that you hear will not be spoken for you.\\" [Friederike Knabe]*) having read the novel in its original, all translations are mine."},{"Title":"After midnight,","review":"I think some of the readers didn't \\"get the point\\". The point of this book is that a simple young woman should be allowed to be JUST THAT. Why are the intellectuals here not getting that simple people have a right to their simple existence? That fascist totalitarian governments strip individuals of their basic rights. The point is: thugs took over a world power by brainwashing and manipulating a whole bunch of simpletons. Lots of simpletons went along with hate-mongering politics out of personal greed or fear. This book attempts to show how intellectuals rationalize this manipulation and then turn on each other, which ultimately just feeds more power to those up top. Vast groups of innocents suffer for the gain of few. Sound eerily familiar? This book is a classic, epic, snapshot of government gone bad that every citizen should read. It has far reaching implications regardless of heritage, race, or nationality."},{"Title":"After midnight,","review":"This is a very intense piece of writing, offering a glimpse the life led by everyday people in Hitler's Germany.The tensions runs high from start to finish as the characters deal with the difficulties of life, under constant threat of being reported for the slightest hint of offense against the regime.There was a sense of urgency about every scene in this book, which was a little tiring at times, but which I also think was necessary to convey the fear of the characters as they each battle their personal demons. I certainly put the book down at the end with a sense of relief that I could now take a moment to breathe.I never really felt I fully engaged with the characters, but I wonder if that was intentional on the part of the author, given the detachment of the characters themselves as they look for ways to escape their various lives and situations.This is a quick read at only 135 pages, but I would not necessarily say it was a light one, despite the moments of great satirical humour that save the piece from becoming too depressive; more one for a dark, long night than a simple rainy afternoon, but worth the effort for those you like a deeper type of literary fiction.I received this book as a free e-book ARC from NetGalley."},{"Title":"After midnight,","review":"Just another of many,many books written about life in Germany during the rise of the Nazi movement.Many others tell a wider more gripping story."},{"Title":"After midnight,","review":"I expected so much more from this book, seeing as it had only 4-5 star reviews when I picked it up. I was sadly disappointed.The book is written from the viewpoint of Sanna, a ditzy, naive young woman who surrounds herself with what can only be described as near-alcoholics who like to listen to themselves talk. Much of the book is long, meandering dialogues by various characters, often in various stages of drunkeness. I got through 75% of the book before finally admitting I didn't like any of the characters. This isn't necessarily a reason for me to quit reading a book - if it's well written I'll keep going even if I don't particularly like the characters. But in this instance I didn't like the characters nor did I care what happened to them. I didn't care if Sanna is reunited with her lover (who's her cousin), I didn't care is Liska and Algin (Sanna's brother) fix their marriage, if Liska gets over her strange, obsession with another man. Overall none of the characters were written well enough to provide enough depth to make you care about them.Seeing this slim peek into Nazi Germany is frightening as I know people truly thought that way, that Jewish people were suddenly diseased, terrible, and a lesser people. Yet in this novel I couldn't get past the self-centeredness of each character to appreciate the picture it was trying to paint."},{"Title":"Holiness : Gods Plan for Fullness of Life","review":"Holiness is a charged word. Many associate it with backwoods ministers and \\"holy rollers\\" who take legalism and ignorant religion to the extreme. However, Blackaby strives to help the reader understand holiness as it is in the Bible, from God's perspective. Blackaby presents these three points: today's Christians no longer fear God; they cannot see sin from God's perspective; and they fail to walk on God's \\"highway of holiness.\\" It is the lack in these three areas, Blackaby contends, that explain the lackadaisical and uncaring attitude present in many churches and individuals today.This book crosses all denominations and should prick the heart that truly wants to serve God and live the Christian life to the fullest. (In some areas I felt that Blackaby repeated himself a little, but perhaps that was simply to reiterate key points that some readers could miss.) Overall, I felt challenged after reading the book. Too often Christians allow sin to get in the way of their fellowship with God, and Blackaby exposes this disaster for what it really is. Every Christian who is serious with God should read this book, and the short length allows Blackaby to quickly deliver his message."},{"Title":"Holiness : Gods Plan for Fullness of Life","review":"This book is one of those ones that you'll read and read again.

It stays with you vividly - I can remember very clearly where I was when I first read it.I only wonder however whether it will still appeal to 14-year olds today - I don't think it has dated but maybe I'm nostalgic. What it has to say about the difficulties of being a teenager and growing up to my mind are just as relevant (it was several reads before I could read about Cathy's experiences with Earl without squirming). To sum up, I was miserable when someone borrowed my copy and lost it and delighted when on holiday in Washington the Library of Congress traced it for me.

The basis for the title is an old proverb to the effect of \\"It is better to light a single candle that sit and curse the darkness.\\" Cathy, through losing her sight, faces darkness. The book details how people react to her differently, and how she reacts. It details the choices she makes, and her reasons behind them. I believe that this book was written before mainstreaming of special education students became mandatory. The book also mentions Cathy using books on records, which we now use as books on tape or CD, so modern young persons reading this might need a quick history lesson. I would one day like to teach elementary school, about 4th grade level, and this would be an ideal book to read, as Cathy is only a few years older than they. The title of the book have stuck with me over 25 years, since I read it in middle school, and I intend to purchase a copy soon.

Once enjoying a normal and fairly uneventful life, Cathy now finds herself having to learn how to live in a different world. She once enjoyed drawing, which she can no longer do; she once enjoyed bike riding, and now that's a challenge. She once had a close friendship with her neighbor Pete, who no longer talks to her.Desperately unnerved with the prospect of going back to regular high school, Cathy agrees to give the state school for the blind a try. That, however, comes with its own obstacles -- it's a hundred miles away, so Cathy must board there; many of the girls have been blind most of their lives, and well accustomed to many things that Cathy is not. Worst of all, the teachers and director don't seem too optimistic about a blind girl's future among average people.It's Cathy's semester at the school that gives her the strength to come home and give her old life a new try -- only as a person with a few new challenges to overcome.Though it's overwhelming and difficult at first, Cathy is soon amazed to learn about all she can accomplish if only she puts her mind to it. Best of all, the teachers at the blind school were wrong -- not every sighted person will either pity or mock her. To her delight, Cathy soon begins to enjoy new friendships and opportunities, some even beyond ones she would have sought out previously.Although some of Cathy's experiences are dated -- the public high school, for example, has no accomodations for students with any sort of special needs -- most of her other struggles are still valid today.

And there is strife among the groups, who engage in discrimination based on widely different cultural values and lifestyles, though all believe in the same G-d and follow the same scriptures.The essays go into much detail about individual lives of women who experienced this discrimination or outright, terrible oppression at the hands of local people in their homelands -- Iraq, Iran and other places. Some of the stories are frightening; in one essay, the writer describes a horrifying massacre in Iraq. Her parents were then left literally stateless, their passports invalid and no land accepting them for refugee status. It's hard not to cry while reading this story. Others talk about a shameful treatment of returnees to Israel, and the division in the communities there. Some of the writers tried to &quot;pass&quot; as French Jews rather than Moroccan, to avoid being treated as an underclass exactly as African-Americans experience in the United States. These stories made me so angry.The essays are also a unique view inside Jewish traditions that are probably as unfamiliar to most Jews as they would be to non-Jews. It was a revelation that some Hebrew is spoken with an Arabic accent, using Arabic words. I couldn't put this book down, and I think anyone interested in the struggles in the Mideast ought to read this, and definitely, if you are Jewish, you should not pass up this book. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"The Flying Camel: Essays on Identity by Women of North African and Middle Eastern Jewish Heritage (Live Girls)","review":"i think everyone needs to read this book in hebrew school, so they know that dark jewish girls like me are not freaks of nature!!! i wish the book had essays by teenage girls, but i like it that a lot of the essays talk about growing up as a jewish girl in different countries. it was cool to read about the amazing things they did when they were my age."},{"Title":"The Flying Camel: Essays on Identity by Women of North African and Middle Eastern Jewish Heritage (Live Girls)","review":"I am one of the &quot;dark&quot; Jews.

Maybe these writers didn't look for opportunity to enrich those around them? Many of the Mizrachi Jews I knew in Israel hung out in a very mixed crowd, and it didn't seem to impead their lives. In fact they would often jokingly make fun of us poor white skinned ashkenazis when we went to beach! There have to be more positive aspects to the way Asheknazi Jews interact with Mizrachi Jews.

Who is a \\"real\\" Latino? Who is a \\"real\\" anything?In the case of this book, the question slowly unravels in an enigmatic answer of who is a \\"real\\" Jew. As a non-denominational Christian who is devoted to exploring and identifying the roots of her faith, I have always been interested in learning more about the Jewish experience, the Jews from which my faith is derived. As I searched for books about this culture, this PEOPLE, I found this gem among a sea of mainstream Jewish literature.\\"The Flying Camel\\" is absolutely amazing. The compilation of essays is told through first-hand accounts of women who are not only Jewish but \\"Arab,\\" so to speak. They are Morroccan, yes. They are Iraqi-Egyptian, of course. They are Iranian. They are North African and Middle Eastern, AND they are Jews.Upon reading their stories, I realized that their lives had been plagued with discrimination and violence, seperation and disdain. Many, many of the stories are so identical to the plight of African-Americans in the United States. They are not tolerated, but even worse, as women in Arab societies, their marginilization is described at best, to be intolerable to the reader. Surprisingly though, their identity is even disputed amongst Ashkenazi or European Jews, which makes even the quest to piece together their real identities even more difficult and daunting.Despite this unacceptance from the \\"white\\" or \\"European\\" Jews, the Mizrahi and Sephardic Jews boast of their unique cultures and traditions embedded in thousands of years of inhabiting their middle-eastern countries even before Islam settled in. The authenticity or \\"realness\\" of their Jewish roots is only a distraction used by their doubters to dismantle their real experiences, their real lives, their real heritage, their real faith.I recommend this book to those wanting to learn about the Jewish experience in the Arab world, and North Africa. It is also a stark view into the daily lives, traditions, customs and lifestyles of living in the East as women and as unwanted neighbors.As a sidepiece, I really recommend anything Yasmin Levy. She is a Spanish Jew, who uses Ladino songs to tell of the history of her people and also fuses the style into romantic love songs. Her album \\"Mano Suave\\" was my soundtrack to this book. :) Just thought I'd add that."},{"Title":"New introductory lectures on psycho-analysis (The International psycho-analytical library, no. 24)","review":"Freud wrote this book in 1921, and its themes are related to his booksBeyond the Pleasure Principle-First Edition textandThe Ego and the Id - First Edition Text.Here are some representative quotations from the book:\\"(I)n a group the individual is brought under conditions which allow him to throw off the repressions of his unconscious instinctual impulses.

For example, a Berlin social club organiser concludes an evening's speeches with 'If we go to dance now, it will not be with a sense of alien lustfulness. Our dance is dance for Germany's rebirth.'Or there is the cycling enthusiast who claims, as the Weimar democratic constitution is dissolved that 'The Fuhrer demands the complete co-ordination (ie Nazi style structure) of the German cyclists' movement.'There is a German comedian in it who is in and out of prison after a tailor's shop sketch, involving a man being measured for a suit with his hand raised in a Nazi salute.

HumezThis book is a treasure. Eminently readable, impossible to put down, totally absorbing, this book will satisfy meticulous scholars and the general public. What a great way to learn U.S. history! Great quotes, critical appraisal of the work of earlier historians, new documentation, wonderfully illuminating photographs. A feast for the curious mind and eye.I have always wanted to know more about Harriet Tubman and as soon as I heard this book was out I dived into it. Harriet Tubman's life has been the subject of several biographers in the past, but in this work Humez convincingly argues that Harriet Tubman, who could not read or write, was able to produce a \\"self-authored life story\\" by carefully choosing the writers she collaborated with and exercising control about what stories to tell and how to tell them. This results in a fascinating and kaleidoscopic interpretation of Harriet Tubman's life, as seen through different authors and through Harriet Tubman herself.In the first section, \\"The Life,\\" I learned about the salient facts of Harriet Tubman's life: her years as a slave in Maryland, seeing two of her sisters sold and carried away in a chain-gang, her successful escape from slavery in 1849, when she was probably 29 years old, her contacts with the anti-slavery movement in the North, the mutual admiration of Harriet Tubman and John Brown who referred to her using the masculine pronoum (\\"Harriet Tubman hooked on his whole team at once. He is the most of a man, naturally, that I ever met with\\"). It is also about the clandestine trips she made to Maryland to rescue her extended family and others, her military and nursing work during the civil war and her settling in Auburn, New York, in poverty, taking care of old and sick people of color and children-- the John Brown Hall project, as she called it.Interesting quotes from her dictated letters reveal details that throw light on her views on other issues, such as women's rights. For instance, in telling about the successful Combahee River raid in South Carolina, in which she worked with Col. James Montgomery and a band of 300 black soldiers, she states after her dress was shred that \\"...I made up my mind then I would never wear a long dress on another expedition of the kind, but would have a bloomer as soon as I could get it...\\"It is in the second part, \\"The Life Stories,\\" that Humez makes the case that Harriet Tubman's gifts as a story-teller, singer, and performer and her reputation as an African-American celebrity ensured that her experiences as a slave and her deep spirituality would be preserved. Here, through a discussion on the politics of research, the dynamics between a researcher and her/his subject, and the cultural and social context that influences much of those dynamics, I felt Harriet Tubman's presence and resourcefulness vividly, towering above those who tried to capture her complex story and interpret her life according to their values and the racial views of their culture.The third part, \\"Stories and Sayings,\\" offers a hypothetical version of Tubman's \\"autobiography\\" culled from every individual life history story Humez was able to locate from the earlier works. While all the stories and sayings are revealing and offer significant insights my favorite part was the \\"Stories of Clever Exploits and Tricks,\\" probably because I always wondered how she actually carried out her rescue missions. In this section the intelligence, courage, and humor of Harriet Tubman shines through, like in the story \\"Avoiding Capture by Pretending to Read.\\" It says: \\" At another time when she heard men talking about her, she pretended to read a book which she carried. One man remarked. \`This can't be the woman. The one we want can't read or write.' Harriet devoutly hoped this book was right side up\\" (Tatlock, 1939a).The final section, \\"Documents\\" is a gift of primary source materials for future researchers and anybody interested in pursuing an in-depth study of Harriet Tubman's life.Read this book. See for yourself how illuminating the past and looking at history with a fresh eye can instill hope. This book is yes, about Harriet Tubman, but more fundamentally, it is a book about courage, dignity, persistence, and solidarity in incredibly harsh circumstances. What a gift for us all in these troubled times."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman: The Life and the Life Stories (Wisconsin Studies in Autobiography)","review":"Several years back I was watching a documentary on Harriet Tubman in which one of her relatives was interviewed. I suddenly realized I had never thought of Tubman as a real person, with actual living relatives! Her legend looms so much larger than life that she hovers somewhere in the realm of Paul Bunyan.This book begins with a traditional biography, presenting the bare bones of Tubman's life. The section called &quot;Stories and Sayings&quot; puts meat on those bones, breathing life into someone who has nearly been lost to us in legend. It's a fascinating concept, and I think it works.Equally amazing is the Documents section, reflecting 10 years of research and which will be required reading for any future Tubman scholars because, as Humez herself says, &quot;...my retelling of her life story cannot be definitive.&quot; Highly recommended.Curator, AfroAmericanHeritage dot com"},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman: The Life and the Life Stories (Wisconsin Studies in Autobiography)","review":"Harriet Tubman: The Life And The Life Stories by Jean M.

At the same time Paxton also demonstrated both the widespread support Petain could count on, at least at the beginning, as well as the fact that the regime was not consistently reactionary but also had modernizing elements which the Fourth and Fifth Republics would build upon. Now Julian Jackson has provided his account of the dark years. What has he done to modify Paxton's account?Like Jackson's two previous books on 1930s France, The Dark Years is based largely on secondary literature and memoir literature. Notwithstanding that Jackson's account is unusually thorough. He starts off with a discussion of the interwar years, which looks over such ingredients of Vichy as pacifism, the German threat, Action Francaise, the shock of the first world war and the Depression. He then discusses the Vichy regime, then goes on to discuss popular opinion about the occupation. There is then a large section on the Resistance, followed by one on the Liberation and the postwar Remembrance of the Occupation.Ever since Paxton's book appeared people have commented on how the French have been unwilling to confront the shame of Vichy. Jackson's response to this is a breath of fresh air: \\"The problem with such comments is not only the unwarranted condescension which underlies them--the assumption that \`we', the British, would have faced up to things much better in similar circumstances--but also the fact that they are so patently false....Far from being years which French historians avoid, the Vichy period is probably at present the most intensively researched in French history...\\"Jackson also points out that the historiography of Vichy was not subsumed in euphemistic darkness before Paxton came along. More important is the emphasis on a fact that Paxton did not sufficiently emphasize. The Germans were never popular under the occupation. The Germans' own reports on public opinion were consistently pessimistic. As one German professor noted in June 1941 \\"The French rejoice at the fact that British planes are attacking their cities...\\" The National Revolution under Vichy has some support, and there were powerful quasi-fascist movements in France before the war began, but its popularity too was limited. Petain, by contrast, was popular, at the beginning, though often this was because many people incorrectly believed he was a double game against the Germans (he was not). The fact that Petain did not have a reputation as a Monarchist led many people to believe he was more liberal than he actually was. The remarkable crowds which greated him a few months before liberation were, as Jackson points out, less an endorsement of him than an opportunity to show French flags after their banning under the occupation. At the same time plans for a more modern and planned economy, greater emphasis on physical education and contempt for the defeated Third Republic would continue into the post-war years. (Similarly, Jackson is also good at how the invaluable contribution made to the Resistance by immigrants to France was ignored and downplayed in the following years.)Jackson is good at pointing out the nuances of the occupation. He properly emphasizes the wide support many ordinary French men and women gave to persecuted Jews that was crucial to their high survival rate. He also refutes the Vichyist argument that their \\"interference\\" accounted for the lower rate of Frenchmen involuntarily drafted to labour in Germany. To the extent this was true, it was because of widespread resistance to the considerable efforts Vichy made to enforce German wishes. Jackson is also good on specific individuals. Henry de Montherlant's reaction to the occupation looks much less pleasant in retrospect. By contrast Lucien Febvre's continued publication of Annales looks more principled than has been given credit for, while Paul Claudel's praise of Petain should not lead one to ignore the fact that he was pro-British and against collaboration from the very beginning. Jackson is also good on the resistance. While the Allies would have liberated France without them, they made it considerable easier and they would have done more if the Allies had given them more arms. Although the Resistance's relations with the populace were strained, \\"the peasantry's attitude toward the Maquis was one of solidarity tempered by prudence, respect tempered by apprehension. Whether one stresses the prudence or the solidarity, there is no dobut that the Maquis could not have survived without the peasantry.\\" If it is true that the number of resisters increased dramatically at the time immediately before liberation, this was also the time when they faced the greatest physical danger. Perhaps the greatest virtue of Jackson's book is that it shows why glib sneers about French \\"cowardice\\" are no longer acceptable."},{"Title":"France: The Dark Years, 1940-1944 (Modern World)","review":"In other readings of World War II, I had always felt I did not have a solid grounding in the history of Vichy France. I have been greatly intrigued for some time as to how a country like France could have collaborated to such a degree. This gap in knowledge, I hoped, could be filled by a general treatise on the subject. Having reviewed several books on Vichy France I chose 'France- The Dark Years, 1940-1944' as the one work upon which I would rely.While I did admire the scope of the work, and have no argument that this book may be called the latest definitive source, be warned that this book is not written for those who do not have a working knowledge on the subject. The author does not spend time on set-up: the reader is presumed to know of not only the leading political figures in France during the 1930's-40's, but also those of greater obscurity. The list goes on with the presumptions of the author- we are supposed to know about newspapers of the era (of which there were many), political parties, both major and insignificant, and the names of resistance groups.Again, this would not be critical if I had the requisite knowledge of the politics and society of France during this era, of which I do know some. But this book is written for the doctoral level student of this era in history, not for those seeking a more general overview."},{"Title":"France: The Dark Years, 1940-1944 (Modern World)","review":"Julian Jackson's history is the most distinguished account I've read on France during the period from 1940 through 1944. He makes an excellent case noting how the Vichy Regime was indeed part of a longstanding political tradition in France which went as far back as the Ancien Regime; he makes a similar observation of the Resistance, noting how its political philosophy could be traced directly back to the French Revolution. Jackson clearly notes the intense dislike - if not outright hatred - of many French towards their German occupiers, noting that such sentiments may have played a decisive part in ensuring the survival of more French Jews than their counterparts in other Nazi-occupied countries. Much to my surprise, he clearly demonstrates how support for the Vichy Regime came not only from a staunchly conservative elements - but also liberal, and indeed socialist elements - within French society. He also succeeds in noting how figures such as French resistance leader Jean Moulin and future French president Francois Mitterand underwent transformations - some major, but also minor - in their politics, eventually shifting their support from the Vichy regime to DeGaulle's Free French movement. Despite Vichy's reputation for cultural as well as political repression, Jackson shows that cultural activities ranging from the fine arts through film not only survived, but also flourished, at least during the early history of the Vichy Regime."},{"Title":"France: The Dark Years, 1940-1944 (Modern World)","review":"Although I knew something about de Gaulle, Vichy, \\"The Resistance,\\" etc; usually these topics were tangential to some other main topic I was reading.

Jackson gives you enough background to evaluate some of the following puzzles:Why did Churchill recognize De Gaulle in 1940, instead of the Vichy Government?Why did FDR try so hard to get rid of \\"Le Grand Charles\\" (De Gaulle)?Why did many French literally cheer when France lost the War with Germany in June 1940?Why did powerful and influential French express such bitterness, invective, and hatred against Jews?Why did the \\"Resistance\\" accept De Gaulle in 1944? After all, thousands of French fought and died inside France while De Gaulle remained safely in England and Africa.Why didn't the Communists launch a takeover at the time of the Liberation?.After you read this book you will understand some of the powerful destabilizing forces in French society. But Dark Years is a long book, it's serious reading, and it's written ina rather academic style -- dull if you are not really intrigued by France, the French, De Gaulle, the Germans, the Jews, etc."},{"Title":"France: The Dark Years, 1940-1944 (Modern World)","review":"This is a fine book on France during the Occupation period. Until approximately 25 years ago, this period of French history was largely uninvestigated. Starting with the pioneering work of the American historian Robert Paxton, there has been explosive growth in the literature related to the occupation period. Not surprisingly, much of this literature has involved controversial topics such as the culpability of the Vichy regime in the Holocaust, the importance of the Resistance movements, the role of Communists in the resistance, and the exact role of DeGaulle and his supporters. Prof. Jackson does a fine job of summarizing and analyzing this extensive literature. He provides a nuanced analysis of the Vichy regime, presents the Resistance in a clear and evenhanded manner, and is quite enlightening on DeGaulle's role and behavior during the war. This book was undoubtedly difficult to write. In addition to the large literature on this subject, France during this period was divided into several units, each of which experienced the Occupation in rather different ways. The basic distinction was between the Occupied and Vichy controlled zones but Occupied France was further subdivided into portions controlled as part of the administration of Belgium (the far Northwest), as part of Germany itself (Alsace-Lorraine), and the remainder of occupied France. Add to this complex mixture the need to describe the complex history of the Gaullist Free French outside France.The heart of Jackson's book is the analysis of Vichy and its counterpart, the Resistance. As shown well, Vichy defies simple characterization. It was possible, for example, to be pro-Vichy and anti-German, at least at the beginning of the regime. Vichy benefited from the general disgust with the politics of the Third Republic and was seen by many as a potential vehicle for renewal of the French nation. Vichy leaders deluded themselves that an accomodationist policy would result in benefits, such as a peace treaty and end of the Occupation. As the war progressed, the Vichy regime would become increasingly collaborationist and the Vichy government participated willingly in German efforts to deport Jews to the concentration camps and in efforts to by German economic planners to acquire coerced French labor. Jackson also does a very nice job of revealing the tangled origins and history of the Resistance and its complex relationship with the Gaullist movement.Jackson is a competent though not outstanding writer. Because of the complex nature of the subject, a strictly chronological approach is not possible and there is some cutting back and forth among chapters. Numerous individuals and organizations are discussed, the latter often represented by acronyms. This book requires some concentration to keep track of all these people and organizations. If future editions are published, a good addition would be a couple of tables listing organizations, acronyms, and important individuals."},{"Title":"France: The Dark Years, 1940-1944 (Modern World)","review":"By all accounts, this is the penultimate history of \\"the dark years\\" in France during 1940-44. I agree wholeheartedly. The approach is at once scholarly without being pedantic. Every page is a gem. I have learned so much about not only the years of the occupation, but also about France itself, and why its history (political and social) contributed greatly to the rise of the Vichy government. There are, according to Jackson, proved beyond the shadow of a doubt, many,many strands of influence upon not only Vichy but the Resistance and how both were viewed during and after the war. To those who complain that it is \\"geared toward specialists\\", I suggest that you choose your topics a bit more carefully if you want something a bit more simplistic. The subject is not easy, but Jackson does a masterful job of keeping the prose interesting and vibrant. This would get SIX stars if it were possible. Bravo.

Although it did not adequately address the concerns that the Americans had for supporting the French resistance early in the war, it still provided emensely important information. The book begins by explaining the deep social rifts in French society between the socialist-elements and the conservatives prior to the war, and how this dynamic played a role in the fall of France and the establishment of Vichy France. It also very clearly identifies the complex sentiments the french people had for Vichy France, including the early feelings of legitimacy and mild support in the founding months of the regime, and how this feeling of support gradually crumbled under the shadow of National Socialism. It also goes into deep detail about the various overlooked actors of the french resistance, including the roles that Jews, women, and even foreign volunteers (even ethnic anti-nazi Germans!) played in the story of the resistance. It describes how different resistance grops formed under different circumstances, with an emphasis on the differences in resistance group formation in the occupied and unoccupied zones of France. It continues by describing how the roles that De Gaulle and Moulin played in orchastrating the various groups and how the concept of the resistance played into French culture and identity in the formation of the fourth republic."},{"Title":"France: The Dark Years, 1940-1944 (Modern World)","review":"Julian Jackson's book is so well thought-out, so utterly comprehensive and so intelligent that it has become like a bible to those studying France's dark years. It is perhaps not quite as readable as his 'The Fall of France' and I think it would require a certain amount of prior knowledge on the part of the reader. I would nevertheless highly recommend this to anyone interested in the period."},{"Title":"France: The Dark Years, 1940-1944 (Modern World)","review":"\`The history of France in this period cannot be understood in separate compartments like \`the Vichy regime,' \`the Resistance', or \`collaboration': these existed in dynamic relation to each other, and the history of France in this period must be conceived as a whole. These are strands but they make up one history.' \`Vichy contained modernizers as well as conservatives... reinserted Vichy into a longer historical context, drawing out continuities with France's past and future. The future of the history of the Resistance needs to embrace its full diversity - Gaullist and non-Gaullist, Communist and non-Communist, North and South, men and women, French and immigrants - but also to reconnect the history of the Resistance to the society around it, to the French past, and to the Vichy regime.'The social ideology of the governing elite after the fall of France owed its pedigree to the crisis of confidence in parliamentary Republic during the 1930s. \`Maurras's movement, Action francaise synthesized royalism, nationalism, and Catholicism into a single doctrine which he called \\"integral nationalism\\".' \`Nonconformists of the 1930s' whose disillusion with the Republic went deeper,' and their \`Order Nouveau' repudiated liberal capitalism as \`incapable of developing a rationally organized society.' The political paralysis after the Great Depression (the 1932 elections and their seventeen ministries in eighteen months; radical governments and their efforts to rally conservative support for socialist policies.) opened the way for \`direct action by social groups,' where the \`illustration of political polarization was less the violence of the extremes than the blurring of the boundaries between the parliamentary right, and the extreme right.' The massive majority that empowered Daladier to revise the constitution \`revealed an erosion of faith in the institutions of the Republic across the entire political spectrum.'Vichy was \`a testimony to the long-term corrosive effect of Action francaise on French liberalism: all strands of French conservatism were present at Vichy.' Its National Revolution \`defined itself first and foremost in opposition to liberal individualism which uprooted people from the \`natural' communities of family, workplace, and region.' In its measures against foreigners, like the repeal of the 1939 Marchandeau decree prohibiting the publication of material inciting racial hatred, \`Vichy was only extending legislation which had been started under the Republic.' Nonetheless, the National Revolution took a back seat to economic realities (e.g. married women became liable for labor service in Germany, regional constitution reinforcing state control rather than returning to \`natural communities.') \`The regime, or organizations which developed with its benediction, had up to a point, enjoyed many intellectuals' support, is testimony to the crisis of traditional republican values in France at the end of the 1930s. All these people had shared a certain number of preoccupations: a sense of living through a profound crisis of civilization which required a remaking of mankind; a belief that liberal individualism was incapable of embracing humanity in all its wholeness; and a conviction that the void which had opened up in France in 1940 offered vast possibilities.'On collaboration, Vichy \`realpolitik was wishful thinking based on a complete misreading of Germany': the regime \`believed that it had trump cards - the fleet, the Empire, the Free Zone - but paradoxically the very existence of these prevented a more robust policy. Precisely because it did have something to lose, the Vichy government was always terrified to push its case too far for fear of provoking the Germans. Vichy only won paltry concession.' In the abortive Protocols of Paris May 1941, Darlan \`had taken France to the brink of military collaboration and that he drew back for want of German political concession.' In 1940, \`Laval's policy of collaboration had had little chance of success because the Germans hardly wanted anything France had to offer; in 1942, it had no chance of success because the Germans wanted so much that nothing the French offered would be enough.' With the German occupation of the rest of France in November 1942, \`everything Vichy had salvaged from the catastrophe of 1940 was irremediably lost: the fleet, the Armistice Army , the Free Zone, and the Empire.'In spite of the higher Jewish survival rate in France than in much of Western Europe, Jackson inculpated Vichy's role in Jewish persecution for its active co-operation with the Germans. According to Jackson, \`the fate of the Jews depended on a variety of factors: the presence of an independent government able to interpose itself between the Jews and the Germans; the willingness of such government to do so; the numbers of German occupation troops; the timing of German anti-Jewish policies; the reactions of public opinion and the organizations which expressed it; the effectiveness of rescue networks; the geography and topography of the country; the size and distribution of the Jewish population. None of these factors was decisive in itself, and what mattered was how they combined.' \`Without French police cooperation, it would have been difficult for the Germans to arrest the foreign Jews. About of all Jews were arrested by French police.' Furthermore, \`Vichy's desire always to keep up with the Germans meant that anti-Semitism spiraled continuously in a more radical direction; Vichy continued to implement its own separate policy of persecution. (e.g. the French government imposed the Jewish Statutes, not the Germans). \`The truth is that without Vichy's co-operation, it would have been impossible for the Germans to arrest as many Jews as they did.'Demonstrating the dynamic relationship between Vichy and the Resistance, \`being directly confronted with Vichy, the Southern movements evolved in response to it, while the Northern ones did not. In the North, those starting hostile to Vichy remained so; other were slow to rethink their position. In the South, however, ideology became central to the self definition of the Resistance, which started to develop a common rhetoric, drawing on the traditions of French republicanism.' \`Given the reputation of the Republic by the end of the 1930s, this reassertion of republican values was not self-evident. It was a situation which Vichy itself created by becoming so identifiably a right-wing regime. It was Vichy which ensured that the Resistance would be Republican.' Jackson assailed the de Gaulle's Resistance myth - despite a few traitors, the French nation, united behind de Gaulle, had liberated itself and what occurred between 1939 and 1944 was represented not as a French civil war, but as an episode in a longer struggle against Germany - was problematic because \`it imposed a unitary vision on what had been highly fragmented experience.'Jackson concluded that \`clearly any attempt to build an identity around the idea that Vichy was not France will be doomed to failure: de Gaulle's assertion that Vichy was null and void no longer serves any purpose in contemporary France. On the other hand, it is no less misleading to repudiate the existence of a Resistance which also represented \`France'... the French past must be faced in all its contradictions and complexity. Only then can it be critically evaluated, and instead of serving to salve the conscience of the present, it can become a usable memory for the future.'"},{"Title":"France: The Dark Years, 1940-1944 (Modern World)","review":"the facts are very interesting and it is complete. that said, however, it is too intricate with names and groups for the general public.

It's the story of Eddie, an illiterate longshoreman, and his anger towards his niece's affection for an illegal immigrant staying in his house. The complicated relationships between these and many other characters in the play makes A View From the Bridge a truly great piece of theatre. The play has the ingredients of a traditional Greek tragedy, complete with Alfieri, a narrator that fulfils the same purpose as Sophocles's chorus from his plays about Oedipus and Antigone. It's a really good read and unravels like a great page-turner."},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"The structure of the play is uncomplicatad. The play is in two acts but within the acts there are easily defined divisions which are controlled by Alfieri. Alfieri is essential to the structure of the play. He opens and closes the play. He is Arthur Miller's mouthpiece and he moves the action fluidly. Catherine is a young lady who, it seems, as a result of her mother's death is living with her aunt, Beatrice, and Beatice's husband, Eddie. Eddie and Catherine have developed a close family relationship. The credibility of the relationship throughout the play is inceasingly questionable. Eddie is fatherlike in Catherine's eyes. In the first conversation between them Catherine looks for Eddie's approval that she looks good.She behaves almost in a coquettish manner to Eddie BUT this is not calculated. She sees him as a loving father figure. Eddie's obsessive attention to her physical appearance is realized when he asks her to turn around so he can see in her back. His intensions here are questionable. Is he attracted or is just parental pride? Eddie realises this from the beginning. Perhaps he feels that for the responsility he has taken, to support Catherine, he deserves a reward. The reward he wants(Catherine) is too big, and which if he got would be unnatural and ridiculous. Beatrice notices the relationship but her unwillingness to speak out makes her part of the problem. Eddie uses an emotional approach which in sensitive to Catherine's emotions. He suggests that all he is doing is looking out for her interests. He uses her inexperience to denunciate her arguements. Catherine shows her interests in Rodolpho's physical appearance. Eddie subjugates her. His intensions to show power dominate his actions. Rodolpho speech is lively and descriptive if a little frivolous. Catherine seems to be attracted to his different style which contrasts to Eddie's simple, normal style. Eddie is antagonistic towards Rodolpho because he is jealous of the obvious chemistry between the youngsters. Eddie unsuccessfully does his atmost to vilify Rodolpho. He sees him as a homosexual who is using Catherine to get an American passport. Catherine is attempting to be independent but she can't stand up to Eddie. She seems to be looking for attention again but Eddie's tension and his use of passionate words bring us to question his motives."},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"Arthur Miller often allows the reader to have difficulty identifying with a character, while empathizing with several characters. This is the case in \\"A View from a Bridge.\\" When the story ends in tragedy, it is no surprise that the reader is made to question some aspect of American society.In this play, Eddie inherits the duty of raising his niece since the death of his sister. When cousins who are illegal immigrants come to stay with the family, it is a challenge to Eddie's role as father figure. The character and integrity of Rodolpho the younger immigrant is called in to question as he begins a relationship with Eddie's niece Catherine. Is he only marrying her to obtain American citizenship? Is he too much of a free spirit with his singing and dress-making skills? In Eddie's eyes, he certainly not the proper suiter he expected for Catherine. With a wedding on the horizon, Eddie takes his only real option to prevent the marriage. He calls immigration. The final confrontation between Rodolpho and Eddie ends in tragedy, but the character flaws in both men make it difficult to sympathize with either.The story raises questions of the bonds of family as well as the changing conditions of immigration into America. The fact that the play makes the reader think about social conditions is a reflecion of the quality of the play. It is from the high standard readers hold an Arthur Miller play to."},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"I have loved A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE since the first time I read it, three years ago. It is a tautly written, exciting drama in which one can practically see the tragic end coming, \\"step by step, like a dark figure walking down a hall toward a certain door\\" (in the words of Alfieri, the lawyer in the play). But as well as the play \\"reads,\\" it is absolutely ELECTRIFYING when seen on stage -- as I found out just yesterday, when I saw a production of it. The actor who played Eddie Carbone, the protagonist, made the character very sympathetic; as a result, the play's ending was truly tragic. Read A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE, but also try to see a production of it, if you possibly can. I will admit, though, that it is not performed that often -- not nearly as often as it deserves to be."},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"Well, after the reading the above reviews I have to say that I was compelled to write a review since I think this exsquisite piece of literature is one of the most moving plays I have ever read.

Arthur Miller has once again brilliantly created a complex and emotionally torturted man in Eddie."},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"The great play writer Arthur Miller had the idea for \\"A View From The Bridge\\" when he was doing research on a longshoreman who was executed by the mob for attempting to revolt against union. He heard a story about another man who denounced his relatives to the Immigration Bureau. The play is not only about this fact, but also concerning on tense familiar and social relationships, and also there is a sexual identity subtext.Although \\"A View from the Bridge\\" is not as famous or as good as \\"The Crucible\\" or \\"Death of a Salesman\\", it is an interesting piece since its characters are so well developed. One of the main themes in this play is the \`naming names'. Just like Miller himself, the main character Eddie Carbone, had the chance of denouncing his friends. Unlike his character, the writer when inquired about his supposed communist friends chose to be loyal to them.But certainly, the main symbol in the play is Brooklyn Bridge, that means, among other things, pathway of opportunity to Manhattan and also the linkage between American and Italian cultures. And the community where the play is set is very close to this bridge. Miller has created again some effective characters in this play, who are forced to face problematic situations. They may not always succeed, but the writer does - at least most of the time."},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"A awe-inspiring view of Brooklyn in the 1950's.

In fact, it was short enough that I thought there was no way to resolve the conflicts that left me hanging until the last few pages. Sure enough, Miller effectively tied up loose ends and still managed to surprise me despite ending in a similar fashion to what most would predict.The play is about an uncle's overprotective nature, which runs so deeply as to be too close for comfort, and the fact that no one would ever be good enough for the niece living in his home. The take home message is about letting go of something you love, as well as swallowing your pride, which ultimately leads to the downfall of at least two of the characters. Eddie's failure to cut his losses and admit he was wrong left him proud but dead.The setting gives a cool, albeit tiny, insight into what the New York waterfront must have felt like long ago, and the narration (through the eyes of the lawyer from whom Eddie sought advice) is a neat touch."},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"Arthur Miller's View from the Bridge is a lengthy, emotionally packed drama that focuses on perplexing longshoreman, 40 year-old Eddie Carbone who has a disturbing inappropriate fixation on his 18 year-old niece. Lawyer Alfieri provides intermittent narration on the unfolding drama with tragic consequences.The 50's play, considered in Best American Plays, takes place in Red Hook Brooklyn, NY, where an Italian family, Eddie Carbone, wife Beatrice, and Catherine, the 18-year old niece whose mother was Beatrice's sister. It's unclear how young she was when they took her in, but since she has become a young girl, Eddie has been in control of her actions, the normal coming-of-age sexuality, like when he accuses her of the looks she gets by \\"walkin' wavy\\".Neice Catherine's argument to prove a short skirt isn't as short when she stands up and walks, she says, \\"when you see me walkin' down the street.......Eddie replys \\"Listen, you have been giving me the willies the way you walk in the street, I mean it.\\"Beatrice's two cousins, who are brothers, are immigrating from the beautiful mountains and oceans in Italy, but where poverty is the predominant force. The beautiful view is what is across the bridge.Hiding from immigration, the brothers are respectful and here to work and Catherine is soon in love with younger brother, Rodolpho. Through his own admission, the idea \\"eats\\" at Eddie, as his torment is fueled each day. Eddie is challenging, belligerent, sarcastic and evil.We don't learn a lot about his wife Beatrice's past or Eddie's, we just know that wife Beatrice is very aware of his actions and obsession toward Catherine. Beatrice and Eddie have not had sexual relations for months and she is craving to be his wife again.During the first act, the set-up is done well. The reader learns quickly about the sexual obsession; we learn how dedicated and respectful the immigrants are, we learn the frustration with Beatrice, and we learn very well, what makes Eddie tick!The drama moves quickly, it is intense and complete! There is a movie version, but I truly believe the best way to see this and get the feel of characters, is to see the entire play on stage. Movies leave out so much feeling one needs to grasp to gather your thoughts.I recommend highly, Miller'sAll My Sons (Penguin Classics)\\"All My Sons\\" andThe Priceand of course, the popularDeath of a Salesman (Penguin Plays). .......Rizzo"},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"The way Miller portrays the relationship between Catherine and Eddie is extraordinary, one can't help but wonder if his love is stronger than that of a father figure.

Eddie is no Willy Loman, though, and the play suffers immediately from a lack of a central, driving force like Willy. Parts of the play seem borrowed from Tennessee Williams, and they don't seem to work in this context. There is some business about the romance of the Old World Italy versus the New World of Opportunity on the docks of New York, and it is the only topic that is at all explored well, if still unsatisfactorily. Eddie's dreams are represented in his pretty niece, Catherine; and unlike Willy Loman's uncle, she is still an attainable dream. That makes Eddie's life seem all the more petty, in comparison to Willy's: he longs wearily not after what he could have had, but after what he can never have, as he is already married. The death scene at the end of the play also seems like a forced, tacked on ending, and Alfieri's entire presence is a more or less unsuccessful stage gimmick. There are better plays by Miller, and many better plays by others."},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"reading a view from the bride i was struck by the similarities of eddie carbone and archie bunker."},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"This play is a very intriguing play and I find it very interesting to study.

I am not familiar with Arthur Miller's reading habits, but I would assume that he knew the Greek playwrights very well. It seemed to me, as I read, that A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE is not so much a picture of \`contemporary New York' as a 20th century statement about human nature. Eddie Carbone works as a longshoreman, accepts the union and Mafia codes of solidarity that went along with the job in that time, and lives with his wife and orphaned niece. He has a good heart, he earns a living, takes in illegal immigrant relatives, and is a decent man in every respect except that he harbors an illicit love for his beautiful teenage niece, a love that leads him to acts of jealousy that doom him. One of the illegal immigrants falls for the niece, clouding Eddie's behavior, moral sense, and judgement so badly that the terse two acts must lead to an inevitable conclusion. If you want a play that speaks of modern America, this is not your best choice. The language, the scene, the mood---all quite far away from 2012.

Let's take as example a play &quot;A view from the bridge&quot; by Arthur Miller. The man cannot change his fate. The man cannot raid against fate. I think that is idea of this play. That's why it useless to talk about decisions, that effect (negatively or not) of life. The main tragedy in the play began not when Rodolpho and Marco came to Eddies house, it began when Eddie decided to &quot;keep&quot; Catherine for him. But, as I think, there was no tragedy if there were no Beatrice. She decided to loose everything. She loved Eddie, and she decided to separate Eddie and Catherine any way, so, to save Eddie for her. She cannot imagine, that it could turn into tragedy. I'm sure, that she loved Catherine, not more, not less than Eddie, and she understand, that Catherine's love want only papers, but her love for herself, her pride, won. She loved herself and Eddie more than Catherine, so, her advice to 18 years old girl was to stay with Rodolpho. What comes next? Eddie do not want Catherine to be with rodolpho. But Catherine loves him and, of course, she will not listen to Eddie, who wants for her only best, she listen to Beatrice. Beatrice thought, if Catherine will be with Rodolpho, Eddie came back to her, but he does not want to leave Catherine with Rodolpho. Later, when Catherine said &quot;In the garbage he belongs&quot; [to Eddie], Beatrice said &quot;Then we all belong in the garbage, you and me too. ...We all done it&quot;. She has no pride to say &quot;I belong&quot;, she said &quot;You and me too&quot;, &quot;We all done it&quot;. Who &quot;we all&quot; ? Eddie - he just wanted to defend Catherine. Catherine - she is young girl, and she cannot understand so serious problems in her age, she should, but don't forget, that she was raised without parents by man, who loved her. Rodolpho - he needs only passport, nothing else. Beatrice - she needs Eddie, she wants Eddie to leave Catherine, she needs Rodolpho to be with her. But why I said that it's useless to talk about decisions, that effect of life? What alternatives does Beatrice had? No alternatives. She'd lost Eddie in any way. Let's try to change the way of the story. Beatrice wanted to save Eddie for her marrying Catherine and Rodolpho. But, if her advises were like Eddies, and Catherine gone from Rodolpho, Eddie will with Catherine. she'd lost Eddie in any way. Even if Catherine married Rodolpho, Eddie will never return to her. So, she'd lost Eddie in any way. And at the end of the play, we understand that Eddie loved Beatrice. Before he died, he said: &quot;My B!&quot;. The life is strange thing. We want to change it, but it's very hard. We always want to make something better (it depends only on our character, for whom we want to make better), but it always turns to &quot;As usual&quot;. People are not so smart to change their life, their fate. And this play is just an example."},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"A View From The Bridge is another classic example of Millers fine talent. Once again, he has taken a small class of people and created a literary/theatrical masterpiece. Each of his characters develop into strong individuals. It it because of his characters individuality that conflict and tension mounts. The relationships between the characters are tested and some form of problem occurs to highten the plot. Miller has an extroidinary, unique style. It reaches in and grabs the heart of the reader and connotates a kaliedascope of emotions."},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"Arthur Miller's play of self-delusion and eventual acceptance is slightly above average at best. Perhaps I was just spoiled by The Crucible and Death of a Salesman, but it seemed much sloppier than his other works that I have read.It's split into two acts, which seem very disproportionate. The first act, which becomes extremely dull and seems to drag on, is more than half of the entire play; while the second act, which seems rushed, is less. Also, Miller should have gone into more depth with Eddie's transition from concerned uncle to confused monster. Eddie always has a sort of underlying hint of being disturbed, but it just isn't made clear enough.On a positive note, the end of the second act became very intense. It had my heart racing at times, and Miller ends the tale at a thrilling moment which, in my opinion, is the best way.I would recommend it only to really adamant fans of Miller who have already read his better-known work. It's absolutely not in the league of some of his other classics."},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"Either I got a misprinted copy or they have a terrible editor. It starts off with A View from the Bridge but becomes Room Service by Allen Boretz at page 18. It turns back into AVFTB at the start of the second act, but since pages 18-44 are filled with Room Service, I cannot say anything content-wise. If anyone else has had this problem, then there was an obvious mass misprint."},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"What really kills this recording is the Guy Noire style narrator.Garrison Keillor kills this recording.We keep waiting for the wry and subtle in-jokes, and they fail to comeWhat we get is real life.Guy Noire only gets in the way.This recording arrived in its box as ordered, used. I was surprised not to find a lengthy brochure inside. I highly recommend you also get the play as written by Miller, perhaps atA View From the Bridge, Arthur Miller, I do not know, but I wish I had read the play along with hearing this live recording, as the issues raised in this play are crucial for where we are today.We are all immigrants and the grandchildren of immigrants, except for instance the Cherokee and the Sioux, etc. By what moral right may we now deny these who come as ew ourselves did?This play explores the nature of the immigrant, and the illegal one, and the criminal networks which hold them enslaved, as they are today, and the criminal employers who need pay them nothing, as they are illegal. For this reason they are labelled illegal, to pay them nothing.This play is not The Crucible as other reviewers wish. It is not Willy Loman, although issues of hidden sexual diversity may also find tracing.It is a play about poor immigrants, some illegal. We need read it today.Yet this recording may well not entirely provide a clear View from the Bridge.Apparently there was some adaptation in order to make it a purely oral reading, and thus the dominance of the Guy Noire character (a lawyer) who even provides descriptions of actions on stage as one would not hear in the theatre except in certain productions of Bertolt Brecht. All the same it was not clear to me just what Ed O'Neill was doing with Marco in the end. For all we could tell from the sighs they might have been, well, dancing.And that is the second distractor after Guy Noire: Ed O'Neill. We all know and despise Ed O'Neill fromMarried with Children - The Complete First Season, the hand in pants Al Bundy character is unshakable and the voice is clearly his here, despite the harder Brooklyn edge.It is hard to come to love Al Bundy, and it is hard for us here to identify enough with Ed's character to care in the end. We are thus tragically left with melodrama (reinforced by Guy Noire) rather than tragedy, bathos rather than pathos.And that is a shame. This play has much to tell us now today in so many ways.When we hear the original Caedmon recording of Death of a Salesman with Lee J. Cobb and Dustin Hoffman we do not need audio-visual clues telling us what we are not seeing, nor an Our Town type telling us what we ought to be seeing. Here I find the omnipresent, omniscient, ironic Guy Noire character intrusive and drawing from the direct drama, and wonder how much the original play has been adapted for this recording. Perhaps none. Perhaps too much. I need to read the book.I think people in other reviews have not heard this play clearly enough, but through the lens of other works by Miller. Read this work on its own. Do not read King Lear as if it were Romeo and Juliet. This work stands strongly on its own. We need read it now.We need open our arms to the huddled masses, as our Liberty statue promises. We need destroy the economic injustice which enslaves millions in our own homeland to the profit of a superfluously wealthy few, who when things fall apart get even more trillions thrown their way.Hear the subtext of this play. It preaches equality. It preaches justice. It preaches love. It preaches equal opportunity. It preaches America.Read the play. And then try this recording by the LA Theatre Works. You might even come to understand Al Bundy as the complex Eddie Carbone."},{"Title":"A View from the Bridge","review":"(This review is for A View from the Bridge, which I give 2 stars. I think that All My Sons is Miller's best play, and rate that 5 stars)During the 1940's, Miller and director Elia Kazan were close friends (Miller actually dedicated All My Sons (1947) to him). In 1952, Kazan went before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and named eight people that had been members of the Communist party. Miller was very disappointed in his friend and wrote The Crucible as a metaphor for the witch-hunt that was taking place in Washington. Kazan responded with On The Waterfront, in which Marlon Brando fingers a corrupt union leader. Miller responded to Kazan through drama again in 1955 with A View From the Bridge.Eddie Carbone turns in two Italian immigrants because one of them (Rodolpho) is dating his niece (Catherine), whom he secretly (even unknown to himself) lusts after. Eddie is eventually killed by the other immigrant (Marco).Alfieri is a neighborhood lawyer whom Eddie seeks out for help to keep his niece away from Rodolpho. He tells him that there is nothing the law can do for Eddie, and that he should just \\"wish her luck.\\" Alfieri is the quasi-narrator of the play, and it is his neutral view from which the play takes its name (he is also a bridge between Italy & America, between old world values & the American law). He is a Cassandra character - he knows what will happen and Eddie does not listen to him.It's much less dimensional than Death of A Salesman or All My Sons, an incredible play about war-profiteering and cover-ups that has never gotten the attention it deserved (it reappeared on Broadway in the fall of 2008).Arthur Miller appeared before HUAC in 1956. True to his word, he refused to supply political information about other writers and entertainers. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail and blacklisted, but it was eventually overturned."},{"Title":"Reapers of the dust;: A prairie chronicle","review":"The first two chapters of this book are excellent. The second, \\"Gopher Hunting,\\" begins with a startling generalization on the theme of \\"the narcissism of minor differences,\\" and then embodies it in the rich detail of girl and boy hunting gophers, and the mother and father back at the house. Not a word that doesn't do its optimal work of proposing, imagining (representing), and guessing."},{"Title":"Reapers of the dust;: A prairie chronicle","review":"Point of clarification: The header says this review is by Kathleen Hudson. The review is by her husband Robert L. Hudson who does not know how to get his name to switch out with her's. Robert Hudson has published other reviews under the name OuthouseBob.This is a book of vignettes as the author thinks back and forth over her early life and times. Ms Hudson was born in 1927 and the times are from her earliest memories to her early teen years. The life was life in rural North Dakota and Washington State, where she lived back and forth with her family as they tried to make an agricultural living during the days of the depression. She gives you a feel, a real feel for what it was like to be a kid in the cold and heat and dust and despair of North Dakota. She gives you a feel for what it was like in the relatively lush vegetation of Eastern Washington where the family prospered more but generally working for someone else.Young Lois was very bright but often an outsider. Part of the reason she was an outsider is because she was inside her own head so much. We the reader get the benefit of that inside insight. With her family, she spent time following the crops in agricultural Washington, living in tents and trying to find a place in society where a bright girl could learn while at the same time being proud of earning a silver dollar by the considerable honest sweat of a young brow. Thus, the book as entertainment works, worked for me at least.Occasionally, in the course of the book, she turns her attention to more profound lessons of growing up and living. You are invited to read these two consecutive paragraphs of her words that start off a chapter where she quotes 'Johnny Appleseed,' \\"The boy moves through his life, keeping a shy Watch on the man who now assumes his face.\\" :\\"While we are growing up, we become more surprised every year that we seem to other people to be changing because to ourselves we seem always to be the same. And even when we exult in the higher mark on the closet door where we are measured every year, we feel an increasing apprehensiveness that a day will come when we will have changed so much that nobody will remember who we are.Thus, when we are still very young, we sense that our first memories of ourselves constitute the only reality by which we will always understand our existence. The problem is that nobody ever seems to see anything the same way we see it, and therefore the memories by which we place ourselves in time and space can never be verified by anybody else. This is the loneliness and the terror of childhood-not to see things the way anybody else sees them, not to understand why some things are \\"real\\" and some things are not.\\"Perhaps these paragraphs mean more to me than the average reader because I have though on and even written on these kinds of things [e.g., \\"The Fictional Adult\\" Etc.: A Review of General Semantics, vol.32 (1975), Number 3, p. 284-286]. I'm not sure Lois and I are saying the same thing but we are laboring in the same part of the soul. For me there was validation of my own poor efforts which I had thought when I wrote was unplowed ground. As I read Ms Hudson I felt that I \\"really\\" had stumbled onto something back in the early 1970's that had guided my life and my understanding of others' lives as I attempted to teach and practice psychology.One last thing must be stated and that is Ms Hudson not only had wonderful experiences as seen through her unique eyes that she shares but also she is a master craftsman with the English language. Ignore the deeper matters if you wish and read this purely as wonderful and entertaining literature. I had never heard of Lois Phillips Hudson but happened upon this book when going through some of my late mother's \\"stuff.\\" I happened to start reading and couldn't put it down. I am now in the process of ordering a copy of one of Ms Hudson's fiction contributions to literature, Bones of Plenty which has some excellent reviews on Amazon and to which I am looking forward to reading both as literature and introspective psychology"},{"Title":"A People Apart","review":"Over all I thought that the book did a great job of describing Old Order Mennonites to children. I was a little dissapointed in that it seemed to me that the pictures were of one group of Old Order Mennonites. It would have been nice if the auther identfied the different groups by name, ie Wenger(Groffdale Confence), Horning (Weaverland Conference), etc. and shown pictures of the diferent groups."},{"Title":"A People Apart","review":"We have both Old Order Mennonites and Old Order Amish in our community, and a quick way to tell them apart is that the Mennonite women can wear print dresses, while the Amish women must stick to solid colors like black, blue, and green. Mennonite men are sometimes clean-shaven, whereas Amishmen are always bearded.Both religious groups are descended from the Anabaptists, who originated in sixteenth century Europe coincident with the beginning of the Protestant reformation. Zurich, Switzerland was the original home of the Anabaptists who disagreed with the 'mainstream' Protestants of the time over infant baptism. The Anabaptists believed that baptism should only be conferred on adults who were willing to following the disciplines of the new Church. They also renounced oaths, reveling and drunkenness, the use of force in war or civil government, and personal adornment.These practices did not make them popular with their fellow Protestants or the local rulers, and the book \\"Martyr's Mirror\\" records the persecutions of this period. Gradually, the Anabaptists split apart into the Mennonites, Amish (mainly because of disagreements over the practice of shunning), and Hutterites, and migrated to America and Canada.Currently the Mennonites live in forty different countries, which is one thing that differentiates them from the Amish, who stick pretty close to home in North America. The Mennonites are more like the Society of Friends in this respect, as they are heavily into works of charity in less fortunate nations.The author and photographer of this 64-page book paint a picture of everyday life in an Old Order Mennonite Community, including a look into a Mennonite school, church-going activities, and a barn-raising. One of my favorite photographs is of a stern-looking teacher in bonnet and glasses running the bases in a lunchtime baseball game, while one of her students tries to tag her out.It surprised me to learn that \\"about one quarter of any Old Order population never marries. They often set up their own farms or households, sometimes with another unmarried friend or relative.\\" This practice quite definitely distinguishes them from the Amish."},{"Title":"Ashes of the Innocent","review":"I have written a dark, spiritual tale of a small southern town in the 1950s, where faith and racism are the powers of the day in an era when rock\`n'roll is bursting through. It's a classic story of light and darkness, heaven and hell, demons and religion. I've been fascinated by the stereotypical South for years, the characters that always seemed to be there in the mid 20th Century: blues players, a wise woman and bigoted locals. They are all here in the small town of Deville. It's a horror but so much more, I hope you enjoy."},{"Title":"Ashes of the Innocent","review":"This book is a really good read.

Drawing on what I believe are a series of autobiographical incidents, Nicholas strings together the adventures of a young CIA officer named Gus, whose only real concern is to catch the best possible wave on his surfboard. His \\"surfer attitude\\" keeps getting him in trouble with his superiors; yet enables him to unofficially recruit an Iraqi diplomat just at the start of operation Desert Storm.Nicholas' descriptions of the Indonesian locales where the action takes place (bars and beaches mostly) definitely make you want to go there and see that with your own eyes and that, along with his reflections on the futility of war are the high point of the book.On the other hand the CIA angle feels almost like an excuse for the character to be in Indonesia; the references to the work done for the agency are minimal and loosely put together (he might as well have been an oil, relief worker for the UN or any other profession that allowed him to be there long enough to make friends and catch waves)What's supposed to be the main topic of the book, Gus befriending an Iraqi diplomat is constricted to the last quarter of the book, making you doubt of its real importance in the plot. Finally the way the hero fouls an Iraqi plan to assassinate the US ambassador is barely believable and is perhaps the lowest point in the book.All in all, the book is fun, very readable and worth your time and money as long as you do not expect anything too serious from it, I guess that to fully enjoy the book you must adjust your mindset in the same way that you do when you go and watch a 007 movie, you know things are not always going to be logical or 100% possible or believable; but if you are willing to let go of that of a while, you spend a good time."},{"Title":"Surfing the CIA","review":"Definitely a wild ride, however it is rated R, so don't leave it for your young kids to read.

Fortunately our hero has packed his surf boards, and arrives just when the country is being opened up as a surfing paradise. Along the way he also finds exotic women and interesting bars, forms an entourage of locals and international expatriates, and even commits a little espionage.The book is kind of an inverse of Graham Greene's \\"Our Man in Havana\\"; instead of making stuff up for his handlers, Gus tries to avoid telling his boss about the contact he has made with an Iraqi diplomat on the cusp of the first Gulf War. While chuckling at Gus's bureaucratic entanglements with his superiors, the reader gets a travelogue of Indonesian beaches and colorful details of Jakarta nightlife."},{"Title":"Surfing the CIA","review":"The first half of this novel was absolutely amazing - as if I was magically transported to another entertaining world filled with great waves, crazy adventures, and sexy encounters with \\"professionals\\" and other mind-bending characters. Somehow, I think the Editor showed up on Nicholas' door right when the second half got underway because the pace hurried, the details were lost from the first half of the book, and the message and adventure got muddy.I definitely recommend the book - especially if you surf, you'll get charged by it - because of the great character portrayals, the comical situations, and the vivid imagery.

The author is a Waldorf Kindergarten teacher. This book discusses the importance of play as seen through a Waldorf education perspective and explains that natural playthings from nature and toys made from natural products are important. The book opens with several essays on the subject of the value of play and the nature of (appropriate) play as seen through the eyes of a Waldorf educator. Simple toys that allow imaginative and creative play are defined as ideal and appropriate for the proper development of the child. The author states that toys made by hand are more appreciated by children and she urges parents to make toys by hand, with the child's help or the child watching. A listing of toys appropriate for different age groups is listed. Discussion about outdoor play, play with dolls, and clean up time is included. Full instructions for over 45 toys are provided. Toys include dolls and doll clothing, knitted animals, wooden playstands and cloths, wooden tree blocks, and carved wooden toys (bridges, animals, spoons, etc.). Using wool roving is explained and instructions for creating pictures with plant-dyed wool end the book. The book is 93 pages long and the instructions are detailed and illustrated with line drawings. If you enjoy crafts and want to make Waldorf-style toys, this book is a must and a good value. Of course you can buy many of these toys already made, but you would save a lot of money by making these yourself."},{"Title":"Toymaking with Children","review":"This book gives good ideas for toys to make at home and gives some good description of children's play at different stages.

I'm not sure if my husband has even looked at it yet. Once I started reading it I took it over. I love this book! The author gives great information about play and includes wonderful, and varied projects to fill an entire playroom. I read it and immediately went to work gathering and creating many of the suggested toys. The difference in the way my children approach play was instantly noticeable. We've enjoyed making many of the toys together. Before reading the book I was sold on simple toys that allowed children to use their imagination as much as possible. I didn't however, have a strong value for making my own toys. After knitting a donkey to the wonder of my 2-year-old daughter and sitting at the table sanding and finishing a set of \\"building logs\\" with my 4-year-old son, I was sold. The toys we made together are imbued with the warmth of spending time together. They use them more often and more creatively than any toys we've bought for them.

Children want to be active in their creativity. At many a play date with my children I have seen all the kids quickly abandon the elaborate play set to go play make-believe on large rocks or a fallen tree or some other simple natural structure that is open-ended to whatever they want it to be for them. This book helps bring that element into the home and the playroom. Just today our family went to the beach and collected smooth stones and driftwood for cutting into logs for the playroom and all it cost us was a good time.

THE DIXON ERA 1959-1975 by Edla Mills Dixon, Antioch College '41 (Editor), and Dr. James P. Dixon, Antioch College '38 is beyond question the single best and most important history and analysis book about Antioch College which was founded in 1852 in Yellow Springs, Ohio with Horace Mann as its first Antioch president.The book was published in 1991 by Bastille Books in Saco, Maine and written by Dr. and Mrs. James P. Dixon, MD (Harvard Med. School '43). Dr. Jim Dixon, Antioch '38, was president of Antioch College from 1959 through 1975 when he was illegally fired by then Antioch Board Chairman Larry Pearl, Antioch '55, who held an illegal meeting at the Dayton, Ohio airport of Antioch trustees, and in spite of the fact there was not a quorum at that meeting, claimed (wrongly) a majority of the trustees voted to remove Dixon, even though this was not the case.Dixon failed to protest the decision, accepted the firing by Pearl (probably due to sheer exhaustion at being embattled too long in a brutal job), and left Antioch after 16 years as Antioch president, the longest presidential term any Antioch CEO ever served in a history which began in 1852.Dr. James P. Dixon '38 was and is (he is still living as of this writing) both a genius and a comic book New England aristocrat, complete with Mass. Bay Colony descendants and long time credentials in Massachusetts. He rode the bucking bronco that is the Antioch College presidency for almost two decades, and the College made more progress during his presidency than at any other period in its history. What Charles Eliot was to Harvard, James Dixon was and is to Antioch.In 1978, successor Antioch College president Dr. William Birenbaum reorganized Antioch College and its then 30 additional campuses and independent degree programs scattered all across the USA and abroad into the (then) new Antioch University. But in fact it was Dixon who was reponsible for the growth of Antioch's influence and educational power which compelled this change. Under Dixon's watch, Antioch went from being a pleasant and repected sophomoric and provincial college started in 19th century Ohio, ranked with Kenyon and Oberlin Colleges there, cranking out doctors, lawyers, and other petty bourgeois types requiring a college degree to a true University, like Harvard, Oxford, Heidelburg, and Bologna.When Dixon left, it had, in addition to the undergrad college started in 1852, every type grad school but a medical school, ironic since Dixon himself was an Antioch grad who went onto become a prominent and brilliant public health administrator physician who led programs in both Philadelphia and Denver before coming to Antioch as president in 1959 when he was 38 years old.After his Antioch president years, he moved to Durham, NC and taught public health at the U. of North Carolina Med. School and also the Walden U. Ph.D. program while being very active with the N. Carolina ACLU. He took more than a decade to compose his memoirs (which is what ANTIOCH: THE DIXON ERA are), and they were finally made public in his book in 1991.The book is wonderfully indexed, maddenly incomplete in many ways. The incompleteness is totally forgiveable, given the ground he had to cover. No Antioch president since Horace Mann in 1852 EVER prepared a retrospective book about his/her Antioch presidency. All should have. Only Dixon did. He was perhaps Antioch College's greatest president ever, from Horace Mann in 1852 until the present day.The book is hard to get, not available at Amazon.Com at this time (August 2003), but listed in the Amazon.Com database because its importance is well known. It is no doubt one of the most important single volumes ever published about American higher education and education generally. This is true because Antioch College and University are among America's most vital and important educational institutions.ANTIOCH: THE DIXON ERA 1959-75 (1991 -- Bastille Books, Saco, Maine) is worth getting, reading, and re-reading by anyone who cares about quality education."},{"Title":"Delicious Sex","review":"This is a wonderful light-hearted look at making sex something special with generous dollops of sensuality and humor.

Bengston establishes himself as a unique and passionate voice for Omaho, gay men, anyone facing HIV, and anyone who ever felt loneliness or longing. He celebrates all those people and more in this diverse volume, separated into five distinct sections.\\"I. NEBRASKA\\" begins the book with images of Bengston's state and its people. These poems mix physical details like streets, buildings, or nature with internal longings.\\"II. Names\\" reveals Bengston's ability to empathize with others and listen to their dreams. The people differ as much as the forms his poems take.\\"III. T-Cells\\" reveals Bengston's personal struggle with HIV, as well as with HIV medications. It also reveals courage, hope, and frustration. This section includes my favorite poem in the entire book, \\"Standing at the Edge of the Quilt.\\" That poem involves the AIDS quilt.\\"IV. Letters\\" includes poems that literally sound like letters. The recipients vary from Bengston's family members to an author of graphic novels.\\"V. First Chill\\" features the most erotic and emotional poems of this collection. Even more than in the other sections, Bengston keeps the readers off guard and can change the feel of an entire poem with the last line or two. This section provides a satisfying conclusion to a book that I would suggest for poetry lovers everywhere."},{"Title":"Play gin to win","review":"The definitive work on playing Gin, the author's own personal proven winning method, situations which develop and how best to exploit them, how to play percentages and the other players, as well as a concise memory course useful to mastering the cards - and all presented in an often humorous vein."},{"Title":"Play gin to win","review":"This is a decent book on gin rummy.

With Kodak recently filing for bankruptcy protection, the photographic community was shaken up with the knowledge that even stone pillars sometimes fall without notice. Now, while Kodak has \\"assured\\" its customers that their film department isn't going anywhere, it is prudent to not fully believe them.Anyway, to the review! Now that you know why I wanted this book, let me explain a little about why this book is perfect for my needs. The Cookbook feels as though it is several books in one. Not only does it go into great detail about processes, but it talks not only about commercially available chemistry but also recipes and methods for creating your own! It goes into such detail on all three of these topics that it is almost the only book that you will need.Now, I have read that some beginners were a little lost reading this book, and I can sort of understand why. I am not one to baby anyone I am teaching about film photography, but at the same time some people do need to dip a toe in the pool before diving in, and I can understand that. I would suggest this as a second read afterInto Your Darkroom Step by Step- the latter will give you a great introduction into film development before you start reading about mixing up your own developer!Overall, this is a highly useful book and will be on my coffee table until it falls apart. I'm not a fear-monger, but at least with this book I have a place to start if my favorite developers are no longer available! A great (technical) read, almost mandatory for any film photographer!"},{"Title":"The Film Developing Cookbook (Darkroom Cookbook) (Vol 2)","review":"A lot of formulas, critical advice, honest opinions.

While I'm only up to the description of PMK, I've already been seriously influenced by this book. It explains, thoroughly and beyond my understanding of chemistry, all sorts of B&amp;W film developer. It contains formula, suggestions and experiments for modifications to formula, references to sources, and development times for each combination of developer and film (I think). So now I'm looking into this &quot;pyro&quot; thing. PMK... got that. Special fixer... got that. Now I just need some film to develop. I'm going to do that... tomorrow.

Kodak wants you to agitate the film a certain way, Ilford says to do it another way. Which developer do I use, and why? This book gives very logical and satisfactory answers to these questions. It allowed me to figure out how I was going to standardize my technique for the films that I am going to use. Don't be mislead by the title. This book does go into details of the effects of metol, phenidone, etc., but it is not a cookbook in the sense that you will come out designing your own developer. It does contain many recipies for developers, for those who mix their own. But, my aim was to figure out what the characteristics are of the developer that I am using, and how to maximize it. The book really excels in this area.I've run through about 75 feet of Tech Pan film trying out how to develop it using Xtol. Following Ansel Adams' advice in his book &quot;The Negative&quot; turned out to be a mistake, in this case. I was making my negatives way too dense. Anschell and Troop explained why this is, in their chapter on &quot;Document Films&quot;. This covers Tech Pan, amongst other similar films. After having read through the book, I revised my working temperature, diluted Xtol to 1+5, changed my agitation style, changed from an acid stop bath to water, and got the fantastic results that I had sought for so long! It's also worked for other offbeat films like Kodak 5302 Positive release film for the B&amp;W slide fans like myself (using Polymax 1+2). If you REALLY want to know what you're doing, and want to save tons of time and money from wasteful trial and error, get this wonderful book. It's really improved my results!"},{"Title":"The Film Developing Cookbook (Darkroom Cookbook) (Vol 2)","review":"This book is what the name suggests - a book of recipes for photographic chemicals. I personally won't be mixing my own developers in the near future, but found the book helpful in choosing my own film and developer from those commercially available. The margin notes are full of informative tidbits (such as the suggestion that tabular grain films only benefit the profit margin of the manufacturers.) The bulk of the book discusses developers, but also includes a chapter on other chemicals, such as stop and fixer. I will, in fact, probably try using the alkaline fixer in the near future.A background in chemistry would be helpful, but not necessary, but without it, you may glaze over a bit in places.My biggest criticism with this book is its complete lack of figures. A photo demonstrating grain and acutance like Adams includes in &quot;The Negative&quot; would be helpful, as well as density curves indicating the effects of different developers. Because of this ommision, I would recommend that someone read &quot;The Negative&quot; before reading this book to fill in the gaps."},{"Title":"The Film Developing Cookbook (Darkroom Cookbook) (Vol 2)","review":"Here is the long and the short of it: This is a wonderful book. I have looked at dozens of photography books, and what seems like hundreds of magazines, and I am positive that none of them contain the wealth of information that Steve Anchell (in collaboration with Bill Troop) puts in this book (or in Steve's other books for that matter). If you are interested in making the most of your black and white photography, you need to know what your film if composed of, what it reacts to, and how to achieve the effects that you want to get out of it. You don't have to be a darkroom guru to use it, you don't need a lot of equipment, and you don't need an elaborate setup. I think anyone will improve his or her results after reading and using this book. I have always believed that the magic in black and white takes place in the darkroom, and even if you don't have a darkroom, your control of the film development process will make you a better photographer. This is a great way to get it right."},{"Title":"The Film Developing Cookbook (Darkroom Cookbook) (Vol 2)","review":"I bought this book under the assumption and recommendation that it would teach me how to begin developing my own film... Unfortunately, this is NOT the book for that!

This book is NOT for beginners looking into how one goes about processing their own film!"},{"Title":"The Film Developing Cookbook (Darkroom Cookbook) (Vol 2)","review":"I bought this book as the other books I have are now a bit dated. As the understanding of film development is always evolving, I thought this book would give me the latest ideas and knowledge.It does to some extent, but I could not help feeling the authors did not take the time to fully research and comprehend the details. Where they have quoted chemists / researchers the details are clear. However where they have tried to interpret or discuss aspects in some places it appears they do not clearly understand what they are trying to explain. The result is that they contradict themselves, fail to make things clear, or just plain get things wrong. They also only seem to address research by Kodak and a few independent researchers. The book thus misses out on research done by Fuji, Agfa, Ilford, etc. which is a significant omission in my opinion.So is the book worth it ? I think that I would still buy it as there are very few sources of up to date information available. And to be fair, they seem to have taken care in reproducing the formula. However, I would be sure to read some of the older books on developers, and cross check the information before relying on it."},{"Title":"The Film Developing Cookbook (Darkroom Cookbook) (Vol 2)","review":"I bought and read every page of all three of Steve Anchell's black and white photo information books: The Variable Contrast Printing Manual, The Film Developing Cookbook, and The Darkroom Cookbook. Why? Because he gives a mix of an historical view plus tells what to pick of the best current chemistries. He does this without bogging down in the actual complexities of a college chemistry course keeping it at a usable technicians level. Since he also tells you why you are using various chemicals or paper his books do not dumb down but instead give you fascinating useful information. Anyone serious about darkroom work will appreciate his insights and commentary about chemistry use. He lists so many historical and current B&W chemical formulas and their use that any B&W experimenter will find the books useful. Beginners may get information overload but anyone who has already done B&W developing will appreciate the vast amount of information. These books could use an overall rewrite to make them a bit simpler to understand, in spite of this they are one of the few sources to accumulate this B&W information and are well worth owning as a reference and explanation."},{"Title":"The Film Developing Cookbook (Darkroom Cookbook) (Vol 2)","review":"I've been working with different films and developers for ages.

I have read a number of books on this general subject and found this one much better. It is descriptive, as stated in another review, but wonderfully so. As an example (p 87, with drawings):\\"Cells are sewn together, almost touching, by thousands of connexons at small patches called 'gap junctions'. Each connexon is composed of six identical protein units, together forming a hexagonal tube through the cell membrane. A constant traffic of sugars, amino acids, ATE, and other small molecules travels from cell to cell through them. However, large molecules like proteins cannot pass through these narrow tubes, so each cell retains its own machinery. In times of distress, these tiny knotholes can be sealed. The concentration of calcium inside cells is normally kept very low, so if large amounts of calcium flow through a cell, it is usually a signal that it has been breached. Sensing a sudden rise in calcium, connexons snap shut, isolating healthy cells from a damaged neighbor.\\"One-hundred-and sixty-six pages, packed full of similar descriptions, that in my opinion are well-organized, taught me much more than any other book on the same subject has."},{"Title":"Our Molecular Nature: The Body's Motors, Machines and Messages","review":"Evolution operates like an origami master at the molecular level, an insight described by David Goodsell with a remarkably simple graphic scheme in \\"Out Molecular Nature.\\"For all the glib talk about what genetic engineering can or might do, it is not so easy to find anything that explains what it does do, in term available to the non-specialist. Goodsell does it.New genes (whether engineered or evolved) specify new molecules, mostly proteins. Their functions are dictated largely by their shapes.\\"Many enzymes (proteins that order other proteins around) were developed very early in the evolution of life and have not been substantially improved in billions of years and trillions of generations,\\" writes Goodsell about dihydrofolate reductase, a smallish protein whose job is to move carbon atoms.In fact, only the small \\"folate\\" site does the work, and it could not change and still function. The rest of the amino acids that make up this enzyme serve only to fold the folate sector into the proper shape.With at least 60,000 proteins involved in the human body (the count has more than doubled in a generation), it is impossible to keep track of them. Goodsell, a drug designer at the Scripps Research Institute, helps make sense of the mob graphically.He has chosen about 150 of the best understood molecules of life (not all proteins) and drawn pictures of them. The pictures are simple, black, white and gray, and what they convey is relative size and the shape of the active sites.This kind of information is accessible even to a reader with no training in chemistry at all, though of course a sophisticated reader with get more out of it. But, for example, valence number is never even mentioned.Goodsell's little descriptions are packed with out-of-the-way information. Sugars, much misrepresented in the popular press in discussions of nutrition, are dealt with on a more fundamental level here.We learn that, despite the preference of the diet police for fructose over sucrose (cane sugar, which is glucose and fructose combined), the body hardly uses fructose at all.While most of us prefer to eat sucrose, what the body wants is glucose. What little fructose is wanted is manufactured by the body itself, in the sex cells, where its only use is as the energy source for sperm.The secret of life . . . is the ability to build molecules according to need,\\" writes Goodsell.Besides proteins, Goodsell illustrates the nucleic acids, which make the genes that tell the body what proteins to make; and a few molecules that are not proteins.To me, the most fascinating protein is ATP synthase, which Goodsell describes as \\"a molecular waterwheel.\\"The marvelous thing about this molecule is that tis functional part spins around an axle that anchors it to a cell wall. The push is provided by hydrogen ions (that is, nake protons). This mechanical effort is transmuted into chemical energy, and for each nine protons that pass through, ATP synthase cranks out one molecule of ATP.ATP, or adenosine triphospate, is the chemical that provides much of our energy. It powers those plastic glow sticks kids buy at the county fair.That's why they run down and can't be recharged. That's also why the ability of the tube to light lasts somewhat longer if you freeze it. At cold temperatures, ATP cannot give up its energy.There are other chemicals here, not proteins and not inhabitants of cells, such as the molecules that roam in our bloodstreams, eating invading viruses. Some are big and clumsy-looking, others small and elegant.But all are unmistakably parts of living systems. \\"Molecules formed by physical processes never show the complexity and design of your own molecules,\\" says Goodsell."},{"Title":"Our Molecular Nature: The Body's Motors, Machines and Messages","review":"GOOD BOOK.

In this case our tough as teak bikie is taken out of maximum security, because of his preternatural driving skills, to deliver vital medicine across to the other side of post-apocalyptic US - LA to Boston. Along the way he has to battle mutant animals, fatigue, betrayal, mega-storms, and, in a classic filmic climax, bikie gangs.The mood is able, as is the setting, although the latter isn't really detailed (post apocalyptic has been travelled so frequently these days: we're in the land of Mad Max). Maybe it received some more critical acclaim at the time because it was still original to have an \`antihero' - \`Hell' Tanner is a brutally unsubtle device in opposition to clean cut good guys. But these days (and then?) he is deep in the land of stereotype that Bruce Willis or Nicholas Cage or Van Damme or any of a number of \`wrong-side-of-the-tracks' sullen heroes could be cut from. Zelazny goes way too far with this, contradicting himself totally in his absurd romanticism of the lone bikie justified by his own code and his raw toughness. He casually throws in that he's a rapist and a murderer of innocents to set up the anti-hero, but throughout the book \`Hell' only ever does honourable things, getting downright homey and sentimental with a salt of the earth farm family and their kid, and stepping in as the knight to rescue a bikie damsel in distress. He only ever fights in self-defence or to protect others: the anti-hero thing is pure gloss."},{"Title":"Damnation alley","review":"Damnation Alley is a book of epic proportions, set in the future.

We all know that the author must have got his inspiration for the vehicle from Captain Scarlets Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle (SPV), the descriptions are almost identical, even the driving positions and steering via TV screen. Obviously, any post apocalyptic novel must either contain the adventures of some sort of alternate religious cult or mutants/bikers. Roger sticks to the latter, safer territory. Lots of mutants. Some bikers. No mutant bikers though. I always thought that it was annoying that the 2 parts of the US MOST likely to be destroyed in a war (the North East and LA/San Francisco) were the 2 ends of \\"The Alley\\". It might have been more believable to make it Washington State to Florida or something like that. The ending is pretty cool though, and one of the best written parts of the book.

Even the general plot is fairly juvenile, obviously targeted towards teen-aged males. And what better way to sell cigarettes to teenagers than to advertise smoking in a sci-fi novel targeted towards teenaged boys? This book must have been paid for by the tobacco industry, as there is a sheer ridiculous amount of chain smoking involved (nearly on every page).Zelazny didn't put much thought into the post-apocalyptic plot, besides the lame midwestern monsters. There seems to be ample cigarettes in an America in economic collapse, as is there plenty of coffee and other items difficult to obtain (eggs, meat, etc).

In this post-nuke wastelands of US he got an offer. A complete pardon of all his past and future crimes if he would be willing to ride across the country in a gauntlet, armored 8 wheel vehicle, from Los Angeles to Boston. To bring a plague antidote for the surviving people. The convoy, motored group of 3, is sent across by land; to battle huge mutant insects, packs of survivors turned violent and feral, and brutal electrical storms that savage the already barren plains, to ravel through the desolate post-nuke wastelands.Damnation Alley takes place in a post-apocalyptic nuclear war where most of the earth has been destroyed. Only a few pockets of humanity exist in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Boston. Tanner's experience as a smuggler makes him the best driver available. Tanner believes in impression but somewhere deep down he has something good. The reader is supposed to believe that Tanner changes during the trip just by psychoanalyzing his own thoughts. The narrative is mostly done through Tanner's eyes how he fights giant gila monster, bats, snakes. In a stop or two he meets a crazy biologist, warm surviving family who offer him a little rest in the long journey and Cornelia, a girl from a motorbike gang he had to slaughter. If Tanner is not talking to himself, he has his co-driver Greg, a Native American who's brains he trashed against the cockpit (at halfway of the book), or Cornelia (at the end of book), who gets killed just before they arrive to Boston. At the end City declares Tanner a hero and a statue is erected for him. Tanner isn't around to see these; he has split in the desert.One (1) star. Written in 1969 the year of theEasy Riderroad movie. The story resembles remarkably the movie; iced only with plague antidote delivery. The ramblings of bearded Tanner, who smokes in chain and kills without a second thought, takes a woman, present straight male-macho ideals put on words. The road ride is predictable and descriptions of the surroundings occupy most of the book. With the initial setting, in this radioactive hellhole, there could have been lots of possibilities but unfortunately all the terrain is abridged to monsters and the Road. The few encounters with the isolated people on the way are probably used for break effect in this otherwise monotonous trip diary.

Fourteen years before _The Road Warrior_, another ballsy loner in leather zooms the wastelands of a post-apocalyptic world, one that has gone insane with lurid pulp nasties like giant gila monsters, big snakes, super bats, storms that dump debris from the sky, and roving motorcycle gangs (gotta have those).

The slow transformation never becomes clich&eacute; or silly, especially since Zelazny constantly throws a smorgasbord of action at Tanner's armored fortress-car.A few avant-garde sequences throw the book off kilter, but otherwise the hard-boiled fury of this adventure carries you quickly to the finale."},{"Title":"Damnation alley","review":"This is an interesting book-- different in some ways from other Zelazny novels. The narrative was less polished than most of his other work. I read this novel on a Greyhound going through some of the area that the story takes place in. I can see why this was made into a film. It has a sort of visual quality, but I never really felt the character was in much danger, or even really challenged, until the encounter with the bikers at the end. Still, the post-apocalyptic road trip across America was intriguing if not gripping. Sort of an On the Road/Art of Motorcycle Maintenance for SF fans. The first thought I had when encountering Hell Tanner was that this must have been the direct inspiration for Snake Pliskin, and that this book (or the 1977 movie) must have been an inspiration for the movie Escape from New York. There are many similarities-- too many for coincidence. It is entertaining, and Hell Tanner is a solid character, far nicer than he believes himself to be. Like all Zelazny novels, my major complaint is that this one is too short. One question I'd like to throw out is that at the end, the &quot;three days&quot; was mentioned, as well as the islands maybe having survived them. Does that mean this is somehow connected to This Immortal?"},{"Title":"Damnation alley","review":"After a nuclear war most of North America has become a wasteland known as 'Dammnation Alley'. Hell Tanner, the last surviving Hells Angel and due to die for rape, murder, extortion, etc. is given the choice of delivering a vital vaccine to a plague ridden city or being executed.Zelazny writes a imaginitive and hard edged thriller filled with vivid imagery. I suspect that Hell Tanner was the inspiration for 'Escape From New York' Snake Plisken and its a pity that Jack Smight's film was just a dilute interpretation of the original. I am surprised it hasn't been re-published."},{"Title":"Damnation alley","review":"This novel is an absolute classic portrayal of near future but post apocalypse Earth. It is set in a US in which what remains of the population is confined largely to the coasts and separated by a wild and dangerous interior. When the population on the East coast is threatened by a deadly disease, the only hope is for a medical supplies to be transported overland. The book follows one man, unreformed biker Hell Tanner who sets out to cross the badlands.As a setting for a novel this is not very promising. However, the author brings a huge amount of invention and narrative skill to bear and the result is a page turner. Of course, you know from the start that Hell Tanner will reluctantly accept the assignment and that he will face almost certain defeat on the way.Despite that knowledge, you want to keep reading this book because the story is just so well put together. For me, one of the marks of a really good book is the vividness of the images that it creates in my head. By that test, this book was very good indeed.If you like SF adventure stories, then track down a copy of this book and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Damnation alley","review":"Sometime after a nuclear apocalypse, there are two nations left in the former U.S. (perhaps in the world); the nations of California and Boston. All the rest is a wasteland of radioactivity, mutant beasts, super storms and violent gangs, known as Damnation Alley.Word comes that a plague has struck Boston. California sends a group of their best drivers across Damnation Alley to deliver vaccine. To lead this group, they shanghai Hell Tanner: criminal, the last Hell's Angel and the best damned driver they have.This was my first Roger Zelazny novel and it wasn't what I expected. The writing was quirky and more literary than I was expecting, given the pulpy storyline and the workman-like writing in so much old sci-fi. The post-apocalyptic setting, lack of details about the causes of the war and unspecified year of the story kept the book from feeling particularly dated (except for thelate-sixties fascination with the Hell's Angels).So I liked the writing (enough that I will pick up other books by Zelazny), but overall I thought the book was only so-so. For the bulk of the book, though we hear what a terrible place Damnation Alley is, it just doesn't seem so dangerous.Once Hell reaches the Eastern Seaboard he is constantly being harassed by raiders (and this section was very well done), but the previous days' driving across the country seemed almost mellow in comparison. I think maybe the book would have benefited a little from a couple of extra chapters and a few more travails.Still, even though I think the book is flawed, it is worth a read. It helped spark a whole sub-genre of post-apocalyptic fiction, as I'm pretty sure Walter Jon WilliamsHardwired, movies likeDoomsdayand theMad Maxseries and game worlds likeGamma WorldandDark Futurewere all at least partly inspired by this book."},{"Title":"Damnation alley","review":"Hell Tanner, the last of the Hells Angels, gets a pardon from the Nation of California - if he takes plague vaccine from Los Angeles to Boston. To make it, though, he has to go through Damnation Alley -- what's left of America after a nuclear war. It's a land of giant critters, volcanoes, biker gangs, and storms that drop boulders out of the sky. Along the way, murdering, pimping, thieving Tanner decides he may just like to have a go at being a hero ...This is a fast-paced, very enjoyable adventure story told in prose colorful in every sense of the word. Zelazny himself preferred the shorter novella version. He was right. The added bits about life in plague-ridden Boston don't add much and a poetic, impressionistic section on the source and circulation of the winds that plague the world breaks up the pacing and tone. And, needless to say, there's little in the way of plausible science. Still, those are minor blemishes, and the story is worth reading in either version."},{"Title":"Damnation alley","review":"When I read this I was struck by the similarities between the deal offered to Hell Tanner to run the serum thru Damnation Alley to a plague stricken Boston in order to recieve a full pardon for every criminal act he's committed in the Nation of California...hmmm. That sounds alot like the deal offered to Snake Plissken, who seems to share alot of other similarities with Hell Tanner, who admittedly came first in 1969. I have no way of knowing whether or not John Carpenter or Nick Castle read the Zelazny book by the time they wrote Escape from New York but it wouldn't surprise me at all. Being a big fan of Plissken's exploits I can't help but like this pulpy sci fi novel. With a few very slight changes someone could easily adapt this into the 3rd Snake Plissken movie!!!! (Why am I not a Hollywood hot shot with clout, power, influence? Oh yeah, my ambition is handicapped by laziness.)There is nothing on earth that could make the awful 1977 film adaptation worthwile. It has about zero to do with the book, which is filled with great twisted post-apocalyptic imagery: giant bats and scorpions and other fantastic beasties and tornado winds whipping great hunks of concrete and other unhealthy materials thru the malestrom that is \\"the Alley.\\" And the Land-Master that Tanner drives is super-cool in a James Bond/Speed Racer way; it has flame throwers and grenade launchers and all sorts of buzz saw hub cap weapons.Very cool."},{"Title":"Damnation alley","review":"In 1969, Roger Zelazny took a short story he had written two years earlier and expanded it into a full novel.Written ten years before the release of the first Mad max film, lovers of the post-apocalyptic road trip genre will find themselves in familiar territory that most believe first started when Mel Gibson first took to the screen.But before there was Mad Max, there was first Hell Tanner and they are certainly twin brothers of different mothers.In a United States devastated by a nuclear war, Hell Tanner is given an offer he can't refuse: to drive the ultimate survivalist car from Los Angels to Boston to deliver a desperately needed vaccine. Along the way, he encounters rogue motorcycle gangs, monster-sized Gila Monsters, monster-sized bats, killer dust devils and a host of other challenges.Not Zelazny's best, yet for pulp readers who enjoy tales of the end of the world as we know it, the read is entertaining though it will not stand up to hard questioning, for instance, where is everybody getting their gasoline?"},{"Title":"Damnation alley","review":"I adore Zelazny, and this is one of his easiest reads, imho. It is also a story that was made into a horrible, horrible film. I know the author was disappointed in the movie as well. Read the book! Great, flawed hero! Monsters! Lives at stake! Chase scenes! Redemption!"},{"Title":"Damnation alley","review":"I read this as a kid. I remember really liking it but not much else.This Is a reread. I couldn't remember details so I reread it to reaffirm my 4 star rating. The rating stands. I enjoy Post-apocalyptic stories and the different paths they can follow. This is post nuclear and leans toward some of the scifi effects of radiation: lingering hot-pockets, mutations, altered weather, etc.The US is split into different nations with most of the population on either coasts. The middle is essentially a dead no-mans land called Damnation Alley. Planes can't fly, the land roams with mutant animals and deadly weather, and the is no radio communication."},{"Title":"Charlie Mike","review":"I first read this book around 1985, when LTC Scott was the BC of the Airborne Training Battalion at FT Benning. I was going through the Airborne course at the time, and the novel really made an impression on me. I have no idea what happened to LTC Scott after June of 1985 or so, but he really helped me understand what being a soldier was all about. It's a great book, by someone who has really been in small unit combat...so grab it and read!"},{"Title":"Charlie Mike","review":"The book \\"Charkie Mike\\" has been around for awhile.

(that i can find) I began this book while in airborne school in Ft. Benning GA in 1988 when it first came out. I read for three straight days and finished it. Then reread it immediatley. I laughed, cried got mad and completely enjoyed it. I have since read this same book over 10 times and never fail to feel the emotions that went into the book. The follow up &quot;the Last Run&quot; is as well fantastic. The expendables and the Hill are also superb novels. The only thing that I regret is that I have not met the man yet. Read these books but be warned, take a vacation because these books will cause you to miss work and sleep."},{"Title":"Charlie Mike","review":"I found this to be a good read.

Benning, GA. LTC Scott was my commanding officer while at jump school. But what enticed me to read the book more then anything was the author. LTC Scott was the most strac, high speed individual I ever had the privilege to meet. He had an aura about him that made him seem invincible, nay I even say, bullet proof. \\"You gotta love it\\" was his catch phrase he would always say. The book was as awesome as the man. I still have the book that LTC Scott autographed for me even after many natural disasters. He also presented me with my jump wings on graduation day. There is a picture of him on the back of the book, that is how I will always remember him, he looked like that on any given duty day. I went on to RIP after jump school and while I was only down the hill, I did not get to see LTC Scott very often after that. I often think about him and wonder what ever became of him and his career? I have never held the brass in very high esteem, but LTC Scott was the exception. I would have followed him to hell and back no questions asked. Read this book, you won't be dissapointed.Rangers Lead The Way! HooAh!"},{"Title":"Charlie Mike","review":"Although the U.S. Army Rangers is mostly glamorized for its daring assault on Pointe du Hoc during the Normandy landings in WW2 and in Spielberg's movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (which involved a certain squad of 2nd Battalion Rangers on a dubious mission), it has evolved into a leaner force in Vietnam with a much different mission, that of being the long-range &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of the Army. In &quot;Charlie Mike,&quot; Leonard B. Scott portrayed the harsh reality of combat through the eyes and minds of these soldiers whose every mission was a struggle for survival, isolated deep behind enemy lines. As a former Ranger himself who served in 'Nam, Scott's descriptions of the sights and smells of combat as well as the camaraderie of the Brotherhood-in-Arms possess a realism and immediacy few novels equalled even today. The only deficiencies (hence &quot;only&quot; 4 stars) in this book are the poorly drawn romantic scenes; they probably are best left out altogether because, rather than lending a more human element to the story, they only served as boring interludes to the pace of the action. Luckily, the novel's written in &quot;snippets&quot; so that you can easily skip these parts. All in all, not a bad debut novel. If you like this type of book, I highly recommend &quot;Black Hawk Down,&quot; which is based on the snafu in Mogadishu, Somalia."},{"Title":"Charlie Mike","review":"As a vet of this conflict, I didn't want to read too much about it, but a buddy gave me some of Scott's novels and I found them to be true to life, brutal, a lot of humor and characters that live and die in a conflict that was at times pure madness. His central characters are alive with personalities, hopes, fears and courage. This novel is superb as are his other novels on Viet Nam. An absolute must read for anyone with an interest in what it was like. Rangers rule the night!"},{"Title":"Charlie Mike","review":"I was in this unit during the time the book covers and Scott was a platoon lieutenant. The book is realistic of the actions that occured and the personalities are factual. There is some embellishment but held a minimum. When you read the book my nick name in the book is \\"cowboy\\".The nick name was given since I was from the state of Wyoming. I would encourage anyone with an interest in Vietman to read this book."},{"Title":"Charlie Mike","review":"In 1986 I bought this book while in Jump School at Fort Benning GA. LTC Scott was the Commander of the Jump School and I still remember how in his opening speach to the class he said, \\"In two weeks you are going to go jump out of one of my C-130s and C-141s. Are you Crazy?!\\" He was a very impressive man and the book was very fitting to his style and attitude. I still have the book, and very often take the time to read it. I wish I could find a biogrphy of him or something telling where he is today. I will never forget the way he ran things and would leave people so motivated after giving a speach.About the book, it is very well written and very descriptive of what a soldier would go through."},{"Title":"Charlie Mike","review":"I first read this book back in the summer of 1985. I was in jump school down at Benning. The author of this book was the commander of the school at the time. He was a little guy, but don't let that fool ya, because he carried himself like a giant. And while we were running in formation in the hot Georgia heat, he would be running around us and yelling, \\"gotta love it\\". We would all yell back in unison, \\"charlie mike, sir!\\" Man, that guy was full of energy. You should know that \\"charlie mike\\" means \\"continue mission... no matter what... and against whatever odds\\". The book carries the same intensity as the colonel.During those 3 weeks of airborne school I must have read that book 4 times. Boy-oh-boy I loved that book. And of course I went with all my fresh-made buddies to the Benning PX to have the Colonel sign it one Sunday.I guess I was kind of surprised 2 years later in the summer of 1987 back at Benning for Ranger School when we were all running on that hot Georgia hardball. Because there he was again! Commander of Ranger School.I'll never forget during that first week there, called \\"zero week\\", on one morning jog, he comes running up to me and says, \\"Ranger, are you an officer?\\" I says, \\"yes, sir.\\" And he says, \\"what school you from Ranger?\\" I sound off, \\"Lehigh, Sir.\\" He then yells back, \\"Rangers from that school don't usually do very well here at Ranger School.\\" So I sound off again, \\"We'll see, sir.\\"I figured he probably said that to a lot of us kids. But I took that as a challenge coming from this colonel. That's the way he was. He was always challenging us. Making us push ourselves to do better. It felt pretty good 8 weeks later after Camp Merrill, deserts of Utah, swamps of Florida, and then back on that parade field at Benning when ol' Scott pinned that black and yellow tab on my shoulder. I got pay back from a school that had just washed out 50% of the class.That's the way COL Scott was though. He pushed us. And he taught us how to push ourselves. And the book is no different. The characters have been taught the same way. Because when the chips are down, they push themselves to continue, to continue mission.So last year when my 16 year old son asked me what Ranger School was like and what Rangers do, I told him. But then I said, \\"if you really want to know you should hear it from the guy who taught me.\\" So I ordered the book off Amazon (my signed copy had been lost over the years) and after he read it, he told me he wanted to be one, too.Charlie Mike, Sir.Airborne Ranger"},{"Title":"Charlie Mike","review":"This novel portrayed the 60's. the era was one of complete dissarray,unhappiness and lines drawn in the sand. You were for or against. We that stood for, were the patriots, those against we felt were traitors. After all these years I guess the only that could state who was right are gone but their names will allways remain with us on the wall of honor. This novel brought back all those thoughts to me. He wrote a novel that not only smelled and felt but was the way things were in those days. Anyone in education should attempt to make this novel a required reading in our high school's today. It is a explanation of anyone that has ever served in our armed forces what we beleive in.

I joined the infantry at 17 to see for myself and after serving in Panama and Somalia I understand. Col. Scott says it best in the books with way he connects you to the characters you come to realize they did it for the men to their left and their right, not so much for America, but the men who represent America.

Fenn's simple and straightforward way of writing makes it an easier read than some other history books, but nevertheless it is informative and filled with interesting accounts. Fenn has the ability to keep readers engaged without bogging them down in scholarly or esoteric language or concepts. She also uses an incredible amount of research and primary and secondary sources. Included are details about smallpox, the symptoms and spread of the disease across the United States, and some interesting information about George Washington and other historical figures who came in contact with the pestilence (as well as MUCH more!).

Its amazing how much of an impact smallpox had on the Revolution. We came so close to defeat, not by the hands of the British but because of the virus. It showed up at every major event of the war and had a huge impact on the outcome of these events. From the Siege of Boston to Yorktown smallpox was there. It was also only an American disease since in England the virus was endemic (a harmless childhood sickness much like chicken pox). In the colonies it was not endemic so the Patriots, Loyalists, slaves, and natives were very vulnerable, dying en masse.A second epidemic then spread from Mexico City to Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. It eventually made its way to the Pacific Northwest.

This text adds an interesting new dimension to an entire time period. Exceptional research on individual experiences."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"The book is an exciting and readable account of smallpox's impact on early North and Central America.Fenn interweaves personal accounts from journals and historical documents with statistics gleaned from various public records to give the reader a front row seat in the macabre dance of death that smallpox represented. She makes compelling arguments that the disease had as great an impact on the American revolutionary war as did the decisions of the fledgling nation's leaders.Fenn provides the readers with enough scientific and medical details to bring them up to speed, but not so much as to discourage the nonprofessional from enjoying the book.Altogether, a very enjoyable book; well worth reading."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"Pox Americana offers an exhaustive study of Small Pox in general; however, the title leads one to believe that the focus of the book is going to be centered from 1775-1782. Elizabeth Fenn spends the first three chapters discussing the American Revolution, but only in sparatic terms. The first chapter is a brief history of \\"Variola.\\" Washington and the troops are mentioned only after countless anecdotes of many other people from many different time periods are written. After chapter three, the book becomes more confusing. Plains Indians are discussed, and I am still oblivious as to how homosexuality relates to this epidemic. Later, the Russians are discussed as well as fur traders. The virus spread across the entire continent, I understand this, but the book was suppose to focus on the American Revolution period, and only three chapters of the book were devoted to the main topic. Honestly, the book should have been 134 pages because after that, the book becomes too confusing and repetitive. Lastly, not to nit-pick, but Fenn refers to Small Pox as \\"Variola\\" throughout the entire book. The scientific and proper form to write the name for a virus is the first (genus) initial and the second (species) written out, i.e. V. major. The fact that Fenn repeats this rudimentary mistake so often takes some of the scholarly value away from this otherwise potentially useful study."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"Lots of people got smallpox, and many of them died. OK, now you do not need to read this dull book."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"Elizabeth Fenn synthesizes an outstanding concoction of accounts into a cohesive narrative of smallpox's movement across North America. Her account sheds new light on a field relatively untouched by historians. Infusing modern insight into historic accounts, Fenn provides the reader with an excellent vantage point to understand not only the physical and medical impact of the smallpox epidemic in North America, but also the political, social, financial, and military ramifications of its impact on everyone - from American troops to former slaves enlisted into the British forces, to Canadian fur trappers, to Spanish settlers in Mexico, to the Native Americans of all of North America. Fenn's mixture of narrative and analysis marks the perfect amalgamation of compelling storyteller and critical historian. She butresses even a seasoned expert's historical framework and enlivens the work with tempered passion for her subject.Pox Americana provides the reader with an accurrate, detailed, and delightful account covering one of American history's most important events.

This book, while clearly stating the impact of smallpox during American's war for independence, also gives us a deeper understanding of how the rest of the continent was made available for conquest.

The title is intriguing and prompted many conversations."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"This moment in American history is not the first time that Americans have debated protection from Smallpox. Ms. Fenn has painted a haunting picture of an earlier America with the same inability to decide what was the proper course of action given the valid arguments both for and against mass population protection. I was fascinated to learn that George Washington himself was initially against mass inoculation and later in favor of it. From Ms. Fenn's book, I understood the fear of the populace that led to laws prohibiting inoculation. She has managed to paint a picture of an epidemic that helped me to understand the sheer panic that led to people inoculating themselves by cutting and packing those cuts with the scabs taken from already sick victims. Yikes. Sometimes a bit wordy with this date and that, I skipped the transmission dates and routes for the most part, although I have to say that the transmission routes between Mexico and the young U.S. was surprising to me."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"The great smallpox epidemic of 1775-82 is covered in a survey which reveals not only the spread of the disease, but how it made an impact on the Revolutionary War's outcome and how it affected the lives of everyone in North America.

Fenn does a fantastic job in portraying a major force in the battle for independence and developing American nation-small pox. This virus, which is often overlooked in history textbooks, played a vital role in the early days of the nation. Fenn presents the information in a logical and systematic way, allowing for a smooth flow throughout the book.

The documentation looks valid and the author has a fluid style."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"This was a definitive work on the smallpox epidemic in America at the time of the Revolution. The implications of the pox on American history is important."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"This book should be in the library of every serious student of American - actually North American (include Canada and Mexico) history. Fenn's work is an important contribution not only to the history of the American Revolution, but the equally important history of Native Americans in Mexico, New Spain (the Spanish-claimed lands of western North America), Canada and the western part of the continent beyond the 13 original English colonies. This is a \\"global\\" study of life and civilizations on this continent mainly during the time 1775 - 1782 (and later with regard to the events in Canada, Mexico and New Spain) viewed through the lens of the scourge of small pox and the death, privation and misery it wrought. I was an American Studies major in college (B.A. 1973), and never was the topic of the impact of small pox) upon the population of the colonies (including Native Americans, slaves, patriots, loyalists, combatants and non-combatants) even whispered, let alone addressed in any depth.This book is truly an eye-opener. Readers will find a new appreciation for the hardships endured by persons of all races and political persuasions in the face of a truly horrific pandemic. Readers will also discover: new sympathies for the plight of African American slaves who were cynically exploited and then, when sick with small pox, abandoned to suffer and die by the British (see Simon Schama's excellent book \\"Rough Crossings\\" for a fuller treatment of that subject); deeper appreciation for the military and administrative genius of George Washington in how he managed and used the Continental Army in the face of the disease that was ravaging his army; more new sympathies for the plight of Native Americans in the colonies, in Mexico and New Spain, and in North America (in Canada and nearly as far north as Alaska, who were decimated by small pox and other diseases Europeans introduced into the Americas.While the cover of the book (it got my attention) would lead one to believe that the subject is chiefly a discussion of the impact of small pox open the colonies during the American Revolution, this is not the case. Fenn's examination of the impact of small pox is on the continent as a whole - how small pox, transmitted mainly by natives, traveled north from Mexico City and to devastated Mexico (the greatest number of small pox deaths in this period occurred in Mexico), all the way up into what is now New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and California; how small pox made its way into the American Plains, again principally by Native Americans and eventually into the Canadian Shield and Hudson's Bay areas, with horrific, nearly genocidal, consequences for many tribes; and the incursion of small pox into the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. In the midst of this account of suffering and sadness, Ms. Fenn introduces us to many quiet heroes; we bear witness to innumerable and unremarked acts of kindness and mercy.Although this is a somber subject, Ms. Fenn's writing style is crisp and lively. She has a great command of language and maintains \\"political neutrality\\" throughout, the only exception being her conclusion, based on historical accounts, that the British most likely did deliberately use sick colonists and loyal blacks in an effort to infect colonial armies and \\"rebel\\"-controlled areas.The book has copious and informative end notes and attributions to original sources that attest to the thorough research that went into the writing of this book."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"This is a great work of a little-known piece of American history. It is noteworthy not just for its reference to the American Revolution but also as a cultural education tool regarding the plight of Native Americans due to smallpox, along with the early reference to biological warfare. The narrative is informative, interesting and well-written. It is a definite must for those interested not just in American history but also in anthropology, biology and world history."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"If we think that America has never known an infectious epidemic other than the Great Influenza after World War I, we'd be wise to consider the smallpox pandemic that swept the length &amp; breadth of the North American continent just as the Revolutionary fever did.Pox American: The Great Smallpox Epidemic of 1775-82 is a fascinating way to learn about the early years of our nation when cultures collided on this continent. Each chapter starts with a story of one man - a ship's captain exploring the Straits of Juan de Fuca or a New England volunteer in the Continental Army or a missionary riding the dusty Southwest trails. From these individual's stories we can see scope of the virus' reach. With pictographs, maps, charts &amp; photographs, this author brings this contagion close to home!Sometimes the dread disease was an invisible passenger upon an unsuspecting carrier that would arrive in a tribe of otherwise healthy people &amp; within weeks, the entire community would be dead. Sometimes it was intentionally sent forth by our wily forefathers to do their deadly work.Smallpox haunted our ancestors from coast to coast; from Russian promyshlenniki (hunters &amp; traders) who first explored &amp; then enslaved the residents of Alaska to America's breadbasket, where entire native communities of farmers &amp; hunter-gatherers were wiped out in weeks to Hudson Bay, New Orleans, The South as well as Mexico City.Elizabeth Fenn writes: &quot;The pestilence can teach us the ways in which other upheavels - native warfare, missionization, the fur trade, and the acquisition of horses and guns...reshaped human life on the North American continent. The movement of the virus from one human being to another shows us how people actually lived in the late eighteenth century. For despite the political, social, and racial boundaries of the day, people rubbed elbows.&quot;I cannot do justice to the scope &amp; breadth of this author's research. Pox Americana is a compelling read, a dread-filled chronicle of another aspect of our story &amp; Professor Elizabeth Fenn has written a rich &amp; interesting story with a huge Notes Section, as befits a teacher of history!"},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"I first read of the devastation that smallpox wrought on the Continental Army while reading David McCullough's terrific biography, \\"John Adams\\" and was lucky enough to have seen, subsequently, \\"Pox Americana\\" author Elizabeth Fenn delve more deeply into the topic on cable TV's C-Span \\"Booknotes.\\" Professor Fenn has written a well-researched book on smallpox....one that is not only informative, but generally easily readable.This is really two books. The first half covers the trail of Variola (smallpox) transmission throughout the course of the American Revolution and in this first half, Ms. Fenn writes with a prose that captures the reader with graphic details of the harshness of the disease itself, the suffering of those who were unlucky enough to have caught it, and the fear that became a constant in the lives of not only those who fought militarily but those in the civilian ranks as well. She gives us facts about how the smallpox incubates, how long it takes to run its course and how it was so easily transmittable. The reader can almost hear the agony of those inflicted and see the smallpox spread over their bodies. Ms. Fenn points to a tie-in (also in the McCullough book) that it is very likely that the British had tried to use the transmission of smallpox from their more disease-tolerant armies to the weaker American ones as an example of the first \\"germ warfare\\" thrust upon our newly independent country. The fact that George Washington had the timely sense (and good fortune) to inoculate his army during the winter of 1777, thus proving it to be a turning point in the war, is a remarkable story in itself....not one I'm sure that most students learn in school!The narrative in the second half of \\"Pox Americana\\" is weaker. Ms. Fenn, while continuing to do a superb in-depth job at following the disease around North America (mostly through Indian tribes), loses her descriptive appeal. The book now becomes more of an encyclopedia of numbers of deaths, which tribe could have passed it to which other one, and so on. At points we are inundated by the vast numbers of tribes and without the help of some elementary-looking maps, the reader can quite easily get lost. Still, the author has put forth her research at a compelling depth. I wonder now that Ms. Fenn has written this book, is there another book in her future which keeps the more fascinating Revolutionary War aspect and includes all different types of diseases that may have hit the colonists? She would be just the one to write it."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"Pox is a truly scholarly work based on primary historical documents. It is obvious that it was a true labor of love by Prof. Fenn.The epidemic that Fenn studied is a particularly valuable in understanding a little known area of the American Revolutionary War (though her scope covers the entire North American Continet).Many know that the British had released smallpox on French alligned tribes seiging Ft. Pitt during the French Indian War. Less known was the great concern that General George Washington had about smallpox during the American Revolution. Elsewhere, it has been described that the main reason the seige of Boston lasted as long as it did was due to smallpox, and that the Continental Army was the first army in world history to require compulsory immunization - force-wide.Prof. Fenn paints an even darker picture. It could be said that the events with smallpox during the Revolutionary War was America's first biological emergency. She clearly documents cases that appear to be obvious attempts by the British to infect COntinental Forces with smallpox at Boston, and later in Virginia. The Virginia case is most appauling as the British turned freed slaves (loyalists) into their delivery vehicle.The failure to innoculate forces was cited as the main reason the Continental Army failed to take Canada. The army literally melted away, with replacements being taken down as soon as they arrived.Eventually, 1777, the Continental Army required that all new recruits go through innoculation stations before joining the army.The remainder of the book (2/3rds) describes the impact of smallpox on other communities in North America. The impact on the tribes around Vancouver at the time clearly documents how devistating disease can be to a civilization."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"Pox Americana tells the story of the great smallpox epidemic of the 1770s and 1780s in North America. The epidemic affected the American Revolution because colonial soldiers who had not been previously exposed to smallpox contracted it in huge numbers, particularly in the New England and Southern colonies where inoculation had not been a widespread practice. As a result of the disease British troops, most of whom had already been through the disease or been inoculated for it, found another advantage over the Americans in the early stages of the war. Fenn goes into somewhat harrowing detail as she describes the sufferings of those who contracted the disease and those who went through the inoculation process, which must have been almost as awful as the disease itself.Although the British had an advantage over the colonial soldiers in that most of them were already immune to smallpox, the King's forces still suffered from the epidemic due to the inroads the disease made among the slaves who flocked to join the British armies, particularly in the Southern colonies. In the African American population the smallpox germ found another previously unexposed host, and the results were once more incredibly deadly. Fenn documents several cases where the British and later the Americans themselves practiced a primitive type of biological war by releasing contagious people into unexposed populations and by allowing items used by sufferers to be distributed to healthy peopleIn the Native American territories west of the thirteen colonies smallpox also spread like wildfire. Fenn does a good job of tracing possible routes the disease followed as it spread from settlement to settlement along trade routes and shipping lanes, decimating the Indians, who again had no previous exposure and thus no defenses.Pox Americana is valuable because it reminds us of our vulnerability to diseases which spread silently from victim to victim, and helps us realize that one of the deadliest weapons of war is not man made (though it is often deliberately helped along its way)"},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"Pox Americana by Elizabeth Fenn is a great piece of work! Smallpox was one of those virtually forgotten diseases. Elizabeth's book brings together the most comprehensive and yet an easy reading reference on the disease. The information is presented in a logical and systematic way allowing for a smooth flow and easy reading. The book demonstrates how such diseases are not just military factors but are wars in themselves! Elizabeth shows clearly how the disease has shaped our nation. This is rather timely considering the dire need for such a reference under the prevailing threats of bio-terrorism. It is a book that should provide all the information that you need to understand the threats from smallpox. I particularly liked the thorough examination of the historical facts which eases viewing our present situation in an historical context. The other book that really compares with it is \\"Bugs in Armor: a tale of malaria and soldiering\\" by Robert Bwire."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"Elizabeth A. Fenn's Pox Americana (The Great Smallpox Epidemic of 1775-82) is an interesting book that traces the course of this horrendous pox as it veers bloodily throughout the continent of North America. It is very well researched and assembled with great skill. The writing lacks a little narrative punch to carry it over to great pop history but it has all the details in the writing for the history fan to enjoy following this story. The most interesting (and important) aspect of the pox story is the tale beyond the Revolutionary War in the rest of the continent, particulary the southwest, north (in Canada) and the Pacific Northwest (where the pox made first contact in many areas, ahead of Europeans). This part of the story is effectively illuminated by the author. An important book beyond its current terrorism inspired significance."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"This is an excellent work. It bogs down a bit in the second half but only for 30 or so pages as the author gets into the detail of some purported statistical analysis, information that could have been handled as an appendix. But overall it is a wow!Starting with the impact of smallpox on the American Revolution, 1775 - 1782, Elizabeth Fenn continues her study with concurrent analyses of Mexico, where Church burial records provide a very solid underpinning for the magnitude of the epidemic, the Canadian interior, the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. The devastation was appalling. Twenty years later George Vancouver would report extended villages in Puget Sound without a soul. Lewis and Clark would report similar Native American villages in the interior that had been deserted for an extended period of time.Fenn's effort was no simple task. The unexpected bonus is that for the first time I began to understand the magnitude of trading patterns that had been established by Native Americans on the North American Continent, before the arrival of Europeans.This is a wonderful book, very enlightening and very well worth your time."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"More scholarly than \\"entertaining\\" in tone, this book traces smallpox epidemics and their influence upon the progress of war, settlement, and \\"who wins\\" in the race for political and social primacy. If you've an interest in colonial history (particularly the war for independence in the southern colonies), you'll find that this book explains just how significantly smallpox affected the war's progress (something only tangentially mentioned in other histories I've read) as well as the role it played in the rise and fall of various Indian tribes. I particularly appreciate the author's restraint in making sweeping or hysterical value judgements about the actions of various individuals or nations -- she documents what is, and is not, known and permits the reader to make those judgements for himself."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"With Pox Americana, Fenn crafts a sprawling narrative detailing the overlooked smallpox epidemic of 1775-1782 in the Americas and the tumultuous times of revolution that surrounded it. While the global devastation caused by smallpox over the past few centuries has been well documented, Fenn's book offers an uneven but often compelling perspective on the events that shaped America's birth, deftly elucidating the undeniable influence of smallpox on the course of the American Revolution.Pox Americana begins with an account of the American army and George Washington's struggle to fight off both smallpox and the British; the narrative is especially gripping here, as it provides a detailed glimpse into how prominently smallpox factored into both side's war strategies. Fenn then traces smallpox's journey through North America by detailing the lives of the various peoples who inhabited America and the constant struggle to coexist with the lethal contagion and carry on with their lives. With the myriad stories of the colonists waging war to the Native Americans running the fur trade, Fenn raises many themes that still resonate today, particularly the use of biological warfare and how the American way of life facilitates the transmission of disease.The scope of Pox Americana is breathtaking. Fenn clearly poured over many, many sources to craft her portrait of an infant America irrevocably shaped by the smallpox epidemic. The research pays off; the role of smallpox in George Washington's decision-making process and the tragedy that befell countless Native Americans makes for compelling history reading. Yet Fenn's narrative is not without its share of flaws. While it may be a function of the historical events themselves, Pox Americana is a very top-heavy narrative; it starts out strong in its depiction of the American Revolution but loses steam throughout the second half of the book, when the revolution is no longer the focus. During this second half the narrative becomes bogged down in repetitive and overlong accounts of Native Americans and settlers dealing with smallpox during the fur trade. Unfortunately, the book never really recovers, losing momentum long before the epilogue rolls around.Yet Pox Americana's shortcomings never quite derail the experience. Despite the uneven structure and pacing of the narrative, the sheer amount of quality historical content makes Pox Americana a unique and worthwhile read for anyone remotely interested in learning how one disease helped define the course of a burgeoning country."},{"Title":"Pox Americana","review":"Pox American follows the smallpox epidemic that spread through North America from 1775-1782, tracing its impact on the Revolutionary War and Native American and Colonial society. Historian Elizabeth Fenn is meticulous in chronicling the devastation, using firsthand accounts and surviving records to sketch out the death and fear that followed the disease.The impact of smallpox on the Revolutionary War occupies much of the book. Epidemiologically, the Americans were at a disadvantage. Smallpox was endemic in Europe, and British soldiers were much more likely to have been exposed to the disease, gaining immunity. This vulnerability led to serious losses during the revolutionary army's invasion of Canada, as smallpox weakened and killed susceptible soldiers.George Washington struggled with the decision of whether to inoculate his soldiers. Under the imperfect technique of the time, inoculation was a draining affair, confining inoculees to sickbeds. The process also potentially increased the risks of transmission, as inoculees were contagious during the dormant period that followed inoculation. Fenn skillfully uses this dilemma to build tension in a historic account.In the post-Revolutionary period, Fenn focuses on the impact of smallpox on Native American populations throughout the continent, offering repeated accounts of decimated villages and devastated cultures. Native peoples were more vulnerable to the disease, and the successive accounts of loss are heart-rending.The book is thorough and engaging but can be technical in its presentation of history. The larger themes of the Revolutionary War aren't fleshed out. The author, it seems, is confident that readers will remember battles and developments they may not have encountered since elementary school. But the book is compelling in advancing its central theme: the outsized impact of this continent-wide epidemic."},{"Title":"Confounding the Color Line: The (American) Indian - Black Experience in North America","review":"In one article, the author comments, \\"Why didn't Black people take up the issue of racist 'Indian' mascots back in the 1960s?\\" Hello! Because they were fighting their own struggles. And most movements for equality start with the oppressed group themselves. Native Americans should have fought to get rid of those mascots in the 1960s; surely the blame can't land on blacks. Blackwise, there were slaves and freed Blacks critical of slavery before there was a mass of white abolitionists. Why does this book not have a chapter where someone laments, \\"Why didn't Native Americans fight to free black slaves centuries ago?\\" The same comments could be made in reverse.In another chapter, an author takes a Black musical audience member to task for opining that Lumbee music sounded like it was Black-derived. Look, there are countless examples of non-Blacks appropriating Black music and other artistic expressions. The question raised by the audience member is legitimate.In short, I found many examples where this book seems to suggest that if Blacks and Natives have tensions, then it is the fault of the former group. Very little is said about Radmilla Cory, a Black-Navajo woman who received jeers from Navajos when she won Miss Navajo. A Black academic whose name I forgot has written three books about how the Cherokees, Creeks, and Choctaw bought Black slaves and did nothing to see that any Black slaves were freed.If these two groups have tensions, both groups can be to blame. This book seemed very one-sided. I found it disturbing, indeed."},{"Title":"Confounding the Color Line: The (American) Indian - Black Experience in North America","review":"I have to disagree with Mingo.

I found it to be a griping somehow not trite quick paced fantasy.That said, I was quite surprised to find zero mention of Princess Julia in either of the reviews, or the book blurb. Based on the reviews, a reader would be left with the erroneous impression that Prince Rupert saves the world all by his lonesome, and that Julia just does some tasteful swooning as needed. Rest assured Fisher fans, Princess Julia is anything but tame and ladylike, and she is by no means forgettable.

Green- This is the first book of a series of stand-alone novels under the title of Forest Kingdom. However, each book is an entirely new story with different characters. The second book is called Blood and Honour and the third book is called Down Among the Dead. The two main protagonists are also the main characters in Simon R. Green's Hawk and Fisher series (No Haven for the Guilty, Devil Take the Hindmost, The God Killer, Vengeance for a Lonely Man, Guard Against Dishonour, Two Kings in Haven, and Beyond the Blue Moon). Simon R. Green has written a number of various series; Twilight of the Empire, Deathstalker, Deathstalker Legacy, Nightside, and Secret Histories. His is currently starting a new series called Ghostfinders that has its first book due out in August 2010. He's written two stand-alone novels, Shadows Fall and Drinking Midnight Wine, and has written a number of short stories. Blue Moon Rising was originally released in 1991 and published by Roc.Prince Rupert knows he was sent on an impossible mission to slay a dragon. He knows his father, King John, sent him to die so that his older brother, Prince Harald, can become the next king. With his unicorn, Rupert journeys deep into the forest and into a place called the Tanglewood, a 'buffer zone' to the evil and corrupt land called the Darkwood. In order to find the dragon, Rupert has to seek the aid of a Night Witch, who tells him that the dragon is found beyond the Darkwood. Rupert and his unicorn travel in and beyond the oppressive darkness and barely make it out alive. After finding the dragon, he learns that the dragon is a peaceful creature who has a princess under his care. A princess who has been tormenting the dragon for a while. After 'saving' Princess Julia from the dragon, and finding out he can't kill so noble a creature, the group travel back to the Forest Kingdom and his father. During the trip back through the Darkwood, things don't go well for the group and they barely makes it out alive. Upon returning to his home, Rupert learns that the demons from the Darkwood are attacking the Forest Lands and the kingdoms only hope lies with an exiled Warlock. To make things worse, Julia finds out that Rupert's brother, Harald, is who she was to marry. As war looms over the land, Rupert is sent out to bring back the Warlock and travel, once again, through the Darkwood. When he returns, things are not looking good.Criticisms:1) Clich&eacute;. Wow was this story clich&eacute;. There barely seemed to be anything that was unique or new. What should I start with? How about the story. I know it's hard to write a new and fresh story, but this was just too basic. How bad is it when a story is just basically about good vs. evil? Sure, there were a few 'twists' but that's the whole premise. This wasn't very horrible, but it grated on my nerves. Speaking of twists, this story had them and guess what? They were terrible. The biggest twist comes after we find out who the Demon Prince is talking to in a scene around the middle of the book. We don't know who they are but it soon becomes obvious, and that's pathetic. I don't want to give it away, but I will say this. Harald would have made a lot more sense and would have felt justified. I will give the story this though, it was hard to believe it wasn't Harald. Even when we do find out who it was, it didn't come as a shock at all. The twists were way to obvious. Finally we have the characters. Each character is a horrible clich&eacute;, but I'll get into that next.2) Characters. Almost all the characters we meet are just basic and stock. There is really nothing unique about them. Rupert is as boring as they come. He does have his moments though, but for the most part, he has to be one of the blandest and annoying main characters I've ever read about. He just isn't likable. The Warlock is the stock old man who has great power but can go a minute without drinking. While this character wasn't totally awful, I just found him annoying. The Champion who accompanies Rupert is probably the worst clich&eacute;. He's every stories impossibly strong warrior who is stoic and unmoving. But even with the clich&eacute;s, the real problem was that every character felt underdeveloped. There just wasn't enough to make me actually care about these people. They were just two-dimensional and unrealistic that I could barely stand them. That being said, I loathed Julia. I absolutely did not like her and because of this I WILL SPOIL things about her. When we first met her, she seemed okay and great. As the story wore on, my opinion barely changed. She was decent and somewhat likable. But all that changed in a blink of an eye. After Rupert leaves to find the Warlock, Julia is left alone at the castle. The whole time we see her there she's thinking about Rupert and missing him. It seems like she might love him. Ever since she found out who Harald was, she would always try to hurt or avoid him. Yet, what happens when Rupert returns? It seems like she totally forgot about him. Going so far as trying to make Rupert jealous with Harald. She turns into this petty person and that the worst thing. She basically becomes a high schooler in how she acts. Sure seven months is a long time, but it seems like she just started to realize that Rupert wouldn't be coming back at about month four or five. Then after a few pages, she's suddenly back with Rupert. Why? Did she suddenly realize that she loves Rupert, well yes she does. But it just seemed so wishy-washy and was just plain poor character development that I can't help but hate her.3. Relationships. I think the biggest problem with the story is character relationships. They just don't ever seem to form. In the case of Rupert and Julia, we are told that they love each other by page one hundred. There was no building up the relationship, there barely was anything. All we were told is that a few months pass and Julia and Rupert seemed to like each other. That's it. Then we have Rupert and the dragon. It's the same case as Julia, but for friendship. We're just told that they are friends. Yet for about three-quarters of the story, the dragon isn't in it. So when he finally returns, it's suddenly like Rupert and the dragon are buddies. What makes this worse is that on the back of the book it says, \\"But the dragon turned out to be a better friend than anyone back at the castle.\\" Huh? Seriously there doesn't seem to be any friendship that developed other than being told that they were. It's lazy.Praise:1) Humor. The story was really funny. It reads more like a parody than a serious fantasy novel, and it actually works. The jokes and situations that the characters get into are really humorous. However, it felt like only half the story was a parody while the other half was serious. It didn't help that the humor and seriousness meshed together in the same paragraph. I just felt wrong. But I can forgive that because I really did enjoy most of the humor.2) John and Harald. These were the only characters that seemed to have some depth to them. King John was by far the best. He was the most complex and interesting. From his friendship with the court Astrologer we see a deep and insightful character. There were times when he came off as swallow and unlikable, but these were times when the story actually needed him to be. As for Harald, he was just plain interesting. The way that Harald teased Rupert was great and the fact that he hides his loyalty to his father and land so well just made him memorable.3) Last Quarter. I really enjoyed the last quarter. It did have its problems (Julia, obvious twists, and poor showing of relationships), but it was exciting and fun. The action scenes were confusing, but it felt right. The desperation that the characters felt, I felt. I couldn't keep the book down for too long during this time. It was a fun ride to the finish.Side Notes:1) Scenes. Why was it that we would have three paragraphs with one persons view-point and suddenly switch to another? It was kind of jarring at first, but easily adaptable.2) Cover Art. I know that there are a few different versions, but the one I'm going to be talking about is the one above. It's pathetic and boring. Sure the unicorn and dragon look great. Rupert and Julia are laughably bad. But what bothers me is the white. It's just too lazy and boring.Overall: 3/5Final Thoughts:Blue Moon Rising should have stayed being a parody. It would have worked better with it being clich&eacute;, but once it turned serious, the clich&eacute; things just became unbearable. The characters were pathetic. They were so underdeveloped and unlikable that the only people I enjoyed were the king and Harald. At least they had some substance. The other major problem was that I never believed the relationships between these characters were there. I don't like being told they are friends, I want to see it unfold. It's just lazy otherwise. All in all, I have to say that Blue Moon Rising is a decent read. It's exciting at points, boring at others but it does its job. If you like parodies, definitely pick it up. Otherwise, use your judgment."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"BMR keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat. You can feel all of the emotions the characters have. After the battles/fights you have to catch your breath and relax so your heart will slow down. I have never read a book quite like this. I would have to say this is the best book I have ever read and I've read a lot of good books. I'm just itching for a chance to get back to the book store and buy as many other books by Simon R. Green as I can. One last thing... be carefull when reading this book at night, you might wonder if sun will rise again..."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"I'd like to give this novel 4 stars for concept and 2 for execution. The story is a very interesting take on the &quot;typical&quot; fantasy story: A king's second son sets out on what everyone expects will be fatal quest after fatal quest, only to &quot;save a dragon from a princess&quot; and make friends with nearly all his foes, with some great action sequences, plenty of humor, and a little romance, to boot.However, the execution of the novel almost made me miss the humor and ingenuity of the storyline: Way too much needless exposition and description bogged down what could have been a very fast-moving, tightly written novel that would have then broken all the fantasy stereotypes. Green writes terrific action sequences, and he knows humor; I'm not sure why he padded his great concept with all this tedious detail. Why do fantasy authors find it necessary to waste pages on descriptions of what everyone's wearing, what the woods look like, and how exhausted the hero is? After all this talk, the readers are the ones who are truly exhausted.Fantasy readers have fabulous imaginations; otherwise these fantastic tales wouldn't capture our fancy. I wish fantasy authors would encourage their readers to use their imaginations, instead of dictating every detail of every story. Then, truly, would we have groundbreaking innovations in fantasy novels.But, if you don't mind a little detail, Simon Green's *Blue Moon Rising* has a terrific concept, great action, and plenty of humor and romance."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Gods, I love this book.... Simon never lets up, something I've noticed both in this and &quot;Shadows Fall&quot; - the characters are actually human. They're not caricatures of heroes and kings, they have fears and desires and dreams that are not those you might expect of their stereotypes. That, and they face absolutely overwhelming odds. Instead of a malevolent sorcerer cackling in his tower, the people of the Forest Land face a force of nature, and like all forces of nature this is something that cannot bestopped by conventional means. The interplay between characters is also something I love. Scenes with Rupert and Julia, or the Unicorn (like the freedom scene) or the dragon.... Very well written. I'm putting this on my own webpage for all to see...."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Really need to be desperate to read this book. Formula plot with super predictable events and outcome.

The humour and wit, the engaging storyline, and the colorful characters still hold sway. I fully hope that Mr. Green is proud of the story he spun, because it's amusing."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Beyond the Blue Moon ia an outstanding book, which is something to be expected from Simon R Green. The main characters are quite easy to identify with, such as Rupert who is a prince but lives in the shadow of his older brother. The plot is rather familiar in fantasy, an epic battle to prevent the end of the world. Finally, there are enough twists and turns to satisfy even the most jaded reader.The one problem I have is with the price. Considering the fact that they are listing the MM Paperback (new) at $3.95, I really have to wonder how they are justifying the $12.99 for the Kindle edition. How surprised would you be if I admitted I own this as a paperback and it isn't part of my Kindle collection?"},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Blue Moon Rising is simply one of the best fantasy novels in recent years. It has spawned a number of sequels (Down Among The Dead Men, Beyond the Blue Moon, etc.) as well as the Hawk and Fisher novels.Prince Rupert is the second son of the King of the Forest Kingdom. As such he could be trouble for the succession and be used as a pawn in a civil war. Thus he has been sent by his father the King to go out and slay a dragon. That should be the end of the second Prince.But Rupert is more dedicated to his duty than any would believe. He survives the Darkwood, finds a dragon, rescues it from a Princess, survives the Darkwood again and returns home. All in the first few pages.But all is not well when he returns. Not only did he not conveniently die, but the Darkwood is now growing, a Blue Moon will rise soon and the Demon Prince may have returned. It is up to Rupert to find the High Warlock and convince him to return from exile and help the kingdom.All the while he has to put up with assassinations, plots, an overbearing brother, an arranged marriage, the Champion, demons beyond counting, a wise-cracking unicorn and the possible end of the world. Well Rupert is not going to take it all lying down. He will do his duty even if it means not dying.Fun and light but with a serious backbone of a plot. Rupert's early encounters with the unicorn, dragon and Princess help set the tone while the setting of the Darkwood and its demons set the pace of the plot. A wonderful book. Fans of this one might also want to check out Slay And Rescue by John Moore."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Blue Moon Rising (1989) is the first novel in the Blue Moon series. It is also a precursor to the Hawk and Fisher series.In this novel, Prince Rupert of the Forest Kingdom and his unicorn are hunting for a dragon. His father King John IV has sent him out on this quest in hopes of him taking off and never coming back. But Rupert feels duty bound to find the dragon.Rupert is searching for the Night Witch, whose home is within the Darkwood. They encounter a huge cobweb, a demon and goblins in the Tanglewood even before entering the Darkwood. Within the Darkwood, only blue phosphorescence lights their way in their trek to the Night Witch's cottage.Luckily for Rupert, the Night Witch was in love with his grandfather. She presents him with a map to the Dragonslair. Rupert continues through the Darkwood to the other side. He keeps feeling like someone -- or something -- is watching him.When they break through to the light again, Rupert heads toward the Dragonslair. The mountain is too steep for the unicorn, so Rupert goes on alone, over scree and up almost vertical slopes. Finally he reaches the mouth of the cave where the dragon dwells.Rupert calls out to the dragon and the creature comes forth. The dragon is thirty feet from snout to tail, with dozens of very sharp teeth and wickedly clawed hands. Unfortunately, the dragon isn't interested in any fighting that day and invites Rupert back into his lair. There Rupert discovers that the dragon's hoard is a huge collection of preserved butterflies.Rupert also encounters the princess who is staying with the dragon. Julia is not quite what Rupert expected in a princess. She has a strident voice and an overbearing manner. The dragon is hoping that Rupert will rescue her just to get her out of his cave.In this story, the dragon agrees to return to the Forest Kingdom with Rupert and the princess. After they reach the bottom of Dragonslair, Rupert calls the unicorn, but he doesn't want to come out where the dragon can see -- and catch -- him. Yet Rupert finally coaxes him into the open and they head back to the Darkwood.Rupert hesitates before entering the Darkwood again, but still goes on. This time, however, the demons are waiting for them. They have to fight thousands of the demons. Finally, the dragon performs some magic to allow Rupert to make the Rainbow Run. He runs and runs and finally reaches a clearing, where he finds a magic sword. He returns to his companions with the sword and calls the Rainbow.The Rainbow not only kills demons, but it melts away their bodies. Moreover, it heals the companions wounds and returns life to the unicorn. But it doesn't restore his horn.Upon returning to his home castle, Rupert learns that the Darkwood is spreading. Demons are raiding villages and surrounding the castle every night. Something has to be done and Rupert is selected to do it.This story relates the maturing of Rupert. He has always been known for doing his duty, but he is now acquiring a degree of cynicism and a much greater skill with the sword. His brother Harald used to be able to defeat him with ease, but not any more.Julia is also maturing. She now can go for weeks without punching out some wisecracking courtier. Of course, some of that comes from her new reputation, but she also has developed a degree of patience.The unicorn begins to display a trace of bravery, but maybe that comes from being raised from the dead. On the other hand, the unicorn doesn't have much choice in the matter, since it is fight or die . . . again. His coat is beginning to look like a much repaired garment from all the scars, not to mention the stub of the horn.The story has a degree of humor as well as violence and betrayal. The unicorn and Rupert have an ongoing discussion about honor and duty, with the unicorn disparaging Rupert's attitude. Julia and Harald also have an ongoing discussion, but about marriage; she keeps saying \\"no\\" and punching him out.The story has more twists and turns than a mountain road. Moreover, it has a well foreshadowed, but surprising solution to the Darkwood problem. The ending is also surprising, but not quite unexpected.Highly recommended for Green fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of magic, close combat and political intrigue.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"The first time I read Blue Moon Rising was in 1992, one year after it was first published. I picked it up on a whim, and read it in two days (maximum.) Since then, I have read it at least once a year, and gone through three copies.This book is simply spectacular.It starts out with Prince Rupert, the second son of a bankrupt kingdom, on a quest to find a dragon. What he finds is a flatulent dragon and a sword fighting princess. And, when Rupert returns to the Forest Kingdom, he finds out that the Blue Moon is rising, and demons are walking the Forest Kingdom.Simon Green's characters are funny, and endearing. The intrigue in the court of the Forest Kingdom is as well written as the epic battle scenes. I have read every book that Simon Green has written, and this one is by far the best. If you enjoyed the syle and flair of the Deathstalker novels (despite the fact that they sort of peter out), you will enjoy Blue Moon Rising. Every person that I have recommended this book to has liked it.Read it!"},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"I am a big fan of the fantasy genre. For years I have been searching for a book in this genre that I could really really get absorbed into. It has been years since I have really been swept away by a good fantasy book... then came Blue Moon Rising. This book is wonderful and a great page-turner. The battles in this book are some of the most graphic and well-described I have ever read. It's funny and it keeps you wondering what will happen until the last page. I loved the fact that the book moved with a fast pace and the action came frequently. I was hooked after the first couple of pages. I can go on and on about BMR. You just have to read it. Make it your next book to read if you are a fan of the fantasy genre. I am now reading the Hawk and Fisher stories( seems to be a sequels to BMR) and even those are great."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"There seems to be some attempt here to pass this off as a nontraditional fantasy story because of its hero being a second son and its heroine being rebellious and cross, as well as a dragon being a protagonist. No, there's nothing inherently unique about this story; it's the details that make it different and a good read. Green fools us a bit by making us think this is a story about Prince Rupert's traditional quest--but no! That only comprises one chapter, and the rest is actually a story about the Forest Kingdom's battle against legions of demons that are taking over the country, as well as including betrayals in the castle and royal politics.The politics were actually what really won me over about what was at first looking to be an uninteresting book. Yes, it's funny, and by the end very exciting and has just the right amount of blood and swordfighting, as well as a mystery that is entwined throughout the whole thing. But it's the politics that make it unique, because it really draws readers into the world of royal courts and how a medieval kingdom operates. And because this book centers on only one kingdom, it doesn't become confusing but stays very manageable. To avoid being boring, there's also plenty of adventure, and did I mention blood and swordfighting? Green also did his research, because the kingdom and the swordfighting are both described in detail; magic or no, this is a believable world. (Actually, even that's believable because the magic is leaving the world to be replaced by science; one can assume it would be entirely gone by modern times.)As for criticism: all small things. Princess Julia's infatuation with Rupert is contrary to her rebellious nature. Though she does learn to live without him for a great deal of time, she still mopes about a bit too much for someone who knows very well how to be independent. Actually, it seems like the supporting characters are all a little one-sided and archetypal, but characters aren't really the main focus of the book. I don't like the fact that Green took an easy way out in ignoring the dragon for the majority of the book, and I think a little more character should have been given to the Demon Prince. The pacing could have been better in the first chapter. Lastly, I think there should be more suspects for who the final betrayer is; the culprit is a little obvious."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"This prequel to Green's \\"Hawk and Fisher\\" series is, in my opinion, the best fantasy novel of the last twenty years.Green's serious talent manages to be both the epitome of classic high fantasy and its lampoon all at the same time.\\"Blue Moon Rising\\" professes to be a satiric take on all the mores and folkways of fantasy literature, with the protagonist, Rupert, an unwanted second son in a bankrupt kingdom who doesn't fight honorably combined with a terribly unfeminine and somewhat average-looking princess, Julia, going through what really IS a wonderfully-done classic fantasy story.If you like fantasy in any form, you have to buy this book. It's that good.Unfortunately, Green's other work suffers from the same problem that Frank Herbert has with \\"Dune\\"- \\"Blue Moon Rising\\" is such a good book that it overshadows most of his other work.Part of what makes \\"Blue Moon Rising\\" such a good read is that it's not just a sarcastic comedy, although it is that as well, Rupert is a very real character. He is both the ideal fantasy knight-in-shining-armor and the antihero at the same time. There's a lot of comedy, but be prepared to laugh at one page and then be quiet in a sort of awe at the haunted horror of the next page.Green is a master of blending both emotions into what is my favorite sci-fi/fantasy novel of all time- and I've read a lot of them."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Great book. (Four stars is a lot from me.) I see a lot of people looking for a sequel, evidently unaware of the Hawk &amp; Fisher books.

Sounds fun; I can't wait."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"I picked up this book years ago when it first came out and it instantly became my favorite. Simon Green did a beautiful job fleshing out the characters and story. Reading it makes you feel like you are part of the story.Everyone I have ever lent this book to has loved it as much as I do(all of us think it should be made into a TV show or miniseries...a 2hr movie just wouldn't do it justice). I still keep 3 copies of it on my bookshelf: one for me to read, one to lend out, and one to replace either of the previous when they wear out(and believe me, they do! I have purchased over 14 copies of this book over the years to replace the ones that have literally fallen apart from use). You might think about buying at least 2 copies for yourself!The story is wonderful! It follows the adventures of a second-son prince named Rupert as he tries to save his kingdom from poverty, his older brother, and the Dark Wood's evil master. His friends that he gathers through this tale range from a &quot;moody&quot; tomboy princess to a prissy dragon to a cowardly unicorn.Trust me, you will not get bored reading this book.

The kind sends Rupert off on a quest to slay a dragon. Rupert takes his friend, the Unicorn, and goes off to find a dragon, and a princess, but what do you do when the dragon needs to be saved from the princess? He knows he's supposed to slay a dragon, but the dragon proves to be a better friend than anyone else Rupert knows so he heads back to his kingdom with princess and dragon in tow. Rupert discovers that the Blue Moon is rising, and with it the Wild Magic is gaining power. The nearby Darkwood is spreading quickly and the kingdom must find some way to stop it before it's evil covers the kingdom and all is lost. The story is by turns humorous, touching, and serious. The Princess Julia is my new hero. She's bold, sarcastic, doesn't take anything from anyone, and knows her way around with a sword. No helpless maiden in distress here... Julia plays a major part in the ongoing battle against the wild magic. This book is an instant classic in my mind."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Blue Moon Rising by Simon R. Green is a fantasy novel set in a world of Mr. Green's creation. This is also a stand-alone novel so that allows the reader to jump right into this novel without having to have read any previous novels. This is the first book I have read by Mr. Green so I really went into this book with an open mind.The plot of this book is riddled with clich&eacute;s, I think this was done intentionally to play off those clich&eacute;s and almost build a story around them. The plot centers around the second son of the king, who since he is the second son doesn't really matter much at court. He is told to go kill a dragon, once he leaves the kingdom (hopefully to die says the king) a series of events that lead to somewhat interesting consequences. There is an undertone of a more serious event that may take place. This book seems to be written in sections, or acts if you will. I realize that other books are written in this manner, but it has rarely seemed this obvious to me. It almost feels as though his is a novel written with successive short stories. The overall plot of this book is passable, but nothing really that stands out to me.The characters of this book are again riddled with clich&eacute;s. From Rupert to the rescued princess to his noble mount (a unicorn none-the-less). To me when reading this book, almost every character seems one dimensional and flat. The characters did not do anything that made me connect with them, nor wanted me to connect with them. There re several times in this book where a character will launch into a two page (or more) diatribe on varying subjects. I don't mind a speech here or there, but some of them didn't seem to make much sense. The characters have a ton of potential, but the actual execution of those characters and tapping the potential falls flat.Some of the things I didn't really care for about this novel.I love humor in fantasy novels, when done correctly. It adds a different element to the story. Through the first 100 pages of this book the humor was entertaining. However, it seemed that after the 100 page mark, the humor was the only thing carrying the novel and it quickly becomes stale. The adage of too much of a good thing can ruin it, certainly applies here.I don't mind if an author intentionally writes a parody of sorts and uses time old clich&eacute;s, but some imagination and just better development of both plot and characters would have been beneficial.Also, I don't know if this is a Mr. Green tendency or not, but there seems to be too much description. Those large descriptions seemed to halt the story and made it become a plodding experience.I do believe that this could have been a good story, and the characters could have been solid and interesting. However, the end result was just bland and uninteresting. It's a shame, because I really wanted to like this book.For fantasy fans looking for a book that is riddled with clich&eacute;s and uninteresting characters that can kill a couple hours of boredom, I would hesitantly recommend this book. For all other fantasy fans, you may want to avoid this book as there are much more interesting novels out there to be discovered."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"It's because of books like this that people think Fantasy novels are for children and idiots.Limp characterization.

I read the first 100 pages and then started reading every 5 or 10 lines, then every other page, and then just gave up. The second-prince concept shows some promise at the beginning but the author just fails miserably in developing the characters. The book is filled with one-liners and silly slapstick moments that truncate the dialogue so it affords the characters absolutely no possibility of any conversation, reflection, or contemplation. As a result, the writing is choppy and the characters have somekind of a skeleton but no soul. One-liners can carry a story may be for 50 pages. After reading 100 pages of such silly dialogue, the book becomes nothing but a bore.The book also needs some serious editing. Typos and grammatical errors are ubiquitous. After reading such wonderful works as the Golden Compass, Eragon, and Poison, this book just does not make the cut.

When a boy is hit and bruised repeatedly by a girl he's pursuing, he backs off. He doesn't smile and go after her again.This writer knows flash, but he doesn't know people.

Then, I find myself close to tears during other scences between the two.Green also is the master of irony. For example,an old dragon that collects butterflies,a talking unicorn without a horn, an aggressive princess who wields a sword better than most guardsmen, an alcholic warlock, and last but not least,a second prince whom everyone wants dead and who rides a unicorn.

I also enjoyed the humor in the novel, which was very refreshing.The main characters of Rupert and Julia was very well drawn and I especially enjoyed the other characters such as Sir Champion and Prince Harald.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a different type of fantasy novel, with just as much excitement as others yet doesn't follow the same traditional storylines."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"I read this book over 20 years ago, after having read the entire Hawk and Fisher series. I have to say this book is great, both as prequel and as a stand alone story. It is an interesting take on prince rescuing the princess, quite diffrent than what would be normally be expected in such a story, and well worth your time. It has definitely stayed in my reread list over the years. I don't want to spoil the story, but Simon Green wrote an amazing cast of characters for this, and while a little violent for younger readers, it is a fast paced story that you won't want to put down. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"I'm very suprised this book has gotten so many positive reviews here on amazon. My first thought was: Theese reviews must be fake(paid for). But the amount of \\"amazon verified purchases\\" makes this hypothesis unlikely. More probable is that the reviewers lack experience of reading fantasy. At first I was thinking this books must be somekind of parody of \\"how not to write fantasy\\" - but then I realized the book was serious. The book contains all the known cliches available - and treats the reader very poorly (doesen't give room for reader imagination or deduktion). This book could be enjoyed by my 5 year old son. But a person much older than that would smell a rotten fish in there. Books like theese are reasons many poeple out there think the whole fantasy genre is just for young boys who want to be princes fighting dragons.I can't recommend this book to anyone - if not for educational purpuses at elementary school.Why do I give this kritic?- Dialogue is very simple and \\"un-intelligent\\".- The story could have been written by a 7 year old writing his first essay in school. A prince rides to the woods. Meets a dragon. Princess falls in love. And they live happily ever after. The book never explain any processes, just states \\"facts\\". The prince met the princess. 2 months later. They loved eachothers.- There is absolutely no excitment. No action that couldn't be \\"foretold\\"- Character depth? Nope, nothing of the sort.- I could continue this, but let me just state that this book will leave you very frustrated if you are used to fantasy authors like: Sanderson, Rothfuss, Martin, hobb, Weeks, Brett, abercrombie, Jordan, etc ..."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Blue Moon Rising starts out as a stereotypical knee slapping style story as it goes though everything the jacket mentions. There is a sarcastic unicorn, wise dragon, and feisty princess. Not to mention the dark woods and demons. After the first 100 pages though, the story completely changes. What you thought was going to be simple quest based fantasy becomes character driven, and thoroughly entertaining. We get intrigue at the castle and multiple traitors, as well as funny goblins and an angry princess. The story behind the south tower, the high warlock, and the champion are all interesting, and every character in this story is realistic and believable. Blue Moon Rising was setting up to be a great story for me until it started to drag at around page 350. The final big fight was a bit uninteresting to me and overly detailed, but that could be explained by my taste. I'm not a fan of 10 page long battle scenes. If you take the last battle out, then I'd give the novel 4 stars. Don't judge this book by the cover or jacket, it is more in depth and multidimensional than it seems. There is just the right amount of humor, drama, quests, and character development to make this a well balanced, well developed fantasy."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Simon Green's \\"Blue Moon Rising\\" is a very enjoyable book. The basic tale is classic high fantasy: champion must defeat enemy using powers that before the story takes place were nonexistent or dormant. The book has dragons, goblins, wizards, castles, and kings. It also has lots of political intrigue and humor. The last two ingredients don't always go well together, and at times they battle it out here and it's not clear which style is the winner.I will recommend this book to readers of high fantasy, and will buy the next in Green's series to see where the characters go."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"&quot;In those days, there were heroes and villains, and darkness walked the earth. There were dragons to be slain, captured princesses to be saved, and mighty deeds to be acomplished by knights in shining armor.Many tales are told of that time, tales of steadfast bravery and derring-do...This isn't one of them.&quot;A great book. Often hilarious, ocasionally heroic, definitely worth reading. Turns the whole Quest Fantasy genre on its head. Where else can you find an ill-tempered unicorn, a drunken warlock, a dragon who collects butterflies, and a princess who's better with a sword than the castle guards?!"},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"I love this book! the plot is so exciting and I love how Rupert is so brave. THE characters are especially great. THis story has humour, courage, and honesty in it. You gotta read this book!"},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"I've owned this book since I was in grade school. I actually had to re-purchase this book because I read my original copy so much the binding started failing and the pages began to fall out.I won't go into the plot, although I know it by heart, merely because so many other have described it so beautifully.Simon R. Green is by far, my favorite author who wrote a book that captured my imagination as a child, and still captures my imagination even today, even though I could probably recite the book near word-for-word by now.I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!"},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Overview:The story is a light (generally), fun (mostly) read that had some interesting elements. The story is not original, instead being a pastiche of hackneyed crap from other fantasy novels that has been rearranged and reworked into something cute, fun, and amusing. Fans of the Myth Saga of Aahz and Skeeve by Robert Aspirin should take note here. This is in a similar vein, albeit a little bit darker. Despite the darkness and the death and the doom and the gloom, it's a fairly light read, really.A. PlotThe plot of the book was really its driving force, even if it is not entirely new. This is not surprising; it is fantasy adventure, not literature. The second son of the king is sent (to die) to find a dragon and prove his worth. Instead, he comes back with the dragon and a princess, who was supposed to marry his older brother, until she was sacrificed to the dragon (who wanted nothing to do with her). He fails to die, so he is sent on another quest with the same goal. Surprisingly, he still doesn't die. Instead, he keeps being a nuisance, right up until the end of the book.The plot is well done, overall. The conflicts are a bit obvious at times, and nothing here treads new ground. The traitors in the castle are obvious, none of the plot twists are really twisty (although some obvious ones are left out). Despite this, I give it good marks. Why? Because this is fantasy. It's not supposed to be complex, deep, and full of pathos. Rather, it is supposed to be escapism, and it is that, pretty well, too. So, I give it full marks. Just not a lot of stars. The intentions were not high enough to justify any more, despite fully meeting all of the author's goals.B. CharactersThe characters in the book were fun and engaging. None of them are stereotypical characters, but they aren't so opposite as to be just as meaningless. For example, the dragon does not hoard wealth, but butterflies. He is not a philanthropist, though. He eats people, occasionally. The unicorn is not bravely charging into battle, nor is he cowardly avoiding it all the time. Instead, he bites down, is sardonic about it, and goes with Rupert. Similar things could be said about the other characters, but don't need to be. If you like fantasy, just read it instead of this.None of the characters really develop and grow in the book, though. They are pretty much the same at the end as they are at the beginning. But, on the other hand, this is just a fatasy novel. Having higher expectations for it puts it in the realm of literature, which this isn't.C. SettingSet in the Forest Kingdom (such an original name!), the settings include such typical fantasy fare as a castle, a forest, a tower, a dragon's cave, etc. There isn't anything really novel about the setting, other than a dark forest that is spreading its borders into the rest of the kingdom.D. ThemeDarkness! Angst! Despair! It's like an emo kid's diary. After a while, it gets a bit annoying.Treachery! Corruption! Betrayal! It's like a soap opera. After a while, it becomes tedious.E. Point of ViewThe point of view is entirely third person, limited omniscience. For the beginning of the story, we mainly follow Rupert in his quests. Not too long after, we are exposed to others as the center of attention, alternating between Rupert and Julia, with occasional forays into other characters mindsets. The perspectives are not problematic, but they are not novel, either, contributing little to the book.F. AestheticsThe aesthetics in the book are negligible. The descriptions are brief in general, despite others' reviews. The text is not overly flowery; the sentences are generally brief, although the chapters are quite long (almost 100 pages for some). Again, not causing enough problems to distract, but not enough to write home about.Conclusion:I would eagerly recommend this to people who enjoy fantasy. It has some depth in addition to the interesting characters. It isn't literature, but it wasn't intended to be. It is supposed to be good, light fun. And, for the most part, it is. There is some dark, angsty, badness, but it doesn't overwhelm the remainder of the fun.B+Harkius"},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"I have already gone through my 3rd copy of this book. I keep re-reading it as it just captures my imagination! The plot is fast paced, the heros are human with their flaws, and the villains keep coming! It is the best fantasy I have read in the last 10 years."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"I loved this book! Doesn't take itself too seriously, the characters are intelligent and witty. A nice blend of humor and fantasy, haven't read anything like and it's now one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Green has done it again! Few better known authors has his story-telling ability.I don't know any other author that has a book that can swing from clever satire to bloody action and court intrigue without missing a beat!The hero: Prince Rupert reminds me of another Green hero,Owen Deathstalker in that he a reluctant warrior who must rise to the occassion for honor and duty against overwhelming odds.This novel has it all: clever satire that spoofs cliches in fairy tales and fantasy novels with honorable goblins and friendly dragons and courageous moat monster.This novel also has terrifying scenes of battles against demons and monsters and some tense court intrigue.I loved the atmospheric darkwoods and I could fear the evil that dwelled there.Green knows how keep the suspense high and plot twists coming.I laughed at the witty banter and my heart was in my throat over the gruesome scenes of battles and escapes. Two thumbs up! What a ride!"},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"What a fabulous surprise this book was! With characters you really care for and come to love, this fairy tale is very funny, yet extremely scary. It's a fast-paced mix of action, horror, comedy and love story, and is done amazingly well. Effective writing and imagery allows you to &quot;see&quot; and &quot;hear&quot; the action. Cool.A great opening chapter ensures you'll keep on reading. The faithful but under-appreciated Prince Rupert is sent on a mission to slay a dragon and capture it's treasure hoard for the kingdom's treasury. Fighting danger along the way, Rupert comes across the Princess Julia (a very funny scene) from another kingdom. From this point on, you'll be hooked. Princess Julia is a riot. Tomboy-ish, feisty, brave, funny, irreverent, and sarcastic, you'll fall immediately in love with her, just like Rupert does.Also, Rupert's poignant relationship with his cowardly yet loyal unicorn is humorous and sometimes heart-wrenching. (I never knew a person had to be &quot;qualified&quot; to ride on a unicorn. Did you?) Funny thing: the unicorn's dialogue is tinged with a proper British articulation that caused me to hear actor Roddy McDowell's voice in my head whenever the unicorn spoke. Very effective writing.Dragons, magic swords, evil swords, a drunken warlock, demons, love triangles, a paradoxical castle (bigger on the inside than the outside), treacherous conspiracies, and a terrifying evil that threatens to consume the world, all combine to create a dazzling story which will transport you to another time and place. You'll be sorry when it all comes to an end and you're summoned back to earth.I've loaned this book to dozens of people. Every single person loved it and wanted to read the follow-up book. I've checked around for a sequel but, strangely enough, there isn't one. I guess either this book didn't sell enough copies to warrant one, or maybe Simon R. Green was too pre-occupied with his DeathStalker series and other books. The publisher may also not have realized what a gold mine they had on their hands here. Too bad. Follow-up books would have kept loyal readers happy, and their resulting word-of-mouth would have brought new readers to the series and, thus sold more books."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"I bought this book from Amazon on a whim, and I stayed up late nights just to finish it. &quot;Blue Moon Rising&quot; has humor and wit smushed together with a seriousness that few authors today can capture on a book's pages. I recommend this book to the readers out there who enjoy a good laugh, but aren't afraid to cry, too. I frequently write short stories, and I suppose that part of the reason I enjoyed his book as much as I did, is because he has a style, or rather, I have a style fairly similar to Simon Green's. If you read it, and find you don't like it, please e-mail me, and let me know why. I'm curious to know! Adieu."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"In BLUE MOON RISING, Simon Green masterfully challenges the stereotypes we see in so many fantasy novels, deftly weaving a story that is engaging and action packed without leaving the reader wondering why they bothered. Very little in this book happens as it should in what might be called a traditional fantasy novel. Still, Green weaves his tale so well that the reader is certain the story could not happen any other way. Unfair things happen to the hero, good things happen to the bad guy, and creatures usually found as good or bad in other fantasy worlds are really neither in Green's world.While BLUE MOON RISING simply cannot be classed with high fantasy novels such as those written by Tolkein, Jordan, Eddings, or perhaps Goodkind, I believe that if you appreciate these authors or solid fantasy authors like Elizabeth Moon (who wrote the Paksenarrion trilogy), you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Blue Moon Rising is a captivating, invigorating novel that will thrill the hearts of fantasy readers and even impress those fond of other genres. Its tongue-in-cheek wittiness keeps the reader smiling, while its action and adventure keeps the pages turning. This book is the first in a series of action-packed adventures. With a subtle humor echoed by such stories as The Princess Bride, a light-hearted fan will enjoy this as both a first book and a novel complete in itself."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Prince Rupert's father sends him off to kill a dragon, hoping that Rupert won't return, because as the second son, Rupert is just an unwanted challenger to his brother's place as heir to the throne. Rupert finds the dragon, befriends it, &quot;rescues&quot; the dragon from the rough and tumble Princess Julia, who is happy to clobber anyone who offends her twice. Rupert returns to the castle a changed man, just in time to battle the darkness that is threatening the whole kingdom. A great, rollicking read, with sharp dialogue exchanges and battles every third page. It admittedly took me a few chapters to get used to the dialogue, which incorporates some pretty modern idioms that felt a bit off key in a sword and sworcery novel, but in short order it was no longer a distraction. I also think that the ending contained a fairly substantial inconsistency, as I had been led to believe that by the darkest hour, nearly every human being in the kingdom was dead, but after good prevails, a startling number apparently survived. Oh, well, nothing's perfect. All in all, a great book."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"This is one of the most well-written and one of the most satisfying books I have ever read. Have you ever wondered what was really behind all those minstrels tales of vanquishing evil? Exactly how did they do it? Or a more important question, what did they lost along the way? If so, this book is definately for you. It has a refreshing viewpoint, is fast-paced, and has *real* characters. Even Harald has his good qualities and you want to hate him. If you're interested in fantasy or things slightly medievil, I definately urge you to read this book."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"i just couldn't put it down.

It starts out as your basic fairy tale; dashing princes, damsels in distress, dragons, and a heinous evil about to intrude on a peaceful kingdom. Except when you get about a paragraph into it, you discover that all is not as it seems: the prince is on a quest no one expects or wants him to live through, the princess has too much personality (boy, does she ever) to be considered either a damsel or in distress, the dragon is hilarious, and the kingdom is not quite so peaceful as anyone would like it to be. It's a book about people (and creatures) who don't really belong in the world they were born into (come to think of it, all of Simon Green's books are like that...hmmm); a totally unconventional fairy tale with dashes of reality thrown in, this book is something that you absolutely must read at least once in your lifetime."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Though Green's novel starts out as something of an&quot;untypical fairytale&quot;--feisty princess, friendly dragon, and all--it soon develops into a darker tale of demons and deceit, brightened by strands of humor. The characters are almost painfully human, from the aging King John to the always-second-best Prince Rupert and the drunken High Warlock. Though the switch in tone may be unsettling, Blue Moon Rising is an excellent tale."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"I've read over 200 fantasy novels and in my opinion &quot;Blue Moon Rising&quot; is one of the top five books in this genre. If you are thinking of building a Sci-Fi/Fantasy book collection, then this is a must have."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"I would have given this 4 and a half stars, if I could.A light, but excellent fantasy. It is fast paced, with lots of action, strong main characters, and lots of magic and wonder that you would want in a fantasy world. IMHO, it is possibly the best work of Simon Green's work.I was, however, a little disappointed with how &quot;human&quot; the other non-humans characters, like the dragon, unicorn and goblins were characterized. I guess I was expecting them to behave ... well, less like humans, and more like the different fantasy type creatues they were."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"It isn't very often that you get a fantasy writer who is able to write an engaging story but has the style to say something interesting about his genre at the same time. I have to say this is one of my favourite fantasy books of all time. The irony and sarcasm is mixed very effectively with the usual, expected plot elements in a fantasy story. It shows unusual depth and ingenuity in its characterisations, creating a world where there are no real heroes, and the people who look like they could actually rescue the world turn out to be ... somewhat less than expected. (Interesting twist to Tolkien's &quot;Dark Tower&quot; theme.) I would love to get a hold of this book ... I think I've read it about 5 times. What I like most, I think, is the way Green writes seriously for a while and then throws in something that completely knocks you out. (Rupert's meeting with the dragon is something else.) Just read it."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"This is not your typical fantasy novel. Simon R.

Green creates a world that makes the reader anxious to revisit time and time again. I just wish he would write more books in this series."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"This was a great novel for those into sword and sorcery. If you like it check out the, Hawk and Fisher series its just as good."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Blue Moon Rising seemed to have two very interesting facets. At first, it was funny, and silly - almost a little too much so. The first two chapters reminded me of \\"Shrek\\" - I was reading about a cowardly frightened unicorn and a dragon that collected butterflies. Then, the book took on a slightly darker tone. The adventures became more serious, more dangerous, and generally more descriptive. Although humor was intertwined with the rest of the action in the novel, it was no longer the focus point of the story.There isn't much about the book I didn't like. At first I was a little weary of the humor, and the tone of the beginning of the book, but as that tone changed, I started liking the book more and more. If there were one thing I could note as having \\"disliked\\", it would be the repetition. I can't remember the number of times something enveloped one of the characters \\"like an old familiar cloak\\", for example.The writing style was simple, and it worked well with the novel. It reminded me of the writing style used in Dragonlance novels. Simple, yet not child-like. Descriptive, yet not over-the-top.I would definitely recommend this book for those looking for a fun fantasy read, with an original, ironic and sarcastic twist not found in other fantasy novels."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"i drank down \\"blue moon rising\\" in about 2 months and i absolutley loved it.i think that if i had enough money to make a film out of any book it would most certainly be this one...i just dont understand exactly why this is not one of those all big and top selling books. i hope you enjoy it."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"I have to say that having just finished this novel I am quite stunned at the level of praise this book has received here. It is a fairly standard story at its heart - the inhabitants of the Forest Kingdom battle (and battle and battle) as they and their land are being engulfed by the Darkwood (your typical light against the dark, good versus evil shtick). The \\"light against the dark\\" theme is used quite regularly in the fantasy genre and is okay in the hands of a good story-teller who can put a twist of originality on the tale, but I don't think Simon Green achieves that here at all. In fact this story is just overstuffed with an unrelenting and forced melodrama. Also, for all of its gory demon-slaughtering the author chooses an otherwise incongruously light-hearted approach to the story. The dialogue is sappy and syrupy to the point of annoyance. I find it hard to believe that most sci-fantasy veterans would find it very rewarding."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"I purchased this book because other readers rated it very highly. Perhaps the raves it has received raised my expectations to an unreachable level, but I tried my best to give the book the benefit of the doubt.The characters have lots of potential, and the plot takes some interesting twists; hence the two stars instead of one. I like Mr. Green's light-hearted approach, but found the characters unconvincing. It's not uncommon for Rupert or King John to launch into a two-page long lecture on his motivation for doing something that reaches back to some vague childhood trauma. I find it hard to believe that the other characters would just stand there patiently without getting a word in edgewise. And Mr. Green uses some unique turns of phrase and amusing metaphors that make you chuckle at first and roll your eyes after the 10th time they're used.Every fighting scene goes like this: demons in the Darkwood, coming from everywhere at overwhelming odds. Exactly 50% of the nameless guardsmen die, and the main characters are badly injured. Some magic happens to heal the intrepid adventurers, who, exhausted, get one hour of sleep. Repeat.As for the magic, how many magic swords does it take to save the world? There are five in the book, four of which could each destroy the world with their evil (like, say, the One Ring), and the Rainbow Sword, which was created by Rupert and the Dragon. I don't want to put an any spoilers here, but let's just say that the heroes somehow use them for \\"good\\" with few ill effects.In all, I found the book full of inconsequential details and lacking in consequential ones, the characters' motivations unconvincing, and the finale disappointing. By the end I was laughing at all the wrong things and eagerly awaiting the end of the book so I could go read something else."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"This is what really happens when a prince is too good at his job and a princess is not fitting into the princess mold. They both want something other than what they have and/or are offered.Its about two teenagers/twentysomthings who find the one thing we all need. Belonging.It might sound sappy but the way its written is 'Errol Flynn' all the way through. Complete with backstabbing relatives and Boggles in the Bush. A delightful read.Great precourser to the 'Hawk &amp; Fisher' series."},{"Title":"Blue Moon Rising","review":"Blue Moon Rising is easily Simon Green's best work to date. His writing style flows and weaves depth of character to all the main protagonists. The story itself is rather unusual and has enough twists and turns to keep the story from becoming commonplace. I asked my girlfriend, who had NEVER read a fantasy book because she was simply not into the genre. She devoured the book, gave up sleep while reading it, and enjoyed it a great deal. The camaderie between Rupert, his horn, the guardsmen, the bonding with the Champion, the romance between Julia and Rupert, the antagonism between Rupert and his father and brother, the mysterious motives that drive Prince Harald, these all contribute and make the story. His characters come to life and are easy to believe, which I find a very important criteria in what I would consider a great book. Some people may find the book light, and they would be right in some aspects. There is a humor mixed in with the gritty action that is misleading to the central theme of the book. While being light in a humorous aspect, I found myself laughing out loud while reading parts of the book, but in other sections I was cheering on characters and empathizing others. All in all this book is in my top ten list of favorite books, and I found it much more enjoyable a read than other overly-hyped series, such as The Wheel of Time series or Dragonlance (which I found rather drab or trying to become too political).

She talks of the darkness in the room. Then they move out into the hall and outside, each step along the way she is pointing out what is in the darkness (the same things as were there when it was light). When they go outdoors they see both wild animals and farm animals and they see what they are doing in the dark.

The last page summarizes that all the animals are \\"safe and still and warm, deep in the dark and free from harm, in the dark of the midnight farm\\".The text does not say so but it is apparent that the little boy was afraid of the dark and that this is the mothers' creative way to show him what is happening in the dark and that \\"life goes on\\" in the dark and that everyone and everything is safe in the dark. The last image is of the boy sleeping in his bedroom alone while mother looks over him.The illustrations are beautiful. My children and I loved the rhyme and the repetitive nature, along with the counting up from one to ten.Despite the publisher's age range, I feel this is fine for two year old's."},{"Title":"The Midnight Farm","review":"This lovely story is so soft and lyrical, it is a joy to read and a pleasure to listen to. As night falls, a mother and child visit all of the animals on the farm, settling down for the night."},{"Title":"The Midnight Farm","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of Susan Jeffers, and she did not hold back here. AMAZING once again. The story line is so nice as well - something any child will cherish. And by child I mean a child of ANY age be it 4 or 67 or more, for there is a child that lies in the center of all of us that still needs a good book to hold on too."},{"Title":"The Midnight Farm","review":"I discovered this book when my now-adult sons were little, and am re-discovering it now with my young daughter. A beautifully simple story....mom and child take a walk around the farm at night, to see what the animals are doing (and to reassure the child that the world around him is \\"safe and still and full and warm.\\")The illustrations by Susan Jeffers are lovely, and the text is full of soft yet striking imagery (\\"two white cats have a leftover glove\\"...) A great bedtime read, especially for the child who may be nervous about the dark (which is most children at one time or another)!I find it especially poignant that the author wrote this book, considering that one of her siblings was abducted from the house at night and subsequently murdered when he was a toddler. I wondered whether writing this book was part of the author's personal healing from that event, as well as her own refutation of the \\"dark\\" and affirmation of a love which holds us safe and secure.With or without that bit of context, it is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Midnight Farm","review":"This is an enchanting book - I love it as much as my young grandchild. A nighttime adventure with a mom and her child as they explore the farm at night."},{"Title":"The Midnight Farm","review":"This book is weird. It tries to be a poem in some places, and in other places it doesn't. It's a book that teaches counting, so it's not really about a child afraid of anything. The mom walks around the farm with her son and counts the animals - the end.If you buy it, buy it for the pictures. They are beautifully done and so detailed. I just wish the story had revolved more around the little boy and less around counting random animals."},{"Title":"The Midnight Farm","review":"I am 30 year old, but still remember how I felt when this was read to me as a child.

The illustations are great and lend to the child imaging more about the story.As a mother of two and a preschool director for many years I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Midnight Farm","review":"THE MIDNIGHT FARM, which is inexplicably now out of print, is the best bedtime book ever written. With a sleepy, repetitive, poetic cadence, Reeve Lindberg not only gives a lesson about not being afraid of the dark, but also subtly includes 1-10 counting and 10 different kinds of animals. Susan Jeffers' illustrations are beautiful, encouraging the child (and the parent) to appreciate the warmth and beauty of the animals, safe and warm in the dark. I love GOOD NIGHT, MOON, but THE MIDNIGHT FARM is even better and richer, and I can't imagine why it's out of print."},{"Title":"Nantucket Impressions","review":"This guy must be a professional photographer. His other books on Nantucket are pure art, images that reflect the perfection of the time they were taken. There must be a good 500 plates in this book, and every one of them inspires a sense of peace.Chinese Landscape Paintingis fascinating stuff, and the author must be familiar with that tradition. This is fantastically good stuff."},{"Title":"Tom Swift and his airship, (His The Tom Swift series)","review":"This book was originally released in about 1910. The Airship is a kind of dirigible. Remember, this is before the Wright Brothers' flight. Old as these books are, they are full of thrilling adventures and most engaging characters. Huge numbers of these books were sold, partly because they are gripping and well done. In this book, Tom's souped up zepplin helps him and his friends to escape trumped up, false charges for a bank robbery-- actually committed by others. Tom also meets a sweetie girl-friend when his dirigible temporarily goes out of control and crashes into the roof of her school! The characters are a real treat! Fun, odd, colorful, and wonderfully drawn. Great gift for a young person. I believe this is a handsome facsimile of the 1910 edition."},{"Title":"Tom Swift and his airship, (His The Tom Swift series)","review":"I just finished this book this morning. I think the wonderful thing about this book is getting a perspective on people's views of technology in another time. One of my favorite glimpses was when Mr Sharp told Tom that someday these blimp-like airships would be everywhere. I think we have yet to see a mass market on blimps. Also, when the sherrif gets to ride in the Red Cloud, he wonders at the fact that he hadn't even ridden in a car before, and now he was riding in an airship. Imagine a sherrif who spent his life never driving or even riding a car. The other fun thing about this sort of book is the dialogue. I can't remember some of the better lines, but I smiled several times pondering the meaning of some old cliches, or tough fighting one-liners that no longer sound tough. Read it. You'll see."},{"Title":"Tom Swift and his airship, (His The Tom Swift series)","review":"As a child one of the first set of stories I read were The Black Stallion books. Fairly quickly I started working my way through Hardy Boy stories, and then started reading Science Fiction with the Tom Swift Jr. series. Tom Swift Jr. was a young scientist who had great adventures, like the Hardy Boys, but he had cool gadgets. In the first book Tom Swift Jr. builds a flying plane which had three levels, and carried a smaller plane and helicopter which could be launched out of the back of the big plane, while in flight.It was a decade or two later that I learned the reason he was called Tom Swift Jr. was because there were a set of stories about his father, Tom Swift Sr. The original Tom Swift books were written in the early 1900s. The first one was published in 1910 - Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle.A couple weeks ago I was at a friend's house and noticed that he had Tom Swift and HisAirship. I borrowed the book. Here Tom builds a cross between a balloon and an airplane. His Airship is made of aluminum and floats because of a special, secret gas. It has a race with an airplane and wins. I rolled my eyes a couple times while reading the book, but remembered this was written almost a hundred years ago.This book is more focused on adventure than the science. Like the Hardy Boys, Tom Swift solves a mystery. He is suspected of a bank robbery, but of course he is able to find the true criminals. Tom also fights the local town bully.While the Hardy Boys are timeless and read very well almost a hundred years later, this is clearly dated. The science is weak. The book has people still using horses and wagons. And one of the characters is treated in a way that we would not tolerate today. An older black man who helps Tom is uneducated and a bit of a comical figure. There are many glimpses into life in America a hundred years ago.I enjoyed reading the book. It is a quick ready. The story moves along; it is pleasant, but not great. It was fun to read about the father of Tom Swift Jr."},{"Title":"Tom Swift and his airship, (His The Tom Swift series)","review":"An absolute classic series. At about 100 years old, these novels are creative in their technical scope (the Wright Brothers were still testing gliders) and give an interesting review of the social mores of the time."},{"Title":"Tom Swift and his airship, (His The Tom Swift series)","review":"Wow, were these books ever popular. I was amazed at how boring and inactive this book was. Tom and some professor build an airship and fly the darned thing without even testing it. Surprise, it crashes.I imagined more than the stereotyped characters presented in these pages. Bad boys were bad. Good boys were good. Good girls were good . and everyone was a white,anglo saxon protestant.Somewhere along the line tom is accused of robbery with no evidence at all and the police are shooting at him in this airship.It is hard for me to believe these books were ever popular."},{"Title":"The Complete Vegetarian Handbook","review":"I've been a vegetarian for 20 years and was given this book as a gift.

Anyway, it is just as well because the product is pretty useless. I know some Tagalog and was hoping to improve on it with this method. I ended up throwing it away.The first 3 CDs are a 110-minute litany of English phrases and sentences with the Tagalog translation repeated twice after each one. Disk 4 is supposed to be a \\"Sessions Text Guide\\", but the one I bought is empty. The Tagalog pronunciation is contrived, and does not sound like the way real people talk in the Philippines. The main problem is that the list of English phrases was obviously made first without any regard to Philippine culture and to what people actually say in the Philippines. They list could have been made for use for any other language. Then someone translated the phrases in Tagalog, in many cases in an awkward way, sometime inaccurately, and often inconsistently. The result is that you don't hear the things that Filipino say every day, but some strange translation into Tagalog of what an English speaker would say. For example there are dozens of lines related to trains, train stations, platforms numbers, train tickets and train schedules, going on and on - there is hardly any train in the Philippines. One of the lines is \\"where is the subway station?\\" A subway in the Philippines, what a joke. Another one is \\"where is the Laundromat?\\" A laundromat in the Philippines? Ha ha ha!A good method would start a list of common Tagalog phrases and sentences, things that Filipino say every day, closely related to the culture and actual situations (for examples about buses, jeepneys and boats, not trains and subways!) and then translate in English. There should be a logical progression, each session building on the previous session.Anyway, enough said, this is useless, don't buy it."},{"Title":"The Substitute Guest","review":"The setting is a remote farm during a Christmas Eve blizzard.

Sister Midnight is the sequel to Reed's novel The Pleasure Chateau, the latter being one of the few erotic novels to combine the worst elements of Anne Rice's unreadable Sleeping Beauty books with those of the \\"naughty\\" novels of J. K. Huysmans. It took me about five pages of Sister Midnight to realize it was going to be more of the same, but I continued until I hit the fifty-page rule before tossing it to the dustbunnies. If you liked The Pleasure Chateau (poor soul that you are), you'll certainly find much to enjoy here; unimaginative, mechanical sex scenes broken by pages of pendulous pontification. What fun. (zero)"},{"Title":"Sister Midnight","review":"This short, odd novel is a work of imagination and poetry. There's no plot to speak of, more a series of juxtapositions (and other kinds of positions) and atmospherics. Contrary to what the cover says, the Marquis De Sade is very much alive in this book. He has discovered some occult sexual secret which keeps him alive. With his sister, Marciana, he enacts incestuous rites of sodomy intended to unite the Marquis with his tutelary female ideal, Laura. In the end, brother and sister are married, which Sade sees as the culmination of the work of three centuries. The castle the Marquis inhabits contains a basement that represents his own tortured subconscious. Much of the novel revolves around a similar use of atmosphere to expound on the Marquis' psychological state. Even the wine bottled on the estate contains the essence of eternal autumn midnight. The key contrast comes from the meeting of the House of Sade with another house which is similarly sealed from the outside world. At a great concert followed by an orgy, we are introduced to an alien &quot;posthuman&quot; named XZ. The conflict between this guru and the Marquis basically points out the conflict between Nature, represented by Sade in full Pan-ic, and technology represented by the trancsendental XZ. &quot;Sister Midnight&quot; is a difficult, sometimes disturbing book. Some of the metaphors, such as Sade's whip, are never fully fleshed out. One wonders why it was added at all. This, and other elements, lend an unnerving quality to the book. Whether that was the intent, or just an oversight is difficult to say. Either way, the book is not for senstitive readers. For those with a stronger psycholgy, however, &quot;Sister MIdnight&quot; is an odd but interesting work sure to make one think if nothing else."},{"Title":"Jacques Cousteau: Whales","review":"One of my most prized possessions is a personal letter from the late, great Jacques Yves Cousteau which is framed and hangs on the wall of my study. This is the man who brought the undersea world into the living rooms of so many people all over the world. Those television programmes first began in the 1950's and yet, even today, people talk about them as though they went out only yesterday.Not only did this man pioneer the invention and development of the Aqualung, he also pioneered the development of underwater photography. It was to be expected, therefore, that any book bearing his name would be the most complete and thorough account of the subject and that the photography would simply be the best. It is.Jacques Cousteau's Whales is a large coffee table book containing 280 pages of sheer value for money. The content includes Whaling in all it's bloody detail, a description of each species, their plight today, their migratory, mating and eating habits and much, much more besides. There are historic references throughout the book where appropriate. Numerous ancient and historic pictures and photographs appear alongside modern photography which detail every aspect of the Whale. As with all good photographs, many of the images speak volumes; Across pages 10 and 11, for example is a photograph of a few Seagulls above a sea turned bright red by Whaling.For many people, this will be the only book on the subject of Whales the will require and they will not be disappointed.NM"},{"Title":"Jacques Cousteau: Whales","review":"\\"Whales\\" is an oversized, coffee table book which conveys a great deal of information about its subject. The many pictures, both photographic and drawn, are used both to demonstrate the grandeur of these majestic mammals and as serving as visual aides in support of the text.This book covers whales from many perspectives. When a particular topic is addressed, the major whale species are covered sequentially. It tells about their anatomy, including their breathing, swimming and eating mechanisms. It tells about their diet and migrations. The history of human impressions of and interaction with whales, the place of whales in literature and the role of whaling are given much attention. Many quotes from Melville and other writers of the past support the text. Conservation and the need to ban whaling are major themes of this book.At first glance, one might be inclined to think that this book is just one with a lot of pictures and that it is, but it is much more besides. The reader is introduced to an informative and interesting textual treatment of whales. I read it in preparation for a whale watch and was very satisfied. I plan to keep it handy for future reference. Whether one is looking for a thorough introduction to whales or a nature book to leave on your coffee table, \\"Whales\\" by Jacques Cousteau is a good choice."},{"Title":"Jacques Cousteau: Whales","review":"This is an AMAZING book, and DEFINATELY a valuable collector's item if you are a whale fan!

This book, on the other hand, is a must for all masters and doctoral students who want to know the rudiments of chamical dependency and what it does to the brain. Don't get turned off by the book's presentation - it may seem juvenile at first but it is far from it. It is a good quick reference and a good companion to The Addiction Counselor's Desk Reference. I am using it for my master's course in chemical dependency and as a recommended read for my doctoral interns.

Others add that his mother was very possibly Lady Godiva!Kingsley's account (written in the 1800's) is a highly romantic tale at times leaning more on legend than rigorous history. As such, it is no doubt his most enjoyable and popular biography!SPOILERS BELOW!------------------------------------------------------------------------------Legends, and tales written later tell the story of how wealthy landowner Hereward grew alarmed that (English/Saxon) King Edward Confessor was in league with foreign Normans. He is said to have then joined and ultimately lead rebellions (both Danish and English) against that King which soon got him branded as an outlaw. Some historians believe that a legend of a fiery patriot resistance fighter now began to grow. Especially after Hareward was supposedly forced to flee into exile and so become the longed for future returning hero.But in any event, happily Edward was succeeded by a true Saxon hero King Harold. But before Hareward could return, the Norman William Conqueror had invaded and seized the crown.Now the historical record becomes more clear and well documented leading to Hareward's famous stand on Ely Island against William. And then he fades back into legends about what happened next."},{"Title":"To Educate the Human Potential","review":"The introduction explains that this book is meant to follow _Education for a New World_, and it \\"helps teachers envisage the child's needs after age six.\\" This book is part theory, part history, covering the psychology of the elementary-aged child, the history of life on Earth, and some highlights and principles of the development of civilization. This seems to be motivation and background material for the \\"great lessons\\" of the Cosmic Education as commonly used in elementary Montessori curricula. Those seeking an introduction to core Montessori theory, especially relevant to three- to six-year-olds, would be better off turning to _Education for a New World_, or the more demanding _The Absorbent Mind_.The first few chapters discuss the educational needs of six- to twelve-year-olds. According to Montessori, it is at the age of six that the child's principle educational need switches from absorption of environment to absorption of culture. A great emphasis is placed upon placing seeds of motivation and \\"wonder\\" in the child's mind, using a big, integrating picture of the world which is supposed to raise more questions than it answers, so that the child will desire to fill out his or her knowledge in later years.The child of this age thirsts for moral knowledge, but also for mental independence, claims Montessori, so moralizing lectures will not be accepted and should not be attempted. She also observes that children of this age have a strong impetus to organize themselves socially.An elementary program, it is advised, should not over-emphasize hands-on learning nor abstract subjects which require \\"imagination,\\" but should integrate both, since the personality is one and indivisible.A chapter is devoted to three psychological principles of the subconscious which are fundamental to the theory: (1) subconscious memory, the \\"mneme,\\" which is specific to and built into each species; (2) Bergson's \\"Elan Vitale,\\" or Horme, a vital urge which drives every living creature in every activity of its life; and (3) the Association of Ideas, the principle by which most methods of education conceive that certain ideas must follow and build upon certain others, but is now, Montessori claims, understood by psychologists to be only superficially true on the conscious level, though it does importantly apply to the operation of engrams in the subconscious. The chapter ends with a fascinating argument that a real love for humanity, for one's \\"neighbor,\\" cannot be based on preachy, patronizing sentiments of political or religious brotherhood, but only upon recognition of the productive toils of those countless individuals, living or dead, who have built and benefited our world.Several chapters tell the story of the world, its nature and history. Surely much of the science here is out of date. The theoretical point met again and again is that the planet and the lifeforms upon it are all interrelated as one whole, working in symphony, progressing upon the Cosmic Plan. This teleological, somewhat mystical theme seems out of place in Montessori's theory, given her otherwise tremendous dedication to a naturalistic worldview. One thing missing from her cosmological account here is what will eventually be the first \\"great lesson\\" in Montessori curricula -- I'm guessing Big Bang theory was not incorporated into the Cosmic Education at this point because it was not yet well known or accepted.At one point she mentions the huge chart of world history which is still used in Montessori elementary classes, saying: \\"[Children] see how brief has been the human span, compared with what went before it, yet how great has been its work!\\" Incidentally, this is the exact opposite of the interpretation of some current Montessori teachers, who hope that their students will perceive on the chart how small and unimportant humanity is.For a few chapters the story switches to human history, up to the Hellenic age. Dr. Montessori emphasizes that humans may have weak bodies, but also a \\"new cosmic energy\\" in their mental faculties, by which they have developed superiority in all things, and have become \\"God's chief agent on earth for creation.\\" She discusses human greatness at length: \\"[T]he history of human achievements is real, a living witness to the greatness of man, and the children can easily be brought to thrill to the knowledge that there are millions of people like themselves, striving mentally and physically to solve the problems of life, and that all contribute to a solution though [only] one may find it.\\"It is interesting, if not a contradiction, that although Dr. Montessori was a champion for peace, she here discusses the great value of ancient wars and conquests, which resulted \\"in added wealth of one kind or another to both conquered and the conqueror, and to the sum of human life in general.\\" The whole world is like an organism, with its own vital functions, interdependent organs, and teleological ends.On the one hand she appreciates the wisdom of certain religious language -- saying that the cosmic plan may be called the Will of God -- but she also describes the limits and divisive effects of religions: \\"Religions and languages keep men apart, while arts, sciences and products of industry unite them.\\" Eventually, she tells us, education will succeed and \\"religion then will not need to be taught, which it cannot really be, but reverence for truth, inner as well as outer, will grow in natural freedom....\\""},{"Title":"To Educate the Human Potential","review":"This is a great book, however after paying 65 dollars for it here, I found it direct from NAMTA for 12 dollars. very dissappointing."},{"Title":"SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF GENERAL INTELLIGENCE","review":"Arthur Jensen is one of the major contributors to differential psychology, and this tome honors him well.

It talks about his life at work and otherwise, from the point of view of one of the pillars of that magazine's early life, James Thurber. The writing is funny (of course), vivid and immediate. Together with Letters From the Editor and Genius in Disguise, it will bring you as close as it is possible to get to Ross, who was, in my humble opinion, one hell of a guy. A must-read for all editors, would-be or otherwise."},{"Title":"Years With Ross","review":"Thurber got into trouble with his friend and co-New Yorker stalwart E.B. White for writing this portrait of their boss and benefactor. Between them the three wrote most of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in its crucial first decades. These chapters, first written as a series of articles for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, are a model of the rich, primary source biography. Thurber pulls no punches. His Ross is not &quot;a monument&quot; as he puts it, but a man, worth looking at in all his strange glory. I would rate this book alongside Herndon's Life of Lincoln as one of the best accounts of a man by his contemporary, without the veneer of legend and without an undercurrent of envy. Thurber shared an office with Ross for who knows how many years, learned a lot about writing from him (some examples of his razor fine editing are here to learn from), and did a great deal of his best writing in the man's employ. One of Thurber's best books, and that makes it one of the best books there is. You could do worse than read this book before trying to write a life of anyone who's still living. You could do worse than reading this book before trying to write even one article about the life of somebody alive and real."},{"Title":"Years With Ross","review":"James Thurber was in his 60s when he wrote THE YEARS WITH ROSS. Harold Ross was the first editor of The New Yorker. He was a homely man, awkward in manner and speech. Ross couldn't write, but he was a fine editor. He lacked a good education and was sadly unaware of most social graces so he was often uncouth, but he created one of the USA's outstanding magazines. The New Yorker is a stalwart of literary sophistication.Thurber's study is not only an intriguing look at a real character of an editor but the story of how a magnificent magazine grew under the guidance of one of the truly talented editors of all time."},{"Title":"Years With Ross","review":"From 1927 to 1951, James Thurber, the humorist and cartoonist, worked under Harold Ross, the editor of The New Yorker.

Thurber tells us about Ross's devotion to the magazine-he was married \\"for keeps\\" to his magazine-and about his hairsplitting attention to detail. These good points seem to be heavily outweighed by his bad points. He quit school early. He wasn't much of a reader: his favorite magazine was True Detective and most of the American writers who are now studied (Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Faulkner) rarely or never appeared in his magazine. He didn't pay much attention to politics. He was a prude. And, as Thurber shows us, he was a poor administrator. He does not seem to be anything out of the ordinary. In fact, Ross often seems like a movie version of a harried editor with the gruff personality and tendency to \\"bark\\" orders, but with the heart of gold behind the exterior. He was the unsophisticated editor for the sophisticated.The secret of his success was the way he could inspire devotion, as exhibited by Thurber writing this book in the first place. The two men's live were bound together for over 20 years. We learn how Thurber met E.B. White five minutes before a meeting with Ross; how White helped Thurber publish his cartoons despite Ross's skepticism; how Ross helped keep Thurber going despite his growing blindness. And, despite the fact that Thurber often makes Ross look foolish, it's a loving portrait. Ross shown at his worst is still endearing.Because of this, it's probably not the best way to find the whole story about the magazine. In a way, it's just as much about Thurber as it is about Ross. That's not so bad, though.Thurber tells us a lot about the production of magazine and the writers and cartoonists who appeared there. As mentioned before, Ross didn't publish the big names of the time and because of that, most of the New Yorker contributors of his day are now forgotten. Anecdotes about them and a chapter about Ross's system of payment are the low points of the book.High points include a chapter about Ross and H.L. Mencken, Wolcott Gibb's guidelines for New Yorker style, and the chapter about Ross's friendship/feud with Alexander Woollcott. The story of Thurber's development as a cartoonist is interesting as well.The Years With Ross is similar to Mencken's memoir,Newspaper Days, in that it also is about the production of a periodical and about the lives of literary figures who aren't remembered today. However, where Mencken's style ranged from slightly acidic to vitriolic, Thurber's is gentle, even when he is poking fun. Here he describes Katherine White's visit to Alexander Woollcott: \\"He met her at the door clad as usual in pajama bottoms and dressing gown, and every now and then during his monologue that day his great bare belly would coyly appear and disappear, like a romping sea lion. \\"Thurber has a nice style and is an amusing writer. He is the sort of writer who more often provokes a chuckle in the back of a reader's throat than he does convulsive laughter.This isn't an indispensable American classic, but certain people will like it. Thurber's light humor can still amuse. And people who still believe in the magazine will want to read this book. Ross said that the New Yorker wanted \\"superior prose, funny drawings, and sound journalism, without propaganda.\\" Recently a book review in the Nation complained that a journalist's collection of articles taken from the New Yorker was handicapped by the \\"the flat-footed New Yorker style.\\" It was different in Ross's day."},{"Title":"Years With Ross","review":"I grew up with James Thurber on the shelf, his cartoons peopled my imagination from my earliest years and as reading skill grew, his stories (The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Life and Hard Times, etc.) comprised some of my first grown-up literature. Much later I discovered The New Yorker magazine, the acme of commercial journalism and cartoon art in which this author had once played such a central role. By the time I bumped into the magazine it was well into middle age, James Thurber was gone -- he died in 1961 -- and blindness had ended his drawing career ten years earlier. Prodded by a friend who is a great fan of this author, I have looked him up again in recent years and rediscovered the fresh wit and off-kilter humor of one of our best \\"casual\\" writers. (As he would label himself.) THE YEARS WITH ROSS is a biography of Harold W. Ross, the eccentric fanatic who founded and edited The New Yorker for twenty-six years (1925-51). Here is the story of how one dogged genius drew together the best editorial talent of an era and lured many of the best writers of the century to fashion his dream. Ross was capable of utter precision and befuddled oversight. His payment schedule for writers was not only the most niggardly in the magazine business, it was an arcane system of word count, add-ons, deductions, bonuses and penalties which left authors baffled. Meanwhile, Ross' personal secretary siphoned off seventy-one thousand dollars in the late 1930s without his notice. He could agonize for weeks over placement of a comma, dueling with an exalted staff which included the authority himself, E.B. White. Though I found this gem as a second-hand paperback which fell to pieces as I turned each page, I see that it and dozens of Thurber titles are in the local library system, and happily commend it to other New Yorker fans. For a taste of the best of casual writing, check out The Thurber Carnival and other collections from this prince of whimsy. (See also my review of Thurber's ALARMS AND DIVERSIONS, Harper & Brothers, 1957)"},{"Title":"Years With Ross","review":"James Thurber originally wrote this book as a series of magazine articles for the \\"Atlantic\\" in the late 1950s. (The copyright page states that the book was first published in 1957, but in the forward and elsewhere in the book Thurber mentions events taking place in 1958, so the book was presumably actually published in that year.) Thurber joined the staff of the \\"New Yorker\\" shortly after Harold Ross founded it in the late 1920s and worked closely with Ross until the time of Ross's death in 1951.Because each chapter began life as a magazine article, the narrative is a bit jumpy, which makes it a little hard to follow the development of the \\"New Yorker\\" or Ross's career as an editor. By and large, I found the book an enjoyable and an interesting account of Harold Ross's rather eccentric editorial style. It also provides a picture of a bygone era in magazine publishing and in the literary life of New York City. There is a fair amount of the patented Thurber humor, but the majority of the book is a more or less straight account of Ross and the magazine. Most of the anecdotes are interesting, some -- such as the account of Ross's final days -- are poignant, and a few -- such as the account of the dinner party with Ross and H. L. Mencken -- are clinkers. Thurber was near the end of his life, blind, and apparently suffering from a brain tumor when he wrote this book, which may explain the relatively sober tone compared with some of his fiction.It's probably worth mentioning that although I'm not an expert on this subject, my impression is that many people think that Thurber exaggerated Ross's eccentricities for effect. In any event, if you are a fan of the \\"New Yorker\\" or of James Thurber, you should find this book a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Years With Ross","review":"These are the recollections by James Thurber of the years he spent with the New Yorker's founder, Harold Ross (as you can tell from the title).

Just get it."},{"Title":"Years With Ross","review":"It's on old-school paperback, which I love. My wife is allergic to them, literally, because of dust, but I'm energized by them.

RSt.C"},{"Title":"A Colonel, A Flag, and a Dog","review":"For generations, the bronze, life-size figure of a dog on the 11th Pennsylvania Infantry monument at Gettysburg's Oak Ridge has captivated visitors to the Civil War Battlefield. Resting on a pedestal at the front of the monument but facing away from Doubleday Avenue and, instead, looking out over the fields where the regiment fought on July 1, 1863, the dog is easily overlooked by passersby. Those who walk around to the front of the monument are sometimes surprised to find her lying there, keeping watch. Who was she? And why was she given this costly and enduring tribute years after the battle? This book is her story and the story of the men she faithfully accompanied from the spring of 1861 to nearly the end of the war. Sallie was their mascot. To the soldiers who lay wounded on Oak Ridge after the first day's fighting at Gettysburg, she was their faithful protector, refusing to leave them behind. The soldiers never forgot her loyalty and bravery. This well told story is a detailed and engaging record of a regiment's service in the Civil War. It is also one of the most enduring human interest stories of the Battle of Gettysburg, one that will be enjoyed by anyone with an interest in the Civil War, historians, students, and dog-lovers alike."},{"Title":"A Colonel, A Flag, and a Dog","review":"This is a great story of Sallie, the mascot of the 11th PA Vol. Infantry. I am so sad to see it out of print now. I had given my previous copy to a descendant of the 11th Regt, at cost, thinking I could get another, and now find I had to resort to a used copy. Sallie is a favorite, of visitors to Gettysburg, and of the reenactors of the 11th PA, and of dog lovers everywhere.

It is certianly not brilliantly academic, but it attempts to take a broad view of religions from all over the world in all time periods. It tells stories about all of the major religions, without being critical of beliefs or giving too much credence to stories which require faith. Of interest to the casual scholar of religion, or someone who wants a different perspective on their or another faith."},{"Title":"How the Great Religions Began","review":"Like it or not statistics say that 96% of humanity consider themselves religious. A huge percentage of the subscribe to a handful of faiths, buddhism, confucianism, taoism, judaism, islam and christianity. If you would like to understand the mind of humanity, what drives it in so much of its day, I'm not sure you can do so without at least a basic understanding of the religions which they follow. If you would understand the world, you should read a book like this, in fact this one is pretty good even if Amazon doesn't have a picture for it, so perhaps read this one."},{"Title":"How the Great Religions Began","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to how great religions began.For Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Toaism, Confucianism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, this book details both the myths of beginning and the basic theological structure of each religion surveyed.For the \\"Readers'Digest\\" crowd, the book even starts each discussion with a one page precise describing in simple terms when the religion was founded, who founded it, what it major religious texts are and where adherents can be found.What it lacks in length it makes up for in force by its description of the natural similarities that exist between disparate faiths and therefore peoples.Excellent book!!!"},{"Title":"How the Great Religions Began","review":"this is a great book for everyone to read -- it shows there are more than one religion in this world"},{"Title":"Pigeons From Hell","review":"I've been hunting for this book sine it was released in 1988, and I was recently lucky enough to acquire a signed edition of the hardcover. All I can say is that it was worth both the wait and the search.Pigeons From Hell is adapted from the classic Robert E. Howard short story by artist Scott Hampton. The story is a pretty straightforward southern-gothic ghost tale, with a little gore thrown in for good measure. Howard's prose is some of his best, and Hampton's art is breathtaking. His dark, moody paintings evoke a sense of isolation and terror that had me totally drawn into the story. I couldn't stop reading. The book also contains a foreward by noted horror author Ramsey Campbell. Highly recommended for horror fans!"},{"Title":"Pigeons From Hell","review":"Printed in June, 1976, Pigeons From Hell is in excellent condition. I intend to continue to preserve it. Actually, the story Pigeons From Hell is but one story amidst a set of Robert E. Howard short stories. My interest was in tracking down the original novel which inspired what most critics seem to maintain as the greatest installment among the 67 Thriller TV show (1960-62) episodes. The purchase was economical, of the highest quality and punctual."},{"Title":"Pigeons From Hell","review":"This short story is written in Robert E. Howard's very distintive tight -- yet vividly descriptive -- prose. The influence of Howard's friend and fellow writer H.P. Lovecraft is certainly present; but this is not a mere pastiche or imitation of Lovecraft's work.This is a &#34;weird tale&#34; produced within Howard's native southern mileu. It's a dark story of madness, murder, and voodoo. It's also infused with Howard's southern fascination with the tense and frequently conflicted relations between blacks and whites in the early 20th century American south.Anyone who appreciates Howard's writing will surely enjoy this story. Fans of the work's of H.P. Lovecraft, Rice Burroughs, or E.A. Poe, will likey enjoy reading this story as well."},{"Title":"Pigeons From Hell","review":"Don't be put off by the somewhat bizarre title: Pigeons From Hell is a terrifying tale that is spun from the stuff of nightmares! Robert Howard, better known for his sword and sorcery tales featuring Conan the Barbarian, King Kull, Solomon Kane and the like, did write the occasional horror story, and for that matter many of his fantasy stories have a strong element of horror as well. But for conjuring sheer literary terror, I think Pigeons From Hell is Howard's finest tale of dark fiction, rivalled only by his better-known masterpiece Worms of the Earth. The setting is masterfully realized, and the eerie tone just right. Better still, despite the blood-curdling subject matter, Howard proves a horror story doesn't have to be chock full of either profanity or gore in order to terrify. If you haven't read this outstanding short novel, you are missing out on one of the very best horror stories written in any era."},{"Title":"Pigeons From Hell","review":"If you're a fan of Scott Hampton's artwork as I am, then you'll be glad to purchase this book. If you're also a Robert E. Howard fan, then what are you waiting for? Superb, fully painted renderings are Scott's forte - combine this with some amazing gothic horror and you've got one fine package."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Perhaps the worst book I have ever read. It is a blasphemy that it ever was published. Its only function is to keep blinkered academics busy trying to wring another drop of meaning from a text already exhausted from analysis.A brief glance through it is enough to confirm that it is precisely the novel you would write if you wanted to become a celebrated author but hated writing, hated readers, and wanted to punish academics. This monstrosity of hideous prose confirms that Joyce had no style and certainly no class. The novel can rightly be blamed for being the originator of the misguided notion that the squalor-and-filth quotient of a story is directly proportional to its artistic merit.The very least one might ask of a book is that it be readable. With this is mind, Ulysses, ludicrously canonised as the greatest of all novels, is a failure in the most fundamental respect. It is the only book I can think of where the reader deserves more credit for finishing it than the author. In the words of a *real* writer (H. L. Mencken): it is rumble and dumble, it is flap and doodle, it is balder and dash."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"From the first \\"Stately,\\" with the first letter taking up the first page, to the last \\"S,\\" capping off SPOILER ALERT the word \\"Yes\\" in Molly's monologue, this is a masterpiece that is worth the price of admission. Joyce's words don't fit a standard narrative, but they are worth the time to puzzle and marvel over. Its fine if you put it aside and dip back in from time-to-time. There's no rush. He took eight years to write this book, and traipsed all over Europe re-imagining the Irish soul -- forged in the smithy of his soul for the thousandth time the uncreated conscious of his race. This is it, just ignore the next book; Joyce peaked here."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"We're approaching the 100th anniversary of the action in Ulysses and I've taken my copy out and began to reread it. No other book I know of has more power to inspire or instill creative thought. His symbolism and skill is simply astounding. Anthony Burgess once said that many times he'd think of Ulysses and then think about his own work, &quot;Why bother?&quot; I know what he meant, but the power of the characters and style gives everday writers like myself something to strive for. This book is worth more than ten creative writing courses in the Ivy League. Even if I wanted to, I could never forget it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I haven't finnished it, i pulled it off the lbrary shelf to look at page one a couple of days ago, and now a couple of hundred pages on feel compelled to write a review.

Usually after about a hundred pages I can sort of get the &quot;gist&quot; of a document, and I will admit to not having a degree in literature or Irish studies. From all the praise, I am wondering if I have a defect in my brain. But I will admit, I don't get it. If this is supposed to be some mental time capsule, a masterful expose of stream-of-consciousness, then fine. Must be an acquired taste. Back to the Archie comic books I guess."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is nothing intellectually challenging about this book. Instead, it is a cruel insult to the intelligence of any thinking person who tries to read it. Even the people who don't &quot;get it,&quot; and feel compelled to give this miserable piece of trash 5-star ratings let some of its true character seep through.In the 5-star reviews alone, we see: &quot;my head aches after reading it,&quot; &quot;one will never be able to understand,&quot; &quot;a vast, complex book about nothing,&quot; &quot;when I finished Ulysses, I felt an emptyness,&quot; &quot;meaning that vanishes in the distance of one's ability to comprehend it,&quot; &quot;Ulysses is not Ulysses,&quot; &quot;sometimes the narrative line just seems to dissapear.&quot;Anyone with respect for themselves should skip this &quot;book about nothing&quot; and find a book about _something_ instead."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The only real reason to tackle the massive burden of Ulysses is to become aware of the stark reality that it expresses regarding the \\"spirit of the age\\", essentially a rampant nihilism. Then one can possibly adjust one's outlook on the current world society and proceed accordingly, perhaps avoiding being a lemming going over the cliff.Before entering the cavern of this work, one has to decide the \\"why\\" as above, then the \\"how\\". For me, after much diddling, false starts and self deceptions, this excellent CD set became the obvious answer. I had heard the comments of people far more intelligent than I on how difficult the work was to plow through. Therefore, I would have even more difficulty than they if I chose to continue reading it (a false start at reading the 735 page tome got almost nowhere). Also, I would be displaying a gracious nature in accepting the much-touted idea that \\"Joyce's prose must be HEARD to be truly appreciated\\".The production here is an excellent way to expose oneself in a leisurely manner to the book's wily trap without becoming totally enmeshed. The trap is simply that one thinks the work is \\"going to say something\\", but the fact remains that it really says nothing, albeit in a brilliant way.One can be tired but still listen to part of a CD, repeat passages at will, turn it off, reflect, then continue. It is MUCH harder to read this work than to listen to it. The CD set also contains very valuable and detailed notes about each section as well as overall enlightening critical information, and relevant musical selections are also present throughout.If one is truly serious about attacking this work, I would recommend the sort of \\"Joyce for Dummies\\" approach that I followed: purchase the DVD of the film version of Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (although the film doesn't boast a very good screenplay and is unrestored, the performances are excellent), as well as the CD audio book of the same title (abridged, but all the important parts are there). Absorbing these will give you a central clue about Ulysses, mostly in the Stephen Dedalus character that appears in both (hint: Stephen is a boring, cold, emotionless prig). Then purchase the DVD of the 1967 film version of Ulysses (excellent photography in a pristine black and white print). Although set in 1967, it will give you a reasonably OK overview of the \\"story\\" of Ulysses which is set in 1904.Having taken in these, you are almost ready to proceed to the CD set of Ulysses, and you can already rightly claim to have listened to the prose of Joyce, definitely a feather in your cap at certain parties (where you may also want to rhyme off a few memorized lines in the appropriate accent).Avoid the millions of words contained in endless musings about the book, and read only one essay, that of Carl Jung entitled Ulysses in the book The Spirit in Man, Art, and Literature. If read carefully and more than once before listening to the Ulysses CD set, you'll find that it does indeed contain the golden key to truly understanding the nature of this massively influential book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As a devout modernist, I put off the pleasure of reading this book for years. I wanted to have the time and leisure to give it proper attention. I had taken a seminar with Anthony Burgess on ULYSSES at CCNY in the early seventies. We did a close reading of the Nighttown chapter and were supposed to read the rest of the novel on our own. I never did. But Burgess' enthusiasm was impressive and though I wasn't entirely convinced, I was certainly intrigued. In earlier years I had read DUBLINERS and PORTRAIT and even some of FINNEGANS WAKE and was especially impressed by Joyce's mastery of language and the poetic quality of his prose.An early retirement offer finally had me reading the \\"GREATEST NOVEL OF THE 20th CENTURY\\" last month in Riverside Park. Some nice cigars added to the mix.The first few chapters were stunning. The powers of description, the playfulness and musicality of language, the wit and intelligence of Stephen and Buck were a delight. I was obviously in the hands of a master. Shakespeare even came to mind.But then something happened. The humanity and poetry seemed to drain out of the thing as we were treated to yet another chapter of theoretical \\"experimentation in narrative technique\\". The idea of writing a novel, each chapter of which is written in a parodistic or borrowed style seems to me a doomed one (and more postmodernist than modernist). Apparently even Ezra Pound objected. I found myself asking, \\"Couldn't Joyce have found his own voice and style to narrate this section?\\" An entire narrative chapter in the question and answer form of a Catholic Catechism seems affected at first. After thirty pages it is deadly and even embarrassing. And then another in the style of a men's sporting magazine, and then another in the style of a women's magazine? What's the point (other than showing off)? And the Freudian/Surrealist kitsch of the endless Nighttown chapter was downright infantile. Talk about dated! This is novel writing from the outside in. First you have an \\"experimental\\" concept and then you fit in some narrative stuff. It's no wonder academics use this book as major fodder. It seems to be written with them in mind.Likewise the useless tie ins with Homer's ODYSSEY. One can't help thinking of them as a desperate attempt to add structure, incident and theme to a book fairly bereft of them. Not to mention adding a bit of literary pedigree to offset the \\"obscenity\\".Which brings me to my main point. The fancy smorgasbord of styles cannot disguise the fact that as a novel, ULYSSES is sorely lacking. Involving narrative, depth and development of characterization , thematic focus, depth of feeling etc. seem totally absent. Basically what we have here is a brief Balzacian \\"realist\\" sketch, padded out and styled-up beyond belief.Now this is really a minority opinion: not only is ULYSSES a failure, but the reason I think it is a failure is that it is a transitional work. Joyce was obviously bored with novelistic narrative but still felt obliged to accommodate. With FINNEGANS WAKE, he hit stride and finally found his m&eacute;tier - a book as a place to play with language and psyche for his own pleasure, without regard for traditional novelistics.A NOTE ON EDITIONS: The huge academic controversy about which edition of ULYSSES is \\"authentic\\" or \\"correct\\" is, as one might expect, much ado about very little. Serious textual issues are minimal. Most of the typos in the 1922 edition were corrected in 1960/1 by the editors of the Modern Library in consultation with Richard Ellmann. That text was also used for the Bodley Head and current Everyman editions. Gabler later went overboard, making some highly questionable decisions. His edition is also difficult to read due to small print, layout, line-numbering etc. Danis Rose's edition went even further and \\"corrected\\" Joyce's compound words etc. - a disgrace.I ended up reading an online version edited by Jorn Barger - a very sensible amalgam of the best work of previous editors. It took some time and expense to print out, but it was definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Who published this?

James Joyce's prose and imagery are breathtaking, and I begin to understand his influence over those writers lucky enough to read him in their youth.However, at the risk of revealing myself as a crotchety old lady, I confess I gave up about a third of the way through the book.

But it wasn't until college that I was able to read this book and make sense of it (spent a whole semester doing so in a course by a superb professor).But let's get back to the novel. Told a single day, the tale of Leopold Bloom is one that was unprecedented in its time. So much flap followed this book's publication in Europe that it took a ruling from our supreme court here in the states to allow the publication of Ulysses in America. The story, by Joyce's own admission, is modeled after Homer's Odyssey. Joyce himself admitted to, and I paraphrase here, including so many \\"enigmas and puzzles\\" he would keep scholars busy for years and solidify his own immortality. So much for being a humble writer. Of course, one might argue that no writer, by the very act of writing, can exercise humility.Ulysses, since it was first serialized in a mag back in 1922, has always been more about people celebrating Joyce's supposed genius rather than about the book itself. It is, for the most part, a very poorly written book with prose, when the author is busy playing the old \\"look at how clever I am with wordcraft\\" game, is rather dull and empty.Considered the modernist book of the ages, I recommend reading it first in a structured environment like a college classroom; even if you have to audit the class (maybe you can find a Joyce class at your local college). And if you can't do that it's best to hunker down withUlysses Annotated: Notes for James Joyce's Ulysses [Revised and Expanded Edition] otherwise you might get lost like I did.With that said, if you are looking for a beautifully written, compelling story I would look elsewhere.

As a student, you have to read it(like Shakespeare of course - but he's slightly better). And every book that you HAVE to read is already suspicious. Why is it a 'must'? Because if you would not be forced, you wouldn't read it?So true because this is a waste of space. How wonderful such space can be used, other longer books like 'The Lord of the Rings', 'Dune' or 'Catch-22' prove. They aim for entertainment, for fun, for joy in reading and all the same, they deliver perfect writing and characterisation. Now what is wrong with entertainment? Nothing! Even the bible wants to entertain - but Joyce is of course above such unnoble things like 'fun' or 'entertainment'. He's into style. And that's what he delivers:Dry, boring and self-satisfied style. He might be a good writer but he should have used 'Ulysses' as a starting point, as a construct in which he could fill a story. There are passages where his style is fantastic - short, journalistic style, the one I always use, the one I like. But these are LINES in a book of hundreds of pages... now if that is not a waste, I don't know what is."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I challenge any so-called critic to read Ulysses out loud, in an auditorum full of listeners and explain, page by page, without notes or the extensive annotations available, just what each and every sentence and word means.

The fact that JJ state, in writing, that he had loaded up his novel with so much foreign words, obtuse references and effermeral meanings to keep academics busy for years say it all. The fact that he had to provide a schema to his closest readers also says volumes. And HE CHANGED that schema more than once. So, obviously JJ himself didn't understand what he meant! Nice book for literature students and prof.s to OOO and AAAH about, but the fact is it is boring to the nth degree and simply not up or even close to anything by Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky or any number of other competent writers. Some time in the future it will become one of the least read novels of all time...perhaps then folks will start to take a more realistic view of what JJ really achieved."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"You can't understand this book without a study guide. That fact alone should be enough to scare you away. One reviewer asks why a reader should have to work so hard to understand a novel and it is a good question, in my opinion. I think that a work of art which is not self-explanatory but which demands an additional volume and commentators in order to comprehend it is a failure. I heard one professor suggest that we should all take three years out of our lives to go through this book and to appreciate it fully. Yeah, right. I have never been too keen about anyone who thinks they know what I &quot;should&quot; do with my life. There are far too many other great and rewarding pleasures available to me in my life which are more easily accessible for me to waste my time deciphering what looks like the work of a schizophrenic. The modernist conceit is that Joyce and other non-linear novelists have captured the actual mental processes of man's daily life. Perhaps if you need medication and are plagued by mania, yes. My mental processes are not a mad jumble and I do not see how anyone with a professional occupation could function if this were true. It simply isn't so. There is a famous sex scene in this book where the mental thoughts of the individual coming to climax fills many pages. I asked around and no one I know thinks about anything while climaxing except for a sexual fantasy. Totally unrealistic."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Woolf was right. Joyce was obsessed with being, hm, obscure. I have read every book he wrote (not that many) and studied him at length. It has not helped. I cannot admire anyone who thinks we should have to work so hard to figure out what he was talking about. Normal people can't enjoy Joyce and I think this is a travesty. For all the hard work I had to do to figure out what he was talking about, I did not get one moment's enjoyment. Down with pretentious male modernists who feel we should all spend our lives &quot;working&quot; to unveil the &quot;true meaning&quot; in their words. For all you Joyceans out there who like to mock the &quot;commoners&quot; for not &quot;getting&quot; Joyce, I am working on a PhD in English--and I &quot;get&quot; him just fine, thank you. And I nonetheless refuse to give in to the pressure to like him. Brilliant as he may have been, he was full of himself. In my mind, these two qualities alone (brilliance and arrogance) should not get anyone's novels on the must-read lists."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Wow. I didn't make it too far into this one.

At the moment I don't find it nessesary to read it any furder.But here are the conclussions I have made.Why this book is interresting:-The stream of consience idea is great, really. I love it.-I also love the idea that he descided to write about some of the things no sensibele writter would have ever written about. Like how Bloom went to the toilet or mastrubated.Why this book is a load of crap:-Way to long (I have nothing against long books and I have read quite a lot of books and I love Homer, Dante, Shakespear, Milton, Orwell, Huxley, Poe, Bulgakov, Plato, Swift, Nietzsche, Dickens, Asimov and many more so I do know a bit about litterature) this book should have ended whit the third chapter.-It lacks a plot. I am not saying that there has to be a overlingly complicated story behind it but it should have some directionlines.-The languege. Joyce seems to want to point out the whole time how good he knows English and that is very irretating.-It has no real meaning. I know that people have looked for one but all they have come up whit where some things like it is an epic of the body (well describing how someone goes to the toilet could hardly be discrived as epic. The also spoke about the complex intriging monologs and the praise of the mind (well the just say a lot of things and never seem to be able to think in a straigt line for longer than 3 min. And finally the the so cold new light that Joyce shines on myths. The mostly bring up Odysseus whit this one. Well people seek for Odysseus in this book because Joyce told them to do so.-Almost anybody could have written this book.I would also like to point out that when it was released all the people who love this book now (writters and proffesors) hatted this book. If it had never ben forbidden it would have just been forgotten like it perhaps should.I would like also to say that I didn't stopt reading tis book because it was to difficult but because it was borring. For after all I have read Paradise lost in the orriginal and I do find it difficulter to read that this one.Perhaps it is just so difficult to read because it is borring has anyone thought about that?(Excuse me for my English.)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How could a book like Ulysses ever have made it to print? The grammar is so disjointed as to make it nearly impossible to read. Additionally, the point-of-view and writing style change in nearly every chapter after the sixth.

The book is well over 600 pages long, but the events in the story appear to take place over the course of just a single day.I have heard numerous people praise this book, but that would seem to be largely posturing because the story is lost under the weight of inadequate editing."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"ULYSSES is so boring and ridiculous in its pedantism!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This was a good book, one that took quire some time to read. Not one I couldn't put down, but one I knew I had to finished.If you want to another read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is one of those books that \\"smart\\" people like to \\"read.\\" Well if being smart means liking this, count me out!

It was the most painful reading experience of my life.Like many readers I was sucked in by the \\"Modern Library Top 100\\" list of which Ulysses is number 1. After getting about half way through this book, I realized that many of the so called \\"Top 100\\" were probably more important than they were, well, good. Ulysses has several passages of graphic sexual description and discussion of infidelity during a few of the author's more lucid moments which surely made it edgy for 1922. The Modern Library must have overlooked the long and frequent passages of rambling lists and nonsence that makes one seriously question if the author was getting paid by the word and needed to pay his rent. I was not surprised to find out that Ulysses was initially a serialization and Joyce was actually getting paid by the word!You can read some of this online, but I don't recommend reading it in any form.

The language is onomatapaeic in so many places and reading it out loud or, in this case, hearing it, is often the missing element you need to receive the picture Joyce is creating.

I am particularly concerned by the number of people who gave the book a poor review after admitting that that hadn't bothered reading past the first few pages. There's an adage in criticism that goes something like \\"Just because it's popular doesn't mean it's good\\" (AMEN to that)...a corallary could be \\"Just because it's difficult doesn't mean it's a 'literary hoax.\\"Yes, as hard as it may be to believe in some circles, ULYSSES is not a hoax. It is, however, difficult, and not, I repeat NOT for everyone. The stream-of-consciousness, the language(s), the style(s), and the fact that Joyce brought in all sorts of obscure references make it just plain difficult sometimes.The travels of Leopold Bloom about Dublin on that fateful day of June 16, 1904, can be, for the right individual, a difficult, fun journey. What brings fans of this work, like myself, back to it again and again, is the fact that each time we read it we discover something we missed (or misunderstood) the last time (or last 10 times) around.With a little work on the reader's part, ULYSSES can be finished. Many of us have actually made it to the end, scratched our head, and started again a few weeks later (after full recovery).Give it a shot, and if it's not for you, don't even bother moving onto FINNEGANS WAKE...you won't make it past the third line!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"\\"Ulysses\\" is a deeply flawed work of genius that richly deserves both the bouquets and the brickbats that critics have hurled at it over the years. It is by turns a desperate struggle to free writing from the literary straightjacket of convention, and an unctuous exercise in literary hubris. It is one of the most definitive products of the modernist movement then in vogue and shares the inconsistency, contradiction and schizophrenia that plagues that movement, constituting a rejection of bourgeois conformity on the one hand while on the other yielding accessibility only to a literary elite.\\"Ulysses\\" is many things: a literary experiment in variety and anti-style (different chapters are written in entirely different voices and forms); a rejection of Victorian conformity; a protest against method, structure and classicism; an attempt to transcend conscious boundaries; and not least, a gross and orgiastic display of literary exhibitionism.There were few contemporary works that dared to take the modernist movement to such extremes. Faulkner wrote similar stream-of-consciousness works but ultimately anchored his writings to a foundation of literary convention that allowed ordinary readers to understand him. Joyce, while ostensibly writing ABOUT ordinary people, never wrote FOR them. He was the ultimate literary snob who, by this time, had grown so infatuated with obfuscation that he would follow up \\"Ulysses\\" with the utterly impenetrable \\"Finnegan's Wake\\".There is something hypocritical about such an outlook: to extol the typical Irishman in writing that no typical Irishman could ever hope to understand; to reject not just established convention, but any appreciable sense of system at all; to push 'writing' entirely beyond the bounds of 'communication'.What saves \\"Ulysses\\" is that, with this work at least, Joyce does not yet go entirely over to the dark side. He goes right to the edge, but only playfully puts one foot over. Despite its calculated obscurity, its see-how-brilliant-I-am experimentation, its auteur elitism, he doesn't quite abandon content for form. This would be the last work in which he holds on to reality, and his decision to anchor his work in at least SOME recognizable conventions allows us to see where he is trying to go.This is a book that is far more important than it is either enjoyable or even readable. Its status as a \\"masterpiece\\" is problematic and misleading: since this honorific is earned if the work is judged by its incomparable technique and sheer audacity--but is undeserved if judged by its respect for the common man. This is a book written for literary highbrows--at times, one almost suspects that it was written solely for Joyce himself--and no one should feel obliged to wade through a morass of such literary contrivance. Those who do, however, can expect to glean many moments of brilliant revelation out of long stretches of teeth grinding frustration."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is, without a doubt, the greatest novel of the twentieth century. Although many great books have been written before and after its publication, nothing has equaled it, or even come close. It is, without a doubt, a true and lasting work of art.Ulysses is an immensely detailed, perfectly-crafted, often sordid account of the wanderings of certain Dubliners around their city on 16 June 1904, principally, Leopold Bloom, outwardly a Hungarian Jewish proprietor of a small business, but inwardly, a sensuous rags and tatters Hamlet, a man who has lost both his religion and his name; his adulterous wife, Molly; and Stephen Dadelus, a clever but pretentious young teacher, Joyce's alter ego. Joyce labored for years on Ulysses, amassing and checking facts and then, with a genius that has never been matched, drawing them all into various symbolic patterns that mirror the wanderings and ordeals of Homer's Odysseus, Joyce's own hero.In one episode, narrated by an anonymous Dubliner, Bloom enters a pub and politely declines a drink offered to him by a Nationalist, accepting a cigar instead. Despite numerous attempts to change the subject, the Nationalist rages on and on, grumbling about foreigners and strangers. Bloom eventually gets fed up; he defends himself and his race, jabbing his cigar for emphasis as he speaks. Eventually, though, Bloom is accused of true treachery against the Irish race--not standing everyone a drink when he is thought to have successfully backed an outsider in the Gold Cup horse race. The Nationalist explodes and throws a biscuit tin at Bloom as he quickly retreats.In Ulysses, this scene is funny, but it is also so much more. The Nationalist is the one-eyed giant Cyclops from whom Ulysses escaped by jabbing his eye with a burning stake. The tunnel vision and terrorism that are but a small part of the Irish race are fought by Ulysses/Bloom as he jabs his cigar at his tormentor. &quot;But it's no use,&quot; Bloom says. &quot;Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life...Love.&quot;There are ironic devices used in Ulysses other than the Homeric one, including the one used so strikingly by Joyce in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (in which we were introduced to the character of Stephen Dadelus), matching the style of the narrative to the person occupying the foreground. As a Modernist, Joyce wanted this stylistic device to be &quot;visible&quot; rather than &quot;invisible;&quot; he wanted readers to develop an awareness of his technique, to identify, not only with the story but with the way in which he was telling it.Joyce had a message to deliver in Ulysses: he sought to tell the world of the people he had encountered; to describe their conduct and speech, to analyze their motive, to relate the effects the sordid, turbulent, disorderly &quot;world,&quot; replete with Irish whiskey and Irish ecclesiasticism, had upon him, an emotional and egocentric genius whose chief pleasure was self-analysis and whose chief preoccupation was in keeping a notebook filled with every incident he'd ever encountered and every speech heard, all recorded with a Boswellian fidelity.Although Ulysses is not impossible to understand, the book does test anyone's endurance as it is filled with fragments of songs, bits of other languages, lists, obscure references and Joyce's stream-of-consciousness style. Idiosyncrasies abound; from the early Dubliners, Joyce abjured &quot;perverted commas&quot; in favor of French-style punctuation.Reading A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is one way to prepare for Ulysses. In that book we are introduced to Stephen Dadelus and we also have a chance to get used to Joyce's capacity to externalize his consciousness, to put down in words those things many of us would be ashamed to admit to thinking, even to ourselves.Unlike Odysseus, Joyce never returned home. He wandered around Europe, his eyesight failing, with his fiercely-loyal wife, Nora, at his side. It is Nora Joyce celebrates in the tremendous punctuationless passage that ends Ulysses.Although Stephen Dadelus, in his Parisian tranquility, would have pretended indifference to the praise heaped upon Ulysses, Joyce knew that he had created something special and lasting. &quot;O rocks,&quot; Molly says to Bloom, &quot;tell us in plain words.&quot; That is something Joyce never failed to do."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a brilliant novel. And it will find its salvation not because it is a triumph of form--which it is. Admittedly it packs intellectual poetry into every syllable, carefully constructed. But this means nothing today. Joyce was the only modernist who seemed to know that eventually the modernist form would fade and people would just wonder why The Wasteland is so damn hard to read. This book will find a salvation because it is more classical than any other book in the 20th century canon. And because it is a realist work before it is anything else.Anyone who doubts that Joyce is a realist writer needs to take a glance at Dubliners. It is, more than likely, the realist tint of Ulysses that made upper crust elitists like Woolf dislike it. In his failed poet Stephen, Joyce offers a critique of the aesthete lifestyle. His hero, Bloom, is an impotent Jew suffering in sexual silence for the sake of his wife. The spiritual motivation of the book is a near-illiterate woman. There's little for the oversexed anti-semites of 1930s Paris to appreciate here.Joyce wrote this book for his wife. It is his gift to her; fill in the details, ask yourself why that particular day, and you will see how Ulysses is perhaps the most profound love ode in the English language since &quot;The Divine Comedy.&quot; It abolishes identity, language, politics, ethnicity and class in favor of a simple love poem. Read and be moved, but never say it is without content."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It's a pity for so many out there that appreciating this remarkable novel requires a broad and good education. A grounding in the classics certainly helps - Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare, as some reviewers have noted. But, in addition, if you've read widely and can catch the parodies of, say, Gibbon or the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, or of journalism around 1900, you'll enjoy it even more.Even then, 'Ulysses' is set in a time and place which have faded - Dublin in 1904 - and there are a lot of topical allusions to the politics (e.g. Parnell and his fall, Zionist publicity for immigration to Palestine), music (operas and lighter musical libretti) and much else to create a world, a whole set of intersecting lives, perspectives and meaning.Joyce was a true polyglot, so the bits of Italian, French, Latin, and rhyming underworld slang, for instance, can strike people as just showing off - but they make the book much more than a recounting of a banal day in a narrow setting.Precisely for both reasons - the allusions which have by now faded, and the breadth of the intellectual experience the book provides - even the most well-read connoisseur of literature would probably gain something by referring, at least occasionally, to the annotations of a book like Gifford's. But once this is done for a bit of the book, it gets much easier not to lean on the annotations, and 'Ulysses' can be read on its own, coming back to Gifford to see what more can be added to fill in the multiple meanings and subtleties.'Ulysses' has to be read slowly. Joyce took seven years to write it, so why not spend a year or two to absorb it? I'd suggest that the right discipline in approaching the book is to read no more than a page or two a day, and to break off and come back to it as often as needed.But then, exactly as some of the reviewers suggest, if you don't have either the background or the time, maybe you should read something else. After all, a top listing by Modern Library or the opinions of others who've thought 'Ulysses' a classic, or the fact that the book is a staple of English literature departments at universities, shouldn't force anyone to read it. And if people don't force themselves to read something they don't like, maybe they won't find a need to call the book or the author names.Yet, in spite of the difficulties of access which make 'Ulysses' somewhat esoteric, it has a lot of verbal pyrotechnics. If you enjoy the sheer mastery of language, there's little to compare unless you go back to Shakespeare. More than that, in the finest humanist style of the high renaissance (Montaigne, and, again, Shakespeare)the world of 'Ulysses' is in the measure of man. There's all of life to be experienced in reading it: tragedy (the death of Stephen's mother, from which he is still recovering, of Bloom's infant son, vividly remembered, the suicide of Bloom's father, Virag, which comes back in Bloom's reveries); comedy (mockery of \\"high society\\" in a hilarious catalogue of names, of \\"high art\\" in a sketch of a dog's barking as if it were reviewed in appreciation of its poetic qualities; sexuality in its many aspects - a quite touching portrait, through her letters to her father, of Bloom's budding young daughter who has just begun to work, but also a nightmarish and hallucinatory scene with Bloom and Stephen in a brothel.Joyce's vision is kindly and humane. He mocks established religion (the blasphemy is quite amusing if you're not easily shocked),or the 'gods' of \\"nationalism\\" ('patriotism' if you wish), and many other '-isms'. But his low-key message is of loving one another, affirming life for what it is, and doing the best one can, with no easy guides.In the end, reading 'Ulysses' is a unique experience. If this review helps even a few more readers have it, I'll be satisfied. All the others should just relax and just read what they enjoy better!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a fascinating book for those who have the patience and time to explore its intricate chapters and themes. Yet, it should not be forced upon anyone as required reading or for that matter anyone under the age of 21. The richess and complexity of the Circe episode alone earns a 5 star rating. Other episodes such as Cyclops, Ithica, Nausicaa and (of course) Penelope are memorable. There were times (Oxen of the Sun, Scylla and Charrybdis) that I just did not have the energy required to continue, but on the whole, a worthy venture.It particularly helps if you can identify with the eroding dreams of either Leopold Bloom or Stephen Deedalus. That is why it may appeal to those who their 20's just making their way out in life or those who middle aged such as myself, who reflect upon what has gone down and what is yet to come."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"1. When you tried it in college, it was a task, a challenge, an intellectual mountain to climb, a test of your literary mettle. Perhaps if you read it apart from any course, as I did, you felt you failed.2. In the intervening time you've read perhaps hundreds of Modernist and post-modernist novels by Joyce's acknowledged progeny, those whose numbers are legion: from William Faulkner to Beckett to Barth to Perec to Eggers to Coover to Calvino to Kundera, from \\"Wittgenstein's Mistress\\" to \\"Wittgenstein's Nephew,\\" from Jeanette Winterson to Louis Paul Boon and Gilbert Sorrentino to Peter Handke. These you have relished and enjoyed tremendously. Why, then, not tackle their progenitor, the master himself, again?3. A book is no longer in any way a notch in your belt; you read for enjoyment, enlightenment, enrichment, a sense of connectedness, all the right reasons and some that aren't.3. You can start with your old paperback, and if Ulysses again proves too difficult, you can toss it aside, no harm done.4. If the old paperback falls apart and you find you're still reading, you can buy a new copy.5. You're not in such an all-fired hurry any more. You have the sense to adapt to Joyce's demands and slow down your reading speed, recognizing that this is like a prose poem. Take five minutes on one given page, what's the rush? The writing is finely tooled enough to deserve it.5. Your maturity allows you to see beyond the Masterpiece Syndrome and the Scholar's Paradise that Ulysses became to enjoy what a romp it is. This is fun! for God's sake. Joyce is forty different kinds of comedian, veering from irony to black comedy to sly humor to sheer buffoonery.6. Each section being in a different style is itself royally entertaining, and Joyce is masterly in all of them. This is a buffet prepared by a virtuoso chef, and if you hang onto your hat, it's exhilarating as all get out.7. The unexpected effect of all this variety is that the three main characters, Stephen Dedalus, Leopold and Molly Bloom are more vivid and real than they could possibly be otherwise. Various sections familiarize us with their intimate habits, personal effects, private thoughts, and the way others see them; and by regarding them through different stylistic lenses, Joyce effects unusual familiarity and allows these fictional entities to assume the palpability of real people.8. We feel great affection for these characters, and Joyce achieves this while depicting them not as highly exceptional, heroic souls but rather average, idiosyncratic and unremarkable people. Even the highly intelligent, poetic Stephen is a typically self-dramatizing, youthful romantic. And yes, though the novel is rife with comic turns, there is poignancy, great and generous humanity.9. The novel is a sensuous feast, the words chosen always with an ear for sound in the reciprocal service of memorable, ultravivid images. You can dog-ear a dictionary (to many disappointments, considering Joyce's flamboyant taste for arcana and neologisms) or not; your workable vocabulary will suffice for much, if not most, of the glorious language. In this regard Joyce is a wizard, a magician unsurpassed by any poet in memory.10. As another reviewer here noted, you will have the urge, once you've come to the last line, to immediately begin again. Keep your new copy handy. This is such a kaleidoscope, a ride of a book, that you'll want to read it a third time, soon enough."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ah, Ulysses. What can one say that has not already been said? It seems that everyone who has read it, and indeed even those who have not, has an opinion regarding Joyce's seminal work. And now, after finally turning over the last page, I hereby add my own name to the long list of critics who have attempted to analyze this novel, and who, although perhaps unwittingly, have also added to the length of the grin on the face of its author--that eloquent literary trickster, that infuriating kicker-of-the-wheels of language, old double J himself.What immediately strikes you upon reading the first few pages of Ulysses is that, despite the cloud of mystique surrounding it, it is only a novel--a collection of words written by one man. It is not, as some would have you believe, some sort of prophetic vision of mankind, a work of art so highly conceived and perfectly executed that it transcends all space and time. No, it is only, as all books are, a story. And thereby it can be reduced to this: a man wakes up, walks around, and then goes to sleep. If you're looking for anything more than that, then keep looking--because you won't find it here. It is simply the story of one long (and I do mean long) day.But the plot is of little importance in this book. What the author wants you to focus on is style and meaning; and there is plenty of both to go around. In fact, there is too much. When Joyce attempts to reconstruct the evolution of the english language in a mock birth of modern speech and literature, he crosses the line that separates amusing people from annoying ones. In passages throughout the book--too numerous to mention in this limited review space--you often get the urge to say to its author, &quot;Okay, that's enough; we get it already.&quot; But on and on he goes, confusing you, irritating you, making you wish you had never started reading this damn book in the first place. So why keep reading, you ask? Because there are parts of the book, again too numerous to mention, that for sheer beauty and clarity of description rival anything ever written. Joyce's portrait of a grizzled old sailor in a scene towards the end of the book quickly comes to mind as a shining reminder that there are rewards for making the long and sometimes frustrating journey on which he wishes to take you.And that, I suppose, is what Ulysses is all about. You love it at times, you hate it at times, but by the time you reach the end you feel, well, something. And no more should we expect of our authors."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Symbolically, Ulysses follows Homer's the Odyssey; literally, it follows one-day in the life of a Jewish-born Irishman (an anomaly, to be sure), Leopold Bloom.First, whoever gives this book less than five stars does not respect the English language or English literature.Second, whoever picks-up this book expecting to enter the temple of profundity is in for a big shock: this book is, and was meant to be, very funny.Third, this book actually is profound, which is due to Joyce's genius and broad learning, not due to the book's intention, which was to recreate the novel and rival Shakespeare in word-play (both of which Ulysses does very well).This book treads from the extremely scatological (Joyce humorously describing masturbation as a &quot;honeymoon with the hand&quot;), to the very highest planes of human thought, for instance at the beginning of the Proteus episode: &quot;INELUCTABLE MODALITY OF THE VISIBLE: AT LEAST THAT IF NO more, thought through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, maestro di color che sanno. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it, it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.&quot; In these short lines, we have a fairly complex argument about the nature of reality; from the Aristotelian argument of knowing things through their transparency or translucence, &quot;diaphane&quot;, to Dante, maestro di color che sanno, &quot;master of those who know&quot;.But don't take it from me: go read this book; and if your befuddlement becomes too great, do what I did, and pick-up a good Annotation--even Cliffs Notes--but don't say it's crap just because you can't read it like you do John Grisham."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you intend to read ULYSSES here are a few suggestions.First off, read or reread Homer's The Odyssey, from which Joyce's seminal work is based. Aside from the Dedalus/Telemachus, Bloom/Odysseus, and Molly/Penelope parallels, each book in Joyce's novel reinvents equivalent parts of the Greek epic. You will gain a much greater appreciation of Joyce's achievement in transposing and reinterpreting a 10 year mythic and epic journey in ancient Greece to a 1 day journey in early 20th century Dublin.Secondly, don't come in expecting to understand everything. Many have tried and quit after reading a few parts, daunted by the strange syntax, the disjointed time frames, the shifts from waking to dream states, and the lack of traditional narrative replaced for the most part by stream of consciousness (internal monologue) to develop the plot. Joyce plays around a lot in ULYSSES, changing narrative styles, dialects, inventing words. You can't breeze through it. It requires a lot of patience to get through ULYSSES..to appreciate what Joyce has accomplished. It's always tricky categorizing a great work, but being that it's a novel about thought processes I guess you can say it's beyond realism..call it super realism. This is literature as a ground breaking art form. Joyce broke rules, but so did Picasso, and ULYSSES is kind of a literary Cubist masterpiece.Finally, after getting through ULYSSES (if you can), read the voluminous critiques on it. Read about the author. Do further exploration. Then read ULYSSES again. Multiple readings certainly enhance the experience, and bear fruit which are hidden or unripe enough to initially enjoy and appreciate."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I recently returned from Dublin where I met many Irish people and native \\"Dubs,\\" as they call themselves. Everyone said the same thing about \\"Ulysses\\", that is \\"I tried to read it but could not get through it.\\"Jim Norton brought \\"Ulysses\\" to life for me. I followed along as he read and began to understand the rythm of the text. \\"Ulysses\\" became exciting instead of imposing.Jim Norton is truly gifted: Great voice and wonderful imagination."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Despite what the reviewer from MA had to say about this novel, it is readable and it should be approached by anyone who is interested in it. It is not an easy read, but then again, really innovative and engaging works never are. Joyce does something in this novel that few authors have the courage to do--trust the reader's intelligence.Yes, this is a retelling of The Odyssey, but even without that framework, the novel stands by itself. The story picks up about a year after Joyce's novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man leaves off with some of the same characters, notably Stephen Dedalus. But the protagonist of the work, Leopold Bloom, is the real stroke of genius. It might help to read Portrait before approaching Ulysses just to get an introduction to Stephen and his family. Anyone who really wants to get as many allusions as possible should probably use Gifford's annotations, which are available for both texts.As for our friend from MA...well, what can you say about someone who is reviewing the Cliff's Notes version of the text? Is that what Poly Sci majors read in order to try and feel intelligent as English majors?Do not be afraid; you can read this book. If you are afraid of starting a book that is so long by yourself then get some friends or family involved and read the book out loud to each other. It's marvelous."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"From the beginning of anyone's Joyce readings, he automatically assumes a powerless position. In Dubliners, we are walking through a labrynth of short stories connected only by theme and setting, paralysis and Dublin. We see the same theme and setting in A Portrait. Ulysses, though, presents Joyce's labrynth at its most complex. Unlike other more traditional novels, the chapters in Ulysses have almost no connections from one to the next. Rather, Joyce presents a series of coincidences and seemingly unrelated events within one day. The navigation of the novel in most places becomes rather belaboured, especially &quot;Oxen of the Sun.&quot; Like the epic it was modeled after (Odyssey), Ulysses includes moments of divine intervention. However, a Ulyssean intervention is made by either Joyce or the reader rather than by a Greek God serving as a deux es machina. The plot of Ulysses is the plot of the modern hero in the greatest epic of all, life. The novel is the most intricate, and probably the most realistic novel ever. I say it is the most realistic even though it has many moments of disillusionment with knowledge that we all go through many moments of disillusion throughout each day of our lives. The characters, just as the readers, are hopeless in the grand scheme of things. Fate, rather than the human hand, controls all of us. If you feel like trampling through a labrynth of deeply insightful and, at times, awfully confusing epiphanies, then Ulysses is for you. The labor involved in the reading makes its brief moments of understanding (the epiphanies) all the more worthwile. After all, you have to go through hell to come out right."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Due to the recent explosion of fame of this novel, many literature lovers have gone out to buy the book (or get it from a library,) to at least see what the hype is all about, if not to actually enjoy it. Unfortunately, many of these literature lovers enjoy not just reading, but the atmosphere of reading--curling up in bed or in a plush recliner after work and shutting off the outside world to live with the characters for a few hours. These readers generally throw Ulysses away before getting past the third chapter because they realize that no such reading atmosphere is possible with such a complex novel. To those interested in reading the novel, I offer two suggestions: first study a little Irish history, particularly about Charles Stewart Parnell, Daniel O'Connell, Arthur Griffin and Sinn Fein, the Fenian movement, etc. even if you just peruse encyclopedia articles. Second, read the Don Gifford notes for the novel along with Ulysses itself. This will constantly interrupt your reading of the novel, but it will help your understanding. If you are completely unwilling to put in this effort, buying this book will be a waste of money. But even if you don't think you would be willing to read a novel that requires so much initial research for basic comprehension, consider this: If Ulysses is really as good as its fans claim, you will want to go back and read it a second time, and then you will be able to enjoy it without constantly referring to notes, history texts or foreign language dictionaries."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This edition corrected hundreds or thousands of mistakes that were in the 1961 edition. When Ulysses was originally published, it had to be typeset in france because english printers could be prosecuted for \\"pornography\\". These typesetters didn't know english and made a lot of mistakes. Joyce's corrections (he often worked backwards to develop certain themes) were scrawled onto (at least) two sets of galleys and many of them were never included. In addition to that he was going blind and missed a lot of typos which thus came to seem intentional. Ulysses is (IMHO) the greatest book of the 20th century and demands careful and close reading. With the 1961 edition, which I read through several times before this one came out, I was left with many obscurities (such as Bloom having a watch in one chapter and needing to ask someone the time in a later chapter) to ponder which, it turns out, Joyce never intended, as well as struggling through passages than made no sense at all. This is still a very difficult book to read, but there's far less that's inexplicable in this edition. The difference is analogous to hearing cleaned-up CDs (of, say, Robert Johnson) as opposed to tapes made from shellac records with all the pops, scratches, and hisses on them."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is Leopold Bloom - husband of Molly, father of Milly, advertising canvasser, lover of \\"the inner organs of beasts and fowls,\\" Jew, atheist, untutored but curious and sympathetic observer of the world around him. On June 16, 1904, Bloom has breakfast, defecates, attends a funeral, goes sporadically about his work, has lunch, visits the library, has a heated discussion with some Dublin barflies, masturbates discreetly while enjoying the view afforded by a conveniently reclining shop-girl, falls in with some drunken medical students, visits a brothel, and tends to an obnoxious young hipster-intellectual, whom he brings home for a cup of coffee and a chat.That's what \\"happens,\\" but over the course of Bloomsday we are invited into the life and times of the most fully and brilliantly realized character in world literature. As Bloom strolls around Dublin, and the novel records fragments from his endlessly fascinating internal monologue, his life slowly comes into focus: he is of half-Jewish descent; he is married to a voluptuous beauty named Molly who, Bloom knows, will spend the afternoon getting a thorough seeing-to by a well-hung local playboy; he has a daughter, but his only son was still-born, since which time his marriage has been largely dysfunctional; his father committed suicide; he is carrying on a clandestine correspondence with a married woman; but at the core of his uxorious being remains Molly, his mind returning time and again to their courtship and the happy early years of their marriage.We learn much, too, from his interactions with his fellow Dubliners. Throughout the day Bloom endures a steady stream of anti-Semitic bigotry, ranging from the casual to the (comically) violent. Bloom is an outsider, a humane and free-thinking man in a city of parochial bores. He is also, in Joyce's words, \\"a good man,\\" a man who takes it upon himself to collect funds for a recently widowed woman and spontaneously helps a blind man cross the road. Most endearing of all, however, is his boundless curiosity, his wonderful (if often ill-informed) observations of people and things. When he looks at his cat he ponders: \\"Wonder what I look like to her. Height of a tower. No, she can jump me.\\" \\"Good puzzle would be to cross Dublin without passing a pub,\\" he muses later. Or: \\"Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn't know what to call her. Always see a fellow's weak point in his wife.\\" Or: \\"Back of everything magnetism. Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement. And time? Well that's the time the movement takes. Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.\\" Or: \\" Curious she an only child, I an only child. So it returns. Think you're escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home.\\" And so on.Bloom, his mind and his life, - like the city he lives in - comes into focus bit by bit, like tiny pieces of a dazzling mosaic slowly coming together before your eyes. With unnerving prescience, Joyce has created a genuinely modern Everyman (he works in advertising!): deracinated, middle-class, tolerant, suburban, he's a little bit like you and me, making a go of his modest existence with a redeeming dignity.The final chapter belongs to Bloom's wife Molly, who lies in bed next to her husband and reflects - in eight astonishing unpunctuated sentences - upon the events of her day and her past, throwing new light upon what we think we know about Bloom and his marriage. Big-bosomed, generously-bottomed Molly is Woman with a capital \\"W\\". Where Bloom is intellectual, reflective and logical, Molly is impulsive, florid, instinctive, sensual. The faithless Molly is an improbable Penelope, but as she concludes with the ecstatic recollection of her courtship with Bloom atop a hill overlooking Dublin bay, and with her climactic Yes - to her husband, to life - it all makes perfect, glorious sense.Next to Joyce's latter day Ulysses - and his Penelope - the stylistic fireworks of the novel are of secondary interest, a brilliant means to an end rather than a legitimate pretext for anorak-like fixation. You'll get more out of Ulysses the more familiar you are with Homer, with the western literary and intellectual tradition, with the geography of Edwardian Dublin, and with Irish culture and history, but in truth you don't need any of those things. Here is a rich, nourishing, generous feast of a book: all you need is an open mind and a sympathetic interest in the world and the creatures that inhabit it.Finnegan's Wake is strictly for comfortably tenured scholars and tragic seekers of hermetic wisdom. Ulysses is for the rest of us. Just you try it on."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"First, please disregard the star rating. I had to choose something, but in this case, it's meaningless.I read Portrait of the Artist in college and found it absolutely wonderful. It influenced me to change my major and, to a degree, my life. I was sure then, as I am now, that Joyce is one of the greatest writers I have ever read. I therefore tried to read Ulysses several times, including just recently, and each time hit a wall after a few dozen pages. My most recent attempt was assisted by an extrinsic aid that summarized the chapters and elucidated some of the obscure references. I was determined to make a go of it; I pictured myself wallowing in a warm bath of self-satisfaction at having completed the book, and being able to mention to others (casually, of course) that I'd read it.I failed.I have read my share of stylistically difficult novels, and consider myself reasonably well educated. I could doubtless plow through the book with gritted teeth, determined not to let it get the better of me, but life's too short. I surely can't say it isn't a great work of literature (particularly since I've made barely a dent in it), but I would venture to say that you should not even try it unless you are prepared either to devote a few months of close study, with reference materials, or to miss eighty percent of what the author was trying to say and do. I can also say that I think it unlikely that you will genuinely enjoy the book unless you derive inherent satisfaction from conquering a difficult task, or are a scholar of literature of this genre.Not a beach book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Plot? There is no plot? Hath life a plot? I think not. Life is a continual process, ebb and flow, rising and falling, like plate tectonics, like the ocean:constant movement, sometimes building to grand, pulsing, God-quaking climaxes before receding back into everyday lifes slowly humming grey. But sometimes not. Don't approach Ulysses looking for a coherent arc of plot, you're going to be disappointed(again, it hasn't one). Approach it more like Lolita, less concerned with the subject matter than with the beauty of its language; each word is a live, crawling jeweled beetle gnawing and burrowing through the dung of a day in the life of ad salesman Leopold Bloom, flittering their wings, busszing and forminng new patters, cresting and swirling into a cone, a tetracylone around an ordinary day in the life of an essentially ordinary Man. It works like a silhouette:each word, like a wort, pimple, hair or other blemish on a face defines its shape, as does ulyesses a life in the context of a single day(cf Finnegans Wake), through long sonorous sentences and chapters brimming like a cistern full of noisy pink coffee, out of which meaning blooms like a bloody Liebestod-singing rose, grabbing you. Even still, there is no meaning-ordering modern life? There is no order.&quot;Der Inhalt ist in den Augen einer Eule&quot;. Using The Odyssey to parallel Blooms avoidance of Molly is but a simple ploy, an act of acceptance and defeat, a concession of escape and resignation-much like those little pimply puke potsmoke fourteen year olds who compare their lives to popular songs. Don't hide. The pure organic beauty-tragic, erotic, hilarious, pathetic, and ulimtately affirmative runs through this novel like a vein of gold ore. Pick it up. Enjoy it at length. Enjoy it many times over-the more you read it the more you get. Don't seek God in Ulysses-Joyce's brilliance could certainly back up his notoriously mammoth arrogance but he was no seer, no mystic, but a human, flawed just like any other-instead, enjoy its beauty, and in it(eventually, but with time you will)recognize yourself, and every other human being on Earth-for am Ende we are all Leopold Bloom(nee Virag)--therein."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],C={key:0},H={key:1};function q(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",B,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",H,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",C,"See more"))],8,E)):p("",!0)])}const R=d(x,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-5a2ba5d9"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/24.md","filePath":"people/24.md"}'),W={name:"people/24.md"},j=Object.assign(W,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(R)]))}});export{P as __pageData,j as default};
