I loved this book! It is almost impossible to put this book down before finishing it."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I'm an avid fan of Toni Morrison's work, especially her novels. Paradise is by far my favorite because each time I re-read it I find something new. I enjoy piecing together the unreliable narration and the puzzle of the illusive \\"white girl\\" shot first! Not an easy read, but well-worth the effort."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I wish I weren't so uncomfortable with ambiguity, as there is much of it in this book. I love Morrison's writing, though it humbles me, too. It was a very challenging book to read in the snippets I get riding the train to/from work. I feel like I need to (and want to) flip back to the beginning right away and read it all over again. Nevertheless, like her other books (of which Song of Solomon is one of my all-time favorites), her prose is beautiful and haunting. It's a compelling exploration of race, gender and belonging."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison is one of the best authors living today, and has firmly placed herself as an author that will be read years down the road. Paradise is perhaps one of her best novels, and is one of my all time favorites (I have read it three times).It does pose a difficult read for those looking for a casual book, because it is a deep and complexly interwoven book meant to stir emotions and one's mind. I am amazed at the spotlight reviews who seem confused by her style of writing and could not become involved with the characters. Morrison uses a recursive approach, one that breathes new life into each chapter (as a new character is introduced Morrison takes the time to back track to explain that person's past before joining the character with the present time of the book; Morrison's Master's Thesis was on Faulkner, who used the recursive style heavily). Although this could create confusion if you aren't aware of it, I think it makes for an altogether complete and compelling story.The Convent itself and the women that reside within are compelling, and sad, stories ready to be told, and as they unfold with their interactions with Ruby it creates a book that is absolutely amazing.This book is not for those looking for a quick easy read, or something that goes from point A to point B with no stops in between. This book will test your mind and emotions as the tale unfolds through complex chapters, leaving you with a much more fulfilling book than one that does not make you think about what you are reading. If I could give this a six star rating, I wouldn't hesitate."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Should fiction be easy? Depending on how you answer this rather basic question, you will either love or hate this book (and the rest of Morrison's catalogue, for that matter). In other words, is reading merely another hobby for you, or is it an obsession? Morrison caters to those of us who are obsessed. We may not have all read James Joyce's Ulysses, but we plan to one day. Paradise takes a rather complex story and tells it in a complex way. If you expect to have your hand held as you saunter through this novel, go read something else. Morrison challenges her reader at every turn, forcing us to exercise our intelligence. Do you draw character maps while you read books? Perhaps you should. I diagrammed the town of Ruby to the best of my ability.The reason why so many people struggle to get through a book as difficult as Paradise (which Morrison originally planned to title \\"War,\\" by the way) is because they are afraid of being confused. Morrison, however, uses confusion as a means of bringing us deeper into her world. The act of reading is not so much a discovery of answers, but of more questions. Paradise is first and foremost a mystery novel: who are the nine men with guns in the first chapter? Who is the white girl? What has provoked this violence? etc etc. Every answer that Morrison gives us comes at a price: more questions. Personally, I wouldn't want to have it any other way."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison made a grave error while writing Paradise-she left too much of the translation (and trust me, there's A LOT) to the reader. To the causal reader, the novel is almost completely indiscernible due to the very complex and very confusing plot structure and lack of an active narrative voice.So did I understand Paradise? Yes, but only after carefully picking it apart chapter by chapter in one of my English seminars. Even now, I'm not so sure that I truly comprehend all of the book's themes. And do I understand the ending? Yes, but only after wading through hours of various interviews with Morrison in which she discussed her book to great length. Most importantly, was the book worth the read? I believe so, but I devoted a lot of work to Paradise before arriving at this conclusion. Morrison's writing style is not to be taken lightly; words and themes often contain several, and sometimes seemingly infinitesimal, levels of meaning. The bottom line is that what you take away from Paradise, if anything, is up to you. If you want to walk away from this novel with any sort of satisfaction, be prepared to commit a lot though and research to the undertaking.Now, I'm not going to discuss the novel's meanings here for those who don't have the time or the will to put in the sort of work I'm talking about because doing so would far exceed the 1,000 word limit that amazon.com allows for these reviews. (I wrote 10 pages alone for my seminar on the theme of sexuality as a form of female submission and still had plenty of material left over to work with.) Whether Morrison has overextended her literary license with Paradise is debatable, but I would encourage you, the reader, to devote some effort to the reading. Who knows, you might find something worth keeping. I sure did."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I must preface my review by admitting I've only read Paradise once.The writing is the same brilliant and disorienting/nonlinear style as the rest of Morrison's oeuvre. What seemed most aberrant in her first post-Nobel Prize novel was, though it was highly intellectually stimulating, for me &quot;Paradise&quot; lacked the connection to the heart that is inseparable from her previous books. It seemed to try to meet expectations the public would have of a Nobel Prize Laureate. (Who can blame her? She remains a wonder.) But to me it was a bit forced, especially with an (overly?) dramatic opening line &quot;They shoot the white girl first.&quot;I will read any novel Morrison writes, they are all worth reading, including Paradise, but if you are new to her, you would be best off starting with Song of Solomon, Sula, and then Beloved."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Yes, it is a confusing text to some extent. I highly recommend getting the book on tape, read by Morrison herself. Her nuances and changes in intonation really bring the characters and story to life. At the heart of the story is the question of whether God exists within each of us, or whether God is an external force acting on our lives. \\"Beware the furrow fo his brow\\" OR \\"Be the furrow of his brow\\". Why does Paradise necessarily have to mean exclusion? It is a thoughtful book that has a reward for those who take the time to unravel the intersecting personal stories. But I am also a Faulkner fan, and this, like Faulkner, is not an easy afternoon read. But I don't think Morrison intended it to be that way. Life, which this book reflects, is not easily understood."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The first half of this book was difficult to understand and difficult to &quot;get into&quot;. BUT by the time I was halfway through the book the pieces of the puzzle began to fit together and from then on I couldn't put it down. This was an excellent, complex story with beautifully descriptive wording that makes you look at the ordinary in a whole new way. The characters are not always likeable, but you really understand (by the end of the book) where they are coming from and what their motives are. After I finished this book I re-read the first few chapters. It was alot like having to see a smart movie twice.... the second time around everything makes sense. This is a wonderful book, and it's well worth sticking with it even though it's tough to do initially. I've also read Ms. Morrison's &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; and &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot;. Ms. Morrison is a one-of-a-kind author and I really love her books. I am definately going to read the ones I haven't yet."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Morrison's novel Paradise is a literary jigsaw puzzle of time, place and space. Personally, I enjoyed the complexities of keeping track of the novel's time and was not confused by the &quot;jumping around.&quot; Morrison has carefully placed many &quot;clues&quot; in her novel and if the reader pays close attention to the book they will be able to follow the plot without any pain! I found it helpful to jot down certain dates now and then for quick reference. A demanding but worthwile read!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"the goddess Toni Morrison. An earth goddess, yes, but nevertheless a goddess of literature and wisdom, symbolic for women the world over as One Who Has Made It, One Who Has Expressed It, One Who Teaches, etc. She is among my favorite writers. I don't love each work equally, but she's an artist, so she's entitled to irritate or bore on occasion. I notice from previous reviews that, like all artists, she touches some and leaves others cold. What I got from Paradise is her ongoing teaching that not all African American people were raised in the south; not all were directly effected by slavery; in other words, there are myriad Black stories just as there are myriad White stories. This one was particularly odd. I just got the unabridged audio version to find out what I missed in a first reading, and I'm sure there will be much. To dissatisfied reviewers: some literature is not a quick read. It takes a bit of thought, study, review, and if it's a nonlinear book you might have to re-read it in a nonlinear way, even keeping a journal of what baffles you until the pieces of the puzzle fit. In that way, Ms. Morrison is not unlike Faulkner, whose great book The Sound And the Fury has bedeviled readers for years. I feel this novel is a box of (Pandora's) secrets, or a puzzle. Thanks again to the goddess and the Goddess for another fascinating collaboration.e-mail me if you're a Toni Morrison fan and want to share: femmesage@earthlink.net"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This book sat on my &quot;to read&quot; stack for over a year. I kept hearing that it was rough sledding, but I finally picked it up and was completely enthralled. In fact, I'd say it was a page-turner. The book is something of a jigsaw puzzle, so it's important not to get frustrated when you don't know exactly who is who. After about 100 pages the pieces start falling into place and that makes it especially satisfying to read. (I recommend keeping a pencil and paper handy to jot down relationships on a family tree as they become clear.) Don't be put off by this, it's one of the great pleasures of Morrison's writing--in addition to her wonderful language and vast imagination."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Morrison has truly lived up to her potential as a writer in her most recent novel Paradise. I found the complexity of her lyrical writing to be both intriguing and moving. The novel fits in well with the trilogy comprised of Beloved and Jazz. The feature that stands out the most to me as a reader, a student of literature, and as an author is not just the beauty in the formation of her words on the page but the questions they ask people to consider. Morrison is able to make the reader ask why do people act violently, why do they choice to exclude those people and notions so central to constructions of self and paradise. For anyone looking for a deep thought provoking and beautifully written novel that won't leave you unchanged, I strongly recommend considering Paradise. If you liked Beloved your bound to love Paradise, or if you simply a true Morrison fan, you must add this to your library."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I guess it just got to me to read all of these reviews by people who got the book because of Oprah's recommendation (interestingly enough, some couldn't spell Oprah's name) and despised it. Don't get me wrong, I think that Oprah's recommendations are wonderful because it gets people to read who wouldn't otherwise read, but sometimes you have to realize when you're over your head. If you stopped reading it out of frustration or you hated it because you didn't get it, then you have to wonder if you *thought* about it or just *read* it. If you didn't get it, find someone else who has read it, and discuss it. Don't just leave it hanging because this book is really so full of things to discuss. Perhaps Toni hops upon a soapbox on ocassion, but then again, a lot of people who wrote reviews didn't get it, so the soapbox was perhaps unnoticed. It just irks me because I believe Toni Morrison to be a wonderfully gifted writer, and this tale may be more complex than previous stories such as _Sula_ or _Song of Solomon_, but I believe this to be just as fantastic as her other products."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"&quot;Paradies&quot; is not an easy read. It is thought provoking. The language and structure is poetry. The novel must be read like a poem - aloud to a friend, with long silent pauses for reflection between paragraphs. As with all of Morrison's novels, this one deals with basic human needs, virtues and failings. Race and sex are only some of the determining factors. The driving force is fear. Fear of contamination from outside, fear of rejection, fear of ones own weakness, fear of women's power, fear of fear. Morrison's very human characters live and try to deal with these fears, each in their own way. All fail. Paradise turns ruby red with the blood of the murdered women who churned the men's fears."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I'd never heard of Toni Morrison before I watched Oprah. That's the beauty of her bookclub. As a young white Australian male living on the complete opposite side of the world from where Ms Morrison lives and writes, it was with apprehension that I picked up one of her books for the first time. It was Song of Solomon. That was May of 1997 and I have read that book three times since then. So, when Oprah chose Toni Morrison's new book as one of her bookclub selections I went looking straight away. I wasn't disappointed. I know some others who have read the book and hated it and then I saw the Oprah show where everyone didn't get it and I just sat there dumbfounded. I love the way Ms Morrison tells about the chivalry and friendship between this group of women. What was there not to get? And what was all this business about white and black? Who cares? It isn't the point of the book. I love Paradise as a book and I love it as a title. Paradise? Oh yes it is."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I was 3/4 though reading the book when I realized I could not remember who was who, or what the chronology was.

You will not regret this journey."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"A Discussion ofToni Morrison's ParadiseBy Mo SaidiParadise is the story of a mythical town, which is founded and inhabited by freedmen and freedwomen. A narrator with total grasp of the characters' feelings, thoughts, and backgrounds tells the story in the third person voice. In this less than stellar work by Toni Morrison, the author uses mythical and metaphoric language to describe a paradise turned around and torn apart by corruption and war.The novel is set in 1997, but it travels through several eras; first to a period shortly after World War II, when the all black town Ruby was founded by blacks, then further back to earlier times when Haven was founded by a band of former slaves in Oklahoma. It depicts a story of Exodus: Wandering ex-slaves searching for a home, a paradise to settle and a desirable community of their own to live in.The people of Ruby also experience, though only second hand, the changes that America went through in 1970s-student uprising, rioting in the streets, police brutalities, and cities more dangerous for young blacks than war zones. \\"Safer than anywhere in Oklahoma outside Ruby. Safer in the army than in Chicago, Safer than Birmingham, than Montgomery, Selma, than Watts. Safer than Money, Mississippi, in 1955 and Jackson, Mississippi, in 1963. Safer than Newark, Detroit, Washington, D.C. She had thought war was safer than any city in the United States.\\" But Ruby changes and becomes a center of a murderous plot against a small group of unconventional women in a former girls' school named, \\"the Convent.\\" Now the war erupts on their home front as nine black men go on a deadly hunt to destroy the four women and a baby of the Convent.Paradise is a novel, which reflects the bitter memories of the slavery, and of the reconstruction era. An era that they can not bury or forget: \\"Deacon Morgan cut (Sergeant Person) off. \`That's my grandfather you're talking about. Quit calling him an ex-slave like that's all he was. He was also an ex-lieutenant governor, an ex-banker, an ex-deacon and a whole lot of other exes, and he wasn't making his own way; he was part of a whole group making their own way.\\"Toni Morrison reveals in Paradise how a relatively short and peaceful period in Ruby's history quickly gets replaced initially by the social unrest and then by a bloody civil war. The novel should have been titled \\"War\\" not \\"Paradise\\". The description of paradise appears at the end of the novel, in the aftermath of the recent devastation, at a shore occupied by a woman presumably a mother who is \\"black as firewood\\" and \\"is singing,\\" and a younger girl, a daughter? \\"Around them on the beach, sea trash gleams. Discarded bottle caps sparkle near a broken sandal. A small dead radio plays the quiet surf.\\" They see \\"Another ship, perhaps, but different, heading to port, crew and passengers, lost and saved, atremble, for they have been disconsolate for some time.\\" \\"They have been brought to paradise and they will rest before shouldering the endless work.\\""},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The overall theme and many of the issues addressed are very thought provoking and well worth being put in print. The problem is the story it self does not flow. At times it is not clear who is the subject of the chapter and where you are in time and place. I would not recommend."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I love how all of the people who claim to like and understand this book focus their reviews on insulting the intelligence and sophistication of readers who did not like it. If these people were so intellectually superior, they would focus their critique on the substance of the book and not feel the need to attack the intelligence of those of us who did not care for this book. I posted a review two months ago begging someone to explain the ending of this book to me. No one has been able to. After reading such childish reviews, I am proud to be in the &quot;simple minded&quot; category."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I am an avid book reader who plows through at least 7 novels a month. In the past few months I have read at least 20 books and none of them left me feeling the way I did while I read Paradise. Her writing is pure poetry and the images she created in my head enthralled me. Her writing stimulated all my senses and I was left feeling exhilarated. I could smell the lilacs like they were under my nose, taste the steaming potatoes with butter as they slid down Mavis's throat, heard the sounds of children or birds as they froliced in the sun, saw the people and the town like I was looking out my window and felt the warmth of coffee in my hands or the wet tears on my cheek. Paradise was outstanding. I loved it."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"A friend said, &quot;Take this home and read it, and then call me when you've finished.&quot; I'd not read any of Toni Morrison, and, somewhat embarrasssed about that now, really had no intention of doing so. Nevertheless I responded to the Paradise challenge and oh, my, what a literary experience it was! I read the first three chapters, was confused but convinced that it was I, not the author, and the next day began all over again. ...And continued and-- good for me, because-- I'm sure I've never read a better book. I've never ever come anywhere close to even a remotely sympathetic understanding of the &quot;black experience&quot; in this country until reading Paradise (and subsequently Beloved and Sula). But aside from that importance in my life, Paradise itself is absolutely remarkable as literature, I believe. The reader gets to know characters in this story in bits and piece, just as people in real life learn about others -- a little at a time, a crumb here and a crumb there along experiences' continuum. And then, voila! a whole loaf magically comes together. At some point and in ever so seemingly random fashion,all along the way, human behaviors and attitudes of Paradise characters become explainable and are sympathically understandable. To be sure, the story line itself is compelling, from the very first sentence of Chapter 1. Most, if not all, of the social interactions and lessons of the Ruby community were strangely familiar, charming in many ways, and chilling in others. When I finished Paradise, I then proceeded immediately to re-read it AND I liked it even BETTER the second time. Not too many books you can say that about. If you are a devotee of the narrative sweetness of the Rosamunde Pilcher woman writer ilk, you will definitely NOT cotton to Toni Morrison. As for me,I am in total awe of the genius of Toni Morrison. Absolutely remarkable!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This can be a difficult book, especially if you want the answers to everything. Try as you might, you can never be sure who the \\"white girl\\" is. The women's stories do tend to blend together because Morrison wants you to make the effort to keep track of the characters. Each main character represents some form of damage inflicted on women in American society. Difference is punished, even in a place that claims to be different from everywhere else.Really the book is about the sense of paranoia that has haunted the American psyche since Puritan times. Even as we claim to be a nation of individualist rebels, we fear the rebelliousness we see in others. The town in the book is based on a real \\"all-black\\" town, several of which were founded after the Civil War by separatist groups who were tired of being discriminated against and envisioned discrimination-free utopias.I would recommend keeping notes on who is connected to whom as you read. In addition, pay attention to all of the references to domesticity (notice in the death scene how many domestic implements are used as weapons) and home, because \\"home\\" is what everyone in this novel seeks. Moreover, you'll want to watch how every version of perfection is distorted because we often grow dissatisfied with what we have over time. You cannot create a perfect world with imperfect people."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This is not an easy book! I will certainly read it a second time after having gained some distance. Morrison requires the reader to actively participate with his mind to glue the different scenes and episodes together and to fill apparent gaps in the plot. Gaps they are superficially only, for the author provides plenty of clues, albeit often just in the form of subtle hints. The story does not unfold in a simple one-two-three manner to be read with only half one's mind present and I often had to pause to think about what I had just read. Add to this Morrison's scholarly vocabulary and you know what's awaiting you. But the rewards are by far worth the effort! What greater pleasure could there be than to have successfully concluded an intellectural exercise? The story itself is as complex as it's characters are out of the ordinary and some scenes are haunting to the extreme, but thanks to its reconciliatory end the book, rather surprisingly, gives one an uplift."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I read this book when it first came out and it kept me thinking and writing about it for weeks, even months after. I read it a second time outloud to my son and husband. Actually, they participated in the reading outloud; we took turns. Morrison does something with gender, race, class, color, abledness, and of course the broader implications of humanness that has not been done before. She speaks outloud about these core identities at the same time she takes them for granted, unnoticed. I have never felt so seen and understood as a woman, as a white person, as an abled bodied person, as a poor person, as a human, as when I read this book. But I am always troubled by her endings. This one as well."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"As with most of Toni Morrison's novels, this is an intense, enjoyable read. The reader slowly becomes familiar with the characters as if he/she is a new addition to a neighborhood; albeit a struggling neighborhood both spiritually and socially. As the characters develop, so does Ms. Morrison's theme and intent. I highly recommend the book to the reader who wants a challenge as well as a good story. Although sometimes the content is disturbing, it is always thought provoking."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"It has been a while since I read this book, but I simply had to take the opportunity to share my comments. I ordered this book just days after its release, I couldn't wait to see if the reviews were accurate. They were! Boy were they. I just want to know where she comes up with this stuff. The characters were deep, intense, exciting and mystical. Just when I was lost in the whimsy of the story just as I was being swept away, I was picked up on a gust of Morrison wind that had me floating higher than any bird. I haven't landed yet! Weeeeeeee!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I have read almost every book Toni Morrison has ever written. She is very focused on the issues projected in this novel. Men and women, men and God, and God to men is the main theme throughout. I really liked this book, but I suggest that it not be taken lightly. Don't time yourself and try to rush through. Read a little and stop for a few hours just to contemplate what you have just experienced."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"After reading Beloved, The Bluest Eye, and half of Sula, I eagerly anticipated the time to read Paradise. As a high school English teacher, summer is my best time to give a novel my undivided attention and so I've just finished Morrison's latest dance with the page. I love it! While I still have some questions regarding the conclusion(were the Convent girls really saved or were they appearing as spirits much like Beloved did? and why did the author end with Save-Marie's death?), Morrison's message about how we treat each other and the suspense she maintains through 300+ pages are awe-inspiring.I read the book pausing between most chapters and over the period of two and a half weeks. While the beginning of a page or a chapter may have been confusing, I had full confidence that Morrison would answer my questions if I read on. She did. I was never confused to the point of frustration. In fact, I like her stylistic approach to mask the every-day in mystery. It makes me! think (which many novels do not,) and it revives my imagination. When I read Beloved, I was struck by her original language-the way her words flowed like poetry water. I give Paradise a 4 instead of a 5 b/c I did not note as many beautiful, natural descriptions in this novel. Some of the metaphors, similes, and other figurative language used were perhaps, overdone. So for those who criticize the language in comparison to past novels, I understand. However, I enjoyed reading this book tremendously and think you will too if you acknowledge the fact that it is not your &quot;every day read,&quot; and if you revel in poetic language. Also, for any writers aspiring publication, such as myself, Morrison can be matched only by Faulkner in the ability to create sense out of apparent chaos. How does she do it? How does one maintain suspense from page 1 to page 318? How does she develop so many characters so well? (I disagree with those of you who claim her characters are one-dimension! al and I offer you Soane and Connie as evidence). I invite ! any of you who still have questions about the book and who are excited to discuss it, to send me a message. I wish I had read this novel in the context of a book group as it is so rich and wonderful I am compelled to share thoughts and compare notes.And to those of you who hated it, two ideas: finish it or don't write reviews of it. try writing complex prose with a universal message yourself sometimes.Hats off to Toni Morrison...again."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Refuse dance barefoot battered Eves bonding Ruby bloodThis novel invites the reader to explore the politics of gender,color,and race, topics painful to this black, female reader. Ms. Morrison paints a brutal, ugly picture of the abuses heaped upon many black women, indeed, upon women. In Paradise the Convent women, women bruised, battered, and set adrift, are blamed for all the troubles in Ruby just as Eve is blamed for Adam's fall. However, it is the 8 rock men of Ruby who,like Satan, fall prey to pride and ambition and destroy the paradise that they worked hard to gain. Steward, even more than the other men, is unable to contain his deep malice and fear of women; his self-righteous denial of murder damns his soul. The more he gets, the more he loses. Ruby is his paradise lost. Rest assured, however that Ms. Morrison has not written a male bashing novel. There are many fine men in this novel, men who do no hurt. Even Deek, who uses and looks down on Consolata because she so freely dispenses her love, is sympathetically portrayed by the author. He confesses his remorse &quot;at having become what the Old Fathers cursed: the kind of man who set himself up to judge, rout and even destroy the needy, the defenseless, the different.&quot; The issue of color - lightskinned vs darkskinned is embarrassingly addressed. The patriarchs eschew any black who is not ebony. Because Menus' intended was of mixed descent, the clan would not accept her. Bowing to the pressure exerted upon him, Menus did not marry his beloved and became an increasingly embittered, drunken shell of a man. These descendants of slaves who were refused refuge in towns peopled by fairskinned blacks promised themselves and their progeny that they would brook no marriages or alliances with those of a lighter hue. Ms. Morrison hammers home the point that this color discrimination is the result of slavery. Fornicating slavemasters gave their lightskinned offspring dominion over their darker brothers. The author's forth! rightness embarrassed me because it is painful to see blacks aping the prejudices of whites. Though Toni Morrison's book is painful because of its sharp points of truth about those who lose paradise, the magical, mystical, allegorical, symbolic, rambling tale she weaves makes the novel a riveting read."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Paradise may be found on this earth.Each individual has a choice to make. It is common for all to seek an utopia. The pursuit was a worthy one from Haven to Ruby. But possession usually brings disillusion. Ethnic cleansing even in today's world is still exercised. The funding for the Arts and Science in Charlotte was abolished to purify the city morality standards. The attack on the convent is representative of this ignorance. The disappearance of the bodies was thought provoking. The author attempts to tie up the loose ends by the characters coming back&quot;to love begun&quot;. This reader feels the author should have edited and revised more. Perhaps she had a deadline to meet. Ele Mae"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"It was challenging, especially the first part of the book. I have found this difficulty with other books written by Morrison, which is why I have only read one other book (Tar Baby) by her. However, since Morrison is so well thought of in educational and literary circles, I decided it was important for me to give her another try. This is not an entertaining piece of literature. It makes the reader think about issues such as class, race, and gender. Morrison uses a lot of symbolism and it takes some thought to understand what she writes and to create knowledge from what she has written. This is the challenge. This is what makes it worth reading."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison has, I think, written a book which defines literature today. Through the non-linear narrative and the ethereal prose, Paradise provokes the reader to extend, expand herself in order to read in a new way. I was moved by the spirituality of her prose and the realization of the profound price of both faith and freedom.The novel isn't as solid as I had expected, and I was left feeling that the promise of the opening sequence was not fulfilled."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"My thoughts on Ms. Morrison's Paradise can be summarized into three distinct ways: empathizing with the women who lived in the convent, understanding their individual tragedies and learning the secret - that is, let their feelings of Paradise penetrate you (see if you can achieve the status of being inlet to the womens' stories).As the story begins with the assault on the convent, you don't quite understand why what is happening is happening. Until you continue on to Mavis (and her battered wife stories), and Seneca and Divine and Consolata, and learn about their individual tragedies. Empathizing with each one.I felt I was reading the stories of a &quot;circle of friends,&quot; the nature of which was bound by friendship, love and strength inside the convent. I thought the use of Latin in Consolata was brilliant - almost as if I can hear her praying to God for salvation. Salvation, perhaps, from the tragedy of losing her baby. Or salvation from guilt she felt for having men in her life who did not love her. It was an almost lyrical quality in the story. The ability to understand these stories; like how Mavis had to leave her life because she had been to a hospital fifteen times (four for childbirth) for being beaten is important. It enables you to clearly see the way in which Paradise is so important to these ladies.Once you reach the end, and find the rapid, racing pace at which the assault on the convent begins (and more of its details), you feel a sense of security that surrounds the safety of these women and you don't want it to be violated.By this point in the book, I felt I became one of the characters. You feel assaulted in your own Paradise because you know the secrets. You also know, understand and appreciate the struggles and ensuing salvations it took to get you to this point.Absolutely one of the finest novels I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison presents a complex, cautionary tale of the uses and misuses of racial pride, ancestor worship, chauvinism, and spirituality/religiosity. I wouldn't say this is a must-read, but I did find it thought-provoking and challenging."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This is Morrison's best novel ; an intricate and enthralling examination of topics as diverse as moral machismo , ageism , self corruption , sexual freedom and the very nature of the human soul ! The power of these ideas and this novel in general do not , however , lie souly in Morrisons ability to engauge her audience in phillisophical theorising but equally in her ability to entertain with a good story and delight with fantastic desciptions , images and brilliantly alagorical occurances ......"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"\\"They shoot the white girl first. With the rest they can take their time. No need to hurry out here. They are seventeen miles from a town, which has ninety miles between it and any other. Hiding places will be plentiful in the Convent, but there is time and the day has just begun.&quot; And so begins Toni Morrison's Paradise. With such great works as Song of Solomon, Beloved, and Jazz, Nobel Award winning author Toni Morrison brings back her original writing style with her first book in over 8 years. Set in 1978, Morrison takes the reader deep into the heart of Oklahoma just as the 2nd World War is coming to an end. As always Morrison is not afraid to discuss the relations between race and gender, as many of life's lessons are dealt with throughout the book, with at times devastating consequences. Morrison's Paradise should be read by everyone, it's the type of book you won't want to put down, and it will linger in your mind for days to come."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Classic Toni Morrison. Thought provoking with multiple hidden messages. Clearly a story that illustrates what men are truly afraid of--a 'culture' of women who don't need them. Historical significance of all Black township must not be overlooked. Less dense than Beloved but much stronger message. A must read."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I do not find many books to be interesting and stimulating enough to even write a review about them. However, this book is a very exquisite piece of fiction. If you are reading these reviews and have doubts about this book, please read it. There are so many symbols, and various structural levels to the book that a less experienced reader would find it impossible. If you consider yourself a sophisticated reader, you will certainly love this."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Half-way through the novel, I found myself reading readers' reviews of this book on amazon.com. I was both facinated and dismayed by the disparity in opinions I encountered but a thorough re-reading of the reviews convinced me that the major distinction was between those who know how to read literature and those who find underlying plots and meanings in texts so elusive. To read Toni Morrison, one not only has to pick up any of her books with the frame of mind that this is not merely a book but a reflection of history and an exploration of idenity, but also to famliarise onself with the general themes that run through her books. The constancy in Toni Morrison's works is facinating, for although, the characters acquire new names, are set in different spatio-temporal dimensions and act out new roles, the text invariably exists in a point of time where the words are elevated above the mere persona of the characters to represent issues at the heart of each black individual. Toni Morrison is an artist, an intelligent writer and a sensitive stylist. To read Morrison is to touch history, to live it and learn from it. Her books are a saga of conflicting identities and how one can learn the art of self-assertion and belonging without losing one's subjectivity."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I thought perhaps I had lost abilities to comprehend and enjoy reading as I plowed through these stories.I have read Morrison before too! The style did not spur me on; just diligence. I think I understand it, caught sub ideas, etc.,but mostly bored by her characters, but surely am glad to be done with it. No wonder the owner loaned it and said &quot;...don&quot;t worry about getting it back to me...&quot;."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"My book club just finished reading Paradise, and I was the only one who liked it (and one of only a few who finished it.) I was also the only one who took the time to jot notes as I read, so that I could keep track of the characters and story. It didn't take anything away from the reading experience to take these notes. On the contrary, it enhanced it immeasurably. I was disappointed in my clubmates for giving up so easily. I would have liked for them to all have finished and understood it, so I could discuss it with them in the thorough manner it deserves. Yes, it was a difficult book. No, difficult does not equal bad. Have we as a society lost our love of a challenge? Are good things no longer worth working toward? I thought it was a mesmerizing story because I understood it. I didn't understand it because of my intellectual superiority, but because of my work ethic."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"just thought you would like to know that Morgan State University is using this book for their &quot;Junior&quot; class in English."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I am a fairly sophisticated reader. I read a book a week, and was an English major and have read many of the great classics. But for the life of me I don't have a clue as to what Ms. Morrison is trying to say here. There is no doubt that she is a talented and skilled writer. Her descriptions and some scenes are striking. However, she is all over the map here. There are so many unnecessary characters in this book that the average reader will be completely lost. Who is who and how are they related to one another? After awhile, a reader will just give up. I have read two other of the author's books, but after this one I will not attempt any future ones. I think Toni Morrison is one of our most overrated American authors and has been given literary prizes simply because no one knows what the heck she is saying."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison is a writer who does not spoon-feed you her work. Story lines are interwoven, emotions confusing and startling, and if you're looking for a neat and complete Hollywood ending you've definitely come to the wrong place with any of her writings. The incongruities of her writing is the genius of her writing and she deserves nothing less than a permanent space in literary history for this amazing piece of work. She imagines an entire town and describes every single aspect of it, from the street names to population's bloodlines to the religion that separates them. This is an amazing piece of work that has changed the way I view literature. And for those who are trying to figure out if the women died and which one was white... that very query is the point. It's the intentional hypothetical question that remains the genius of all of Toni Morrison's work."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I want to start off by saying that Toni Morrison is an author that only the brave try to read and understand. I've read Sula, Bluest Eye, and I am still trying to figure out Song of Solomon. I really did enjoy them all. Yet, some people may complain about her style of writing or the fact that &quot;Paradise&quot; has an enormous amount of characters, but I see it another way.&quot;Paradise&quot; is a beautiful story about the choices that people make and how they affect community; it's a story about following your heart. I know, in my case, that as I read the story, I was constantly finding that I had something in common with each of her characters. From Soane Morgan's indecisiveness to Roger Best's desire to please, to Pallas Truelove's search for true love. Each character has its purpose in the story no matter how small a part. And that is one of the things that makes &quot;Paradise&quot; a well-written book. Sure Morrison could have clearly left some of the characters out of the story but the story would not have been the same.Morrison is known for taking readers on a trip where they are constantly traveling back and forth through time. But I was okay with it because I took a few notes. I also found myself captured by each character's story, which made it a hard book to put down.I believe that &quot;Paradise&quot; is a work of poetry. The prose of life. The story of pride and prejudices. The exploration of cause and effect. All these things are intertwined in the story because these are the things that make life what it is. And these things are so successfully used by Morrison in the book, that Paradise will always be a read that forces you to reflect on your own life after you are done.I will not lie and say that &quot;Paradise&quot; is an easy book to follow or that it is a book that you will only have to read once to understand. I read it for the third time and I am still pick up on things in the story that I either overlooked or didn't understand. And the shocking part is that each time I read the story, I find that it is just as intriguing and interesting as it was the first time. But that's what great about Toni Morrison books. It takes time and dedication to read."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"A lush, well written story is one of life's pleasures. This book has countless lush, well written passages that I'll remember or want to recall for their insightful grasps of wisdom. As an added bonus,I also found &quot;tolerance&quot; to be a learning point for me from this reading. But then there is another side to this book that is maddening. The story is full of clues and if you expect Morrison to tie it all together neatly in the end you will be disappointed. I am now reading and rereading parts, especially the beginning, to try to understand what exactly Morrison wants us to understand about what happened to the convent women. (This is not an easy task since mid-way through the story Morrison introduces truly fictional phenomena, thereby making a logical approach questionable.) This book is like a well planned crossword puzzle minus the solution. After struggling for a while you begin to wonder if one exists. Toni, have mercy on us mortals; I have small children who need my attention! It would be nice to know if Morrison wanted to leave Paradise open to interpretation (how poetic)or if she felt an astute reader would find her intended meaning. Given Morrison's acknowledged talent, together with the care and elaborate detail put into this story, you may not be able to rest well until you think you have put it together."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This is the first Toni Morrison book I've read, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was hard for me to find a groove in reading Paradise. First, there are SO many characters and names and family ties etc. Second, there were plenty of subplots. As I was reading, I had to take several breaks because it was hard to digest all the information. I was actually stressed about this book. Was it only me that had difficulty in reading this book?With that said, I would like to say that all the stress was worth it in the end. At the half way mark, I was able to put info together and it started getting good. I really felt for all the female characters in this book, as well as a couple of the male characters. I won't give any spoilers, but the two characters who were almost star crossed lovers was the biggest subplot surprise. I was really rooting for them in the end, although it definately wasn't rational.Great read if you stick with it."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I wish I had \\"discovered\\" Toni Morrison earlier. As good as this is, Song of Solomon (by Morrison) tops it.Buy them both. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I have read some amazing books by this woman, but I think Paradise is her best piece of work. It is a mixture of Faulkner, Rushdie and Ms. Morrison's established style of writing. I found myself as equally fascinated as the characters in her book about the phrase &quot;Be the furrow of His brow&quot; or &quot;Beware the furrow of His Brow&quot;. The difference in meaning is huge and I think central to the main event of the book - the gunning down of the &quot;outsiders&quot; in the convent. Morrison shows the danger of obsession - be it obsession with a human being, race or religion. There is a thin line between being extremely religious/godly and becoming a self-appointed &quot;God&quot;. I think this book demonstrates that well and I would encourage any serious readers of English literature to read this! To those who enjoyed it, may I recommend Salman Rushdie's &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; to you - another excellent piece of literature."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"i fully enjoyed paradise. yes, it is difficult to get through, and yes she can be vague at times. i think that is the beauty of toni morrison's writing style though. you must be patient and you must be able to sit down, give the book your full attention and read it slowly. to enjoy the full meaning of her books you cannot read them fast. they are slow moving books that need patience. it is also definately not a writing style that all appriciate or enjoy. i would not recommend this book to a person who hasn't read a book in awhile or is not used to reading a modernist or postmodernist style of writing. without being used to non-linear plot lines, i cannot imagine being able to follow paradise. yet, if you can get through it, and appriciate it, it is definately worth it. toni morrison is one of the most gifted writers today and every book i read of hers is a different, rich, amazing joy. to all who haven't read beloved, which thus far, is my personal favorite."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"...I started to withold .25 star out of contrariness, wishing there was a version of this book available for those who prefer more linear narratives. That way, the ideas in Ms Morrison's writings might get a larger audience. She takes us into places in our hearts we recognize and refuse to confront, with topics like sexual exploitation of women by men; sexual exploitation of women by other women; child abuse; adultery; the lost promise of Reconstruction; Black color-casting; the nature of wealth(land versus cash); the Depression; the Fifties; Vietnam; the Seventies slide into anarchy; sexism; the Black Church, midwifery and folk medicine. Of course, racism and its brutal aftereffects is always an issue in Ms Morrison's work. It's clever how she links the past with the brutal here and now, when we still don't know what to do with all that hurt. I am always amazed that so many people say Ms Morrison's books are too hard to read. I say, that's ok - they're supposed to be. Feel the pleasure of reading your favorite best-selling storytellers, mystery authors, and thriller-writers (I do!); just know that when you read a Morrison book you need to set aside some time to savor it. It's worth the work. MAS"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I went through and read all 180 some reveiws submitted before mine. I'm kind of sorry that I did. What people expect of books today is just unimaginable.A book isn't a book because all the periods are in the right spot and everything is spelled perfectly. A book is a book because it tells a story and NO, not always from beginning to end. Life would be incredibly boring if everything went beginning to end.Toni Morrison has escaped that cliched book. Just read Beloved and you'll see an earlier version. Her writing is more of an art, than a pain. Grammar and spelling are tools she uses to explain herself, to show the story. (in Beloved she even goes so far as to invent new words, Omigosh!!) It's a beautiful thing if you can manage it and many have tried to imitate her...but Morrison is a Shakespeare of the 90's. (don't jump all over this, I'm saying there are parallels between the two, not that Morrison will be forever memorialized as Shakespeare has) You don't read Shakespeare as a light read. You don't read a little of The Tempest before bed each night. There is a purpose to his plays just as there is a purpose to Morrison's books. You HAVE to look at them. You HAVE to think. And, if you think reading is just for recreation, fine...don't read Morrison, don't read Shakespeare. But, if you are willing to take a chance, to think, to go in-depth on a book, then pick up Paradise. Or, pick up Beloved, Song of Solomon, The Bluest Eye or any of her other books. Morrison will make you think about bigotry (not just racially but physical, mental and financial) in ways you never imagined."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"As a longtime fan of Ms. Morrison's work, I absolutely enjoyed this novel. I was actually reluctant to put it down at the very end, as I was so engaged in Morrison's world. As always, Morrison creates an intriguing world and characters I couldn't help but to be drawn to with her gorgeous and lyrical prose. The novel unfolds as you read it, so that the reader is absolutely confused in the first several chapters of the novel, yet (mostly) all is made clear by the end. Trust me, Oprah was right when she advised readers to &quot;hang in there&quot;!One caveat: do not attempt to read this novel as &quot;light reading&quot; or something to read bit by bit before bed. I began this novel while I was in school and was absolutely perplexed; I picked it up again during break and was in love! For those open to Morrison's nonlinear style and willing to commit themselves to a book that will alternately confound and astound them, I highly recommend &quot;Paradise&quot;!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison's latest novel, Paradise, demands that the reader trust her and relinquish control to her masterful storytelling abilities. Any attempts to prejudge, project, theorize, or precede the narrative revelations only create confusion and frustration. Relax and revel in the moment with the author, even if that moment is past-present time, real-imagined event, male-female perspective, personal-societal experience. The sting of remembered rejection, the nobility of pride and traditions, the clash of youth and maturity in their aspirations for the future, the differing male and female accommodation and interpretation of events, the suspicion of non-traditional female roles, and the need to maintain normalcy are all reflected in a small black town in Oklahoma.If you need definitive answers, there are none, you'll have to &quot;roll your own&quot;. There are only opportunities to witness and share the personal histories, individual motivations, interpersonal dynamics, and general vagaries of life that transform this flat Oklahoma landscape into a curiously textured multileveled community of shared and complicit life experiences."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The word 'paradise' has utopian and religious connotations. Morrison, in her book, does not hesitate to utilize Biblical allusions - exodus, sin, and salvation. She begins her book with a poem, which I think reinforces the traditional view of a division between the secular and religious worlds. Indeed, the entire book seems to validate this passage; the first line in the section entitled Ruby, &quot;They shoot the white girl first&quot;, hints that Paradise critiques those New Age and utopian thinkers who believe that there can be a heaven on Earth. Although the first line has racial and gender connotations, race and gender in the remainder of the book become secondary. For Paradise not only portrays conflicts between whites and blacks and between men and women, but also between vice and virtue, old testament god and new testament god, and tradition and progress. These issues comprise a small part of human existence but they have frequently been raised. Their endurance make any utopia impossible, as the fate of the women in the Convent demonstrate.What has Paradise accomplished? Mainly, it proves that paradise is not a physical place resembling the Garden of Eden. But more importantly, Paradise criticizes utopian conceptions as delusional and harmful. However, Morrison rescues the pragmatist from despair. I believe that she conceives of paradise on earth as being a state of livelihood. Unfortunately, this is vaguely implied. One criticism of the book is that Morrison fails to adequately discuss as to what constitutes paradise. Overall, Paradise raises disturbing issues and is thought-provoking because it raises doubts about the civility of humans."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This book was very confusing, challenging and enjoyable all at the same time. The characters were well developed and the story caused me to think and contemplate life in ways that I had not thought of before. After reading this novel I thought for days about the various characters and what had happened to them. I have to admit that I made a list of characters and who they were related to in order to help me through the text. This novels is certainly a good read but I am not sure that Toni Morrison needs to make her writing so difficult in order to inform and stimulate her readers. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"My irritation overflows at Oprah for promoting a book with such inthusiasm that is so painful to slog through. Had it been a movie I would have walked out. Because I had faith in her selection powers I finished the book. I couldn't regret it more."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I've read most of Toni Morrison's works -- some more than once. All have offered profound histories and experiences of the African American's external and internal journeys through the evolution of America. The precise obliqueness of Toni Morrison's words, particularly in Paradise have made me more knowledgable, more appreciative, more connected to myself and to the African American Woman. The power of this book is in its ability to make the reader feel emotions, contemplate perspectives after the words have already been read -- absorbed. The women of this book via the author's overt landscaping of their pain subtley crept into my head and heart and have stayed there. And lately when I observe, interact, or challenge parts of my everyday life, they linger in the background -- affecting me and others. I closed the last page of Paradise gently -- respectfully. I didn't want to the book to end, but I knew the women of Paradise would not leave me. How often can you say that about a bestseller.!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I enjoyed Paradise. Toni Morrison certainly has a distinctive style of writing. It sort of keeps you in the dark and tantalized at the same time. She answers your questions slowly and on a seemingly need-to-know basis only. By the time I understood the nuances of the book (at the end), I felt like I needed to go back and start it all over again and read it with my new understanding. I found it to be very enjoyable, perplexing, complex and compelling. I could not put it down and never once thought of abandoning the effort!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I'M A WRITER MYSELF, AND A VERY ACTIVE READER, BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT SOMETIMES I GOT LOST AND HAD TO GO BACK AND FIGURE OUT WHO WAS WHO IN HER NOVEL, BUT...SO WHAT? IT WAS WELL WORTH THE READ, HER LYRICS ALONE IN THE NOVEL SHE WOVE ARE ENOUGH TO DRAW A READER IN AND MAKE THEM WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE WOMEN OF CONVENT, THE WOMEN OF RUBY AND THE MEN OF RUBY. WHILE I WILL NOT SAY IT IS HER BEST NOVEL YET, THAT TITLE STILL BELONGS TO SONG OF SOLOMON, IT IS ONE OF HER BEST. MORRISON CAN MAKE A READER THINK SHE IS DESCRIBING THEM OR SOMEONE THEY KNOW OR ARE VERY CLOSE TO, HER IMAGES OF THE WOMEN OF CONVENT AND THE TOWN OF RUBY AND ITS INHABITANTS ARE DEAD ON. MORRISON'S LATEST NOVEL IS GENIUS."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I was eager to read this novel after hearing so much about it. To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. I was told the book was &quot;a hard read&quot; and quite frankly I resented that label. I consider myself an intelligent person, capable of following and understanding a novel. However, I am embarrassed to admit that I truly did not understand a lot about the book. There were far too many characters, their lives and names all got mixed together and I had to keep going back to past chapters to get them straight. I kept reading and telling myself that somehow at the end of the book all of this will come together and make sense. Needless to say none of it did. Also, Connie's &quot;powers&quot; totally eluded me. Somehow I was not expecting something like that to enter into the story. I suppose I should read it again but I know I never will. I resent having to read a novel twice in order to understand it. Having said that I can only wonder why so many are calling it &quot;her best book yet&quot;."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Morrison, at least to judge the reviews listed here, is quickly growing to be quite a controversy. (and personal to the MA, Phd, etc... If pieces of paper counted for brain size, I would bow down in awe. Just because YOU didn't get it, doesn't mean diddly. I GOT it, and so do a lot of other people. Get off your high horse and stick to your opinion). So what is _Paradise_? Like _Jazz_ before it, Morrison is trying to put the focus on the characters, rather than a central plot, ala Joyce and Faulkner. And her characters are fabulous: The women of the convent and the townspeople are all fully formed, complex, and often surprise you. This is already an improvement over _Jazz_, which to me lacked much of any cognizance at all. The problem is the plot, and the way it is presented. By skipping around, Morrison gives us a long series of interelated short stories that is difficult to maintain interest in over this length. Joyce and Faulkner pulled this sort of stuff off, but it took Joyce SEVEN YEARS to write _Ulysses_, and he wasn't trying to change anybody's perceptions, just point out the uniqueness of life in everyday Dublin.Perhaps, then, Morrison should either give us a formal flowing book (in the history of _Song of Solomon_), or simply line up the characters of the Black South and let us take a look without the noisy background. Morrison can be great, but in the long run I don't think this will be remembered as one of her greatest."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"To fully grasp the meaning of what's written in this book, you would have to read and study each page like you were reading Shapespeare. It's not Shakespeare, however, just bad writing.I wouldn't complain had it not been for Oprah Winfrey's statement that it was the best book she ever read. It was one of my worst.Paragraps go to two pages, thoughts ramble dreamlike, character development is spotty and her thoughts from inside the male mind laughable. It could have been good, but fell well short of the goal."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Paradise isn't a conventional read, so it's understandable that a good number of people find it difficult, confusing or unproductive. I shared those same feelings when I first read another of her novels, Jazz. Since then, for various reasons (including the persistence of some good friends) I've gone back and read all of Morrison's books. In the process, I re-learned how to read. Beloved, Song of Solomon, Sula; these are works that have simple requirements of the reader -- to trust the story and its teller; to enjoy the language, scenes, and people; but to above all re-read. Similarly, Paradise emerges from a tradition of modern writing that rewards, even demands, careful re-reading. One has to learn to enjoy discovering the story and its insights, rather than having both handed to you. One also has to understand that the unconventional form of the story can possibly tell you more than its content could (Exhibits A: Woolf's Mrs Dalloway, Faulkner's Absalom, and Beloved).In Paradise, Morrison fully assumes a posture toward storytelling that she's played with since Tar Baby: that a novel's insights ought to be fragmentary in nature and almost missed, scattered throughout the pages and paragraphs, not foreshadowed and located at the end of a chapter. That you will come across a moment just as you would in life. And so you may not realize its importance the first time, or you may realize something significant is unfolding, but its meaning will require study and contemplation.Learning to deal with this particular demand on reading has helped me enjoy novels by Morrison and other great writers, who (whether or not they provide That Satisfying Ending) have always hidden their best in various passages, waiting for the patient and perceptive to discover them, quite often in the 2nd, 3rd or 5th read. Of all her books, I think Paradise would be the most inappropriate for someone looking for a traditionally satisfying reader's experience. And since I'd really hate for more people to close the book disappointed (those things are expensive) I'd recommend The Bluest Eye first, then Song of Solomon, Sula, Beloved, then Paradise, a deeply thought-provoking read, and among her best."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"...but once you get the hang of the structure, it gets a little easier to follow. I did not say easy, just easier. But if you read Toni MOrrison, you have come to expect a few challenges. When I finished I was pleased with the novel. It still stands as one of my favories. The prose, characters and the whole tone of the book are distrubing, but necessary to really understand the struggle these women, the town and our history had to have faced. It all culminates in a little suspense and a big surprise in the end-- that you may or may not expect or understand. But take a chance, a little confusion is good for the soul."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"After reading Paradise, I found myself going back and rereading parts of the text. Toni Morrison is a breathtaking, experienced writer who proves why she won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993. This book really talks about two cultures, the male-dominated Ruby, Oklahoma and a Convent run by Catholic nuns who also take in women seeking refuge. The first chapter named Ruby explains the circumstances surrounding the possible massacre at the Convent caused by the angry men of Ruby who sees the Convent as a threat to their community. The women are described as weird for leaving their abusive husbands and families for the convent. Their minister preaches that the place is a coven rather than a convent. In actuality, the place is a refuge or sanctuary for the women of the convent. Not all are nuns, the other women in the convent don't take vows but they do respect the lives of the nuns and they become an unorthodox, non-traditional community and support group for each other. For them, this Convent has become paradise since it's a haven from the abusive world of men. Morrison doesn't imply or suggest that the women are actually lovers but there are hints of lesbianism among them. It's not like they don't have their share of problems. The women are viewed by the locales as weirdoes and outsiders. The men don't understand why the women live there alone by choice. It's because the men's behavior of constant abuse whether they have been beaten or raped is what draws the women there. Morrison writes on each female character after Ruby like Mavis, Grace, Divine, Colosanta, and others. The chapters help explain what motivates women to go there seeking a non-threatening and non-abusive environment. In a sense, that is what Paradise is about for these women. In actuality, women's choices were few which included either entering the Convent or marrying and producing. Women who did not enter the convent or marry and become mothers became an object of scorn and curiousity. The unmarried women are the subject of rumors but even more so over the centuries. The Convent where the Sisters of any order live is a sanctuary and there are healthy relationships and unhealthy relationships as in all families. The sisterhood whether it's ordained by the Catholic Church or by a group of women comes together to support each other in a man's world. I was very impressed by Morrison's book. I think she gets better with each one over time."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I've just finished reading &quot;paradise&quot; and am still mulling over what I have experienced. At the outset let me say I am male, white and a Canadian. My knowledge of the black experience is limited. I first saw the movie version of &quot;Beloved&quot;, and knew there must be more. I then read the book. I became a Toni Morrison fan. Next came a birthday gift in a book called &quot;Paradise&quot;. From my standpoint I ask was there a place or is there a place like Ruby? Were there all black towns in America? Morrison says yes and we find a town really without color. Only casual reference to the war between the races. But the conflicts in Ruby are all too familiar. I think Morrison is holding up a mirror and daring all of us to look in. We might not like what we see. But what we see is familiar. The element of mystery is disconcerting. The resolution is not clear. But so is life itself. Without the mystery there is no point in seeking. Toni Morrison has no more answers to the mystery of life than anyone reading this review. She has the courage to venture forth in her mind to offer her insight. And her insight makes it worthwhile to keep turning the pages. In Beloved and now Paradise; I have learned something about the black experience in America. Paradise shows that what we are and what we believe is behind our color and lodged in our mind. A thousand Rubys will not make the world right. That problem is our own. All of us. Paradise waits..."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Paradise is brilliant, thought-provoking, disturbing, and beautiful. Anyone looking for a story other than the quick and empty bestsellers available should read this book. It isn't an &quot;easy read&quot;, it is meant to be READ. I applaud Ms. Morrison for challenging me to use my ability to read, think and react, and I feel privledged to read a great literary work that was actually written in my lifetime. This book should be discussed for decades in American Literature courses taught at Universities across this nation. Paradise lives up to its title."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I will freely admit that I did not really want to read 'Paradise' but I sat down one morning at 11am and didn't move until 8pm, having read the book cover-to-cover in a single day. It was absolutely wonderful, the characters were good (though confusing at first) but above all it is the style and themes which are important here, the characters are simply a method of conveying them to the reader. I would recommend this book to anyone, and it is interesting whilst reading, and after, to consider the relationship of the title to the content of the book: What expectations does the word 'paradise' give you? How does the book affect your idea of paradise? The enforced idyll of Ruby against the freedom of the Convent. 'Paradise' is a very powerful book which effectively questioned some of my values and ideas, and it is perhaps this, overall, which made it great."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison's \\"Paradise\\" begins with the brutal murder of several women by a posse bent on ethical cleansing of their small town, Ruby. The tale is told in a circular fashion, beginning and ending in the same place. Morrison reveals the rise of Ruby through the eyes of the women who become its ethical sacrifice.I go back and forth on my views on Toni Morrison. I really enjoyed \\"The Bluest Eye,\\" I am not sure what I thought of \\"Beloved,\\" and I did and did not like \\"Paradise.\\" I thought Morrison took too long \\"getting there\\" in \\"Paradise.\\" I do enjoy her writing style as a whole. Morrison is a master wordsmith and her style is so free flowing that one must really struggle not to be caught up in it.Give it a whirl, but don't expect too much out of this book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"this seems to be a very difuse narrative, after reading part of it i had to put it down with a sense of not knowing what i was reading. the people in the story seem to have lost connection and the tale is hard to follow"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I, along with many of your readers, found this book to be very disjointed and difficult to read. Many of the characters were poorly developed and their relationships quite unclear. The plot, while brilliant in its intentions, was slow to unfold and had glaring holes. Basically, I enjoyed one chapter and am sorry I finished the book (always waiting for it to finally get interesting)."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I am a student who had chosen this book to do a presentation on. It is the worst mistake of my life. The characters are flat and unrealistic, the author jumps from scene to scene without allowing the reader to understand properly what happened previously. I am quite disappointed with this book as i had all negative things to say about it and i had expected better. After reading this book i would never read one of her books again."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I'm an avid reader &amp; usually can't put a book down until I finish it. This one I couldn't wait to put down. The scenes/characters changed without any tranisition. I had to force myself to finish reading it."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This has to be one of her worst. She must have combined about 5 brainstorms of book topics and wrote one book. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Toni's but come on!!!!Toni, Toni, Toni. I'll give it one star since I was crazy enough to buy it and another for attempting to read it. There is no way on God's green earth, that this could become a movie. If anyone even thinks about it, I'll play one or more of the many characters myself. Just to see how far it goes and get a good laugh out of the cast confusion."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The first ten pages where great. Then she lost me. The weaving story structure left me with indiscernible characters lacking motivation for almost everything they did, and a shifting plot I could never get my head around. Toni leaves far too much for the reader to decipher, and this makes the read laborious and slow.There are several points in the book however where her talent cannot be denied. Unfortunately, I did not feel it was worth wading through two hundred or so other pages to find said points. She had the makings of another masterpiece if she had been a bit more patient and willing to bring focus to many of the fog-laden chapters."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The interlaced tensions created in &quot;Paradise&quot; by pairs of diametrically opposed characters, institutions, and beliefs makes one wonder if the story's title is revelatory or simple wordplay. I opt for the former. Indeed, there will always be two sides of Paradise - the inside and the outside - whether it is a physical state or a spiritual state. But the exclusivity that some Paradises ruthlessly require for their existence can weaken and crumble the very walls that enclose and nourish it. Is then the sparkle of Ruby dulled by an internal flaw or a mischievous glint of light?"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This book has bits and pieces which is not possible to analyse at the first time. Everytime we read there is something new to discover. It is a good book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I heeded all of the warnings , took this book very slowly, kept track of all of the characters, took notes, went back to previous chapters to understand characters and situations. I thought I was doing very well until I got to the end. WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT! I didn't get it! I felt that all of my hard work and time had been wasted. Please somebody explain to me what the ending was all about! I am an avid reader and take great offense to previous readers claiming that If you didn't like this book, you're not intelligent. To the charming 18 year old reader who basically said that if you don't like this book you're stupid, soley is spelled s-o-l-e-y not soaly. Honey, just because you claim to like and understand an Oprah recommended book, it doesn't make you intelligent or mature."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I read this book based on Oprah's declaration, &quot;It was the best book I've ever read&quot;. Well Oprah you lost credibility with me. It was the worst book I've ever read. I deplore Tony Morrison's writing style. Why can't she just SAY IT! Who wants to read a book three times to finally GET IT? Her nuances are simply not that interesting. Next time Oprah recommends one of her titles, I'll simply say, &quot;YUCK&quot;!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I was looking forward to reading Toni Morrison and decided I would start with Paradise. To say I was disappointed is quite an understatement. I was totally intrigued with the opening and thought to myself - &quot;why did Oprah say to hang in there&quot;? But as I continued to read I was frustrated and kept putting the book down. However, I did force myself to finish the book and when I was finished reading, I asked myself why I bothered to read it. After reading some of the other reviews I know I am not alone in my thinking. On the upside, I do plan to read &quot;Beloved&quot; and keep an open mind."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Paradise is by far one of the better books of our time. I find it interesting that most of the people who disliked this book cannot spell: &quot;Opra&quot; &quot;inthusiasm&quot;! Maybe these are typos but if so, what a pattern. Many people have given intelligent praise of this book, the well developed story, characters and rich language. For those of you who didn't understand it at all, try again, stopping to think about issues of race in our society today. Is it possible for us all to live together in harmony? What is paradise? I had the occasion to listen to Ms. Morrison speak about her book this spring and these were some of the questions she brought up for me. I realize my attack on people's spelling may be a bit harsh but I was angered to see that while &quot;Paradise&quot; received an average of 3 1/2 stars on Amazon, &quot;A Child called It&quot; received 4 1/2. Do people who post on this thing think? Or do you guys just like to read for the sake of pro! ving to others you can? I think Oprah perhaps had too much faith in her audience when recommending this book. While I can respect criticism of &quot;Paradise&quot; I cannot stand by while people slander this book simply because they didn't &quot;get it&quot;."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"As usual with Morrison's books, you truly have to be a &quot;thinker&quot; to enjoy her style of writing. I have always considered myself a pretty high level &quot;thinker&quot;. I understood the book with all of its twists and turns and character shifts. However, I feel that she took far too many liberties with the patience of her readers. Why would she possibly think it was OK to make this book almost intolerable to read. Was this book her soapbox? Where was the dialogue between characters. I feel she spent so much time rambling on and on, and then when you finally actually get to some concrete dialogue between the characters, you were relieved she had finally stepped aside and let her characters develop. At times, I was awe struck by her literary genius, and then all of a sudden, for several more pages, it was as if written by and adult with ADHD - impulsive, without organized thought, and rambling on and on without regard. I have to say this book is not one I! would recommend. It did not have to be this difficult to get through, it should have been a treasure, something to pass on to your friends, and a book that the memory of it is cherished, as many of her other books have been. We waited for so long for this book, and for it to be such a disappointment to so many, is a shame."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I had to pick a number so I shall take a positive approach. I've just purchased Beloved and Paradise - wish I'd read the reviews first! I now fear I have a somewhat daunting task ahead. Wish me luck!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The reviewers of this book have not been honest .There is nothing to praise.A struggling prose,contrived ideas and perhaps a feeling that as the Nobel Prize winner the writer had to come up with something different.Thoroughly confusing and poorly written.Very weak characters not worth writing about.Losers like Mavis.Perhaps they should have given two Nobels to Arundhaty Roy for her God Of Small Things."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I recommened this book for my book club, and was absolutely humiliated and embarrassed that I wasted everyone's time with this selection.What a waste of $28..."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I would've never read past page twenty if I wasn't forced to read this for my college English class. For a writer as prestigious as Tony Morrison one would assume that she has mastered the craft of novel writing. But it is clear that Tony Morrison still doesn't understand how to develop a strong plot as well as a clear theme. The story is misguided from the beginning as Morrison jumps back and forth from the town of Ruby and the characters of the convent. There are a million undeveloped characters and a number of confusing family trees. Morrison leaves it up to the reader to follow along with her shaky stream of consciousness, leaving the reader overwhelmed and bored. It is obvious that Morrison has taken advantage of her place as literary master. She has used her popularity and prestige to sell another book. All I can say is that I am glad I checked this book out at the local library instead of wasting money at the university bookstore."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I am a huge fan of Ms Morrison. IMO she should have won a Pulitzer for \\"The Bluest Eye\\". But I find her increasingly difficult to understand. Beginning with \\"Beloved\\", Ms. Morrison novels have taken on a mystical quality that bewilder and confuse me. Often I have to go back and re-read pages to find out which character is speaking or remembering or dreaming or what. I gave up on this one somewhere in the middle. I am now plowing through \\"Love\\" in which she uses the same tactic and it's a guessing game. I really wish she would return to her earlier style as exhibited in \\"The Bluest Eye\\", \\"Sula\\" and \\"Song of Solomon\\"."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I read Paradise for a project in my English class. The book was very difficult for the fact that it seems like Toni Morrison switched topics every few pages. With all of the different characters coming in and out of the convent and the town it was hard to keep up with what was going on with who. I just didn't care for the book at all. If i had to tell someone whether they should read the book I would definitely tell them not to read the book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I hate to dedicate so much time to finish a book that I really don't enjoy but I did finish this book. I was just sure it was going to get better. After I was done my only thought was Hmmmmmm."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The plot is confussing and weakly held together by the detailed personal stories. I found little that was morally redeeming or outstanding in this book. Having grown-up in Oklahoma, I found the book unauthentic. I cannot recommend this book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I started this book over a year ago. I have read everything that Toni Morrison has ever written, and I am determined to get back to this one as well. Ms. Morrison is a fabulous writer who knows how to weave a tale like no one else I have ever read. Her ability to develop characters and to tie them together in a way that is both cohesive and entertaining is wonderful. I was amazed when I read the reviews of this book at how people berate the book and each other because they &quot;don't get it.&quot; Although I have not finished this book it was not because it was too difficult, I simply could not maintain my interest in it. It is not the best book that I have read by Ms. Morrison (&quot;Sula&quot; was), but I am determined to start again from the beginning, since it has been a whole year since I picked it up, and then finish this book. At that time I will review it, but I needed to put my two cents in now."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"How I remember the way people were forced to read books by dead white european males, like Shakespeare or Dante or George Eliot. But all those guys are boring because they don't write about America, also they are so culturally limited and don't want to look outside their own narrow boundaries.I think we should have the freedom to read what we like, and basically Western Civilisation courses should be banned from university campuses because people are offended by them.Finally I think Toni Morrison was extremely insightful when she said that Bill Clinton was 'our first Black President', after all the main cause of death among black males is being killed by other black males, and Bill Clinton certainly sent plenty of black men to the gas chamber in Arkansas."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I've read almost all of the reviews of this book thus far and the general concencus is that Paradise is too complex. Well, don't read it!!! This book is not Green Eggs and Ham or some supermarket trash! It is a literary masterpiece and it angers me that so many have poo-pooed it because it requires the use of all 3% of human thinking capacity in the brain. Toni Morrison has shown us time and time again in all of her books that human thought is not linear. Most of our memories are not thought of chronologically, so then why should a book be written in that manner? If you are used to predictable and downright mundane storylines of common bestsellers, then Paradise is not for you. I am not saying that you have to be a Harvard grad to appreciate this treasure, but you do have to think; you may even need to take notes, but please, do not treat this fine wine like Kool-Aid just because you are not accustomed to drinking."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Halfway through Paradise, I was wishing I had had a pen and notepad from the beginning. The book is intricately woven, and the clues that I blew by (which twin drives a Chevy?) and then couldn't find again, bothered me to the end. This is a story that will clarify and deepen with repeated reading, but requires a lot of mental exercise."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"i enjoyed the book a lot! i wish there had been a &quot;family tree&quot; to refer to. it was difficult keeping everyone straight. good reading and lots of food for thought."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Paradise is a true literary work, in that, Morrison successfully labors to peal back the layers and reveal the interworkings of our consciousness and reality. Morrison is writing our conscious mind. The back and forth, in and out, up and down of the novel is how we think, and we do not think chronologically. We perform, ponder, postulate and plan all at the same time. Those who inaccurately descibe this novel as one full of disilusioned and controlling males and controlled and troubled women are unfortunately missing out on the beauty of the novel. They do not see that Morrison has created an earthly paradise that we are familiar with, but rarely, if ever, acknowledge. The characters are anything but one dimesional. Remember the &quot;living man,&quot; the &quot;8 rocks?&quot; Furethermore, I disagree that this is not a book for someone who is used to reading Grisham or the like. If you accept reality as an ongoing set of events, many which are somewho related, this novel is for you. If you appreciate the &quot;labor&quot; involved in weaving an amazing story such as this into a beautiful fiction success, you will revel in it from page 1. Moreover, those who decide its not worth it to partially or completly re-read miss out also. It only enhance the value of the novel. Would you buy a video that you never want to see again? Those critics will miss out on or misunderstood the meaning of Steward saying &quot;there is only one of me.&quot; I felt I was taking an enriching journey where I met interesting, beautiful people (with wonderful names) and each time I met someone, they reminded me of those I had already encountered, and pleasantly, I discovered that their lives are all realted in some way, that they all exist in the same realm. For these reasons, I think this novel is truly a literary achievement."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Paradise took me back to my early childhood and brought me forward to the '90s. Ms. Morrison placed me back to a time that I had forgotten. Through this book, I relived that history--especially travels through now forgotten primarily black towns. What a great read!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I had anticipated that this would be a tough read. Toni has an extraordinary gift of the written word but this novel was a disappointment. The characters were too complex. I could not determine where the story was headed. I tried hard not to put it down before the end but frustration won out. Maybe I will try to read it again later."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"of the book because I found it hard to follow. But, after reading the above reviews, I am willing to give it another try.I also found &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot; by John Berendt, hard to follow but I re-read that and found that an excellent book. So, maybe there's hope for &quot;Paradise&quot;."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I found myself drawn into the intricate plot -- the various stories woven around the many characters. Although I enjoy the musicality and rhythm of Morrison's writing (also present in her other novels), I found this particular work to be less joyful than her other novels -- less affirming, more preachy. At several instances in the novel, Morrison chooses to directly spell out her message (e.g. concerning God and love), rather than allow the readers to draw their own conclusions. The preachiness or the obviousness, for me at least, tended to distract from what I have always so enjoyed about her previous works, especially &quot;Beloved&quot; and &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; -- namely, a sense of the author's great affection and care for the people she creates in the novel, and the overall joy (sorry, I keep coming back to this word, but I have previously found it central to her work) despite immediate circumstances and social injustice.With this novel, I got the sense that she was more concerned with politics than story -- if this is what she chooses to do nowadays, that is fine. It is only that I personally preferred her earlier area of concentration -- which I felt was the state of the human being, the African American human being, across time and space. Thus, although I found the novel a digestible, dense read, and quite entertaining, I did not feel as involved with her characters' plights as in her other novels -- it appeared to me as if they were dead pieces being moved around in Morrison's political design, rather than living people undergoing the harrowing experiences she describes."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I turned the last page last week, and I picked it up again during my lunch break today. I was very intrigued by Paradise. It is absolutely fasinating. I understood what was going on throughout the book, but then I did not understand at the same time."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"At last! Something intelligent, stimulating, challanging and quiet frankly a feast of yummy writing that I could not put down. I honestly don't understand why people have found this novel to be confusing. After all, most T.V. shows jump around with their narratives, though admittedly, not around in time. It is refreshing to read the unpredictable. To be surprised and entertained by each character as they appear, clearly mind you, announced at the beginning of each chapter. As in Ruby, Mavis and so on. I love the fact that Toni Morrison has not stuck to the proverbial beginning, middle and end. To those who gave this book a low rating largely due to the fact that they couldn't figure it out. Stick to Wilber Smith, Mills and Boon et al. Why did I rate this book as a 9 instead of a 10? Well Ms Morrison, at the risk of sounding cheeky and disrespectful, I wished that you had put a recent photograph on the back cover. Hey Girl! I just love your hairstyle!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The author attempts something even good writers would find difficult. Her minimal talent fails her and the reader. The result is even worse than her usual."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Altough the first paragraph grabs your attention, the book is difficult to get thorough. Lots of names to remeber and sort out and the chronology jumps around alot. I think this is the best way to write a book though. Everything makes sense at the end, but ther is still questions to be answered with a second and even a third reading that really makes this a great book"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I loved this book. Like other Morrison novels Paradise has a good deal to say about misdirected anger, about turning harm inward (like The Bluest Eye) or in an arbitrary outward direction (like Song of Solomon) or upon the ones we most love (like Beloved). But central to this story is the dangerous notion of creating a paradise on earth. Things fall apart, the center will not hold.The prose is lush and the story not so hard as some might lead you to believe. I found I didn't need to worry about knowing who was doing what when; I merely had to trust the story to hand itself into my heart. Which it does. And there is redemption here, this is not a fatalistic vision to my eyes.A second read? Yes, of course. Always read the good ones more than once and they will be better. When I read it again, I can come back and rate this novel the 10 it surely deserves."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison is brilliant in her new book. I have the sensation that in review, I will find the characters even more multi-faceted than I first thought."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Morrison's story is brilliant, the characters are beautuful and the description's are breathtaking but the presentation makes Paradise nearly impossible to read. I had to struggle through the first few chapters to even find the strenght to continue reading this book. The telling of this story is confusing at best- and she interweaves past, present, good and evil before establishing any form to the characters Don't belive most of the early press reviews- they sound like they were writen out of the publishers ads and not by somebody who actually took the time to read this book. I stop short of calling this terrible, and only so because Paradise has tremendous potential to be all that it has been promised to be. Unfortunalty, Morrison's genius is blinding to both her story telling and those trying to read this book. I'm ,sorry, but I must disagree that if it must be read over and over before understanding- that does not make it automatically wonderful."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Twenty minutes ago, I finished reading PARADISE and let out a long sigh of amazement. What a beautiful symphony. A magical blend of myth, history, and morality. Lots of questions still swarm about in my mind, for instance many characters seem obviously symbolic and I'm still trying to figure out what their symbols stand for. Like BELOVED, its amazingly multi-layered. Its definitely a page turner - a glorious mystery with a suspenseful, powerful climax. Move over COLD MOUNTAIN, this is the best new book I've read in the past few years!! Toni, you're a lagend."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Paradise is not a easy read, but it is a must. The last two chapters I read with a fury I haven't read in a long time. I had to go and reread some passages to have it all make sense, but as Ms. Morrison said herself, &quot;That my dear, is called reading!&quot; A wonderful novel from a wonderful writer."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Morrison is guilty of turning writing into something of a hyper-conscious attempt at art. Authors have done so in the past with varying degrees of success---Shakespeare, for one, was extremely succesful, but Morrison is no Shakespeare and I very much doubt that her works will endure to the extent that our old Elizabethan friend's have, if at all. The crux of the matter lies in this: Morrison, in all of her self-conscious effort, has written a tale so complex and so multifaceted that it lacks a firm center, something for the average reader to hold on to. (English teachers love this sort of book; gives them a lot to talk about.) She foregrounds too many themes and places equal emphasis on all of them so that we, the readers, are left without a definite direction of thought. I am extremely skeptical when someone claims that they have read Paradise and that they &quot;get it.&quot; One can &quot;get&quot; a theme here and there, but I have yet to meet someone who understands the novel as a whole, and I really don't believe that I ever will. Morrison has neglected to include an overarching point to Paradise, and as so, has neglected the reader."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This novel hurls you into a situation leavin you dazed and confused. It is difficult to understand what exactly is going on. The actual story is great though Tonie Morrison's writing style is confusing. I do not recommend this novel unless you have a lot of time on your hands to take notes on the story line."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This is not the book to pick up if you are only just discovering Morrison as a writer. It's not a book that reads easily, nor one heavy on the nostalgic narrative that can been seen in some of Morrison's other works.Still, this book in many ways only deepens my respect of Morrison as an author. Here, she reveals that she is more than a storyteller. &quot;Paradise&quot; is a book fraught with paradigms and stereotypes, tangled with deceit, and weblike in its branching character relationships.More than once, in reading this book, I had to apply myself with diligence to untangling the identities of the many blurred characters. Gone were the long pages of dialogue that Morrison uses to flesh out some of her other works, like &quot;Beloved&quot; and &quot;The Bluest Eye.&quot;So, why then, give this book 4 stars? I think, in many ways, this is a most prophetic book. I find the feminist themes extremely well played, and the underlying themes of time and corruption give this text an almost Faulkner-ish taste. This is a book written for well-taught readers, for thinkers, and for those willing and ready to tackle a more oblique work."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This is the first work of Toni Morrison's that I've read; I'd wondered what all the talk was about--had heard she had received both Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes--wondered if she could live up to the expectations created about her. I was duly impressed by Paradise. It's something I could really sink my teeth into, thought-provoking, moving. Inciting. I'm now eager to read more of her novels, and learn more about her. I'm sure both will be fascinating. Recommended for the dedicated, open-minded reader."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"After hearing a snippet of Oprah describing this book as difficult, I braced myself as I embarked upon reading Paradise. Page after page, I waited for the confusion, but it never came! Having read all of Toni Morrison's novels, some in the classroom context, I think it was less confusing because I speak Morrison-ese. It's not a good choice for a first Morrison novel. As usual, Ms. Morrison's writing in Paradise is very rich and lyrical. She dances in and out of time and lives and characters in a way which could be hard to follow if you're trying to speed through this book. Although I do think one must have a sharp, analytical mind to &quot;get&quot; and enjoy this book, intelligence is not all that is neccessary. You must be willing to lose yourself in the images Morrison creates, to allow things to wash over you and seep in and mull them over. Paradise was absolutely beautiful, I think maybe even better than Beloved. I liken Morrison's writing to jazz music- it can be unexpected, with an unpredictable flow, certainly not a linear, patterned read. I loved this novel and would reccommend it to those who are willing to take their time on the journey through it's pages."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This is a harrowing story. A small group with a big dream has taken off to create their own paradise on earth. The original group is a brotherhood of black men and women of near-direct African descent, racially pure, &quot;8-rock&quot; dark. Rejected by whites and even blacks of less pure descent, they found their own, closed community.But like all racially closed communities, they have their own excellences and their own bigotry. Ultimately, they begin to see their own flaws.The women that gather at the Convent are a symptom of all the ills of the society the small town tried to escape. Rejected by the town, and leaning on each other, they manage an escape of their own, and perhaps attain a more meaningful paradise - in the real world.As usual, Morrison's writing is lyrical and laden with emotional imagery. However, characters are never truly developed, the highly symbolic scenes are difficult to string together into a storyline, and events are difficult to decipher. It is a challenging and difficult read, but a gripping story."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison is my favorite writer, and I won't hold this book against her. For me, though, my experience with Paradise began much the same as my experience with Beloved: I tried to read it a couple of times, got into the first few pages, then put it down. It seemed just so complex. In both cases, though, I finally picked up the book a third time and read it all the way through. I loved Beloved, but this book was different. It's basically about people in a black town who think that a lot of the evil in that town is due to the presence of the strange women who live in the \\"Convent\\". Toni takes a lot of time to develop the characters, and that is commendable, but there are just TOO many characters...in the end I got just plain confused, trying to keep up with who was married to whom, and who lost what child in what year. It just was a bit too busy for me. But to her credit, Toni Morrison, paints colorful imagery; I simply love the way she writes, and that's what is giving this book three stars. She is a master of her craft. Granted, I don't like to have my intelligence insulted by having the writer explain every little thing to me, but with this book, I'm like, \\"insult my intelligence already!\\" There were just so many unanswered questions for me in this book, and I don't think you should have to go back and re-read a book (what I'm doing now) just to understand what on earth is going on. This is a lengthy book, so if you've got some time to kill, and you enjoy a challenge, you may actually want to give it a try."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The best opening sentence I have read. The prose at times is pure poetry. Reading this book takes concentration, though. It is like putting together a puzzle. At times I was unclear and confused about what piece I was looking at. Then the images would become clearer and the piece of the puzzle would fall into place. I enjoyed this book even though I was often confused about where I was in the story and who I was reading about."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I have been a Toni Morrison fan for many years now. When I learned that she was putting out a new book I rushed out to buy it and had great expectations. I was not disappointed. I believe this to be Morrison's most profound work. The characters were so complex yet real. In her own unique style Toni Morrison has set out to teach a lesson to all those who chose to embark upon this journey to Paradise. Morrison shows that paradise is only what we make it and that what is perfect for one is not perfect for all. If you love a good, complex, and eye opening read then you will love this book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison is generally worth reading for her lush prose but in this particular book, the organization leaves the reader confused as to what happened to whom and when. I kept looking for the reason behind the obscure structure of the book. There are some powerful moments, especially toward the end, when describing the violence that men have felt towards unfettered women, but overall I was left disatisfied. This could have been a much more powerful book if the reader hadn't had to struggle so hard to figure out the histories of the characters."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I read this complex, meandering book for a college class, and at first hated it. It took intense concentration to get through the non-dialogue, and I don't know how many times I re-read certain passages or paragraphs or chapters. But it was worth re-reading. When it finally fell into place in my mind, I \\"got\\" it. I'm not sure I would read it again, but it was well-written and researched and most complex, but engaging and ultimately and finally enjoyable. If you don't like a challenge, don't read it. Clearly, Morrison wants you to think..."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Unlike some of the reviews I have read, I found this book easy to follow. I couldn't put the book down, I wanted to find out how all of the characters came together &amp; what their story was. It was definately an interesting story, which I enjoyed thoroughly. If you are a good listener, you will not have a problem following this book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This horrific excuse for a novel was, perhaps, the most blatant example of &quot;trying to be profound&quot; that I have ever seen in my literary career. Ms. Morrison so visibly is striving to make her transparent symbolism and pained allegory immediately manifest, it becomes frighteningly irksome to any reader, regardless of his or her ability to read the twisted and idly complex plot. This novel totally lacks any sort of linear progression that might have given it some sort of unified feeling of going in a certain direction. Albeit written in a fascinating style, this book lacks that which defines the great books of our time: a character with which the reader can identify. Morrison's characters are so revoltingly flat that one finds it almost physically painful to labour through this horrendous novel. And such is a horrific surprise coming from an author who has shown such incredible promise. This book is no reflection on her other works, which are perhaps among the greatest works of American literature. This was, as I strongly hope, just a fluke--Stockholm Syndrome perhaps."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I came to Paradise via audio tape and thought it the most convoluted, daunting, and confusing thing I had ever heard. I couldn't tell whether the time of the passages was present, near past, or far past. I couldn't tell who was who, who was related to whom, nor how the characters tied together. But I was reading it for a reading club of which I was a new member so I was determined to understand. And so I listened and listened and understanding came, and then appreciation, and then awe at the astounding power of this story and of the author who wrote it. And finally I was glad I had struggled through it because at the end of that literary journey I found an experience I had seldom felt, a kinship with the characters, a profound understanding of the passions and emotions of the women and men of the town and the convent. I am now purchasing the book and expect a joyful reunion with the humanity and inhumanity of Paradise."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I found out about this book through the Opra Winfre Show. This book was not at all what I expected it to be. I have tried reading and re-reading the book. This is one book that I feel that I have wasted my money on. I only bought it because Opra recommended it, and I thought Opra has good books to read in her book of the month club. Oh well, you can't win them all."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison has a way with words that is unbelievable. However, the plot of Paradise is so disjointed that it is almost impossible to follow. It was a chore to decipher what was happening. The theme of the book is one that should be presented and discussed. It is unfortunate that Paradise was not the vehicle to do this. Still, Morrison's use of words is fabulous even though most of the time they did not enhance the plot."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I am possibly in the minority, but I just didn't like it. I didn't think the author tied information together. I tried to keep going, like Oprah said, because the beginning is hard. I never found that it got easier or better. It was not a good read."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I read this book for a book club assignment. I enjoyed but wish I'd had paper and pencil to recordthe particulars of likes and dislikes. I noticed a similarity to Stephen King of whom I've only read 2 works. I read it in two days and don't regret the time. I'll probably read more of Morrison."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Ms. Morrison's command of the language is impressive-this particlar book is not. I have read and enjoyed the author's other books; this was a punishment for something that I did not know I had done!!!! If there was a lesson to be learned I must have missed it somewhere between pain and suffering:My own!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"If I could have given less than 1 star, I would have. I am not sure that I have ever read a worse book! I did not finish - didn't even get a third of the way through. Talk about overhyped!! What on earth was this all about? I confess that I didn't get it. If this is the level of book that is being promoted by Oprah, then I know why I am thankful I never have time to watch daytime television..."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I managed to read Paradise in it's entirety but it was a struggle. The concept was interesting, a group of blacks forming their own isolated community in order to build a &quot;Paradise&quot; and avoid all the pitfalls of society in general. Eventually those within the community who are able to see what is actually happening notice that their isolated society has become no different than what exists on the outside. They found that they have all the strengths and weaknesses that exist everywhere.I wish that Toni Morrison could have written with more clarity, the book was such a struggle to get through that I was frustrated after every page read. I was determined to finish and was thankful when I did. I'm wondering if she is overly impressed with herself (an award winning author) and took too many liberties. I couldn't tell the difference between what was reality to the characters and what was fantasy. She called a character by one name and in the following paragraph called them by something else. I felt the author was trying to test me to see if I was paying attention.I read for enjoyment and this had nothing to do with a good time."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Paradise as I've said the first time. My question though, which I failed to mention in my excitement that I followed and understood (not really a good word) the book is that: I did get lost in the last 8 or so pages. I remember Seneca and her story, but when the mother, in those pages, says she thought this was her daugher, ect., I was lost. I understood that each women had her story, and also that others were telling pieces of their story about each woman. I didn't remember anyone talking about this part of Seneca's like. Oh, well, it'll be more fun the next time around.This book was tops. Well, first, back to Beloved. I picked Beloved up in my Ph.D. program which was committing murder on top of suicide. So, I have lots and lots of good books to read, like Songs of Solomon, Bluest Eye, etc.I have the greatest respect for the author, Toni Morrison. She very brillantly brings her experience(s) to the pages without being bias, and without making the characters be her (in disguise) but have their own personality.I did not have this much understanding (there's that word again) of Beloved. I got through the first half of the book and clocked out. I picked it up, tried for about 3 months, put it down, up again about 6 months later, and down again now for over 3 years. Since I made it through the Ph.D, I'll try again, especially after the easy reading of Paradise. And, it is Paradise. How was that missed by those readers who so easily and quickly attacked Toni?My hats off to the author, intellect, writer, award winner, lady, ... !!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I've read most of Toni Morrison's work and anticipated the release of Paradise. I should learn not to set myself up like that. More complex and enigmatic than any of her other novels, Paradise waits far too long before giving the reader enough frame of reference to appreciate what's going on. The characters are interesting, but lack the multi-faceted quality that made books like &quot;Beloved&quot; and &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; so rich. There is merit to this book, I just didn't find that merit to be worth the effort of slogging through the murky depths of the convoluted storyline."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"after two weeks of reading, re-reading, and starting over. There are so many characters that float in and out and back again, not to mention the oven. Perhaps if I could find the time to read thru the whole book, I might catch on. Not a book I would suggest."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"VERY DEAD!!! I READ THE FIRST 21 PAGES IN 10 MIN AND ALREADY KNEW THIS BOOK WASN'T WORTH A LOOK AT. GOOD THING I DID GET IT FOR A $1.50. IT'S NOT INTERESTING AT ALL AND VERY BORING. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS TO MY DOG."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I'm one of those avid Toni Morrison fans who has read and enjoyed all of her books, so you can imagine my disappointment when I finally struggled my way through &quot;Paradise&quot; and realised that I didn't get it! Can anyone PLEASE explain the ending? Maybe the intelligent 18 year old from Ontario could illuminate our ignorant brains. Honey, you'll grow out of calling other people stupid as soon as you hit my age. Wisdom is a gift bestowed upon a few lucky ones."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"From the reviews posted here, Paradise seems to divide people into two seperate camps - those who gush &amp; gush, and those who feel ripped-off. I fall into the latter category. I am truly sorry to say that, as I enjoyed Beloved immensely. I look for books to affect me emotionally &amp; at the last page of Beloved, I was crying. However, reading Paradise felt like a chore. Like so many others, I forced myself to finish it. You can't imagine my relief on finally being able to put the damn book down! Out of pride I finished it, I wanted to be able to say,yes, I read it. Luckily, this didn't dissuade me of reading any other Toni Morrison novels. Immediately after reading Paradise, I read Song of Solomon, probably not wanting to leave such a bad taste in my mouth. Well, it worked and I think I'll pick up The Bluest Eye next."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"My excitement was peaked before I opened the book. Oprah's pick and everything. Ms. Morrison's interview with Ed Bradley of 60 minutes proved that this was a lady with intelligence, integrity, and style. The first sentence got my attention like Ms. Morrison intended. I read the first four pages without hardly breathing because I just knew that soon I would be drawn into this thing and not be able to put it down. I continued to read and I became angry. Angry with myself because I was not getting it. I put the book down for about a month and had to start over again, only to be reminded of my inital anger. I envy the people who appreciated this book. I really wanted to appreciate it and I really tried to appreciate it, but I kept thinking how easy it would have been to have written the book in the order the events occurred. I usually finish what I start, but not this time. I read more reviews to find out what I felt was important to know. I really wanted to know who was white. My hat is off to Ms. Morrison for that well-kept secret. It shouldn't matter, after all. If I could ask Ms. Morrison one question it would be a toss up between , &quot;Do you think the way you write?&quot; and &quot;What group of people out here did you want to appeal to?&quot; I have not read any of her books and it is unfortunate that I started with &quot;Paradise&quot; because now I am too angry to try any of them."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"One of the supremely happy moments in my life came about page 100, when I said to myself: &quot;I don't have to read this book, even if it came from a Nobel prize winner, and even though I'm out 25 bucks.&quot; Ms. Morrison may have deserved the Novel accolade for her body of work before she won the prize, but the money or fame or something has obviously created an impenetrable barrier between herself and good writing. She should give all the money back, including my $25."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Ms. Morrison is unbelievably amateurish and superficial. This book has little to recommend it but hype."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This is another overwritten, emotional screed from the highly overrated hack. Paper thin charactors, empty headed plot, and stiff, cliche ridden prose. Ms. Morrison is nothing more than a product of a politically correct and deluded Nobel committee and Oprah hype. A pitiful effort and complete waste of a reader's time and money."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"After reading all the good reviews and the fact that this book was on some cool people's list mania lists - I really wanted to read it and to like it. But after having bought it, I found it rather difficult to follow and understand.The charachters keep coming in and it's hard to keep track of who's who. You know they are all going to come together in the convent somehow but it's still hard to follow and make a connection. I consider myself to be an avid reader and reasonably intellectual but unfortunately I could not bring myself to finish this book. Maybe in a few years time I'll come back to it and understand it better!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"As is the case with all of Morrison's novel's, PARADISE is not an easy go and should not be taken up as light reading. The complex layering of allegory onto the storyline is brilliantly done, and I admired the elaborate construction of the narrative, but it seemed as if Morrison was much more interested in telling the somewhat hackneyed stories of the women at the Convent (guess what: they're all victims!) rather than telling the much more interesting story of how the women and men of the town were turned away from another all-black community, came to settle in Haven, and then went forward to Ruby."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This book is hard to write about, but I wanted to thank the reader from Milford, Conn., whose review April 12 has such a nice way of putting things. Toni Morrison seems to be edging in this book into a realm exemplified by how we feel when we are born and maybe how we feel when we are dying -- not completely &quot;one of them&quot; who we see around us, and at the same time very fully ourselves, although not sure precisely who that is. Embodying this in-between state of being, her characters are mostly outsiders who are fully aware of their insides. I think Toni Morrison is saying that this illuminating, private paradise may return at times in quiet or intense moments, and is one of the great gifts and puzzlements of being human. The last page of the story I reread several times, and I deeply felt this wisdom or this recognition, and it was extremely gratifying and wonderful to read, bringing sighs and tears to my eyes. But even then I couldn't have said why in words, and I certainly can't now. This is just one of many notions that seem to be threaded through the book's knotted tale, but it's what has stayed with me the most since finishing it a couple of months ago. So, I'd say that Toni Morrison is definitely on to something in this and other of her books, but I don't know what that something is, and I'm not sure I'd want to explore the blueprint of her thoughts because that would spoil the bliss somehow. So I will keep listening to this grandmother's lyrical songs with dumb pleasure, trying to keep a grasp on a mysteriously wise and peaceful place."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"In the first few pages of Paradise, I felt as if the mechanics behind the writing were too obvious. Unlike in Morrison's other books, in which the language created vivid images that illicited a strong emotional response, in the beginning of this novel I was distracted by the sensation that I could feel Morrison's effort to find just the right word. But as I read on, I found once again the same Morrison that I enjoy so much. The novel is a stirring look at the way people try to survive in a world where no one can remain whole and unscarred. Like her other books, Paradise left me with more questions than answers and certainly bears reading many more times."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I have never read any of Ms. Morrison's works before and as an avid reader I am glad to have finally found her. Morrison offers the reader the chance to challenge themselves with this novel. I suspect that people are disheartened with this book because of the unusual way in which the text is revealed. As a reader we are not used to a style where the author offers a conclusion to a piece of work at the beginning and this is, in my opinion, one of the harder aspects of &quot;Paradise&quot; to deal with. After the first chapter I was engrossed. I wanted to learn more about the town and people. Most importantly I wanted to learn more about myself! Unlike many others whom I guess chose this book on Oprah's recommendation I did not. As an Australian reader I know little about Oprah's Book Club. Maybe this is why so many people are dissapointed, this is not a book to read simply for all the hype surrounding it. It is a book to pick up and challenge you. If you get the chance to reflect on Morrison's words I suggest it is worth the read and furthermore worth the look within."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I was almost ready to put this book down after the first chapter. I was completely lost and discouraged, especially after all the good things i heard about it. But I continued on and was very pleased. Im sure everybody who reads this gets a different message, but what I took from the book was a message about judgement. The people of Ruby set up there own town to get away from the judgement and predjudice of white people, but what they found is they could not escape it. They judge there own population and others who they feel are dangerous. This is great book but can be difficult to read at times."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I have enjoyed several of Ms. Morrison's books, and am pleased to add Paradise to the list. Morrison is a complicated author, you must engage your brain to read her work. The novel was hard to follow in the begining, but eventually the light bulb came on, and at the end of the story I was sorrry to leave, and felt I had learned something.I really believe that anyone that had trouble with this novel should give up their pride, and try joining a reading group and/or using a dictionary and bible while reading the book. Morrison always presents her readers with a tumultuous batch of characters whose conflicts are explored from different angles, but are not resolved. I always feel like reading one of her books is like being sung to by your grandmother. You may not always understand the words, but everytime you hear the song you catch more of its story, and it begins to mean something to you.I recommend that some one who had trouble with this book try reading Morrison's The Bluest Eye in order to get familiar with her style. It too is not chronological, but it is easier to follow.Paradise is a rich and enlightening allegorical exploration of the meaning of paraidise and what it includes and/or excludes. We are introduced to a fascinating multigenerational cast of characters. Each has his or her own point of view, and we are allowed to experience that point of view first hand. The reader learns about the benifits and costs of exclusivity, and what drives people to that exclusivity.I highly recommended this and all Toni Morrison's work."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Getting into the flow of Toni Morrison's latest novel, Paradise, is like finding one's way to a river in an unfamiliar and densely wooded wilderness--without a map. It takes persistence--there are only feeder streams to follow and the sound of rushing water in the distance. It takes patience. You lose your way. On more than one occasion you consider abandoning your quest. At last you reach the river. With relief you enter the rushing water. You give yourself over to the currents, and as the beauty and spectacle of the river and surrounding landscape unfold before you, you congratulate yourself for not having turned back too soon.Paradise is the story (history really) of the people of Ruby, Oklahoma--pop. 360, an insular and isolated African-American town founded and populated by the racially pure descendants of African slaves. The main narrative takes place mostly in the 1960's and 70's but returns frequently to the events from the 1800's onward that led the founding of Ruby. Paradise is a utopian novel--nobody in Ruby has ever died there--and Ms. Morrison uses the device to explore once again a favored theme--the consequences and aftermath of slavery. Paradise is also the story of the women of The Convent, a former Catholic foster home outside of Ruby that has become a refuge and second home for five women seeking escape from the despair, abuse, and emptiness of their former lives.Ruby and the Convent are on a collision course whose climax is revealed in the novel's opening chapter--with the attack and murder of the unarmed Convent women by a group of Ruby's leading and formerly law-abiding citizens. In the subsequent retracing of events preceding the attack, Ms. Morrison avoids orderly chronology, choosing instead to rove forwards and backwards in time, telling the story from many characters' points of view.This novel is no \`continuous uninterrupted vision' (John Gardener's definition of a successful novel) and the reader must work to get to where the many narrative tributaries gather the momentum to sweep the reader to the novel's end. However, the questions raised in the novel's first chapter--the \`Why' and \`How' of the murders--should sustain most readers until that point is reached. From there, Paradise is difficult to put down, and the novel's conclusion redeems the effort invested.Ms. Morrison is a master symbolist, and early on one senses allegory at work: Ruby as the promised land that a latter-day Abraham leads his people to from persecution, exclusion, and drift. It's perhaps not coincidence that Paradise has nearly as dizzying number of characters in the novel as one finds in the Old Testament.Though biblical allusions abound in Paradise, Ms. Morrison's ambitions go much further, and Ruby may perhaps be best understood as a study of black-American utopia whose citizens are free to build a dream unhindered by many of the compromises that African-Americans make to survive, much less flourish, in a white man's world. However, as with most utopian novels, the very principles upon which the utopia is founded invariably contain the seeds of its ultimate destruction, its fall from paradise. Paradise then, is about what happens when outcasts become insiders, suggesting real-life parallels such as Israel's treatment of the Palestinians, the Islamic fundamentalists' treatment of non-Islamics, not to mention Christianity's long history of persecution. The people of Ruby build a dream and a town where once was none; in the process they heal their bodies but not their hearts. The persecuted become persecutors, the once ostracized are now the new excluders.Ms. Morrison's prose is lush, colorful, and tightly woven as broadloom; so tight that at times there is little breathing room between the lines. She is at her most lyrical and moving when she writes simply. A quarter way through the book I began wishing for a genealogical tree from which I could arrange the bits of history and anecdote about Ruby's nine founding families, their innumerable descendants, not to mention the family histories of the Convent women. Given the number of characters and events populating Paradise, Ms. Morrison's predilection for not identifying speakers by name for many pages adds to the struggle of getting one's bearings.For those already familiar with landscapes of Toni Morrison novels, the journey and struggle to get situated and comfortable in her narrative vision is expected--anticipated even, as many look forward to the challenge of the Sunday Times crossword puzzle. For those unfamiliar with Ms. Morrison's work, Paradise is rich, complex and thought-provoking novel, perhaps her best yet, and well worth the initial work and sore feet to reach its depths."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I was sorely dissapointed with Paradise.The first page was great, but went down hill from there.I patiently waited for it to get better and expected the last chapters to make it all worthwhile,this novel was my first read of Toni Morrison, will read her again to see if this was just one of her great flops."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Paradise, Toni Morrison's long awaited novel exhibits a kinder, gentler Morrison. Her writing still has the Ginsu fine edge we expect of Ms. Morrison, but this offering has a greater readability than previous Morrison works ie Tar Baby and Song of Solomon. Actually it doesn't become vintage Morrison until the end and &quot;the great disappearing act.&quot; The story of Ruby and it's less than sparkling inhabitants is however, absorbing.Morrison highlights the history of a town founded by strong righteous men through the lives of wounded, haunted, and finally empowered women. But with Morrison, the story is secondary. You know she can tell a good tale. It is the language, the lyrical linking of words that makes you pick-up and to be honest, sometimes put down a Morrison novel. In Paradise the language is beautiful without being burdonsome, moving without the melodrama in which Morrison sometimes gets lost. Rich with symbolism and cultural references, Paradise should provide rich discussions for book groups and classrooms for years to come."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Unlike some of the comments I read concerning this novel, I did not find this a difficult read at all. In fact, this book was able to envelope me into it's spirit almost immediately. I could feel the turmoil of the founding fathers and their fear of change as well as the frustration of those attempting to bring about change. It was as though I could envision the dilemma faced today by those persons struggling with acceptance while faced with pain but lacking the strength to keep fighting.The characters were complex enough to give the reader a clear picture of their being yet vague enough to represent a multitude of ideas. The story was so well written that time became irrelevant. This was my first novel read for enjoyment after completion of my PHD and it was definitely an excellent choice."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I found this book to be a difficult read. I found that I had to keep rereading sections for clarification. The first sentence captured me and I had to keep reading to find out why the men wanted to harm the women in the convent. I found it interesting that I had a hard time telling who were black and who were caucasian. At times I felt like I should have read the book with a piece of paper and a pencil so I could keep track of who was who. I did enjoy the book and was so proud of myself when I finished it. When I reread chapter one I found things to be a little clearer so I may reread the book. I would recommend this book as a challenging read."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"When I picked up Paradise, I was eager to get started, driven by Oprah's overwhelming praise of the story and the characters within. However, after a few chapters I found myself wondering what the hell was happening, hoping to see improvements to the flow of the story in the pages that followed. While there were a couple dozen occasions where I wanted nothing but to put it down for good, I accepted the challenge of working through the pages. I thought part way through that I should have made some notes, or a sort of family tree to keep track of all the characters, but decided against it, as no read should be that much work. So, I continued through the confusion right until the end, feeling entirely unsatisfied when I finally got there.I do not read as much as I would like, simply due to my hectic schedule. I try to find time to read for the sheer escape, the understanding of characters and interesting plot development. In Paradise, I was working too hard to be able to understand it, there were too many characters to gain an in depth understanding of any of them individually, and I felt myself wanting Morrison to just GET TO THE POINT. While her vocabulary and attention to detail was impressive, we as readers need to keep in mind that a difficult, confusing read does not automatically make it a good one.This was my first Morrison read, and likely my last."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"As in all of Morrisons books, her choice of words and the images they paint are sheer delight. I can happily go back and reread random chapters just to reconnect with the dreamlike state I've entered through her words."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"On the one hand, I have to marvel at Morrison's self-created world in Ruby, Oklahoma. I did not mind the complicated maze of people and events, past and present, that she leads the reader through. I submitted myself to this jigsaw puzzle of a novel, and eventually, all the pieces WERE put into place, more or less. After Beloved, I was prepared for and even anticipating Morrison's inside-out method of telling a story--plunge us into the story in medias res, then go back and fill us in, partially, then plunge us in a bit deeper, then reel us back in, etc., all the while firmly rooting us to a time, place and lifestyle with concrete descriptions of scents and colors and lists of food--lots and lots of food!In Beloved, this approach was magical--I felt continual surprise at her words--they seemed to bubble over with a life of their own. Her metaphors and her &quot;food-talk&quot; seemed to be one and the same; she was somehow able to make the concrete seem ethereal and the mystical seem &quot;everyday&quot;. Beloved had elements of &quot;magical realism,&quot; but she made me BELIEVE it. I could have lived in that story.The first thing I said to myself after finishing the last page of Paradise was, &quot;I don't believe a word of it.&quot; And that is really the worst criticism I can give it--it is unreal. It does not live and breathe. It's metaphors and spiritual questings never drew me in--I never wanted to enter into Large Questions with Morrison, because I wasn't reading a reality that forced me to deal with its existence, its failings, successes, and accusations.Why did this world fail to convince, while Beloved overflowed with life, for me?Here are some symptoms of the larger problem of lifelessness: a preachy tone; obvious, overused, mixed, or just plain strained metaphors; characters used as ciphers; a perverse authorial pleasure in creating loose ends; plot elements that seemed extremely arbitrary (Connie and Deacon's affair, the dead white family, everything about Gigi...); long pages of deliberate vagueness punctuated by long paragraphs of authorial explanation of the &quot;POINT&quot; of it all.I could go on. But the main problem was, this novel simply isn't as serious and weighty as Morrison wants it to be. The plot turns actually silly at her grand climax and after. It's Faulkner-lite."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I made it through half of this book and said forget it. I had to force myself to get that far. Toni Morrison can't seem to say what needs to be said for the reader to halfway comprehend what is going on in Ruby or at the convent. This makes for a selfish author who has let success go to her head."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Paradise is a challange. Even Oprah had trouble with it. I was able to reach a deeper level of understanding by researching reviews by critics, reading the reviews on this page, and listening to several TM interviews. I also got the audio version which is read by the author. (Really a great performance.) Speaking for myself, I could not have gained a this level of understanding without assistance. TM's working title was &quot;War.&quot; She saw a kind of war between different concepts of Paradise. She says that she poses questions rather than gives answers. The original founders of Ruby were pure, but their survivors became corrupt in their dealings with women and money. The women at the Convent established a kind of passive Paradise which protects them from the cruelties of the outside world. The survivors of the original settlers see their Paradise slipping away and blame the society of women at the Convent. (And was it not the woman Eve who led Adam to the original sin?) In order to maintain their Paradise the men of Ruby agree to perform an evil attack upon the women at the Convent, risking the wrath of the God, (the furrow of his brow), in whose name they created their own Paradise. Theirs is a God of Vengance, and not a God of Mercy. But will God claim his own Vengance because the men of Ruby do not show Mercy? In any case, both Paradises fail. Many of the events of &quot;Paradise&quot; are still not clear, but if you like a challange, go for it."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"My first Toni Morrison novel was _Song of Solomon_, which I read several years ago. That novel still resounds in my mind, so much so, that I often get into heated arguments about which is her best. Paradise is not her best story, but it is her best writing. Those who are not able to understand what Toni is doing in this piece, probably cannot stand the intensity of poetry, nor do they understand the collective history and minds of Americans of African descent. This novel is not about events, but rather the states of the minds of the characters and how they got to the way they are. If you are not used to Toni's writing, DO NOT start with this novel. Start with _Song of Solomon_ and work your way back. Only those with patient minds willing to take great leaps will be able to comprehend _Paradise_."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I made a beeline for this book after Oprah's glowing review and was deeply disappointed. The first paragraph was a grabber, but it soon fizzled. The convoluted prose and disjointed characterizations did not entice me to dig deeper or leave me wanting more. By the end of the book I could have cared less who was killed or who did the killing. Ah well, I guess after having just read the literary masterpiece &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; anything else was bound to be a real let down."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I haven't finished Paradise yet, but I will in the next day or two. I've heard a lot of things about this book lately, due to Oprah's endorsement. It's interesting that so many people have complained of the book being too difficult, or too convoluted. I'm proud of Oprah for supporting a wonderful book and author, but I'm afraid that her support has put this book on the reading list of far too wide an audience. This is not your typical best-seller. Morrison does not spoon-feed her readers, and for that we are appreciative. I enjoy thinking while I'm reading, not being told every linear detail. As I'm reading Paradise, I find myself trying to remember details, how this character hooks up with that one, and I have had to go back and check some things. I don't see this as a negative quality--it's part of enjoying something that is truly a work of literature. The lush history, the stories related from generation to generation, and the complex relationships and character sketches make this one of the most amazing experiences, let alone books, that I have encountered. I'd give it a rating of &quot;10&quot;, but I would have to reserve that for the &quot;classics&quot;. Paradise will likely stand the test of time."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Man is not an island unto himself. If he chooses isolation, he risks diminishing himself mentally, physically and spiritually. Isolation shrouded the citizens of Ruby, as well as the women of the Convent. PARADISE lies within each of Morrison's characters, to choose or to reject."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This novel moves rediculously slow, with benign details and decoy storylines. I found it very difficult to folow which for me is a first. I would give it no stars if that was possible, but I will give it one star for its title that lures you in and makes you read this very boring book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"As I was reading this I kept wondering what the heck was going on--but in the last few chapters everything was tied in so perfectly it all became crystal clear as a perfect high C. This book is gorgeously brilliant, so persevere though it. It is the kind of book that is even more rewarding on the second read. Remember too that when Morrison is writing of a character, she is often invoking their own voice and attitude in her prose style. Morrison is fearless and so brutally honest, I don't know how she stands it."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"In the beginning it was a difficult book to read in as the story jumped between past and future and back again. Once I made a conscious effort to retain the information, the story moved right along. In spite of this I thought it was very well written and I realized I really enjoyed sorting out the story in my mind. This is a book that really makes you think."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This is the first Toni Morrison novel I have read, I enjoyed it. I had to think and to think is good for the brain. I plan to read Beloved and Jazz, because according to book reviewers Paradise is the last of the trilogy where Beloved is the first and Jazz the second in the series. I am a Toni Morrison fan."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I feel that Morrison's latest book &quot;Paradise&quot; is am amazing literary creation. I have read others say that this book is confusing and not worth reading. Well I think that these people are not understanding the entire meaning of the text."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"We were aware that Toni Morrison is one of the great literary authors of all time but also aware that her books are not an easy read. Not all 14 members ITCOMS finished the book nor did everyone understand all of the book or the same parts of the book. There were Post-it notes and pieces of paper hanging out of everyone's copy. The discussion of the book was so lively and engaging, that the members who had not finished reading Paradise wanted to rush home and finish. Our consensus: it really was a good book, Deep and confusing but a really good book. We had strayed off our beaten path and it worked out OK."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Ms. Morrison's latest, &quot;Paradise&quot;, is evocative and personal. I thought the novel very worthy, as did my grandmother, my father and my sister. True, it wasn't the great masterpiece of the decade. True, it was sometimes a bit tedious. True, it is a book worthy of attention. But this book is not excrement. Nor is it verbose. Nor is it simply the bible of pretension. Reading over many of the reader reviews, I noticed the development of a quasi-political establishment: the worshipers and the heretics. I am certain that Ms. Morrison had no intentions of writing a book devoted to the interests of intellectual snobbery. Books, real ones, aren't written in the style of grand philosophical essays. They are art, embroidered with subdued, personable intellectual threads. In short, one shouldn't feel an intellegence hammer crashing over one's head. If this happens, this is not a piece of literary fiction . . . it is a dry sermon. Paradise, while being very thoughtful, is not a bible and Ms. Morrison, while delivering a message, is not a preacher. To the worshippers: Toni Morrison is not a deity. To the heretics: neither are you."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I like answers. I like to know what happened. I was not satisfied with the resolution. I wanted 500 or 600 more pages so I could roll around in the story. I am gluttonous. I wanted her to retell the story several different ways (some chronological) so I was asbolutely positive that I didn't miss one tasty morsel.However, since this is not what Morrison gave me, I had to run a marathon and build a palace inside my head. Thanks. I will reap benfits.This is one of the best books I have ever read. I can't believe what the author has done to the narrative structure. I'm still reeling.Sorry if this is a bit pretentious. I feel strongly."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"'Paradise' is Toni Morrison's highest achievement so far (I hope she will write many more facsinating novels). I liked it more compared to 'Beloved' and 'Jazz', and I think all readers who enjoyed Morrison's early writing will not be disappointed on reading her latest novel. Her characteristic style is at her best in 'Paradise'. Her writing evokes very vivid pictures, though develops somewhat chaotically - in the same way life does. The story is told in beatiful language, and gives bright and colorful descriptions of life in a small Black community in Oklahoma. The author looks closely at the development of this small town, which has many miles between itself and any other settlement. So on one hand the book is an account of the town's interaction with the rest of the world. On the other hand, it gives insight into the nature of human relations within the community. It is a story of building-up tension and the resulting conflict. I found it very captivating from the very first lines; firstly, because the story is so masterly written; secondly, because of the suspense present in it; thirdly, because of the wonderful descriptions of everyday life. One of the author's greatest talents is her ability to give fascinating true-to-life images of trivial events. Her book is a great adventure - just like life is."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I'm 18 years old and I found Paradise to be the most amazing book I've ever read. I don't understand those people who dare to give this book a rating of three stars of less because they couldn't understand it. In my opinion anyone without the brains to understand this novel shouln't even consider writing a review because they aren't capable of writing a review based on the novel, it's souly based on their stupidity toward fine literature. I would recomend Paradise to any person who would take the time to sit down and read the book properly and I'm sure they would enjoy it tremendously."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I heard Ms. Morrison read a selection from Paradise when it was still a work in progress and I couldn't wait to see the rest of it. But, like her reading, the book was beautiful yet confusing. When I heard her read, I thought it was just lost on me because I hadn't heard the rest of the story. Now I know, I was lost because there just was not a lot of clarity here. This book is worth your while IF you don't have your hopes up that it will be the best thing you ever read...if you are expecting that, you might walk away disappointed."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I bought &quot;Paradise&quot;. I love Oprah. I love to read. I am not dumb!At least I didn't think so till I got into this book. I did not finish it and I probably won't. I know I could but I just don't find it personally worth it.I began, I watched Toni discuss the book, I listened to the comments from other readers (many--actually most--like mine). &lt;b&gt; I listened to Oprah say she read it 3 times, now after listening to Toni's comments, etc. she will go back &amp; read it again??? Sorry, I don't even want to. There are just too many books out there. I like mysteries--that's not the point. I like to think--that's not the point. I just don't like having to work that hard &amp; to be made &quot;dumb&quot; in my valuable spare time.Does it seem that is what we the public are asking for? I understand this book got much aclaim.End of comment. Thanks for asking."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Morrison's tact is getting the reader to see the connections between past and present through the sometime rational, sometimes irrational mind of her characters. (Faulker's narrative style in &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; comes to mind.)I think she DOES want to entertain her readers - as any storyteller should - but the entertainment involves asking questions about the role that the past plays on our interpretation of the present.Nevertheless, I feel like, no matter how much she wants to entertain, she does not compromise her narrative vision to become more accessible to readers. I concede that she comes dangerously close to becoming &quot;academic.&quot; But, in truth, Morrison, no matter how accessible, is just not for everybody. (I personally can't stomach John Updike, although I don't doubt he is a fine literary craftsman as well. His stories just don't interest me.)Could the narrative of &quot;Paradise&quot; have been simplified? Yes. (This is a story about some independent, fiesty women, who p*** off the patriarchs of a patriarchial town with their joy at being female (non-male) and being self-sufficient, just at Lillith p***** off Adam and God because she wanted to &quot;be the top&quot; in their sexual liasons and have as much fun as Adam did.) Fundamentally this was a story of the War Between the Sexes. And, like all issues concerning war we wonder if the side that won the battle also won the war.But, would a simpler story have been possible? I'm not sure. Time was starting to erase the collective memory of the community. (Few could remember the original title on the oven, for example) Morrison, through her complex narrative, also forces us to ponder how a character's lineage influences their behavior in the present.In the book, just as with human relationships, the past colors one's vision. For example, one of the critical questions that hangs annoyingly before the Ruby citizens who witnessed Connie's murder is what REALLY happened? We are left to wonder if the witnesses really do not know, or if they cannot see the truth (it is inaccessible to them) because of how the past has colored and shaped how they view the present.Wallace Boyd"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This novel had it's moments, powerful moments, but alas, &quot;only moments&quot;. I had heard a lot of praise for this novel but maybe I just missed the point. I know it's about the individuals in Ruby and the convent characters too, but it's being touted as this only happened in a small black town. I don't think so. It could have been anywhere, anybody USA. A small town with its own secrets."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"If a writer can't get me involved in their story in the first 100 pages, I don't finish it. I read half of this book and realized that I was forcing myself to pick it up because of Oprah. I didn't like it and will not read any of her selections again."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"By the time I got half way through Paradise, I decided to stop wasting my precious time and return the book to the library so someone else could read it. I didn't love or hate any of the characters in the book. I was unable to feel anything for any of them. I'm sure Toni Morrison wrote the book to be dissected by students in literature class. Quite frankly, if I want to dissect a book, it better be nonfiction. I used to be the type of person who would have to finish a book once I started reading it. Paradise has cured me of that. Life is too short to waste."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I was sitting on the train home from work, determined to &quot;get through&quot; the last 40 pages of my new book when the woman sitting next to me glanced over and asked if I was enjoying the book. I paused for a moment, turned to her and said, &quot;I don't know!&quot;. She then explained that she got through the first 2 chapters of &quot;Paradise&quot; and could not go on. Being someone that feels I would be insulting a book (books are people too!)if I did not finish, I thought everything would work out in the end. It didn't. People had told me this was a brilliant book - I almost felt stupid not feeling the euphoria at the end. That was &quot;almost&quot;... yeah, it was a hard read - big deal! But gosh, to actually recommend people to read it AGAIN?!?! If I was that disappointed after struggling through the first read - lord knows what would happen if I read it again! I'm just relieved it's over!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I loved this book. I loved the way the first paragraph is really the last and you keep reading to find out why those people are in the convent. It was an incredible book, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I read the book before the hoopla and found it a rich reading experience- a full symphony, a multicourse meal. I had feelings not experienced since&quot;Song of Myself' was asigned in lit class. I will now read it again for more layers of experience,and not for &quot;difficulty.&quot;"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I admit that Paradise is a hard read, but Toni Morrison's work usually is. While the characters were many and embedded in prose, one must remember that not one word is wasted. To fully understand a Paradise one must do more than read. Read with a pen if necessary. It might require more than one reading to completely understand Ms. Morrison's version of Paradise or &quot;hell on Earth&quot; for that matter, but the rewards are great. The Biblical subtext is meaningful and relevant and she has in my opinion, produced a scholarly work. For those who complain that this novel was scattered and just plain difficult, I would suggest starting off with one of her easier works (i.e The Bluest Eye or Sula) and then working up to Song of Solomon, Beloved and Paradise. I can almost guarantee that you will change your review."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I've read many reviews before I decided to tackle Paradise. I didn't find it as unorganized or shallow as others, but it does require a lot of concentration to follow the story. I think too many authors write their novels with the movie in mind. In return, we the readers become almost offended when we read something a little deeper than a script. Paradise is hard to read because you have to think while you read. Not something many authors challenge us to do these days. I did enjoy the novel (as I always do). Paradise was a little different from Morrison's other novels. It was more of a history lesson than the others, but I'm still glad I read it."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I don't understand what it is about Toni Morrison...maybe it's me? I didn't enjoy the story. I had to &quot;push&quot; through it. It was hard to understand a lot of what was going on- and I am an avid reader with a large vocab."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The following is a short paper I typed for a College Literature class concerning Paradise:I would like to use this final response paper as a means to express my dislike for the Tony Morrison book Paradise. Don't get me wrong, I liked all of the other books we have covered this semester. Invisible Man is true greatness. And I have never came across a book as differently effective as Maus. I even like the other Morrison book I have read, Beloved. But Paradise just did not do it for me at all. It seemed to me to be one of the best cures for insomnia that I have ever came across. And if I weren't required to read it I would have put it down a long time ago. But I did read it, and if there was going to be a test over it, frankly I wouldn't stand a chance(the example I use to prove a point later on in this paper I'm sure will prove my ignorance on the matter). There were many aspects to this book that I didn't really enjoy. But for this brief paper I will just name a few reasons that I will not be going back to Paradise. My first point is obvious, it has way too many characters in it! Why did the great Morrison decide to include what seemed to be an interminable number of people in this book. There are more people in this book than in my hometown it seemed. Did she want it to be such a difficult read that you had to muddle through it about five times just to really comprehend her stories and messages. And to add to the confusion, it has shifting timelines that would make the movie Pulp Fiction look like Dr.Seuss. I have never been one to shy away from difficult readings. T.S. Elliot is pretty difficult to read but I do like it. My Comp and Theory class this semester read a article from Victor Villanueva that was very tough but I still thought it was fascinating. Paradise was just so convoluted with characters that I had an immensely difficult time staying interested while reading it. I mean how many books require you to write a timeline and a cast of characters in class just to try to straighten everything out? And every time I did start to like parts the tone set me off again. It was so dark and oppressive that I felt depressed after every time I read it. I am usually ready to go when it comes to anything with a morose theme. Whether it be movies, music,books, etc., I am always readily able to disconnect myself from that and allow it not to affect me. But every character in the story has some sort of skeleton in their closet that really made me feel sorry for them. And the overtones of inbreeding really made me sort of nauseous. The beginning, which I think creates a promising start to the book, is just left dangling and I didn't really get to find out what had happened to a lot of the women in the convent. And the emotions they display seem incorrect to fit the situation. For example, after not seeing her mother for nearly ten years, a young woman(sorry, don't know her name) reacts to seeing this mother after all that time as if she had went to the kitchen for a few minutes and just came back into the room. The mother(don't know her name either) left terrified that the daughter was trying to murder her, but acts as if nothing happened after running into her again. The book was also disjointed beyond my obviously meager comprehension. The individual vignettes would start in one year, then quickly and abruptly shift to another year. The flashbacks confused me on many occasions. To me the book seemed rushed and unorganized."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"As much as I wanted to like this book, I could not overcome its racist and hurtful depictions of black men. I was very offended by the depictions of black men, and as a black man who has never been to jail or had any ill-will toward black women, I was surprised that all of the black males in the book ar depicted as misogynistic and cruel, almost apish criminals or cretins. This book reminds me of racist literature from the 1890s-1920s that I read in my Whiteness Studies class. Such racist books written by white authors who sought to foment race riots (meaning violence by whites against blacks). The tone of this book is quite similar, which is shameful and all too eerie. To think that a gifted black author is writing literature no different than literature that Grand Wizards of the Klu Klux Klan wrote in 1919 says something very harrowing about the publishing industry, something I had not realized before. I expected her worldview to be a bit more like Mark Twain's than David Duke's."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I couldn't even get past the third chapter. Maybe I'm just not deep enough for this one...who knows, but it's awful. I have read other books my Ms. Morrison and found them enjoyable, but this one was so confusing and I just didn't have the patience to muddle on."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This book had interesting moments. So far I have read three of Ms. Morrison's books including this one, \\"The Bluest Eye,\\" and \\"Sula.\\"I was often bored reading this book. Her writing tends to be depressive and odd, yet informative of the black culture at times. Each of her books seems to contain some element of horrific incident(s) that will stir the emotions. I am hoping for more from \\"Song of Solomon.\\" I can't help but wonder if Oprah would recommend books that portray the abuses whites have suffered at the hands of blacks. It has occurred, but since whites have never been considered abused by the slave days of old, these stories do exist, even in more modern times."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I never quit reading books. I could see how this story would be confusing and hard to understand. I was able to keep up with the reading and understand it, but it was just plain boring. This book I just wasn't into. I didn't look foward to reading it. So I didn't finish it. Morrison jumped around to much.. once I started getting familiar with characters, she would switch it up. I don't know how it ever ended, but I wasn't patient with the book to find out."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Which one has the fewest ghosts/supernatural entities/bible characters (the weakest link(s) in her chains?) Why are there never any beautiful women in any of Morrison's novels?Was hoping this would be her best book, adhering closest to reality. But -- the biblical underlayers here as well as intercession of ghosts and remembrances of dead babies in the other two biggies impose a strain on perspective; i.e., is she doing a fantasy or a drama/commentary or a combination of both - and where does one end and the other begin? Perhaps these efforts are best left to Stephen King et. al., those more skilled with the genre.There is a serious dearth of beautiful women and d&amp;d consensuals in these novels and you can't but wonder if there is some subjective psychology at work here.Whenever the issue of ugly women comes up I always flash on the exchange between Jeff and Louie in TAXI:Jeff: Don't be callin' my mother ugly, Louie!Louie: Face it, Jeff, this is not Lena Horne we're talkin' about here!Jeff: Don't be talkin' about my mother, Louie. She's got beauty on the INSIDE!Louie: But she's Swamp Thing on the outside!Anyway, we've learned that a scary plain woman can be as literary as a foxy one &amp; versa vice(Dorothy Dandridge, Diahann Carroll... their biographies ... ); probably moreso . Maya Angelou's been around since the flood.Likewise Angela Davis; a life half suspense novel and half treatise on the rise of genius. Her legacy of survival and faith in the human condition - now there's a special woman and a special story!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I only bought this dog of a book because my mother saw it on Oprah and said how good it was supposed to be. This is my first (and probably only) Oprah selection that I will knowingly buy. If any future titles pique my interest, then I will wait for them at the public library.I don't read to try to decipher garbage, and to me that's what this stupid book was all about. I couldn't stand it and shipped it to my mom after reading up to page 37, wishing her the best of luck in figuring out what it was all about!!!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I think that is so crazy with the men to attack to woman in the Convent as they don't allow their wife to let them out alone as their wife often go to find woman in the Convent. they feel that the reasons with the wife left is woman taught them so man don't like them so much and attack to them and raped or killed them."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I have read a lot of books in my live but Paradise is the best book ever. After reading Paradise it was as if I had lived for years in Ruby. I could see, feel, smell, taste, grieve and believe. It started at Chapter one and it never ended. The way Toni Morrison creates a Paradise into a Paradise is amazing. I hope we have the opportunity to enjoy lots of books from her in future."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This book literally gave me chills.It emphasized a small little light thaat had been growing inside of me throughout the book, and just exploded at the end. I never realized that the book would be so powerful until I finished it.I admit, you must have patience to get through the midle of the book, the endless strand of names that almost threw me off. But perserverance is the name of the game with this book, and luckily I had it.I had no idea Oprah had recommended this book, and now that I know she had, I want to see her little segment thing with Toni. I want to hear what others thought about it (that's why i am writing this review). My AP Comp/Lit teacher had recommended this about three months ago, along with practically every other Toni Morrison book she'd ever read. I had also been told by my friends that thisbook blew them away as well, so I was drawn in.So, I started reading it, and three days later, I had learned something. Like any good book, though, the author becomes the teacher, and I the student, and I am pleased to report that I learned a LOT!her writing style of going places that aren't expected, and writing with such incredible words, all put together, it blew me away.Something else I freely admit is the fact that I hadn't realized I was attached to the characters until the very end. After the assault, I felt so touched that it startled me.So, my hats off to Toni Morrison, because now I understand what new things are possible with a great story...a great lesson."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"this is truely a great novel. I'm an african american that can truly relate to the concept of the oven as being a focal point of tradition and can identify with the elders in the town of Ruby as calling the young people &quot;talk back young people&quot;. Ms Morrison has already made a statement in literature with her pervious works and in this one she knows that she can still tell a story and will be here in a long timeI found this work to be as powerful as the song of solomon. get this!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Always a brilliant writer, Toni Morrison has managed, yet again, to top herself. Brilliant and moving - this is the best book she has written - so far. The symbolism was great; the story insightful. This is one of the few books that i can read more than once!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"After reading this book I felt as if I was still waiting for something very big to happen.......It left me wondering whether I was the only one in the world to missunderstand this book. All in all, it left me feeling stupid and very upset that I did not &quot;get it&quot;. It's been a month since I have read the book and I still think about it and wonder what I missed. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because I enjoyed the style of writing and it did manage to keep my interest up although I WAS expecting more from the ending. I felt very let down by this book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"After reading all of Toni Morrison's novel, I found Paradise to be the most difficult. This is not a book for those who do not look for the novel's underlying meaning and themes. I only &quot;scratched the surface&quot; of this book and I will be reading it a second time, third if necessary. I would not recommend this book for first-time readers of Morrison. Overall, it is a very intriguing novel."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This was the first book by Ms. Morrison that I have read but there will be others. I could not put the book down, frequently reading passages over and over. This story of redemption and relationships was sufficiently thought provoking and feeling provoking that I have passed it along to numerous friends. It is a book that I will definitely read at least a second time. Paradise will become a classic."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Oh my...this one is a thought provoker---BIG TIME. As per usual, Toni has written a slow read--you must take your time with this or you will find yourself having to go back and read over. As I was reading this, I was wondering what all the fuss was about. Only until after I was done and began to think about it did the full impact of it hit me. And I found I could NOT get it off my mind for the next several days. Now THAT is the mark of a truly excellent book. I have the utmost respect and awe of Toni Morrison after reading this. The woman is brilliant."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"After I read Beloved a few years ago (based on someone's recommendation) I knew I would read anything Ms.Morrison wrote. It's not easy reading her books, but what joy. The language, the characters, the COMPLEX (yes, pleasantly, complex) plot. She makes you think. She makes you feel proud that you have a brain and can use it. Sometimes it's helpful to step out of your narrow point of view and look at people and life from a bigger prespective. I just finished Song of Solomon and loved that too, but Paradise is definitely a more complex book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Many people complain that this novel is much too complex. I think that maybe we a re too willing to read books that just take us away and do not require us to think. I am only nineteen years old and did not feel that it was too complex or too difficult to read. You may need to take notes, reread certain sections or read the entire novel more than once to REALLY get the big picture but it is certainly not beyond comprehension. Paradise is an excellent story that sucks you in and tempts you to keep turning the page. Morrison once again displays the extremely high quality of writing found in Beloved making Paradise a highly enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"It is sad to consider the true literary greats never honored with a Nobel and then see a writer of such limited talent and intellect so rewarded. This novel is particularly pedestrian, obtuse, and lifeless. Very sad indeed."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Having read all of Toni Morrisson's books, this one by far is not her best novel. Her chapters do not flow from one thought to the next, they jump around and you(the reader) have to make the connection. No, I don't think this book is dificult to read, just difficult to follow because you have to work at putting it all together. It started out as a great idea, but somehow it got lost in the rambling of Ms. Morrisson."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The journey through this novel left me in a reflective mood. Toni Morisson has created a powerful depiction of human frailty and redemption and cast those attributes in the shell of a black township whose premise was noble, but reality was an opaque facade. &quot;Paradise&quot; is therefore cast as an attainable goal or ideal that is not, nor ever can be a finite set of circumstances. To achieve paradise one must mutate. The characters are multifaceted, the scenarios are sometimes contrived, the retelling of their lives is laced with the humanity that we all grapple with. What makes Paradise is its ability to hold the reader up to a mirror and cause him/her to gaze deeply into a looking glass. Superb fiction by a gifted voice."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"When reading a novel and determining its greatness, we must ask, &quot;How fully does it achieve its purpose?&quot; Every chapter, every character and every literary stradegy, including its narrative style, must all work. Does &quot;Paradise&quot; accomplish this? I will argue that it does in most cases, but not in all. The difficult prose and non-chronological style was perfectly appropriate and works brilliantly. I am not sold, however, on every minor character and story. While I was reading, I couldn't wait to get to the stories of the women. Their lives and struggles were moving and powerful, thereby dwarwfing the rest of the narrative. I will never forget the chapter &quot;Divine&quot;, for example, and that remarkable scene when the women made a fuss at the church ceremony. These scenes and many others involving the Covent women work just as well if not better than any in her other novels, but the rest of the story has fewer scenes of raw power and energy, leading to a successful but not completely successful novel."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Oh mercy, I wonder how many unfortunate book discussion groups are going to be slogging through this one. Paradise, by Toni Morrison, is convoluted, overwritten and downright confusing. She sets up a smug tone that grits the teeth. I have a mental picture of Oprah chomping happily on a burger, reading Jackie Collins, and snickering to herself at the thought of earnest readers toiling through Paradise. Thumbs down,"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison has done a great job. She has written an amazingly insightful book, and has left her reader with a lot to think about. The book packaged a lot of depth, but has left the plot somewhat dry. She developed her characters well, but took up too much time with them. Several characters had little to do with the story, but she took time writing about them anyway. Next time, less matter with more art."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Whenever I have trouble following a narrative, I blame myself not the author. The characters kept my interest and kept me reading. It wasn't until I reached Consolata's chapter that I was able to solve some of the novel's mysteries. My advice is to keep reading."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"After Oprah bragged about what a wonderful book this was, I had to read it. However, it is sitting on my bookshelf after only reading half of the book. It is hard to follow and unless you're re-reading every paragraph and page, it is hard to understand. This one would go over the average reader's head. I think even Oprah just &quot;pretended &quot; to &quot;get it&quot; to push Toni Moorison's work."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I find myself troubled by this book and how difficult it is to follow. I don't mind reading slowly, and, in fact, I have no objection to taking my time with anything, however, right now, this is simply trying my patience.I want to keep going because I've invested so much of myself into it, but, I find myself making excuses for not reading it.I wish Ms. Morrison had thought about the impact of making the reading so challenging and had eased up on us just a little bit.I am worn out from focusing on every word, but if I don't, then, from one sentence to the next, I lose site of a character, and then I'm lost too!I just hope I can hang on long enough to get to the finish line, where, I know I'll have to start all over again!After a long hard day, you really have to work hard with this one. Do yourself a favor, save it for a vacation, otherwise, the everyday stress of life, coupled with reading it, will simply wear you out!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Paradise is anything but! I realize that I should probably read the novel one or two more times before I pass judgment, but the thought of having to wade through all those characters and themes, again is agonizing, at present. Of course, I said something similar of Beloved upon its initial publication and over time, came to love, admire and appreciate it as it deserves to be appreciated. Unfortunately, I don't see the same happening with Paradise ... but I'll give it another try when it comes out in paperback."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I had to read this book for my Honors English class, and I loved it. It's a classic Toni Morrison novel, and everyone who likes other books by her should read this one."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I have only read this book once, but after seeing many suggestions to read it again, perhaps I will. I was enchanted by this book. Certainly it is very involved and couldn't qualify as \\"brain candy,\\" but the passion with which Morrison writes makes up for it. It is tragic and painful, but at the same time inspiring.This is the first of Morrison's books that I read, but since I have read nearly all her works and she never ceases to amaze me with the depth of her characters and ease with which I fall in love with them and sympathize even with the \\"bad guys.\\" This, as are most of Morrison's books, is a study of the fallibility of humankind. In everyone's quest to do what is best for their families or communities, we inevitably make decisions that hurt others. In Morrison's books these errors have a more resounding effect than most in our everyday lives do, but she successfully shines the spotlight on the pain we inflict upon ourselves and those around us in the name of doing what we believe to be \\"right.\\"There is magic in this book--you won't be able to miss it."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This book was very enlightening. I really enjoy all of Toni Morrison's books but this one is by far my favorite. There was so much to absorb here, I learned a great deal about the early years, after slavery but, before the \\"Civil Rights Movement\\". I'm sure that when you read this book you will be hooked on Toni Morrison books forever. There are so many levels to this story. Each character is significant in his/her own way. There was no wasted space in this book. Every page was worth reading."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Paradise was a wonderful, thought-provoking book. I think that the reason so many people didn't like this book is that there is no clear-cut way to see it: Morrison leaves most of the interpretation up to the reader. Don't pick it up if you want an easy read. I had to read this for a college class and while it confused me at first, I became interested in the characters and themes behind the book. This is the first book of Morrison's that I've read, but I intend to catch up with her backlist. She has a unique voice and a lot to say."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Morrison's obvious fluency does not serve her well in this novel. Paradise is a quagmire that sucks into itself all that could make it rock: movement, action, a forward-going narration, dramatic tension, tight plotting. Morrison seems to have been too much in love with the book's &quot;epic&quot; format and her own ability to write expressive, descriptive prose to pay attention to the above requirements. Paradise is full of ideas and themes; unfortunately it quickly becomes an inert mass that eludes our desire to give it our full concentration and praise. Is it perhaps several novels mistakenly entwined in one binding? A huge effort, not a success."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I read this book because Oprah Winfrey recommended it in her book club. After 2 days of trudging through it, I was hellbent on finishing it, just for principle! Secretly I was hoping it would get better...but it never did. The most interesting and (I think) valuable aspect of the book was how it described the members of the small black community's prejudices against others of their town, and how the color of their skin determined their worth in the community. However, I never did figure out how the convent fit into the picture. The words were descriptive and eloquent, but the story was lost on me."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison has always been one of my favorite authors. Last winter, I received Paradise as a gift, and I couldn't wait to begin reading it. However, once I did, although I felt like I was reading it all the time, it took me seven months to finish it. There are hundreds of characters, jumbled together, and at times, I found it hard to stay interested. However, Morrison's talent is evident with every word and I enjoyed reading it. Some sentences she writes surprise me so, I have to write them down and ponder them! It isn't comparable with Beloved or the Bluest Eye, but its themes were excellent. I absorbed the female characters' strengths and found I learned from their mistakes. Their experiences became my experiences. I would def. reccommend reading this one."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I've never put down a book without finishing it, no matter how horrible it was, until NOW! I did not understand ANYTHING that was going on from chapter to chapter. I think Oprah was out of her mind for putting this on her list. However, Oprah's theme of books seem to be whatever is the most dark and depressing reading she can get her hands on and this is definately one of those. That was clear, even if I couldn't follow along with what else was going on in the book"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I read for pleasure, not to have to re-read a book in my precious spare time. Although a nobel prize winner for literature wrote this, I find Morrison's books (particularly this one) to be like a riddle. New characters were brought in, within the last few chapters. Characters are implied but, not developed. Some trite characters are far too developed and dealt with. Far too many characters were thought of and brought into the book. Morrison writes several books into one verbal dirreah novel.Most common of all, characters appear, as if we are already to know them. This bothers me greatly as if I am missing something. However with Morrison's terrible grammer, it would not surprise me if this were true. I do not want to think while I am reading a book, books are there to escape with, to venture to a different dimention. With Toni's I feel stupid, and I know I am not.I found 'Paradise' interesting as a story, particularly the parts containing Gigi, Mavis and Pallis. There witty remarks were very entertaining. The connection Ruby had with this outstanding town (until ages in, I thought Ruby was the town)!I usually commend Oprah's picks and enjoy them but, Morrison, my God, just not good. I will not be purchasing anymore of picks but I will keep the ones that I have already purchased. I may, and that is the operative word, borrow one from the library."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"After I finished this book I felt angry at Morrison for being so obtuse. I kept asking myself &quot;why?&quot; What did it prove that she had to make the book so hard to understand and unravel? I felt like she was playing some kind of literary joke on her readers or else trying to make herself look smart and the average reader look dumb.I feel like there was important meaning in the book, but unless you take a literature class that focuses on this book, most will not likely ever get it -- and to me, that is the waste of a book that so many will read and could be elevated by.Toni Morrison, you are too good a writer to waste your time making your book so hard to understand for so many people. I found myself asking, what was your point?"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Disappointed? I am. I really am a fan of Morrison's work--for many, many years, but I thought there was too much going on with too many characters, and the story gets lost, hidden, whatever. When I invest time in a book, I should be able to understand the ending, that shouldn't be a priveledge because I've taken notes during the reading. The plot format and structure was really interesting, but somehow, some way, it sadly didn't work."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I tried and failed again. I cannot get through Ms. Morrison's books without frustrating effort, and sometimes not at all. Her writing is sophomoric and lacks the finesse of a truly gifted author. She owes a huge debt of gratitude to Oprah for her support. Paradise, like Jazz, was a waste of money and time."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison has too many characters in this book. It reads like the family tree for this whole Oklahoma town. Toni Morrison has been slowly going down hill from her first book. She just gives too much detail of stuff that has no relevance. Stick to the facts. I will never buy one of her books again. What a waste!!!!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This is one of the most muddled books I've ever plodded through. I am the only person I know who read this book from cover to cover, hoping to find some justification for its stellar reviews. I could find none."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Ever since Sula, Morrison has been developing a penchant for mythic characters and situations, a prose style which is more oratory than specific, and situations and events which are neither realistic nor magical but a way to avoid dealing with real life. All of these flaws are brought together, exponentially, in this text. The faults are too many to go into great depth: the narrative is too fractured; too much &quot;poetry&quot; (poetry, Toni, is concrete and minimal, not flowery); one-dimensional characters. But the worst flaw is how Morrison dodges saying anything critical about black people or women, and instead, after a brutal execution, everyone is forgiven and lives on in paradise. Toni, this response to the world is too easy."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Tony Morrison is an excellent writer. I simply anticipated more out of her before reading this book. Maybe it is my problem as a white male, but I expected more raw emotion from her characters or better insight on the people she wrote about, or, alas the plight of the African-American woman. Maybe that was the point of the book to show that all of these human emotions have been locked up due to terrible circumstance and treatment."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"my assignment was...write a 16 page literary analysis...no specifications about author, subject, or anything... i asked my professor what she recommened..she said .. &quot;anything by toni morrison.&quot; i chose paradise because of the more than stellar reviews, but i found it to be an incredibly boring and pointless book!! morrison is an extrememly gifted writer, but paradise is pure garbage... it's the kind of book that will put you to sleep!!sorry :("},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Maybe I'm immature, maybe I am not intelligent enough, or lack the patience it takes to understand Paradise,or maybe it's poop.I"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"As a freshman in High School, William Faulkner was required reading.

I felt as if I was reading for required academic purposes. I found no joy in the process. I needed an index to recall the various characters. I would argue that in order to understand and enjoy this book, you need at least a week to dedicate solely to reading this book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"If Morrison had not won the Nobel Prize there is no way that Paradise would have garnered an even adequate review. Paradise is a disjointed and erractic book. Morrison takes the liberty of inventing a 'style' that would have had a new author rejected by any publisher. It is not literature. Paradise is no more than a collection of words. Morrison is a wonder with descriptive phrases but she is not a wonder with a narrative tale. She simply, as another reviewer put it, can not get 'to the point'. Paradise is not worth the time, the effort or the money. If it becomes required reading in any class; it will be because the instructor does not like the students. It is simply awful. Morrison peaked before the Nobel and she is now on a downward slide.If her name did not sell the book Paradise would have come and gone off the shelves quickly.Give me Saramago, Ha Jin or Grass any day. They not only understand literature - they can write it. Morrison can not."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I must say that I am still trying to get through Beloved, however, Paradise was marvelous.

If that is your intention, prepare to be dissapointed. This is to be read in silence, preferably without any foreseeable interruption, because it will grab you and keep you sitting. The stories weave in and out of each other, catching you at moments, as connections reveal themselves. This is also a flipper. You will find yourself going back and rereading, trying to find passages and commit them to memory. What seemed unimportant becomes important, what seemed a focal point becomes a tangent. I read it like a sleuth, and recognized in it the same kind of inspiration that one finds in a Garcia Marquez. How many times I have read a Garcia Marquez short story ,ran back to find 100 Years of Solitude in my bookshelf and found that, yes, effectively the main character in the story was a tangent in the novel. Or been surprised that such an initially unimportant character emerges as the main character after 50 pages. Or been amazed that what seemed so confused is clarified in one sentence. Such is the way that Paradise constructs itself. Not an easy read, but well worth it for the mini-epiphanies. Congratulations, this is a marvel!!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"A dud. I've read Morrison's earlier novels. They were good. Perhaps the Nobel and Pulitzer went to her head. And I wonder about literary critics who seem to praise novels simply because they are written by &quot;established&quot; writers. A tangled plotline doesn't always make for a good story. Skip this one. It ain't worth your time."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I've read all of T. Morrison's books, many more than once and all for pleasure. Generally, I've been pleased and felt rewarded by these experiences. However, Paradise was a major disappointment. Given the warnings that the book was complex, I actually read each page, highlighted key passages and kept notes on each character. This did not help prepare me for the final chapter. I am left feeling &quot;all dressed-up with no place to go!&quot;. This is not one that I would recommend for pleasure. No, I will not re-read. That should not be necessary for a pleasure-based text.

I wonder now if the professor had read the book prior to putting it on the sylabus. Who can follow a story that has no sort of time while following characters that necessarily lack development, just by the sheer number included? The reader cannot care what happens to the citizens of Ruby. The only reason I give it a three is because of the rich use of language. However, it is not strong enough to overcome the multitude of faults. I have lost all faith in Oprah.

Meat and potatos, and what I was offered was a jumble of vegetables which wanted cooking (and me with no can of Sterno to my name). Sure -- &quot;The energy we have to spend puzzling out the various pieces and getting them into some kind of satisfactory narrative shape keeps our focus on the realistic plane of the novel and allows that allegorical machinery to operate more or less hidden from view. &quot;(New Yorker).Sure -- That's just what I want, to expend my precious vital energy to build myself a book which arrives at &quot;some kind&quot; of &quot;satisfactory narrative shape&quot;and at the same time hope to keep my focus on a &quot;realistic plane&quot; . . . No, I'm sorry, I can't go on (I think I'd shoot myself !)Keep it simple (or at least intelligible).I've got to agree with the prof who wrote -- :Confusion reigns in Paradise Morrison's new novel begins, &quot;They shoot the white girl first.&quot; After that opening statement, it's all downhill. E.B. White once equated fine writing with clarity and simplicity. If indeed these two qualities are the mark of exemplary writing, Morrison's Paradise fails terribly. This tale is twisted and convoluted. There are no turns of phrase that strike this reader (a university literature professor) as exemplary and extraordinary. My thoughts, as I read this work, were thus: (1)if it had been written by a newcomer, it likely would not have been published and (2) Ms. Morrison has probably reached the stage in a literary career when awards and accolades intimidate editors and most reviewers from offering an honest appraisal. In short, confusion reigns in Paradise and, unless you have ample time to waste, it is a book best left on the shelf.&quotOf; course, I may be speaking somewhat prematurely, since I managed to force myself only one-third of the way thru the book before I gratefully set it aside.The most interesting feature about the book is the enormously varied readers' reactions.There's a how-dee-doo. Could this be presaging a fundamental breakdown in society ? Hmmmm.... Aw . . . too much effort to figure it out, and the data looks kinda iffy to quantify anyway.This said, I give Paradise a &quot;2&quot; (great opening;down the tubes after page 2, tho)D.G.

I do not feel she adequately concluded all the threads running through the story."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This is the first of Ms. Morrison's books that I have read. After reading the reviews I suppose I will try the Songs of Solomon. There were pockets of well written verse hidden in alot of confusion and layering, but once discovered remained on my mind for the rest of the evening. I wished that this book had been condensed a little,...some of the fluff and fat cut away. There were far too many named characters, and none but Connie and Mavis held my attention. There was no sympathy for the girls, no pity for the struggles within the community. It read like a newspaper report....I didnt know the people, so I didnt care about their struggle. I also VERY MUCH RESENT THE BIG GOOFY LOOKING OPRAH STICKER THAT HAS DEFACED THIS AND MANY OTHER BOOKS THAT I HAVE ENJOYED....I invited Toni Morrison into my library....I enjoyed the read, I DID NOT invite OPRAH to deface the covers. I really do not care that she has read it. If she was Walt Whitman I might....but I dont think even Shakespear has the right to slap stickers claiming some sort of ownership to the books I CHOOSE."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I find it disturbing that many reviews, some of which are listed on this site, devalue this book because it doesn't deliver \\"a point\\"; but I would find this, or any devaluation, disturbing since this is one of my favorite books by Morrison. There is something to be said for subjectivity in the enjoyment of any work; often this is what separates a fine or noteworthy novel from a disappointing or lackluster one. I would, however, question the validity of those who look for a conspicuous or conclusive \\"point\\" in a work of literature. It's not an expository essay, people; it's a novel, one that seeks to question your conceptions of class, race, and gender.Clearly, I'm a defender of this novel. I found it poetic and affecting. I did not find that it plodded on or lacked description or injudiciously pointed fingers. I found that Morrison's tale of an all black town's xenophobia provided an engaging backdrop for issues of identity, intra-racial color politics, and misogyny. I felt the characters' pain and triumphs and hatred and cared enough about them to be disappointed and overjoyed. Perhaps I brought so much of my baggage to the party, I simply had to show up to enjoy myself. After all, I am black ... and a woman; but I don't feel you have to be a black woman to appreciate this tale. I suppose you just have to be okay with not having \\"the point\\" served to you on a platter. Great works of art are often inconclusive, but they've done their part when they've triggered both emotional and intellectual responses that force one to question his or her stance on traditional issues.Again, these things are subjective; however, I love this book. Some of you will also love it. Others of you will not. Pick your poison."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Like most of Toni Morrison's writing, the plotline of this book is complex and usually extremely confusing. I am still puzzled about the ending, and in fact puzzled about most of the events in the book. However, like a piece of abstrtact art, you are meant to interpret it for yourself. The overriding themes and the finely sketched characters will stay with, as well as the mood of mystery and despair. If you are willing to attempt this book with an open mind, it will seep under your skin. Though it is often hard to follow, and the actual events of the novel are foggy at best, it is a journey that in the end is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"After glancing through other readers' comments, I concluded that perhaps &quot;Paradise&quot; should have come with a warning label: NOT FOR VIEWERS OF DAYTIME TELEVISION. Oprah clearly overestimated her audience on this one. But I can't fault her taste in literature; &quot;Paradise&quot; is without a doubt one of the greatest American novels of the 20th century.I would love to re-read this book in the context of a university course or discussion group; its many strands and layers justify considerable critical thought and analysis. Some areas a thoughtful book group might explore include:-- Free will vs. predestination, and how these centuries-old themes come vividly to life in the clash of generations in the town of Ruby-- Magical realism, and especially how it applies to the characters at the Convent; the conflict between their mysterious female world of domestic magic and the male-dominated Old Guard of Ruby-- The terrible irony of how this all-black &quot;Paradise&quot; ends up reflecting the very problems of white-dominated society it sought to escape-- The theme of rebirth and renewal that runs throughout the history of both Ruby and the ConventI believe that &quot;Paradise&quot;, in its depth and complexity, takes Toni Morrison's writing a quantum leap beyond &quot;Beloved.&quot; This novel deserves serious study, multiple re-readings, and further discussion wherever possible. Like the plays of Shakespeare, it works on many levels; decoding each layer helps lead the reader into a better understanding of the next."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Paradise is novel that HAS to be read more than once to be fully understood; that I don't think can be denied by anyone who has tried to wade through the complexity of this book. If you're going to read the novel, I think you should understand this as well because without going back over certain parts in the beginning, such as the differences of the twins and their wives or whom is actually pregnant, the novel will seem like a conglomeration of short stories about past and future residents of the town that appear to connect, but don't actually.That being said, I feel this is an absolutely magnificent piece of literature when one reads it as its depth of characters and shifting of emotions between them is first rate. One of the best things that can be said about the book is that you could say you felt you were actually part of the history of Ruby as it was happening. Morrison demonstrates great care in connecting all the characters and their story arcs through subtle use of inference and bit of wit. The book is often critqued for leaving the reader to discern what is happening for themselves and I find this critique accurate. However, I like the fact that Morrison doesn't hand hold my way through the story and makes it challenging for me to understand what's going. That may put me in the minority but I find that I would rather be treated like an adult than lead in linear fashion through the story that assumes I can't comprehend the simplest clues. I would highly recommend this book to people who feel the same way. There is always John Grisham to read if this doesn't suit your tastes."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"First let me say that it has taken me years to finally read this book, having initially gotten only 'so far' and going no further. Now, having completed it less than an hour ago, I wanted to put the impressions it gave me 'out there' while still fresh on my mind. Toni Morrison is a Genius of words, imagery, storytelling and metaphor--among other things that make for epic, sustaining literature. What this story does is illuminate conditions that are universal in many aspects, though largely framed within the context of the townspeople of Ruby and the myriad fragmented lives of those women in the convent. But Ms. Morrison goes beyond the obvious and unearths what lies beneath [and above] its many layers, doing so in a way that requires full participation by the reader, and delivers ten-fold for your dedication to the Journey.With stealth and dexterity, Toni Morrison weaves Paradise tightly and loosely. It is at once transparent, then opaque, becoming transparent again and again. I am left struck with a sense of being more awake, more full, while also being appreciably more bouyant. The reason I liken this story--which is an understatement given its spanning of decades and even centuries with ease--to a 'Jewel' is due to the fact that a Jewel is born of shaping, becoming multi-faceted with every experience of friction or purposeful movement...The more experiences the more facets... What is left is the unmistakeable shimmer of the extraordinary. Beyond this, I believe I'd be saying too much, interpreting where it is not my place, but the reader's. So let me conclude by saying that when you are ready for this book you will know it. And regardless of your background, once it is finished, you will be significantly and forever changed to some degree.Thank you, Madame Toni Morrison. You Light the Way.Bead"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The main comments i had encountered everywhere about this book before i read it was people were disappointed, that it was not as good as Morrison's previous books. If that is the case, i can't wait to read more of her work!I thought this was a great book, not just because of the fine crafting of the story, but because it was so thought provoking. And i love some of the names of the characters - the four sisters in the 'nativity' play - Hope, Chaste, Lovely and Pure. Or Lone, named such because that is what she was when they found her. And Morrison does such a good job of writing about food! (i love reading about food in books, so perhaps i am a little biased).This is a story about the township of Ruby, and it's relationship to the Convent nearby. Ruby is a town populated entirely by the descendants of freed slaves, and the Convent was actually once a school for Indian girls, now a home to an eclectic grouping of women. We learn about Ruby and the Convent through the stories of various women, and i think we learn a lot about perceptions, and how history shapes the present. What was best about this story for me, however, was Morrison's wonderful use of language. Some people have complained that her work is too complicated, that ' you have to read the sentences more than once to understand them.' I didn't find this at all. This was my first Toni Morrison book, and definitely not my last."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Once again Toni Morrison has delivered a great novel. Her detailed, lyrical prose makes this book read almost like poetry. It is truly beautiful and disturbing. Then again what can you expect from a book with the unforgettable opening line of \\"They kill the white girl first.\\" From this point on you know you're going to be in for something more than just an average story. I will warn any perspective readers, while the prose flows as you read it the plot is confusing. The story switches view points and time quite frequently and while this adds to the story's appeal it does make it difficult to follow. I would suggest reading this book with a pen and paper handy, start drawing some family trees or at least a character list. I had to keep character names on my bookmark just to make sure I knew who was who and how they were all related. Once you have your system down for keeping track of who's who (or you could just be better with keeping track than me and not need an aid) you're in for a truly wonderful read. Morrison deals with both racism and colorism in such an easy manner you hardly know she's doing anything but telling a story. That's the beauty of Morrison's work. She weaves her message into the larger picture of the story and lets you walk away to think about things on your own."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The first book i have read by Toni Morrisson, i found this book awash in detail provided with such straightforward observation, that the reader is never lulled into oblivion. Instead, the characters and the bizarre town from whence they come ignites in the reader an insatiable curiosity. I have not for a long time read a book so intensely interesting, if at times a bit confusing and disturbing. But like a good mystery this book's power is in the details you wish you could remember so that you could tie all the events together neatly. As it is this book is a mosaic of women' lives and their attempts to be redeemed. Couldn't ask for a better theme. But, buyer beware, the some of the events are twisted."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I just finished Paradise and cannot wait to reread it to get to know the inhabitants of Ruby, Oklahoma, on an even deeper level. No character, and there are many, is one diemnsional. Ms. Morrison's characters are lush and complex, the prose brilliant. Morrison does not try to win the reader's sympathy for any one character over another; the women in the convent are equally as moral and equally as repugnant as the most upstanding citizens in Ruby. Ms. Morrison leaves all judgment to the reader. Admittedly, the novel will not appeal to those accustomed to the easy reading of most of today's popular fiction. I spent more than one week intensely reading this book, studying its characters, and wrestling with its nuances. It was well worth the effort. I think the reading public has been too long deprived of great literature, and I applaud Ms. Morrison's attempt to reacquaint us with fine literature. Truly great literature requires work, rereading, deep attention to detail. This novel embodies all of that, and more. A definite must-read!!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This is well worth the time to read slowly. It is an intricate plot with many things going on at once. There are a lot of characters (too many?) and it can be hard to follow. I recommend taking notes. The second time I read it, I understood it better and decided I liked it. The first time, I was unsure but it did produce a strong reaction. Men will enjoy it but women of all colors will really appreciate the story. This was the first of her books that I read. I just bought 3 others based on my experience with this one."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This book is wonderful!!! Better than Beloved, which was my favorite. The characters are brilliantly sketched out. Morrison is a brilliant artist with an exceptional talent in evoking powerful and unexpected images. She paints her characters with perfect fluidity. The shocking introductory sentence is mind-numbing. The clever contrasts between the Oven and the Convent was provocative. This is a novel about life and freedom. The hopes of all people. A must-read."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"There is a subtle snobbbishness in much of the praise of this novel. It is difficult, we are told, but everything worthwhile is. (Subtext if you don't like this book maybe you aren't up to reading it.) Toni Morrison's book is difficult, but that hardly seems the point. The question is &quot;Is it worth the effort?&quot; I have been slogging through this book in hopes that the answer is yes but in the end the answer is no. In an effort to understand what it is I was missing I checked out the NY Times website and looked for the review of Paradise. Low and behold I discovered that the NY Times had printed more than one review of this book. A favorable review (quoted above) was in the Sunday Times but a very unfavorable one was printed in the daily paper!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The story is so imbedded in unnecessary literary gymnastics that I found this book unenjoyable. The women in the convent were not likeable and the town's people were difficult to follow without a family tree. I felt no empathy for any of the characters. There were so many of them that they all appreared shallow. This is the first Toni Morrison book I have read, and I do hope this was not her best as it would be difficult to see how she could be a prize winning novelist at this rate. It takes so long to find the story that it seems to have lost any plot before it even begins. The premise of the book is fine - it is the style in which it is written that seems most flawed."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I liked the story idea, and was eager to know how it would all come about. Ms. Morrison apparently doesn't want that to happen. Time-shifting isn't so bad (I loved &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; &amp; &quot;Seinfeld Backwards&quot;), but other rapid shifts between characters, places, conversations and thoughts without guideposts seem to be purposefully misdirecting. It's interesting that many readers feel rewarded by repeated readings. I believe that rereading would be frustrating: more of the same. Those noting the similarity to reading Shakespeare seem right on. I think there's some feigned intellectualism in the writing and reviewing of this wordy, murky book. - Harry Wareham, Monterey, CA"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The writing is eloquent, the structure is distracting. I read *Beloved* years ago and found it soul-touching. I found *Paradise* too scattered to feel touched by it. I will reread the book and hope for more, but I resent the need to read it multiple times to &quot;get it&quot;. Reading *Paradise* I sense that Ms. Morrison has a plethora of deeply emotional issues within her and she seeks an avenue to express them. I would love to meet her and have her lend voice to the characters. Perhaps I should have just &quot;read&quot; the audiotape."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I finished _Paradise_ night before last and started it again last night. Not because I didn't understand it, but because I know there is even more there. It is very rare that I reread a book immediately after finishing it, but certainly the best books demand to be read over and over again, each time revealing something new. As others have commented, good books require active readers, people who don't need perfectly linear narration to appreciate what the author has to offer. I admit to being left in Morrison's dust a couple of times, and perhaps that is why I find myself so eager to reread so soon. The fluid nature of time in _Paradise_ is somewhat confusing, but I always felt that this fluidity was reflected in a deliberately non-linear narrative, not because Morrison wanted to bewilder the reader but rather because she wanted to render her characters' bewildering realities. If we are honest with ourselves I think most of us realize that the present, our present, is entangled with our past (history) and our futures (aspirations for/fears of). Certainly this is true of the people of Ruby, the women of the Convent. I don't think this is Morrison's finest book--it would be difficult to match the searing art of _Beloved_--but it's among her best (My own totally irrelevant ranking places it perhaps below _Song of Solomon_ but far more satisfying than _Jazz_) A few questions I wonder about (perhaps my second read will answer them): Why do reviewers talk about the 4 women at the Convent, when there are 5 (not counting all the ghosts, obviously)? Even Morrison, in the first paragraph, says that 9 men, more than half the number of the prey they're after, go to the Convent at dawn. And, perhaps an obvious question which reveals my own limitations: Which woman is the white one?"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"There are some of us who eat TV dinners and frozen pizza; and then there are the others, who savor only those meals which can be created from fresh ingredients and long simmering in cast-iron pots. If you are the latter, get Paradise, dig in. If your are the former, skip past it, read Jackie Collins, and enjoy the experience of tired, frozen mush. Paradise is for the active reader. You must go to the page wanting the experience, and not waiting to be hand-fed clues and bottle-fed plot developments. You need pencil in hand, dictionary near by, and the desire to research the meaning of names and the images in portraits. You see, an author does you a favor when they allow you to take their literature, and use it to expand your knowledge. If you want that, Toni Morrison will give it to you. If you do not, there are plenty of authors who are satisfied giving you less."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I'm into the third read and am finally &quot;getting it&quot;. Ms. Morrison's gift is providing that simple window to her imagination and inviting us to step through it. To consider paradise on earth as attainable only when we love unconditionally is such a powerful notion that few of us ever attempt it. It couldn't be that easy, could it? Or perhaps it's just too hard.."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni's book Paradise is challenging, beautiful, and also full of suspense. In Reading Paradise I found that I had to put 100% of my mind power into the book which was truly rewarding. The chapter that brought everything together for me was Patricia. This is definitely a book that I can read over and over again which I normally don't do. I truly enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Stripped down to bare bones, &quot;Paradise&quot; is about a town formed to provide safety and plenty for its inhabitants, and about an act of violence the town's strong but flawed men commit against a group of women living in a former convent nearby.But Toni Morrison's saga of the 360 residents of Ruby, Okla., is really the story of all human civilization, condensed.Ruby is formed after World War II as the successor of the town of Haven, whose African-American founders had held state office in the South during Reconstruction. Once they lost their public positions they found no place in the South among whites or lighter-skinned blacks. They traveled west, seeking to join other black towns on the American frontier, but were painfully rebuffed because of their material poverty and their dark skins.In Ruby, the descendants of the original families create a version of paradise--a prosperous and self-sufficient town insulated from human predators and, less successfully, from the outside world's corrupting social influences. Like all utopias, Ruby achieves a veneer of perfection but inevitably declines because its human inhabitants aren't perfect.Paralleling the town is the Convent, originally a mansion built with embezzled money to be a criminal's paradise. It becomes a Catholic school for Indian girls, then evolves into a '70s commune of damaged women who can't find safety or acceptance anywhere else.In the center of Ruby is a brick oven, first built as a utilitarian gathering place and later serving as a symbol of community. The oven bears the hammered-iron inscription &quot;Beware the furrow of His brow.&quot; By the early 1970s, the weather-worn words have become a source of conflict between older Ruby residents, who believe and adhere to the admonition to fear God, and younger residents who choose to believe that the inscription means to &quot;BE the furrow of his brow.&quot;But ultimately it is the town's most solid and respected citizens, the ones who believe they must fear God's wrath, who put themselves in the role of a wrathful God when dealing with the women of the Convent.Morrison has imagined a fascinating place and populated it with characters who demand readers' respect and empathy even as they're doing some pretty hideous things to each other. Not one character is entirely unsympathetic--not even the spoiled-rotten K.D., who tarnishes his wealthy family's good name first by hitting his pregnant 15-year-old girlfriend, then by pursuing an obsessive, abusive relationship with a Convent woman.If there is a flaw in &quot;Paradise,&quot; and of course there is, it is that the story flows too freely among characters and years, and thus can be difficult to follow. But Morrison's gorgeous words and dead-on observations make it well worth the effort.&quot;Paradise&quot; demands to be read twice, and thoughtful readers will want to do just that."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The story is one big puzzle, full of flashbacks that are intertwined and developed, leading to even more puzzlement. I never got all the characters straight, even the major ones. I found it almost impossible to follow the story line. And I found myself falling asleep after just a few pages. However, I plodded on. After all, wasn't this book recommended by Oprah? Didn't this book get rave reviews? Isn't Toni Morrison a Pulitzer Prize winner and a professor at Princeton?It's 318 long long pages and I had to push myself to read it. Halfway through the book I almost put it down. Why was I still getting the characters mixed up. Why wasn't I moved by some of their stories? I hoped it would get better after I passed the half-way mark. It didn't.The tone is heavy and depressing. The characters each have deep dark ugly secrets. There is rarely any relief from the long artistic, somewhat poetic sentences. I didn't understand the ending, but at least it was over."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison is my favorite author, and I have, by finishing Paradise, now read all of her books. And this falls in the high end. (just for the record, I rank her novels, from highest to lowest, as such: Jazz, Beloved, Song of Solomon, Paradise, Sula, Bluest Eye, Tar Baby)Yes, it was difficult to keep some of the characters straight, and even towards the end I would occasionally forget who was with what family(especially the Fleetwoods and the Morgans). Like all Toni Morrison novels, there are sometimes questions left unanswered, but that is because she is trying to shift your focus from the details to what really matters, the effects. We learn about a mysterious man who Dovey has been having an affair with, we never learn his name. His identity is not important; what is important is what theses scenes reveal about Dovey's personality and the state of her marriage with Steward. If you go into a Toni Morrison novel hoping to be satisfied by a final chapter of wrapping up all of the facts, you will be disappointed.To the reader who said s/he could not remember learning about Seneca's mother(actually it is her older sister), it is in Seneca's chapter; the scene where her sister leaves her, she lives by herself for a few days eating only cookies, and then finds the letter with lipstick that smudges in her shoe.One thing I did NOT get, however, was the final page. And I never quite understood how Piedade fit in with everything. And, some of the events in the final chapters with the showdown and the drawings on the floor seemed like the were ripped out of a bad Stephen King novel. But, hey, Ms. Morrison is a great writer and even where the plot seems a little contrived you can still fall back on the fantastic prose, structure, and wordplay."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison seems to be posing that question through the context of her latest, very arguably, most complex novel. This story of a Paradise in Oklahoma soon shines through as nothing but. In order to protect the vestiges of perfection, the town must bring order, even outside their boundaries, to a group of threatening but very non-threating women.On a deeper level, this story attempts to shine light on the power of mythology and stories in our culture, and how much they change from the real events. People looking for plot and facts, and a predictable story with a beginning, middle, and end, you will soon become confused, for Morrison purposefully contradicts herself throughout the story. Myths change through time, as do the stories of Ruby, Oklahoma.Do what I did at those times. Let her words and mastery of poetic imagery just to wash over you. If you are not comprehending, that was her intention, and just bathe in the beauty of the language and her Paradise of pictures she paints.I've read many books in my lifetime by many authors, and I must say its Morrison's books that quite often stay with me for many days afterwards. It's not an easy read, but then, life isn't easy itself."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"A very hard book to follow. I had to push myself through to finish this book. The flashbacks were hard to follow. This book is not a relaxing read. Be prepared for much work when reading this book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"If you're looking for a relaxing, purely entertaining read, this is not the book for you. Like all of Morrison's works the characters are complex and the plot is developed in a series of flashbacks. If you're willing to invest a little more effort than your standard &quot;beach read&quot; though, this is an exquisite book, rewarding you with a spiritual lift at the end. I seldom give a 5 rating, but this one deserves it."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"My conclusion my be unwarranted because I did not finish the book. I could not finish the book, I tried very had, I read it half way through twice then I read a little further and I just couldn't continue. This was the worst peice of literature that I have ever attempted to read. I can not believe that this book was rated #1. Maybe It's just me I thougt until I discussed the book with the few people that I know who were able to finish the book. I am glad that I did not buy the book, it was difinitly beyond me. I will probably never read another one of Toni Morrison's book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK. SO FAR I HAVE ENJOYED ALL OF THE BOOKS ON OPRAH'S BOOK LIST, THAT I'VE READ, HOWEVER THIS ONE DIDN'T CATCH MY INTEREST. I FOUND THE STORY VERY HARD TO FOLLOW, AND I DON'T THINK I MADE IT PAST THE 2ND CHAPTER. I HEAR THAT TONI MORRISON IS A GREAT AUTHOR, AND I DON'T KNOW IF ALL HER BOOKS ARE THIS HARD TO READ, BUT FOR PLEASURE READING, THIS BOOK DID NOT DO IT FOR ME."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I was relieved to read all the other reviews on this book.

I hate not finishing a book, but I only made it half way through this one."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"The first of the book naturally caught my attention. I labored intensely through too long chapters for somewhat more than half the book. The characters were complex and moreso their relationship to each other.

That's what all real art is about: to create something that resonates with the common man, not just with an exclusive set of art-minded elitists."},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail","review":"A RICH, AND SPLENDID STORY! It all started with a man's death. Loving to stay faithful and loyal to his partner, Rafe promises to take care of things!

If you're not interested enough, I'll be happy to say that that ain't all what's in store. Louis L'Amour always finish it with a handful of spice on each story he writes! Go get it, and you won't regret it!.."},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail","review":"When it comes to reading Louis L'Amour the modern western fan is faced with having to take things in context. Remember that L'Amour's works were primarily written in the fifties and sixties and, as a result, have a certain &quot;dignity&quot; about them that no longer applies with the westerns of today, especially those on the big screen.Take CROSSFIRE TRAIL for example. There is plenty of action here but it is painted much more subtly on L'Amour's canvass than, let's say, on those of Larry McMurtry or on Clint Eastwood's or Kevin Costner's movie screens. Frankly L'Amour or his readers would not have tolerated the raw, often harsh violence of today's western s offerings.L'Amour wrote with a clear sense of nostalgia and romance about the west. He was much for the kindred spirit of John Wayne and John Ford than of McMurtry, Eastwood or Costner.I thoroughly enjoyed CROSSFIRE TRAIL, a tale of revenge, deceit and, as is the case with all L'Amour tales, of ultimate white-hatted triumph and justice. The fan of the movie of the same title, starring Tom Selleck, should note that there are some differences between the screenplay and the book. But all in all the story is the same and is just as enjoyable in print as the story told on the big screen. Read it in the correct mindset and you have a masterpiece.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail","review":"Louis L'Amour often wrote novels of men whose strength of character was their best redeeming quality although they were handy with guns and were rough and tough when it mattered. Rafe Caradec's promise to a dying man kicks off this tale that begins on a ship and plays out in Wyoming amid lawless men and unfriendly Indians. The story has touches of romance and plenty of shootouts and fistfights, and as usual, the bad guys get what's coming to them. Caradec does seem to good to be true but the tale is a good read and ranks as one of his best western yarns."},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail","review":"Louis L'Amour may not have had the prettiest writing style but his westerns had such an easy and relatable accessability to them that readers readily snapped them up. And, actually, L'Amour's love of the wild west and the old frontier was so palpable that many passages of his novels did end up reading like poetry. I've read most of his stuff and, bar none, this guy is my favorite writer of westerns (well, okay, Zane Grey, as well). CROSSFIRE TRAIL is just one sample of L'Amour's ability to transport the reader back to the old west, when your word meant a whole lot more, when men were hardy (and probably very dusty) and a trusty horse and a well-oiled pistol determined life or death. I'm sure things weren't so black and white back then or that simple, but L'Amour drew a clear line between the dastardly and the heroic. And, always, always, he told an exciting story.L'Amour's protagonists are basically all cut from the same mold. Much like how one takes it for granted that mystery author Dick Francis's heroes are inevitably urbane, unassuming, and grittily resolute in the face of adversity, Louis L'Amour almost without exception writes his leading men as lean, tall, strong, upright and very capable. They're all heller with a gun, peerless in a brawl and savvy in the ways of the west. Rafe Caradec, the central character of CROSSFIRE TRAIL, fits all this to a T. In the parlance of his time, Caradec is a man to ride the river with.CROSSFIRE TRAIL was published in 1954, and it's a testament to L'Amour's skills and timeless appeal that this story doesn't at all read as dated. It's a fast-paced story of survival in the wilderness and a reckoning in Wyoming. Rafe Caradec, on the surface, is a rough sort, skilled with a gun and with his fists. A man of commanding presence, he escapes from forced shipboard labor, vowing to keep a promise he made to Charles Rodney, a dead friend left behind. Rafe makes his way to Wyoming, set on looking up and protecting Rodney's family and wresting back Rodney's ranch, of which ownership is currently in question. In the tiny cowtown of Painted Rock, Rafe Caradec runs into a world of trouble.He learns quickly that Painted Rock is controlled by a gang of scoundrels and stone cold killers. Worse, the gang's conniving head honcho, Bruce Barkow, is engaged to Rodney's beautiful daughter, Ann. Worse than that? Ann doesn't at all believe Rafe's story and instead suspects that Rafe is out to get the ranch for himself. But Rafe is not without unexpected facets. He's able to buffalo the thugs with mere talk (even if it's talk bolstered by the threat of imminent violence). In a courtroom scene, he smoothly acquits himself from a charge of murder. Gradually, Rafe begins to turn the tide. And, naturally, Bruce Barkow, slated initially as the book's prohibitive Big Bad, persists in resorting to underhanded means. But someone lurks in the wings and, as it turns out, this hombre is a lot worse and far more frightening than Barkow.To add more texture to the thing, the Sioux hover somewhere in the backdrop and there's the mystery of why Barkow so covets Rodney's land. CROSSFIRE TRAIL, like most of L'Amour's novels, reads like a bullet and offers plenty of Rafe Caradec bracing his enemies, resulting in blazing gunplay and a hellacious brawl or two or three. And while L'Amour never was one to get muddied too much in epic love story, he does throw in the occasional romantic spark. Let's just say, it's not too long before Ann Rodney begins to have serious misgivings about her shifty fiance.No surprises in this book, as CROSSFIRE TRAIL isn't really Louis L'Amour at his tiptop best. But nonetheless this is a pretty riveting no-frills read, and it's a lot of fun watching the dangerous Rafe Caradec outtalking, outthinking, and outfighting those what done him and his friends wrong. Reading Louis L'Amour's vivid descriptions of the lay of the land and the people inhabiting it, you can't help but soak in the old west atmosphere and the rugged culture. As usual, L'Amour tacks descriptive sobriquets onto several of his characters (Texas Brisco, Bully Borger, Gee Bonaro, Trigger Boyne), catchy nicknames being an element prevalent in the western mythos. And, as well, the occasional homespun vernacular lends one more touch of authenticity. I've said this elsewhere, there's Zane Grey and there's Louis L'Amour. In my eyes, every other western writer takes a back seat."},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail","review":"&quot;Law was still largely a local matter&quot;.

Sometimes, too many of the books I read are too serious, or too dramatic, or too thought provoking, but Louis Lamour can be counted on for straight facts.

It is hard to teach adults about how our money supply works, let alone teach kids about it, when kids don't even have jobs, debts, or bills.This book led to a series of grade school & junior high summer jobs as my brother and I took to the neighborhood looking for ways to make spending money for our Lego set addictions.Years later, I sailed through simultaneous classes in Macro-Econ and Micro-Econ in college due largely to the course of self study that this book started a decade earlier.I will be purchasing this book (once I have the cash allocated for its purchase since I run a debt-free consumption household!) so that my children have this as a guide in their formidable years as well."},{"Title":"Designing a Home with Wood","review":"This book is filled with inspiring photos and interesting tid-bits and suggestions for using wood practically everywhere in your home. It covers traditional uses of wood such as flooring and kitchen cabinets to more unexpected uses including wooden bath tubs.The book begins with a discussion of many species of wood including typical uses of that wood and why it is ideal for those uses. It then moves to discussions of specific rooms and both the conventional and creative uses of wood in those spaces. Next come photos and brief discussions of how to incorporate wood in several different design styles with chapters on American styles, European styles and exotic styles. The book concludes with a chapter on wood finishes. The appendix includes a table summarizing most of the wood species discussed in the book as well as over 180 color photos of 1\\" square samples of wood species variations.On a downside, just note that the book was difficult to read cover-to-cover. I believe the font choice and size was a significant factor. Many times, I found myself rereading paragraphs or loosing my place mid-sentence.If you are looking for inspiration, you'll find some here. This book has a lot to offer anyone wanting to incorporate more wood into an existing or planned home.

Not saying that men are more logical or right, buy we thing differently.What we observe as erratic woman behavior is simply just a different means in operating and living in our face paced world.In the end you root for Isadora that she may find the love, happiness, and sexual satisfaction that she desperately seeks."},{"Title":"Waltzing With the Ghost of Tom Joad: Poverty, Myth, and Low-Wage labor in Oklahoma","review":"Question: What do most service sector jobs, hog farms, chicken plants, and so-called right-to-work laws have in common? Answer: All do, or will, contribute to the perpetuation of poverty in Oklahoma, already the eighth-poorest state in the nation. This book should be a best seller in Oklahoma. It won't be, but it should. Amazingly, as we enter the 21st century, this is the first comprehensive study and analysis of poverty in a state that has consistently experienced a poverty rate above the national average. Using ethnography with statistical analysis, Maril has explored the age-old myths about the poor, discusses the facts behind the myths, and points to the real causes of poverty, expecially low-wage labor, which has been the hallmark of most state so-called &quot;economic development&quot; programs. Maril debunks such myths as the poor being lazy, refusing to work, and on welfare. Among the 600,000 or so Oklahoman's that are poor, some 20% of the population, 52% work and the majority do not, repeat, do not receive welfare assistance. Maril followed twelve poor Oklahoma families over a four-year period and found obstacles such as poor health and a lack of medical insurance, the lack of quality childcare, concerns for personal safety, and low-paying jobs as major contributors to poverty. The author had four major objestives when writing the book. First, to describe the poor and poverty in Oklahoma in detail using historical trends and patterns. Second, to examine the myths, typically accepted as facts, about the poor in Oklahoma. Third, to define the real causes of poverty. Fourth, to propose a public policy agenda that would correct the costly and ineffective system now in effect in Oklahoma. He met, and exceeded, them all. This is an excellent, timely, thoughtful, highly-readable study of the real causes, and costs, of poverty in Oklahoma. While the author may not have all the answers, and public thought and debate on his conclusions and recommendations will be healthy, one thing is for sure: the continued harping on the economic virtues of more hog farms, chicken plants, so-called right-to-work laws, and other low-wage proposals will not help remove Oklahoma from the Tom Joad era. This book is a perfect example of the real need and importance of university presses. OU press is to be commended for their foresight and courage in making it available to the general public. It will not be a best seller...but it should."},{"Title":"Meditation Handbook","review":"For both the beginner interested in meditation, or the skilled practitioner with many years of experience, this profound text provides the reader with everything he or she needs to achieve enlightenment.

And it is distilled, without any loss of flavor or potency, into these 21 meditations. Icompleted these meditations in 1997. I made more progress thanI ever had in any spiritual or psychological program. So I naturally started to do the meditations for a second 21-days.I treated my family as myself or better. I felt that life had meaning. I felt part of you, the reader of this review, as well.That there was a connection to everything else. Then my brotherasked me what program I was doing. I told him that it was theLamrim meditations of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. He told me that theDali Lama was angry at him for worshipping a protector deity named Dorje Shugden. So I quit. Until now. I did a one month exhaustive investigation of this affair. I have found Geshe Kelsang Gyatso blameless. And the Dali Lama was trying to keep his country intact because a book titled \\"The Yellow Book\\" wasdividing it. This book portrayed Dorje Shugden as a hero entity that was protecting Tibet and driving away the Nyingma influences. I am back. And this book is the best. It may not be the best for you. But it is the best for me. The 21 meditations are a concise psychological map for mental health. I have known lamas and swamis who are quite mean-spirited. But howcan you be mean if you are meditating on love? The mind takes the form of whatever it is paying attention to. After you have this book, you will see that the first meditation involves meditating on your Spiritual Guide. Don't be frightened. You can meditate on Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. Or you can meditate on the Dali Lama.Pick one of them as your Spititual Guide if you don't have a teacher of somekind. The next problem that you might encounter is the meditation on Tranquil Abiding. I just called The NKTCenter in Los Angeles to get an answer. You can achieve tranquil abiding (the ninth stage) at home and in the evenings.Students have done so. This book is such a tremendous achievement. You will have such great joy. I am sorry that I quit.

I recommend those who are not sure about how to meditate to read this book which will be helpful at all times. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Meditation Handbook","review":"I stumbled upon Buddhism several months ago and felt it deserved a closer look. After purchashing Gyatso's \\"Introduction to Buddhism\\", I decided to seek out a local practice. Fortunately there was a weekly Buddhism Meditation Class about 25 minutes from my home.I attended the class and felt that it was somewhat valuable. It gave me an opportunity to get out of the house, meet new people and explore Buddhism further. Interestingly, upon further research I found the class I was attending was part of Gyatso's schools! I was quite happy to fall into order.The next book I purchased was \\"The New Meditation Handbook\\", which covers many (if not all) of the meditations that Gyatso recommends his students do on a regular basis. It also includes prayers and mantras and explanations of everything. It seemed to be a great read, although Gyatso does recycle a good amount of his material from book to book.Finally, I purchased Transform Your Life: A Blissful Journey and attended a retreat at the NKT school. I walked away from the retreat with a different \\"feel\\" for NKT Buddhism.NKT stands for New Kadampa Tradition and while I am really not versed enough in what the Old Kadampa Tradition is, I remember reading that NKT was founded by Gyatso in the UK as a means of seperating from Tibetan Buddhism because of the politics. Gyatso has sold countless books and has established thousands of practices throughout the world.NKT Buddhism wasn't for me. There were some things that Gyatso taught that just didn't make sense to me. Granted, he's the Tibetan Monk and I'm just the average Joe, but Buddha himself is quoted as saying \\"Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.\\" And unfortunately, NKT Buddhism just didn't appeal to my own reason and common sense...but it may be different for you.Overall there is nothing objectionable in Gyatso's teachings. I do not care much for how Buddha is revered as a god and considerable time is spent reciting prayers to Buddha."},{"Title":"Meditation Handbook","review":"Let's get down to business, consciousness enters the human body to meditate.

This is perfect for anyone who is looking to learn to meditate or wants a selection of sure-fire, practical, and well-tested meditations that will definitely bring greater happiness into ones' life.The 21 meditations listed here, called the Stages to the Path of Enlightenment, or 'Lamrim', come from the Buddhist master Atisha in an unbroken lineage. These meditations have been integrated into Tibetan Buddhist practice for nearly 1000 years. Just from withstanding the effect of time it is obvious that these must be quite powerful. From my own side, utilizing and constantly meditating on each daily meditation in a 21 day cycle has transformed the way I think, act, and understand life as a whole. Their depth dramatically increases as time goes by and it becomes more and more evident why these are hailed as a perfect selection of meditations.We often spend too much time absorbing more and more book-learning and information without putting what we have learned into practice.

Additionally, much of the wording herein is also repeated (in many cases, verbatim), within Gyatso's other audio books (i.e.: Transform Your Life, How To Solve Our Human Problems, Introduction to Buddhism, etc.). There is even considerable repetition contained within the presently reviewed audio book itself. In other words, lots of regurgitation with little in the way of new or revelatory information.At one point, the author claims swatting a mosquito in anger will result in eons in the hell realm. He means this literally, not figuratively or as a parable, and with no discussion of purification.Overall, it is quite preachy (\\"You must...\\"), but Gyatso does not support his rigid certainty on his subject matter other than to establish himself as the only authority on the subject. If you can blindly trust him and can believe only one author can cover the depth of Buddhism (as many seem to be able to do) you will end up with a rather narrow view on the subject.Skip this oversimplified, unsubstantiated, repetitive and preachy volume and get something from mainstream Buddhist authors instead, including Dalai Lama approved sources such as the down-to-earth Guided Meditations on the Stages of the Path by Thubten Chodron, which includes 14+ hours of guided and easy-to-use meditations on an mp3 CD for about the same price, and with a forward by His Holiness (also available from Amazon).This book is clear and easy to understand, and unlike Gyatso's self-important, claustrophobic writings, features an extensive bibliography for further reading. The CD meditations are easy to follow and delivered with extraordinary warmth, combining to yield a most effective outcome. Rest assured with the approval of His Holiness The Dalai Lama and Thubten Chodron's lucid and kind voice, you will be learning how to establish a daily meditation practice from an authentic and mainstream Buddhist. Further recommended are titles by Yangsi Rinpoche on the subject of Lamrim meditation, also available from Amazon.These recommended books are intended to steer those new to Buddhism to genuinely helpful sources, the secondary purpose of any review. The suggestions are also the result of further research when I was once again \\"allowed\\" to read other Buddhist authors after terminating membership with Gyatso's organization.UPDATE:Finally, and of interest is how followers automatically claim \\"anger\\" on the part of negative reviewers for this author. It must be the officially encouraged/sanctioned word to use as it is ALWAYS invoked in subsequent comments 100% of the time. I genuinely feel no anger towards anyone involved, rather, I am merely amused by the over-the-top defensiveness and the militancy of this group, which only serves to further prove its draconian nature.

If so, what would be the point in following the directions within Gyatso's book since we are all guilty of this and already destined for eternal hell? There is no follow up discussion about purification and the balance of karma. That's it... angrily swat a mosquito, and off to hell you go.The Buddha said to use your wisdom. Did that mean almost cult-like fervor for the author as if evidenced by all of the 5-star reviews that basically say the same thing using the same words? Gyatso bestowed the Geshe title upon himself even though he refused to take the Geshe test when offered. Taking him seriously would be like taking a self-proclaimed medical doctor seriously who refused testing and who lacks an actual medical diploma. Gyatso refused the Geshe test and is not a Geshe, period. Therefore, he is no more an authority on this subject than any other lay person. Sorry fans... I do not recognize his \\"authority\\" on anything.Overall, it is quite preachy (\\"You must...\\" ...or words to that effect), but Gyatso does not support his rigid certainty on his subject matter other than to establish himself as the only authority on the subject. If you can blindly trust him and can believe only one author can cover the depth of Buddhism (as many seem to be able to do) you will end up with a rather narrow view on the subject.Alternatives:Skip this oversimplified, unsubstantiated, repetitive and preachy volume and get something from mainstream Buddhist authors instead, including Dalai Lama approved sources such as the down-to-earth Guided Meditations on the Stages of the Path by Thubten Chodron, which includes 14+ hours of guided and easy-to-use meditations on an mp3 CD for about the same price, and with a forward by His Holiness (also available from Amazon).This book is clear and easy to understand, and unlike Gyatso's self-important, claustrophobic writings, features an extensive bibliography for further reading. The CD meditations are easy to follow and delivered with extraordinary warmth, combining to yield a most effective outcome. Rest assured with the approval of His Holiness The Dalai Lama and Thubten Chodron's lucid and kind voice, you will be learning how to establish a daily meditation practice from an authentic and mainstream Buddhist. Further recommended are titles by Yangsi Rinpoche on the subject of Lamrim meditation, also available from Amazon.These recommended books are intended to steer those new to Buddhism to genuinely helpful sources, the secondary purpose of any review. The suggestions are also the result of further research when I was once again \\"allowed\\" to read other Buddhist authors after terminating membership with Gyatso's organization.[I bought this book by Gyatso (and many others) when deeply into the New Kadampa Tradition. After April 22, 2008 (Google the date and the Dalai Lama), I came to realize the true nature of NKT and walked away from it.]"},{"Title":"Meditation Handbook","review":"I was very disappointed in thee didactic, dull, and heavy tone of this book. I've practised buddhism for more than 25 years, and honestly find the approach outlined in this book among the least attractive, least helpful, and most naive of the many books I've read. The title 'to Make Our Life Happy and Meaningful' especially rings false to me. Of course this is a lovely thought but I didn't read anything in the contents of the book and the practice it describes which made me happy or which clarified anything. Instead it left me confused and irritated. Perhaps some of the awkward writing is due to translation difficulties, though the book credits no translators -- a point of suspicion, as an enlightened author always credits his or her translator -- and one that added to the didactic, pedantic tone of The New Meditation Handbook."},{"Title":"Meditation Handbook","review":"The people buying this book think its a meditation book. Boy did they get fooled. Most of the book is about paranormal concepts like \\"spiritual guides\\" and \\"karma\\" and praying. That is fine and dandy, but the author should not pretend the book is about meditation. If your looking for superstitious concepts from Buddhism you will like the book. If your looking for meditation you will be gravely dissapointed. He covers only one meditation the whole book and barely even explains it."},{"Title":"Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 1","review":"This manga is one of the best i've read, and believe me, i've read a lot.It starts out with a character named Gon, very strong and very good at fishing (you'll get me when you read it). He enters a vigorous contest to become a hunter. There he meets three companions that all travel with him through the competition. There are a lot of challenges that provide for tons of adventure throughout the books. Not only do the books have a good story line but the art is not too detailed and is easy on the eyes.over all, this is a great buy, and you will definetly not regret buying this series."},{"Title":"Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 1","review":"I picked this up just two days ago, thinking it might be good. I have read the series Yu Yu Hakusho (at least what's published of it so far), and loved it. This series is by the same man. If you liked Yu Yu Hakusho, you're bound to like this too.There are a few main things that differ between the two. First of all, Hunter X Hunter seems to be more of an adventure manga, rather than the fighting manga that Yu Yu Hakusho turned out to be. The drawings in Hunter X Hunter are great, but are, for the most part, not as detailed as in Yu Yu Hakusho. Finally, Hunter X Hunter plays more around a few characters rather than just focusing on one, as in Yu Yu Hakusho.So if you like adventure, danger, excitement, then Hunter X Hunter is definitely for you! I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 1","review":"Okey, so I've never read this, but I DO own the entire animated sereies (nearly 100 episodes, fansubbed) & I can only think of this as a Heavily BL-Suggestive take on the genres Yu Yu Hakushou & Dragonball took (yes, even slashier than Yu Yu!) I also know that this manga went on haiatus this year in Japan, but hopefully it will rebound without being cancled or abandoned.This series will grasp any gender or age tightly & keep them reading/watching; the stories are just that interesting. It also has a really hot biseinen called Hisola with questionable taske in clothing (an old-fashioned baseball suit?) But BL fans are the ones who will REALLY have a good time with this series."},{"Title":"Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 1","review":"This is my favorite Anime and as you may have noticed, I have given this Anime a perfect score. First let me start off by explaining why.(This review is based on 2 viewings of this Anime & the 3 OVA's). I liked it even better the second time around.Hunter x Hunter (pronounced Hunter Hunter) is an amazing series. It starts off a little slow but when it gets into the Hunter Exams (first arc) it is very addicting. The main characters are:MINOR CHARACTER SPOILERS AHEAD!!!GON - A 12 year old boy who is looking for his father who left him as a baby for very mysterious reasons...Killua - A 12 year old boy who has a very dark past...Kurapika - Revenge, revenge...Leorio - A seemingly greedy and shallow man who wants the enormous amount of money and prestige that comes from becoming a Hunter but has his own personal demons and reasons...The genius of this series is that it doesn't do the things that make Anime series annoying over time. There are no predictable moments such as the 1 or 2 signature moves that characters whip out all the time or the episode setups like travel together, encounter monsters, kill them and find missing piece of whatever. Instead every episode is different and there are many different arcs instead of just one major one that everyone is fighting for.This series focuses a lot on male friendships. The characterization is amazing and this series has one of the most detailed fighting system that I have seen (Nen)Animation/Direction - You may wonder why I added direction in my heading for this category. This is because I believe that direction is just as important as Animation. It is a vital part of how an Anime feels, POV and especially suspense factor.Of course if one is to compare HXHs' Animation with the latest and greatest they will be disappointed. But I actually think the fact that the animation isn't awe inspiring works to its' favor and here's why. This lets the watcher focus more on the story. What we have instead is an Animation that focuses on realism (dark shadows, dull colours inside the tower etc). If one looks at backgrounds and buildings they will notice that the Animation is very fitting to the locale and the storys' tone at the moment. This is by no means a cutesy Anime with all the characters wide-eyed and rainbow haired. The expressions on the characters faces are also nicely rendered at exactly the right moments.It knows what it should be and when. I have seen this Anime twice and I have figured out for me why it is so enjoyable.The direction and editing alone deserves a 10/10. The editing is flawless from the 5th episode onwards.The Direction must be given props especially during fights and dramatic scenes. Also the use of close-up face shots (sometimes highlighting eyes, or mouth) body shots such as hands ie Killua, feet/stances (during fights) and general panoramic \\"shots\\" definately holds your attention, they know what they are doing. Kudos.By no means was the first 5 episodes awful though, it was just not as easy to get into because I didn't know where the story was going ie funny, action, dramatic etc. especially during the very first episode. I guess I was maybe expecting that it would be one or the other but as the series progressed I noticed that this would be a Classic because there is a little bit of everthing as all great Anime Series are IMO. Also I think that the title is a little vague and frankly you don't know what to expect when you first watch it if nobody recommended this to you (this was my case).SoundI am going to break this down.Voice ActorsAbsolutely perfect. I cannot think of one voice that was not fitting for the character. The voice actors are pros. You feel that they know thier characters so well that they are thier characters. I believe that VA are 50% of the character. If I had to choose I would say that Hisoka is the best with Gon so close behind that he's stepping on his Joker boots and Killua close enough to grab Gons' fishing rod.MusicAll the opening and ending songs definately grows on you. Ohayou (the first opening song) is uplifting and hopeful, I smile everytime I hear it now. The second Op was Alt. Rock, it reminded me of some early Our Lady Peace stuff.The many music themes for certain moods are so seamlessly intergrated for the designated scenes. They are sometimes haunting, happy, mischevous, forboding etc. All are composed quite nicely with a good variety of instruments including melodies with the piano, organ, jazz piano, bass etc...(Yamaha P120 maybe?) Jazz and Classical, I believe Chopin was even used for a scene. It is definately above average. Somehow everything seems to fall into place even better the second time around.Sound EffectsNice, sound effects are used accordingly to the situation ie the trapped air on the airship can be heard in the background etc.Crisp, clean, real...no problems.StoryThis Anime has many levels. It is a very deep, funny, dark, exciting, uplifting, suspenseful, imaginitive series. To truly know what I mean one must watch it in it's entiretyMost of what you read here is about 50% at most of what this series is, including this review. This is simply because the story is so vast and detailed and multifacted that it would take more than a three pages to explain it all.Have you ever watched a movie and started to predict what would happen next while you are watching it?You will probably not get a chance to do that here because of the gripping storyline. You will most likely be still thinking about the latest event when the next event happens.It is important to note that this entire series does not contain any fillers.Each episode is something new, no repeat formats.Another thing that should be mentioned is that people definately die in this Anime and sometime even main characters kill people.Each character has his own motives and storyline and there are about 6 (maybe more) story arcs.I don't know about other fans but I've never been more anxious than when waiting for K to return. Absolutely submersive storyline.CharacterAhhh...the heart and soul of the entire Series.I really think all men should watch this because it was clearly made with much thought and care for you.Many complex male themes are explored.The need to make your own victories, the sport of competing, the beauty in a challenge, the rare and great true friendship that accepts you for who you are but pushes you to become who you can be and most of all the relationship between a boy and a father. Even I feel like I understand a man better now.All in all this entire show is a character study of being a Boy and Man.People who think that Gon is simple and boring don't really understand his character.SpoilersGon always stands up for himself.Gon is the only character that changes everyone around him.He is pure and interacts with others believing in thier goodness as well.But he LOVES a challenge too and will stop at nothing to get what he wants.He is an inspiration because he knows exactly what he wants and trys to find the right way to get it.ValueThe first time I saw this series I finished it in about 5-6 days.10/10 rewatch value is extremely high because the story is so in-depth it is actually better to watch it twice.I know I'm not the only one that had Nen completely down only the second time through. Ummmm...........if anyone has any complaints in the value section then they are lying........or they overpaid because this series is FREE as of this date. You really can't get any more value then Free.The entire series including the 3 OVA's are still available at AnimeSuki. That's about 100 quality episodes (all these reviews are proof). The fansubs at AnimeSuki are great. Thanks Fansubbers!!!I know this because as someone who knows about 5% of Japanese, I still found myself laughing out loud during many moments just from the subs and not to mention a great way to pick up some Japanese as well.I really do recommend this Anime wholeheartedly.I guess I just want others to have as an enjoyable experience as I did. Yes it can be misleading in the beginning so please give it a chance and watch about 10 episodes, it took me about 3 but I'm a patient person.I also just happened to stumble upon this Series while browsing on AnimeSuki for a long Anime to watch so I went in with no expectations and no idea what it was going be be about, that's the best ;)Enjoy and please write your own thoughts afterwards =)"},{"Title":"Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 1","review":"Hunter X Hunter is good series with engaging, mysterious characters and an intriguing storyline. However, the long \\"Hunter Exam\\" arc may not appeal to everyone and the occasionally inconsistent artwork will likely upset some fans of Togashi's previous works. (There may be some SPOILERS ahead).The story is easy to follow and contains many clever and creative twists. Hunters are people with access to confidential information, restricted locations, and loads of wealth. To become a Hunter, you must acquire a liscense by passing the Hunter Exam. We are introduced to Gon, a young and ambitious inhabitant of Whale Island with a skill for communicating with animals. Gon aspires to obtain a Hunter's License and find his father Ging, a famous and successful Hunter. Througout Gon's journey to reach the Exam Hall, he encounters two interesting characters: Kurapika and Leorio. The three eventually become friends and together they tackle the rigorous and grueling Hunter Exam, meet remarkable adversaries, and struggle to acheive their goals.The first volume has a solid translation with what may seem like promising artwork to some. The art isn't bad but the quality varies too often. The first volume doesn't show this as well as later volumes which contain a few more inconsitencies (examples are the ending chapters of volume six with very sketchy designs).The characters are what really kept me reading. Gon seems a bit shallow and slightly immature but he is fiercely loyal and a skilled combatant. The designs of Leorio and Kurapika aren't fully developed when they are first introduced but they gradually fall into place. Leorio, despite seeming conceited and obsessed with money at first, is an admirable (and at times determined) character. His dialougue, however, doesn't seem to fit his character all the time (an example would be in volume five when he suggests a character tellls their opponent to go \\"suck an egg\\").Kurapika is upstanding and just but is never given a specific gender. I lean in favor of Kurapika being a guy so I will refer to him as a \\"he\\". Kurapika is very fair and very honorable. He does have a dark side which we see when we learn he and spiders don't mix. With a strong grudge against the Phantom Troupe who slaughtered his brethren, Kurapika is not one to joke with.Then we meet the more enigmatic characters who give the series a bit of a darker tone.Killua caught my attention right from the beginning. A kid with silver hair and a skateboard, he seems innocent and naive. But why are the drugs he ends up drinking ineffective? I do not wish to spoil anything about this character but be forewarned: Appearances are very deceiving.The last character I will mention is Hisoka; a psychotic clown with a set of combat skills. Hisoka is not one to trifle with as we later find out. He is clever and can kill without hesitiation. In volume six we learn how Hisoka makes his playing cards so sharp... Also, be aware that Hunter X Hunter is not for everyone. Though the artwork and character designs are sometimes \\"cute\\", there is a lot of violence and gore.The series grows as the volumes progress. The constantly maturing protagonists will keep you glued to the pages as abilities and pasts are revealed. If you're patient and willing to give the series a chance, you might find yourself flipping through the ensuing volumes to find out what happens next."},{"Title":"Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 1","review":"That doesn't mean I don't like Yu Yu Hakusho, because I have all 19 volumes but, Togashi's writing in that series really prompted me to get into Hunter x Hunter.The back stories of the characters, the character development and also the subplots are so well delivered and they often overlap in very unique ways. This kind of writing is very hard for me to like, and the author presents it without it being confusing for me. (The overlapping plots in CLAMP's Tsubasa Chronicles for example hurt my brain, so I stopped reading the series).The artwork is not as advanced as Yu Yu Hakusho, but there are points where the work becomes very detailed and shows just how talented a drawer that the author is. There is much more dialogue, as well. This book is quite a bit bloodier, and the characters run into a lot of life or death situations.If you've read Yu Yu Hakusho you may notice similarities between the four lead characters and the Hunter x Hunter characters. Gon takes after Yusuke but very minimally, he is much more light hearted and gentle. Killua takes after Hiei as far as the gore is concerned... Leorio is a definitive Kuwabara, and Kurapika is the blonde version of Kurama. Still, these characters do have their own straights that separate them from other stories and make them very likable.I recommend this to anyone who wants to read a story, a very, very big story! You'll really love it.Edit: I feel it necessary to elaborate on the character's personalities a little bit more.Gon - He is neither good or evil, very neutral most of the time but he has a heart of gold and a love for all living things, even the bad guys. He tends to be very curious, and loves to learn about new tools, techniques and take on crazy challenges. The one thing that makes him identical to a character like Yusuke is, Gon is heroic, can take a beating and usually gets incredibly angry at anyone who kills others.Leorio - He's not the sharpest tool in the shed sometimes... He tends to act on impulse and lose his cool. Still, Leorio is a sweet character, with very strong ambitions and is also very loyal. Surprisingly though, he starts to take on a very strategic and calculating personality as the series moves on.Kurapika - I didn't particularly care for Kurama's character, he bored me when I first got into Yu Yu Hakusho. Kurapika has that calm, super-intelligent style, but he is much more interesting and his rage sets him far apart from Kurama. He has serious motives, and while he is respectful to the other lead characters, he doesn't seem to me like a loyal character to anyone but the people from his past.Killua - Of the four, I adore this character the most. He's rebellious, aggressive, somewhat hot-headed but he has a very child-like demeanor. He's bright, he watches everything and out of everyone is really is the most skilled when it comes to tracking things down or playing life like it's a poker game. He's a little on the dangerous side, being from a family of assassins but, he forms a very close bond to Gon very early on and becomes extremely loyal.I noticed a lot of reviews mentioning the artwork... Togashi started this not to long after Yu Yu Hakusho, and he had some health issues during the final stages of the series that made it hard for him to illustrate sometimes. I think the inconsistencies may be due to that, and they disappear rather quickly as the series progresses."},{"Title":"Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 1","review":"The first chapters of any manga are always the toughest. The characters have to be introduced, the world has to be set up, and the author has to snag the readers' interest.Such is the trouble for the first several chapters of Yoshihiro Togashi's \\"Hunter X Hunter\\" in its first volume -- it moves rather slowly and seems a bit too childish in its worldbuilding. But the introduction of a brutal villain and some solid backstory -- as well as the promising idea of the Hunters -- gains steam in the last half, and leaves you anticipating more.Gon has wanted to be a Hunter ever since Kite, a protege of his long-lost father Ging's, told him about him.And a few years later Gon successfully gains permission from his reluctant aunt to go take the Hunter exam. But he soon finds that the Hunters rapidly weed out most candidates -- he ends up on a storm-tossed ship filled with seasick wannabes. The only other ones who make the first cut are the seemingly mercenary Leorio, and the mysterious, vengence-filled Kurapika.And upon arriving at their port, the trio finds themselves dealing with increasingly bizarre tests involving unanswerable questions and vicious magical beasts. But these are only the preliminaries to the REALLY dangerous stuff, and the three aspiring Hunters -- as well as the deadly young boy Killua -- find themselves in a literal race to their dreams. Unfortunately, there are some nasty people along the way....It's pretty clear from the start of \\"Hunter X Hunter\\" that Yoshihiro Togashi intended for this to be a more fantastical, childlike kind of manga, rather than an outright fightfest. Gigantic fishes carried by a tiny kid, talking bipedal foxes, and the general feeling that we've stepped into a children's fantasy book. Nice, but rather lightweight.Fortunately things start settling into a more comfortable groove later on -- Togashi's work starts shining when the various aspiring Hunters start openly competing with each other, and we're introduced to some of Gon's rivals. We've even got a villain in the works -- a homicidal clown who slices people apart with playing cards. Once somebody gets dismembered alive, you know Togashi has hit his stride.Those who have read Togashi's previous series \\"Yu Yu Hakusho\\" will recognize the basic cast. Aside from the inhumanly perky protagonist, we have the big lug with a heart of gold, a tiny spiky-haired killer, and a beautiful, smart young man with an unpleasant past. Fortunately Togashi provides enough background to solidify them -- Leorio's dead friend, Kurapika's vengeance. Killua is particularly intriguing -- you can tell this lethal preteen is going to be an amazing character.The first volume of \\"Hunter X Hunter\\" is unsteady, fluffy and a bit slow at first, but Yoshihiro Togashi hits his stride in the second half of the manga. And the characters promise to get more interesting with time."},{"Title":"Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 1","review":"WARNING: Do not form your opinion of this series based on the 1st (and 2nd) books. The start can be rather boring.This is one of my favorite manga series. It is nothing like the typical fighting series the Shonen Jump magazine is famed for. Intelligent, humorous, fast paced, brutal and filled with likeable characters. This series also lacks the black and white division between good and evil - it simply has a range of different characters all working to advance their own motives. And on that note, the \\"bad\\" guys in this show should receive special acclaim.The series never bogs down, it moves from one intersting event to another at a good pace. Fights occur seldom and they usually last from half a chapter to 1 chapter. Also, this is maybe one of the most unpredictable series I've come accross. You never know what kind of a turn the series is going to take, and exactly how important a certain event might be.The artwork is pretty simplistic, but at the same time somehow stylish, and believe me, you'll be so absorbed in the story that you won't pay much attention to the art.A must read for any manga fan, whether you like shonen mangas or not."},{"Title":"Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 1","review":"Hunter x Hunter is not meant to be a deep and philosophical manga that delves into the nature of love, humanity, religion, or life in general. It IS meant to be a fun and entertaining romp through a colorful setting with colorful characters, and it succeeds at this well.Now, this comic is not exactly very fighting heavy, at least early on. If you buy comics only to see people beating the tar out of each other you may be disappointed. Instead, early on Hunter x Hunter relies more on dangerous situations that must be overcome using the main characters wits. So, think of it kind of like Indiana Jones but without guns tanks, and in a sort of modern fantasy setting.Now, the translation is pretty darn good and nothing appears to be censored as there are quite a few violent scenes. However, there is one thing keeping me from giving this manga a solid five stars and that's the art-style.Don't get me wrong, the art style is good, however occasionally things will look a little, under drawn. Often times this is actually a pretty neat effect, but other times it's a bit distracting and some people will not like it.All, things considered however, I highly recommend this title to anybody that is a fan of adventure or manga in general. I think most anybody will walk away feeling pleased with their purchase after reading the first volume or two."},{"Title":"Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 1","review":"It's great to have such a great series at the palm of you'r hands. It looks alot better on paper than it does on a computer or phone screen. I would highly recommend this series to any manga fan."},{"Title":"Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 1","review":"Hunters are greedy, honorable, highly skilled people who collect, steal, protect, and hunt down valuable animals and relics. The story is about a boy, Gon, whose father was a Hunter and he wants to be a Hunter too. The art work is kind of lame, the character design could be better, and the story itself is kind of slow. But the characters, their merits and flaws, are solid and the setting seems fantastic enough to be interesting. Kind of reminds me, slightly, of One Piece, but not as good."},{"Title":"Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 1","review":":3 Long title.The story is about Gon, a teenage boy who was told by his aunt (who he lives with) that his mother and father are both dead. However, after an encounter with a wild beast during Gon's childhood, he is rescued by a man named Kite, who reveals that Gon's father is the best \\"hunter\\" to have lived, and that he is definitely alive. (NOTE: In Hunter X Hunter, hunters are society's elite, with a liscence to go many places without a passport and do basically whatever they want.) After this, Gon decides he wants to become a hunter so he can meet his dad, and sets off to take the exam.Volume 1 contains part of the Hunter Exam Story arc. In this arc, Gon meets friends Leorio, Kurapika and Killua. Several tests are taken within the exam, which have all been passed by the heroes, so far.All in all, this volume's story seems to ultimately just go through the paces. Gon has exceptional senses and abilities, and is a radical dreamer. Leorio plays the part of the one who's just in it for the money (although it is hinted that he has other motives). Kurapika is the character that thinks everything through, and whose ultimate goal is revenge (against people who gouge out eyes). And Killua is the mysterious character.The tests are interesting enough, but the reader knows that the heroes will most-likely pass them all, which takes a good deal from the suspenseful aspect of manga.And Togashi's art has seemed to decline a bit. The character's designs are often inconsistent, and many panels lack the desired level of detail.My conclusion: 3/5. Hunter X Hunter: Volume 1 is a bit above average, and a fairly good manga. The art is a bit lacking, and the story is a bit uninspired, but the mysterious characters leave one wanting to keep reading, and remedy the lapses in quality.On a side note: Hunter X Hunter: Volume 1 is rated T+ (this stands for Teen +, or ages 16 and up). It contains some mild violence and some mild language, but no sexual content. I'd recommend it for anyone 13 or above, despite the rating it received from Viz."},{"Title":"Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 1","review":"Like many titles, I often check out the Anime first, only to find out that there's the Manga version. Well, when I checked out the Anime of Hunter x Hunter, I thoroughly found myself engaged in this adventure world from Gon acquiring his hunter license to entering the game that his father created in order to find the instructions that could lead him to the infamous, yet greatest hunter of them all -- his father! Anyway, volume one starts off with a nice pace and a kid named Gon has the natural ability to befriend animals, which becomes quite an asset later on when he enters the hunter exams. Basically, he wants to follow in his dad's footsteps and find his old man who happens to be a legend. On the way, Gon meets Leorio, Kurapika and Killua who all become his close friends and also take part in the hunter exams with him. Also on the same path to becoming a hunter is the sinister and maniacal killer magician known as Hisoka. One strength that I found in this courageous Manga is how well the puzzles were constructed in each level of the exams. It's a very addictive adventure that you'll be happy to get involved in. There's plenty of action and comedy too, so you won't be disappointed in that area. The main character could've looked a bit different though, because he honestly looks like Goku or Gohan from DBZ. Also, his attire looks a bit weird, but boy, can he swing that fishing rod or what? I wish I had skills like that. Leorio is another character that kind of looks out of place, but I guess he adds to the humour aspect of the Manga, although he can be annoying at times. If you like the early Dragon Ball with Goku wandering on adventurous journeys, you'll probably like how this starts off as well. The bottomline is that you'll find a lot of resemblances throughout, but that shouldn't stop you from giving this a go. It's easily one of the best adventure Mangas you'll ever find."},{"Title":"Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 1","review":"This is probably the best manga I've ever read! Gon the character, naive as he is, is a very good natured lad who goes on a search for his father who is a world famous Hunter. Together with the ex-assassin Killua, the surviving member of a lost tribe Kurapika and the aspiring doctor Leorio, each having their own agendas in mind, they compete in grueling test to gain a Hunter license and getting one up to acheiving their goals.The moment I finished volume 1 of this manga, I immediately went over to a friend of mine, who is Japanese, and asked him about it, and unsuprisingly he too is a huge fan, not only that he has also read the future volumes, in Japanese, and told me everything beyond volume 1, as much as he can remember, and I must say Yoshihiro Togashi-sensei is brilliant! Yu Yu Hakusho was great but this one is a work of art, magnifique!!To those who loved the Naruto and One piece series, you would definitely love this one, more than those two already great mangas. It might not be the next Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh, as Hunter is a different genre/type of manga which referring it to those two is a glib generalization, but, it sure is something nice and awesome to read while we wait for Harry Potter 7."},{"Title":"The Modern Contest: A Systemic Guide to the Pattern That Connects Individual Psychotherapy, Family Therapy, Group Work, Teaching, Organizational Life","review":"THE MODERN CONTEST is a master work that deserves a much wider audience than it has received since its publication ten years ago. The scope of the book and its opening claim, that it defines &quot;the common pattern that connects individual psychotherapy, family therapy, group work, teaching, organizational life and large scale social problems,&quot; is so vast that the volume was guaranteed a narrow readership probably from the moment it hit the presses. It is a tribute to W.W. Norton that Gustafson and Cooper's ideas, heady and raw-boned as they are, can be studied and savored over time. This is not a lightweight piece of theory-building, and the brilliance of the work only becomes clear after repeated visitation. One is reminded of Louis Armstrong's immortal statement about the definition of Jazz: &quot;Man, if you have to ask, then you just don't know.&quot; These two jazzmasters have gone quite beyond the riff and jive of the typical book on group and organizational life. They do not tell us what we want to hear; they tell us what we need to hear.Having seen these authors in action in both large and small group settings, I was chagrined to realize how little I understood about the true genius manifest in their twenty years of collaboration and dialogue. Their combined insight is impressive, daunting, demanding, and inspiring.Gustafson, the psychiatrist-physician, writes the odd numbered chapters. Cooper, the psychologist-professor, is author of the even-numbered chapters. That curious structural contrapuntality tells the reader from the beginning that the band is rocking and this is no slow-dance. We are jerked back and forth in an almost primitive rhythm as these mind-drummers explain to us that &quot;the modern contest decides winning and losing very fast,&quot; and that our post-modernist era is a battlefield beyond our simple-minded understanding of the way things appear to be.Throughout the book there are zen-like generalizations about the nature of group life. &quot;Loyalty is the best introduction,&quot; they suggest, and &quot;meeting crude challenges cheerfully is the least troublesome for our friends.&quot; What transforms this collection of globalizations into deeply valuable insight is the assortment of stories, illustrations, and self-reports offered by the authors. Their unabashed descriptions of failure, misery, suffering, and cruel hardship are painfully personal at certain moments. The most trivial rejection by peers or students illuminates a world of almost visionary proportion when seen properly through the lenses of interpretation and purpose.Who should read this book? I came to THE MODERN CONTEST as a longtime student and teacher of group process, psychotherapy, and personal growth. Anyone with those interests will be properly hammered by Gustafson, in particular, who has managed somehow to be an iconoclastic survivor in the maelstrom of academic life. One gets the sense that no matter how deep the confederacy of dunces surrounding him, he gets the joke and accepts the new navigational challenge. Like a character out of James Joyce, he seems to say, &quot;Oh? We have changed the rules? Very well, then, we have changed the rules!&quot;Try this on for size: &quot;Any territory will be invaded by three kinds of armies of contest: the armies of the oblivious who have something they are authorized to check; the armies of the desperate who must have their fortunes improved or else become lost; the armies of the overpowering who can clear the room. Each ought to get a different kind of counterproposal.&quot;And here is my own particular punchline: this book is very, very helpful in my daily work. I am not quite sure why. Certainly the value derives in part from the knife-edge humor that pervades the book. These guys are not laughing with us, they are laughing at us. What redeems them, I think, is that they are enthusiastic about letting us in on every gag, every secret, every nasty little truth about ourselves and our behavior. That is why the book can soar from a small group of medical students, behaving like primitive apes, to a vast territorial organization acting much the same way.I confidently predict that this book will be reprinted, if not revised in a second edition. I doubt that these two sailors will circumnavigate this particular world again, at least not together. They are like Wallace Stevens' man with the blue guitar, and they do not play things as they are. I can picture the two of them, warm tea dripping from their moustaches, already planning something quite beyond the modern contest. The post-modern contest, perhaps, or the punishment of splendid little insights.Whatever they call their next duet, I will be first in line in cyberspace to see if I can get my hands on their next commentary on our wobbling little planet and the Great Pattern which suggests that there is meaning in the cosmos."},{"Title":"The Modern Contest: A Systemic Guide to the Pattern That Connects Individual Psychotherapy, Family Therapy, Group Work, Teaching, Organizational Life","review":"The authors approach groups, both large and small, contexually.

Driscoll argues that it is women, not men, who dominate intimate relationships. Women might be flattered to be told they are the stronger sex, but they are less likely to accept that they hold the upper hand in relationships with men. At the heart of Driscoll's argument is the observation that women are much more comfortable with conflict than men. Driscoll says women are biologically better equipped to express anger, sustain anger comfortably, and recover their composure after an angry exchange. Men, Driscoll says, are far less at ease with the whole process of anger and conflict between the sexes. In the face of female anger, he says, men often collapse into themselves, making any mutually negotiated settlement of the conflict at hand almost impossible. Driscoll backs his argument with a host of fascinating biological and psychological evidence. Whatever a reader's initial political reaction might be to Driscoll's larger conclusions, he or she would be wise to set aside preconceived notions and consider the writer's subtle, detailed, and, I think, enormously helpful insights into the ways men and women interact in daily life. Whether or not you think women are winning the war between the sexes, this book is chock full of perceptions and advice that make the possibility of a lasting peace-for individual couples if not for society at large-much more likely."},{"Title":"Stronger Sex: Understanding and Resolving the Eternal Power Struggles Between Men and Women","review":"The funny thing is that this might have been a passable men&#65533;s rights book, if it were not for the insulting title and the author&#65533;s Orwellian games with language.That women use manipulative abilities and emotional ploys to counteract a physical strength advantage possessed by men in order to garner concessions from them is no secret, and this book adds to the understanding of the evolutionary perspective. That women, as a result, are less likely to withdraw from emotional confrontations with men than the other way around is also probably no real secret. It ties in with the first point, and again the author&#65533;s academic studies of the phenomenon add some understanding to it.This is all very well and good, but instead of merely arguing that the male view of the balance of power between the sexes should be taken into consideration, the author phrases this female ability in terms of genetic superiority.Feminazi junk science has been dehumanizing men for years by suggesting that longevity of females and vulnerability of males to certain birth defects is proof of female superiority or female &#65533;strength&#65533; (if longevity is an indicator of strength or superiority, is a tortoise who may live several hundreds of years therefore the highest form of life on earth?)Driscoll runs on a slightly different track which leads to the same destination, and one anecdote that he uses is that of observing a group of rhesus monkeys amidst limited food rations. The male monkeys are larger than the female monkeys and often more violent. Well then, aren&#65533;t the males stronger?Apparently, it depends on whether you are using the conventional definition of the word or a nouveau definition chosen for the purpose of flattering female readers.Because rather than the males as a group hogging the food for themselves, what happens is that the high status male rhesus monkeys elbow out the lower status males and share the food rations with the females in exchange for conjugal bliss. Yeah, it&#65533;s a pattern that is often repeated in human society, but what a strange example to support the proposition that females are &#65533;stronger&#65533;.Driscoll certainly doesn&#65533;t discuss the phenomenon from the standpoint of male altruism (or even the more values-neutral standpoint of male status-seeking) or female avarice, presumably because this would insult his female readers or his politically-correct peers at the academy. So he argues that women are &#65533;stronger&#65533; because one may insult men without fear of reprisal.Yet there are certainly male professionals who are adept at using emotional ploys, and one might as well argue that the con man who coaxes money from the one who earned it is &#65533;stronger&#65533; than his mark. On the other hand, perhaps Driscoll would like to strengthen his case, to his own satisfaction, by arguing that the thief who steals money is stronger than his victim and that the woman who uses the court system to extract resources from men (either as tribute for a failed marriage or as compensation for some supposed employment wrong) is actually displaying superhuman strength.Is it not more accurate to maintain, as Socrates might, judging from his Platonic dialogue with Ion, that the ability to coax or appropriate resources or concessions from others is a sort of &#65533;knack&#65533;?Driscoll ignores the fact that there are areas of the world where women aren&#65533;t able to use their emotional means to inveigle favors from men with quite the same aplomb that they do in the chivalric West. In such places, men are presumably immune to the power of female histrionics or they use their will to prevent those histrionics from coming into play. And it&#65533;s hard to imagine any academic alluding to those examples from other parts of the world as proof of male strength. When we hear of places like that, we always hear them described not in terms of male &#65533;strength&#65533; but in terms of male malfeasance.Specifically, what we hear is that &#65533;men oppress women&#65533;. But if the focus shifts from justice to ability, why isn&#65533;t the ability of men to impose their will on women, either by asserting their authority or their physical stature, proof that men are the stronger sex?It is a rule of thumb that male advantages over females are almost always expressed in terms of injustice or oppression and that female advantages over males are virtually always expressed in terms of inherent ability. And Driscoll, who is purported to have written a male-friendly book, compounds these rhetorical crimes. And Warren Farrell is well aware of such double-standards, having written critically about them in his own books. Shame on him for blessing this one!Women should open jars, move sofas, hit home runs into the San Francisco Bay and throw dead weight over their shoulders and climb down fire ladders with it with at least the same frequency that men do before being flattered with the appellation \\"stronger sex\\"."},{"Title":"Stronger Sex: Understanding and Resolving the Eternal Power Struggles Between Men and Women","review":"Although I can see the point of another reviewer concerning the word \\"stronger\\", perhaps the point to be focused on would be that women are typically portrayed in society as needing men's protection (hence implicitly weaker) and this book shows why that is driven by nature.I don't agree with all the remedies to problems that Driscoll presents, as there are alternatives such as using personal growth to move beyond the basic tool kit that nature provides us with.Nevertheless, I think every man should read this book, as well as the books by Warren Farrell. They would also do well to subscribe to the Everyman magazine, which discusses men's concerns."},{"Title":"Stronger Sex: Understanding and Resolving the Eternal Power Struggles Between Men and Women","review":"&quot;Balanced and insightful...

In those two roles he is quite credible as an author of a book on forgiveness.I was disappointed in this book. That is not to say that I did not find much helpful information in it. But to me the book seemed to wander aimlessly toward forgiveness. While focusing on the \\"journey\\" may indeed be part of the process toward forgiveness, I thought that the book should have been more direct. I also thought it repeated itself a lot. Wading through such repetition made reading the book less appealing that it might have been.I thought the book made a lot of vague points that were hard to grasp in a \\"real world\\" experience. When I reached the end of the book I concluded it was more about reconciliation than forgiveness. Though reconciliation is clearly a goal of forgiveness, it is not the only outcome, or even the most frequent outcome.Augsburger does seem to grasp this concept at certain points. For example, he said \\"So few sins can be paid for, and so seldom does the victim posses the power or the advantage to demand payment\\" (page 18). Realizing that you cannot demand reconciliation or restitution but must forgive without them is a key concept to grab hold of. The concepts of reconciliation and forgiveness are related but are not emotional equivalents. While it is clear that Augsburger understands at some level that reconciliation is distinct from forgiveness, he spends a great part of the book trying to help the victim find that very reconciliation that he had already said might be impossible. It seems as if he talks himself out of a foundational idea that he began the book with.Augsburger had several great quotes that would be helpful to share with those struggling with forgiveness. Two of them are found on page 18, \\"Revenge is not its own reward; it is its own punishment\\" and \\"Resentment takes the soul hostage.\\" Both of those statements clearly and concisely present truth about certain aspects of the forgiveness process that I found very helpful.Augsburger clearly understands that forgiveness is a process. This understanding is displayed in numerous sections of the book. He says that forgiveness often \\"happens in small but increasing increments, step by step, until the journey of restoring love, recognizing repentance, reclaiming relationship, and reopening the future has been completed\\" (page 41). He goes on to state that \\"Forgiveness is not an act--it is a process\\" (page 48). He further develops the idea of forgiveness as a process when he says \\"Process is as important as content in resolving inner as well as interpersonal conflicts\\" (page 81).I also liked his statement that \\"Forgiveness is not a gift one claims, internalizes, and then possesses for life. It must be rediscovered in each situation of pain\\" (page 48). I appreciated Augsburger's continued discussion of this concept throughout the book.But it is conclusions such as \\"real forgiveness comes with the recovery of a relationship, even when the rupture is repeated again and again\\" (page 42) that I struggle with. I just don't agree because this defines forgiveness as the recovery of the relationship. I think that too often this is just impossible. If we make it part of the definition of forgiveness, then we will prevent many from ever completing the journey toward forgiveness. Too many people I have dealt with over the years have been hurt so deeply by someone that a relationship is not only unlikely, but simply unsafe. I am thinking primarily of those who have been abused in some way by someone they trusted. For me to tell them that they can only learn to forgive if they reestablish a relationship with that person is to do a great disservice to them in my opinion.For people who have been so deeply hurt by others, it is not reconciliation that they need to work on, but anger issues. Augsburger did have one chapter on this subject. The chapter was helpful. He said \\"disciplined anger focuses its demands on what is just and on what is good\\" (page 63). The world needs to see some good examples of disciplined anger instead of uncontrolled rage. He also said \\"Use anger. Do not let it use you\\" (page 64). Furthermore, he said \\"Getting mad may be necessary sometimes, but remaining mad never is!\\" (page 68). It reminds me of what the Bible says in Ephesians 4:26 \\"Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\\"Overall I thought this was a helpful book with many good concepts. However, because of its endless repetitions and conceptual wanderings, it is unlikely that I would recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"The New Freedom of Forgiveness","review":"because there is so much poor teaching and misunderstanding about forgiveness.

Recently I have been wanting to hear more from other Asian Americans and so, resumed reading the excerpts authors shared. I read Ms. Minatoya's story and was disappointed that there wasn't more! So the next day I went and bought Talking to High Monks in the Snow. And I have just finished reading it. It's one of those books that I come across infrequently, the kind that I absolutely MUST get to the last page before I go to sleep. Because of school I longed for the moments when I could sit and enjoy my newfound treasure, on trains, breaks, at home. Ms. Minatoya is subtle in her writing but it sure hits you when you're through with the sentence. I felt the pangs of pain and embarassment and degradation when she did. It brought back sad memories. The great thing though is that she isn't sappy and she doesn't want my pity just because I relate to her. Ms. Minatoya is eloquently matter-of-fact. With each section of her book, I was amazed more and more. I wished I went to all the places she has been to, Boston, Japan, China, Nepal, and done the things she has. Actually, I admire her because she was and probably still is BOLD and DETERMINED. She has gone to all these countries and actually lived and worked there, not just visit as a tourist. She has taught and communicated deeply with people in these countries. Thanks to Ms. Minatoya, I have this urge to start a club at my college. A reading and discussional group for Asian Americans and non-Asians. I feel that many in my school and city do not appreciate our rich heritage as much as I wish they did. A club that will teach and show through discussions, reading, and debate, the sincere, talented, proud people such as Ms. Minatoya. Talking to High Monks in the Snow is a truly wonderful book for Asians and non-Asians alike.

The first volume had all of his piano instrumentals, (plus 3 additional rags in the Complete works) save Frolic of the Bears from Treemonisha. It is now hard to find, and people have to scavange a bit to get a copy.So now we have the next best thing - sort of. I wanted to give this book a better rating because of my admiration of the composer, much less my knowledge of his works through recording them all over the past few years for CD release. It is intended to balance out the alternate Dover title Complete Piano Rags. But in that regard there are still omissions. This book contains Joplin's Marches and Waltzes, as well as his single tango that the book is titled for and one collaborative rag (Lily Queen).While these pieces are not quite piano rags or even ragtime (except Lily Queen, and arguable for Solace and Bethena) they do represent a balance for a disciplined composer who was serious not only about his work, but about making the ordinary into something much more.But I have a question that I am not alone in asking. Between these two volumes, what about the missing pieces? We have to find another source for them now? These include Cleopha (A March), and The Chrysanthemum (of which many of us have had spirited discussions with editor Dave Jasen as to its rag vs.intermezzo status). Two pieces are hardly enough to create another volume, yet the Chrysanthemum in particular is so rich and enjoyable to play and listen to that this omission is frustrating indeed.This consideration aside, if you don't have the NYPL edition, Solace is still worth having as a compliment to Complete Rags. And you can always come to my ragtime site to listen to the missing pieces if you want."},{"Title":"Imagine a Woman in Love with Herself: Embracing Your Wisdom and Wholeness","review":"I am enjoying this book, although I am reading it at a slow pace.

There is such a thing as self-assessment that is accepting, positive, and life-affirming, without necessarily approving of everything that we accept about ourselves.In the end, by overlooking the necessary distinction between \\"acceptance\\" and \\"approval,\\" the book limits the possibilities for growth that it can nurture.

Women learn to love and appreciate themselves even with warts and blemishes. They learn self-healing, of shallow wounds, deep wounds of the heart, emotional wounds and most importantly, self-acceptance. Women who have gone though battles need more self-love and appreciation for the sccars they carry. Self-inflicted doubt, criticism, fear and comparison have wounded women; &quot;Embracing your wisdom and wholeness&quot; are words women should be hearing. Women need to see beyond her outward appearance and be encouraged to look inward to the real beauty beneath her skin. Women are wounded by society's standard of womanhood, the &quot;who&quot; &quot;what&quot; and &quot;how&quot; women should look, act and express themselves. The twenty stanzas of the poem are aimed at each need, each scar, and each offers, a reassuring of a woman's self worth. All women should read this book, especially women who have gone from child to adult because of incest, abuse or rape, all women who have been scared from disease or injuries. Emotional scars of neglect, reminders of past mistakes, all will be turned into positive bandages of healing by reading the poem over and over again, by using it's advice and suggestions on forgiving, toughing and healing your own body. Patricia Lynn Reilly appreciates the wonder and beauty of all women. She helps us to see, as we should, the whole woman, her body, her mind and her soul, the character of a woman. &quot;Imagine a woman in love with her ouwn body.

IF YOU ARE NEW TO SCIENCE FICTION OR JUST LIKE A GOOD STORY WITH GOOD PLOT GIVE THE DEFENDERS A TRY"},{"Title":"The Defenders","review":"Nothing wrong with the story, but if you react to writing that is extremely clumsy (George Lucas quality) this is a very painful read. It is adverb-heavy, full of turgid explication, plenty of \\"flashing eyes\\", \\"warm chuckles\\", and lip biting as well. On the other hand, if you like the formula, it is a fun read; nothing wrong with WW II, as a template."},{"Title":"The Defenders","review":"#5 in a series of 7, reputedly going to be 8 any year now, the book is somewhat predictable but still very enjoyable.

I thought I had something after reading the first one. Not so. Brim was a great character to start with but goes down hill after book 1 I guess Baldwin turns him into what Baldwin secretly wants too be, a Lothario who gets all the beautiful, big breasted women including wives plus the action becomes very predictable and unvaried. Brim flies, fights, takes a lot of damage, kills a lot of bad guys and a lot of his crews.Very uneven, poor continuity, terrible morals. I will not be buying the new book coming out this year."},{"Title":"The Defenders","review":"Baldwin takes the battle of Britain and rehashes it in space with &quot;Starfuries&quot; replacing Spitfires. The empire replaces the British empire, etc. etc.The thing that made me throw the book down in disgust was when &quot;emperor&quot; plagiarizes the famous Churchill speech. Enough Already!And although I really liked the others in the series before this, I'll never buy another Bill Baldwin book again."},{"Title":"Hip-Hop vs MAAT : A Psycho/Social Analysis of Values","review":"At the time this book came out, Hip-Hop was much more diverse than it was today.

This book is good for those who are learning about hip-hop culture"},{"Title":"Hip-Hop vs MAAT : A Psycho/Social Analysis of Values","review":"This book is good for realting to the issues that our young people face today.

Bruce Brown does an excellent job of hitting on the issues of what coaches need to think about, but so often get missed in the whole scheme of things. Coaching is so much more than just knowing the particular x's and o's, and reading this book helps the present or future coach realize that. I would recommend Teaching Character Through Sport to any coach of any sport!!"},{"Title":"Teaching Character Through Sport: Developing a Positive Coaching Legacy","review":"You've read, digested and implemented Jim Thompson's Positive Coaching materials. Now take a Graduate Course.Bruce Brown's book is filled with wonderful ideas on how to create a sports culture where individuals and teams maximize the personal growth that is possible through athletics.Personal favorites include sections on the qualities of \\"Great Athletes\\" - successfully introduced to players as young as 11 (and, more importantly their parents) - about the choices that athleted make. Similarly \\"Great Teams\\" explores the qualities found in the most successful teams. \\"Positive Conditioning\\" is an eye-opener (imaging what happens when the winning team in a game at practice does 20 extra push-ups) as well as great team-building exercises such as \\"Spotlighting\\". The section on how parents can be helpful participants in the process is also worthwhile.Run, don't walk (can you do that on-line?) to get this book."},{"Title":"Teaching Character Through Sport: Developing a Positive Coaching Legacy","review":"Easily worth the money, this book is amazing. It poses great questions to coaches about why they coach and what they hope to accomplish, methods to teach character traits, and a wonderful section on using conditioning positively, to name a few sections. The book is geared primarily towards junior high or high school programs, and really has some great ideas for a sports program."},{"Title":"Historicism (The New Critical Idiom)","review":"Hamilton's book advertizes itself as an accomplishment in finally clarifying for us the confusing and controversial notion of &quot;historicism.&quot; It provides a good survey of the key figures and philosophical commitments in the history of historicism and attempts to deal with the stakes involved in contemporary investments of the concept. But Hamilton's text turns out to be, at best, a kind of apologia and, at worst, a &quot;how-to.&quot; Consequently, his assessment--and understanding, I'm affraid--of historicism is delivered from the position of a believer and advocate. This contributes to the reproduction of a lot of conventional mantras about historicism, such as, for example, that it somehow represented--and still does--an &quot;anti-modernist&quot; position. We are still modernist, in a sense, and this is why, as this book demonstrates, it is difficult to think outside the framework of historicism. A provocative book, but not deserving of its authoritative title."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I though that the book, pretties, was exellent!! it was very well written and interesting. it really got me thinking about what if the world was reall like that. I randomly picked up the first book, Uglies, and was immediatly hooked. i now can't wait till the 3 rd book is released. It is a mix of science fiction and fantasy. I was wondering through it all what would it be like if this was how the world was really run?!? It would be really amazing and really different. I reccommend these books to anyone that likes to read good and very interesting pieces of work."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I thought Pretties was a great book , but not as good as Uglies.

The way that Scott describes everything with such clarity that you can imagine yourself there is fantastic. The first time I read this I couldn't believe how good it was! It even surpassed the greatness of Uglies which is hard to do. I just read it again upon getting the final book in the trilogy, Specials- definitely worth picking up, and was once again stunned by how much i loved it. I would strongly reccommend this book to everyone-- trust me, you will NOT be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Uglies and Pretties are the best books I've ever read and coming from me thats alot of books. I love the whole plot of both of them. The sequel did not disapoint me at all. It made me even more expecting of the last one. Its as if in each book shes a new person and every time she has to find the real her. I absolutly love them. I highly recomend these books. There just the best!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I have to say, I'd choose being ugly but with personality over being pretty and shallow any day, after reading this sequel. While Pretties carried on where Uglies left off, the protagonist, Tally, seemed like a completely different person. The plot was decent, and I have to say I loved the ending, but I missed the old spark the first book seemed to have. I also missed seeing Tally so close to David, and I was disappointed by the character of Zane. While I still plan to read Specials, the last book in the trilogy, I was nowhere near satisfyed with the continuation of such a promising story."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I have to admit that I didn't care for Pretties quite as much as I liked Uglies. This is often the case for me with the second book of a trilogy (I didn't like Eldest (Inheritance, Book 2) nearly as much as I liked Eragon, either, though I liked Inkspell better than I liked Inkheart).Pretties picks up a month or so after Uglies leaves off (stop reading here if you haven't read Uglies yet), with Tally living in New Prettytown, after having had the operation that makes her Pretty. She has only limited, patchy memories of her time living in the Smoke with David and the others. She hangs around with her new clique, the Crims, drinking and partying and anguishing over what to wear.Fortunately, a couple of incidents occur to spark Tally's memory, and make her realize that her brain, and her memories, have been tampered with. She hooks up with Zane, the leader of the Crims, and together they embark on a quest to make themselves \\"bubbly\\" (meaning able to think), and to escape the city. Tally's partnership with Zane, however, is a threat to her friendship with her old friend Shay, and causes problems. It becomes clear fairly quickly that Tally's relationship with Zane will also cause problems between she and David if they meet up again.I think that the reason that I didn't care for this book so much was that I didn't like Pretty Tally, with her surgically implanted shallowness. And although I liked Zane, I was always pulling for Tally to find her way back to David.I still found the book compelling, however. I read it in a single day (a plane ride helped), and I look forward to the May release of Specials. I want to see if Tally ever gets her pre-operation personality back. I want to see if she succumbs to the Specials, or defeats them. I want to see if Shay is redeemable. So, Pretties did accomplish what a second trilogy book needs to accomplish - it set things up for me to want to read the third book. If you liked Uglies, you should definitely read Pretties.This review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on April 3, 2006."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"oh my gosh!

At first reading the reveiws for the Pretties, I decided not to get it. It seemed like it would be a total letdown, and then I would not think so much of the Trilogy.I ordered the Pretties two days ago, and it arrived the day after I ordered it. I was up until 1am reading it, and the book was truly amazing. The Specials I ordered yesterday, when halfway through the Pretties, and it should be arriving in just a few hours! I cannot wait to read it. I am sure that is not going to be a letdown, especially if the pretties was not. This book is definantly worth the buy!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Tally Youngblood has been made pretty. Croy, and old friend from the Smoke, finds her at a party and tells her that he needs to give her something. He gives her a room number to find it in, \\"Valentino 317\\". After this encounter, Tally can't help but feel that she's forgetting something. However, finding out what she's forgetting doesn't make anything easier. Suddenly her and her boyfriend, Zane, are fighting to stay bubbly (the opposite of pretty-minded) and to stay alive because they have just gotten themselves into a very dangerous position.Pretties is an absolutely fabulous sequel to Uglies. It continues to explore what happens when society goes too far and has too much control. Also, the idea of wanting to belong is mentioned several times. Tally has always wanted to fit in with some kind of group and likes the idea of security. In Uglies, she wanted to fit in with the Smokies, and now in Pretties, she wants to fit in with the Crims, a clique in New Pretty Town. The idea of beauty being within is carried over from Uglies, though mentioned much less. Overall, Pretties portrayed many important themes and was a very captivating novel."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Well, you guessed it, that girl on the cover is Tally, who has finally become pretty. However, although Tally is having the time of her life, drinking the night away and going to tons of parties, which include the occasional hangover, the reality of her life suddenly hits her smack in the face. Her enemies from her previous life show up unexpectedly, along with something that will change her life forever. However, Tally picks up some crucial information that the authorities will kill her for if they ever find out. Tally must help her friends and cover up the evidence before it's too late. Or else, the answer is simple: game over. I personally loved this book, and if you like sci-fi like me, you'll be thrilled to hear the story of Tally and the others go on. This is a book that I think has surpassed many futuristic books of its time."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I remember when I was first considering buying the book Uglies by Scott Westerfeld, I was disinclined to purchase it. I thought the title was stupid and the book would get preachy, with a warmed-over, tweaked, brave-new-world feel. I bought it because I couldn't find anything better that I hadn't read. I was pleasantly surprised. While I found his characters shallow at first, the book sucked me in until I couldn't put it down.Then the long wait for Pretties began. I checked Amazon regularly and ran out to buy it as soon as it hit the shelves, and I read the whole thing the night I bought it. It's not quite as exciting as Uglies, because all the really big revelations have already been unveiled. I liked the characters a lot better this time around. Their dialogue felt a lot more believable. There are some pretty thrilling close-shaves and a few plans that don't go perfectly, which is refreshing and real.Westerfeld uses this book to explore the other side of his characters' world a bit, not as much why they rebel, but a lot of why the powers that be made the world that way in the first place. I find the Pretties' lifestyle a lot more boring than the Smokies', but I now see that Westerfeld's characters in the first book were so shallow because they had to be. In the world they lived in, there was nothing to encourage depth. Westerfeld has turned out to be a much better writer than I originally thought.I'm bursting to say more but I don't want to ruin it for people still reading. Just know that this book provided an incredible setup for the last book, Specials.I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good sci-fi story, or a story where kids actually accomplish things."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Last time we left Tally, she was demanding the pretty operation so she could test the pills that theoretically remove the lesions from your brain. The Specials were only too happy to comply, and now Tally's a pretty, the world nothing but a drunken haze, a source of entertainment. Possibly worse is the fact that she has only the dimmest memories of David, Special Circumstances, or why she's a pretty at all. And if you ask anybody at New Pretty Town, Tally \\"rescued\\" Shay from The Smoke. Of course, none of this bothers Tally. She's having the time of her life being beautiful, perpetually happy, and one of the Crims, her new clique. Especially when Zane, Tally's new crush, is the leader of the Crims. After a few months of this, though, the fun stops. An old Smokie friend, Croy shows up at a party, giving Tally instructions to get to, \\"something important\\". Even though she has no clue what's going on, Tally follows Croy's directions, because, after all,\\"everything was always ultra safe in New Pretty Town. Otherwise pretties would be killing themselves left and right.\\" Zane, who seems to have taken an interest in Tally, comes too. The important thing turns out to be a letter Tally wrote to herself back in her ugly days, and two lesion-killing pills. Tally's afraid of the possible psychological effects the pills might have, so she and Zane split, each having one. And for a while(alas, in the life of Tally Youngblood, happiness can never last longer than a while)everything is great. Life is no longer a blur, and Zane's physical abilities are greatly enhanced. That is, until he starts having headaches, crippling migraines that put him out for hours, racking him with unbearable pain. Shay's memories of what really happened at the Smoke are resurfacing, and she's cutting herself so she can be as clear as Tally. The Smokies might be able to help them out,but Tally can't seem to contact them. With no options left, the Crims, minus Shay, will have to find them themselves. Pretties is fast-paced and exciting, making for a worthy sequel to Uglies. I would recommend it to everybody. Even more appealingly, the book tells you more about the Downfall of the Rusties. I guarantee you will love this book, especially the real reason for Zane's headaches(not for the faint of heart) and the wonderful, fantastic, thought-provoking cliffhanger ending."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Pretties picks up where Uglies left off. Tally has been turned pretty and dull-witted. Tally loves the pretty life of partying, drinking, and doing whatever she wants. She has a lot of fun with it, until one day at a costume party, she sees someone in a specials costume, and she starts feeling like something's not right with her world. Together with Zane, another pretty, Tally must track down the clue to her past as an ugly. When she does though, the repercussions of her choices afterward will continue long into the book. As Tally remembers the truth, she tries to figure out a way to help the other pretties and to save herself and Zane as well.Pretties was a little slow to start out, but turned out decent. It would have been good, had it not been for \\"bubbly.\\" One word, repeated practically every page for the first two-thirds of the book, that drove me batty. You see, bubbly was slang for any number of meanings including, but not limited to: impressive, exhilarating, fashionable, cool, cute, interesting, smart, happy, buzzed, weird, daring, exciting, alert, rational, nervous, calm, thrilling, shocking, good, intelligent, trustworthy, rewarding, conscious, intense, riled up, cognizant, and aware. It was such a pain trying to figure out what bubbly meant in each situation, and it distracted from the story and grated on my nerves. Other than that, the story was good."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Pretties is a pageturner. I stayed up late and woke up early to finish it, and immediately went to see if the third book in the trilogy, Specials, is available yet. (Sadly, no.)Though it may not be quite as original as Uglies, this book does a better job of presenting moral ambiguities. Everything is not quite black-and-white good versus evil. The city that has become a prison, for example, was created for a pretty valid reason. The wardens are genuinely kind. Characters switch from ally to enemy and back again.Start with the first book, Uglies, then read this one. The plot twists keep coming right until the very end, and the characters are dynamic. A swift, exciting read."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Tally's story continues from the previous book, UGLIES, in this second installment of Scott Westerfeld's futuristic trilogy. Tally is now a pretty who lives only for good times. While attending a party at which she is to be voted into the Crims clique, she is followed by someone appearing to be a member of the ominous Special Circumstances team.Tally can only remember her previous adventures as an ugly outside New Pretty Town in brief disconnected snatches. She is shocked to discover that the person stalking her is Croy, an old friend from the Smoke. He has something for her, he tells her, but she must search for it later in a certain secret spot. She agrees, bemused by his repellant ugliness, including his big pores and tangled hair --- all the imperfections that the surgery to become a pretty transforms to beauty.Tally returns to her pretty life, concentrating on the fun she has with her friends. Her peace is disrupted when gorgeous Zane, leader of the Crims, asks her about David, whom she loved when she lived in the Smoke. In fact, Zane once knew Croy and had been determined to escape to the Smoke before his surgery. He regrets that he didn't go into the wilderness then.Zane is eager to accompany Tally in finding the mysterious object Croy has hidden for her. They must face strenuous, dangerous physical challenges in order to locate the gift, which is accompanied by a startling and eye-opening letter from Tally to herself, written before she underwent the pretty surgery and explaining to her future self her motive in becoming a pretty --- to save all the pretties. Zane and Tally also learn that the pretties' brains are altered during their surgery. When the two share what Croy left for Tally, everything in their lives changes, putting Zane's health at risk and infuriating Tally's friend Shay.As with UGLIES, you cannot read this book without questioning values and mindsets prevalent not only in New Pretty Town in the future but also here and now. How much will people surrender in order to be pretty? What is the price of popularity and conformity? Can people who relinquish everything get a second chance? As in UGLIES, the plot pace is rapid and exciting, the characters are real, and the situations are truly frightening.How good is this book? I read it in a day, unable to concentrate on anything else until I finished it. After the tantalizing ending, I'm filled with delicious anticipation for the third book in the series, SPECIALS. Bring it on!--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon [...]"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"\\"Halfway down, it occurred to Tally that the bungee jacket might not catch them both,\\" states the narrator as the main character, Tally, and one of her friends, Perris, \\"fell\\" off an enormous building during a party. Tally has awesome clothes, she is completely popular, and everyday it's basically just nonstop parties. But, only after a month of being a pretty, Tally's life will change forever. While at a costume party, Tally realized that someone she didn't recognize was following her. After a while of worrying about who it might be, she decided to find out. She follows the stranger onto the emergency fire stairs. Tally was shocked. It was an Ugly. But, somehow, she knew who it was. It didn't make any sense to her at the time, but it would soon. Before he disappears, he tells her that he will leave something very important for her in Valentino 317, and that she cannot forget about it. Little did she know that what the ugly had left would send her on the adventure of her life.Pretties is the second book in the trilogy. It is about a girl, Tally, and her boyfriend, Zane, finding a cure for what the doctors did to the Pretties during the operation that everyone got to become a pretty. This is a great book and I would defiantly recommend it to anyone who likes fiction and adventure. It takes place in the future, where everyone gets a new body when they become sixteen. They are the Pretties. If you choose not to change, you are an ugly. Uglies and Pretties are forced apart, living in two different places, pretties in new-pretty town, and Uglies in smoke, or somewhere else in the wild. I think this is a good book for boys and girls eleven and older. I've never read a book like this! It is funny and sad and there is more suspense in one chapter then there is in my life! This is a great book and I hope you like it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"The second installment of Westerfeld's \\"Uglies\\" series, _Pretties_ is a continually darker fall into madness for his heroine, Tally. In her continuing quest to liberate herself from her personal feelings of guilt over the unintended betrayal of the city runaway's collectively known as the New Smoke, she has given herself up to the authorities of the city and accepted their required beautifying, and mentally damaging, surgery. Awakened from stupefied vanity by strong stress, she begins to wind her way to recovery, along with another young man impacting her life away from David, her interest in the first installment of the series. Wending through a fast paced story Tally is drawn ever deeper into a chaotic maelstrom of betrayal, fear, hope, despair, vengeance, and manipulation. Westerfeld's cliffhanger ending in _Pretties_ is also darker, and more hair-raising than that found in _Uglies_. I will not spoil the end of the book for you by describing this in detail.As in _Uglies_, the most impressive aspect of this book and the series in full is the fact that the science fiction story evenly and beautifully coats a sharply pointed, tearing social commentary. Westerfeld is very direct in this commentary throughout the tale, offering, through an extremely engaging and wonderfully active plot line, his thoughts on the reasons for cutting, externally destructive actions, and aggressive social tendencies. His exploration of the seemingly converse relationship between the protective measures taken by social authorities and the increase in destructive behaviors among privileged young adults, culminating in the absolute destruction of a flying ice rink, is fascinating. The danger of police state tactics taking over from more humane, and more human, authority figures (as shown in the difference between the Specials and the Wardens) is dealt with in relation to this \\"imposed safety must be combated\\" mentality.This is an excellently crafted science fiction series, in the best tradition of the genre. Westerfeld's world and characterization strikes close to home and thereby becomes believable. I highly recommend this series on the basis of the first two novels and look forward eagerly to reading the third book, _Specials_."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This book picks up where Uglies left off - Tally and Shay were caught and made into pretties. While going to all kinds of exciting parties and living an outlandishly fun lifestyle, there are still some memories and nagging doubts in Tally's and Shay's minds about their past experiences with The Smoke.They hook up with a Pretty clique called The Crims, who are focused (as much as any pretty can be focused!) on becoming \\"bubbly\\", or clear-thinking, and do all kinds of stunts for the adrenaline rush that makes them able to think clearly for a few minutes or more at a time.Tally becomes involved with Zane, the leader of the Crims and the one most obsessed with becoming clear-headed, and when the couple remaining Smokies bring Tally a note from her past Ugly self, and some pills, she and Zane each take one right before getting caught by the city's wardens...This sequel to Uglies is a bit less action-packed than the first, but has more things to ponder, as we learn more about how their world and community works, the motivations behind the workings of the community, and the ways in which Tally, Zane, Shay, and the rest learn to take power back from the government and learn to think independently, even with the brain changes that are inflicted on pretties.I was fascinated by the book and it was well worth reading.

When Shay finds this out, she is as mad as a wet hen. Shay finds a \\"cure\\" for herself, cutting her wrists, and she is going to let no one stop her from \\"curing\\" herself. It is up to Zane and Tally to find a cure for Shay when Shay is determined to do it on her own. Will Tally and Zane help Shay, or will Shay end up doing something she'll regret for the rest of her life?I recommend this puzzling, non fiction book to teenage girls, ages 12-16, who are interested in learning about a sort of new world. The sequel to Uglies, it brings some major competition to other non fiction books out there. It is filled with mystery, humor, pain, and sorrow. Scott Westerfeld has done a fantastic job of writing this fascinating novel."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I just finished \\"Pretties\\" - i think its alot better than ' uglies'. it has more twists and a lot more of a plot.

Here I was excitedly reading all of Scott Westerfeld's stuff and believing that maybe he might be an exception.But no.Uglies was an interesting book that left great possiblities for an exciting thought provoking sequel. But pretties is a book with alot of action and no meaning behind it. It gets boring after a while. Can't anything go right with these characters? What ruined this book for me was that I stopped caring. After one annoying dissapointment and sqaushed goal after another I stopped caring about the charcters.The dialogue was SO VERY ANNOYING. \\"Oh, I'm bubbly today. That's bubbly. I feel bubbly. Totally bubbly!\\" Ok I get the point! Please stop torturing me with this stupidity.Yeah, I over estimated this series. I have to say that it is nothing special.

Perfectly wrong that is. Pretties by Scott Westefeld, tells a story about Tally and her friends and how their world gets turned upside-down. In this science-fiction novel based in the future, Tally faces her future in more ways than one, even if she doesn't want to.Pretties was interesting to read but also quite boring. I think this is because I often felt they overused the word \\"bubbly\\". For example on page 8 they use \\"bubbly\\" to describe something as simple as make-up. Also, it was boring because it resembled the first book in many ways. One of the ways was that Tally experienced the same problems as in the first book, but with subtle differences. This also resulted in a similar ending. I would recommend this book to anyone in the grades 7th to 9th and to people who enjoy science-fiction books. This is because the theme, everything you do has a consequence, may be hard to comprehend at a younger age. I also recommend reading the first book before reading this book because it will be confusing if you haven't. Perfection is hard to achieve and Pretties proves it."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Pretties by Scott Westerfeld, is a captivating sequel in the Uglies Trilogy that will entice young readers for generations to come. I believe that Pretties deserves four out of five stars becasue the book is filled with issues that many teens face today. With all of these teen issues comes a lot of drama that makes the book impossible to put down. Pretties is the story of Tally Youngblood and her fight to live life the way she wants. As the story unfolds Tally and Shay discover how sickening their society is and venture out to change it. Even though the book was great, I think it should relate to many more generations. This book truly helps youngs teens view the world they live in and think of how they affect it."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Well, I am a book worm, but this book was great! In my class, we read the first book, Uglies, and i was intriuged by its storyline, so i decided to use my christmas money for this book, and the next book in the trilogy, Specials. It turns out it was great. For those of you who want a little synopsis, here it is. (I must warn you, this may contain spoilers for you people out there)! After Tally Youngblood volunteers to become a pretty to test a potential cure, she is living the LIFE!!! She joins her friend Peris after waiting quite a bit. She joins a clique called the Crims in order to stay \\"bubbly\\". Afterwards, her past comes to haunt her, and one of her friends from smoke gives her the potential cure. She and the leader of the Crims decide to split the two pills after they are caught in a serious situation."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"The sequel to Uglies is just as good. Missing is the great hippy commune out in the woods, which has been replaced--in questionable taste--by a found group of \\"primitive\\" mankind. Still, I enjoyed reading this book and getting back into his post-apocalyptic world of pretty-making. The language is slightly different; or, I should say, the vocabulary is different because even though the book is not in first person it mimics the new \\"pretty\\" way of talking. Once you get over that it's well-crafted. These books were recommended to me by my mother-in-law, and I hear they are very popular with both gals and guys. I can see why; there is much to grab on to in this series, and it's an accessible and interesting read."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This was an interesting sequel to the first book \\"Uglies\\".The story begins with Tally in her room worrying over what to wear. As you find out something has happened to these teens to make them stupid to keep them quiet. Tally has been made pretty because of what she knows and now the members of the Smoke are trying to get her back.The only problem I had with this book was everything lingered on her being stupid and \\"bubbly\\". There was so much more to the story than her being stupid and I think the author needed to cut the stupidness and get on with it.I liked the book a lot but he didn't need to put so much teenage, stupid stuff in there."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Pretties is the second installment in Scott Westerfield's Uglies trilogy. In this volume, we get to see life through Tally's eyes as a Pretty- her old dream has finally come true. Aside from the characters we are already familiar with, this novel introduces an elite group known as the Crims, pretties who in their previous days as uglies were the tricksters who pulled the most elaborate stunts. Naturally, Tally would definitely qualify- especially since she was previously a Smokie. The leader of the Crims, Zane, even develops a special interest in Tally, and together they develop a friendship that may turn into something more. After an encounter with a mysterious stranger at a costume party who is later revealed to be someone from the Smoke, Tally is given a message that she and Zane attempt to decode. Eventually this message leads to a secret room where the pair find the two pills Tally must take to get rid of her pretty-mindedness forever- before Special Circumstances arrive... Quickly, things start to go downhill for Tally, involving a: split-decision, unique offer, dangerous cult, trip to the hospital, cruel experiment and a significant choice.All in all, the Pretties is a book you don't want to miss! I had a few complaints that all contain spoilers, so I won't mention those, but I really think the trilogy is moving in a good direction. I personally believe that Pretties was more exciting and fast-paced then Uglies, and I'm sure most will admit it is definitely harder to put down. Tally's difficult decisions and genuine personality makes her truly unforgettable and easy to relate to. I cannot wait to read Specials!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This review is especially for any parents checking up on books for their young adolescents. I checked online reviews before buying \\"Uglies\\" when my 6th grader last year said her English teacher recommended it. I was reacting to the name. My daughter and I both read Uglies and Pretties, when she was in 6th grade, and she read Specials and now wants Extras. I especially recommend this for parents and young teens to read together for a number of reasons:1. It's very entertaining!2. Fast reading for adults in particular - looks long, but I read it in 3-4 hours when I woke up in the middle of the night once.3. Nothing negative or too adult for young teens or pre-teens.4. Raises some great ideas for discussion that are both simple and complicated in their power (a way to solve lots of society's problems that takes away personal liberties, etc). Not difficult reading or thinking, but still gets across in an entertaining way these complicated issues of all utopias.5. Ages 10-16, but once I started reading, I couldn't stop reading because it was moving along with so much excitement. It would make a great movie.6. If you or your child liked The Giver, you'd like this even better. This fleshes out the story quite a bit more and moves very quickly through drama."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"What a perfect sequal to the first book The Uglies.

Speculating what we think would happen all along the way. This is a wonderful read that will keep you guessing and perfect for those who are fantasy lovers.

Until meeting up with one of the Uglies from The New Smoke, Tally had forgotten that she had volunteered to submit to the operation so she could test the pills developed to cure the lesions. She and a fellow Crim, the Pretty Clique Tally joined after her operation, each take a pill, which allows them to stay focused for longer periods of time. But her friend has a bad reaction to the pill and Tally must find away to escape New Pretty Town and meet up with the only doctors who can help him - those hiding in The New Smoke.This is book two of a trilogy. While a totally riveting story, it is not one that stands on its own. I strongly recommend reading these books in order. Westerfield has created likable, but fallible characters involved in a complex and compelling plot. Upon finishing Pretties, readers will want to rush out and pick up the final book in the series: Specials."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Darn tecnology won't let me give this book six stars!

It was always so interesting, there is no way Westerfeld can top this!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Upon finishing the Uglies I knew I must have the second book in the Uglies trilogy. After reading the Uglies I thought there couldn't possibly be any way that the other two books were better than the first. How wrong I was. Pretties was quicker paced, enthralling and more informative than the Uglies. Although I was quite disappointed that the smokies weren't involved openly in the book so much, the author still did a wonderful job. He also did an amazing job introducing the character Zane. It felt like he had been there the entire time. There was more urgency in the Pretties it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Scott Westerfeld portrayed the Pretties in wonderful light I felt as if I was struggling with them all. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loved the Uglies."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Have you ever been perfect but perfection isn't good enough? Well this book called Pretties is all about getting into trouble and it being hard to get out of. It has a total of 370 pages, the authors name is Scott Westerfeld. The main character is Tally, Tally Youngblood, creepy last name huh?The book Pretties is all about a girl Tally Youngblood, she is now a prettie and when Tally goes to a party and David gave her instructions to get something important but Tally doesn't understand, Zane shows up at the party and all three Zane, Tally, and Shay start taking pills, but Shay does this to become like Tally, but instead gets addicted and becomes a cutter. It's a great book, read it! And see what happens next!My favorite part of the book is when Tally has to take Zane to the hospital and Tally has to talk to the doctor, but instead of talking about Zane's injury he talked about why Tally and her best friend Shay were fighting.The most important thing that I learned from reading this book is to never take pills or lie because you might just become a cutter like Shay!The other books by this author (Scott Westerfeld) are Uglies, Specials, Extras, Bogus to Bubbly, Midnighters, Peeps, and more.I recommend this book because it makes you scoot off you chair....... And is so amazingly great I think this book will be perfect for you.Star Rating ***** 5 stars"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I found the second book in the Uglies trilogy to be an excellent pick-up from the first book. I was very curious about the subculture of the Pretties when I read the first book, and this one opens up right in the middle of it, thick with the new vocabulary of the Pretties, with words such as bubbly, bogus, surge, pretty-making, fashion-missing, spinning, criminal, etc. At first, I liked being immersed in the world of the pretties, a mixture of familiar and foreign aspects, but it quickly became very apparent how much of the Pretties were complete air-heads! Being shallow is the social norm, and if anyone even attempts to have a little depth, the authorities are quick to step in. I admit, being a Pretty is not completely unattractive, what with an improved immune system and perfect skin, teeth, and eyesight. The focus of the book was mainly on escaping the Pretty society with more development of the world of Uglies, Pretties, and Specials. I found the discovery of the reservation that the Pretties maintained to study Pre-Rusty civilization very interesting and a great way to reveal how deeply people are being controlled by the authorities. She made an excellent observation about the Smokies, that even though they lived in the wild and lived similarly to both Pre-Rusty and Rusty civilization, they still had not completely escaped from the influence of the Pretty / Ugly society because of the devices they depended on and how their mindset has changed in regards to violence and caring for the earth.Even though I had no doubt that Tally would be turned into a Special in the end, I can't help wondering how the people in charge think they can keep a leash on her, since it has become very apparent that she will always try to escape. I look forward to the final book in the Trilogy, Specials."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This book had less message and more action than Uglies. Tally has become pretty and must decide whether or not she wants to stay that way. The author does a great job of making the pretties sound vapid. The way they talk and their pretty slang was so annoying I almost couldn't stand it. I picture them as a cross between Stepford wives and the Heathers. There's not much I can reveal about the plot without spoiling it so I won't but I will say it ended with a doozy of a cliffhanger and I'm looking forward to Specials the last book in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I can't promise that there will not be any spoilers in this review.....actually there probably will be spoilers so if you have not read Uglies: read at your own risk!Scott Westerfeld has most definitely done it again! I thought Uglies was action packed and intense but this one far surpassed it in it's awesomeness. I was a little put off by the ending of Uglies and the beginning of this book. Did I really want to read about Tally as a dumb Pretty? But the author worked it all out perfectly.Tally has most definitely grown in this book. She was strong and made some really hard choices. I was surprised at all the turns her life has taken from the first book. The development of Zane was a big bonus for me. Of course I liked David but I think I might like Zane more.....This is a 5 star book for me but there was one little thing I was disappointed with. I kind of saw it coming but I still wasn't trilled about it. I'm talking about the ending. I dislike that with every book it's like we are starting over from scratch again. But I'm sure that that is very important to the series so I'm not going to whine too much.Overall, Pretties was a awesome edition to the series. I read it all in one day. There was no way that I could leave this one unfinished to sleep!

Personally, I think I will end up reading \\"Specials\\" but probably not until a few months pass and my sense of let-down is diminished.a Pam T mini review(booksforkids-reviews)"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Tally Youngblood's sacrifice from Uglies has turned her into a beautiful, tall, fun-loving, disease-free, and anti-infection masterpiece. In short, she's a Pretty. Like all pretties, she's forgotten a lot of what most her life was like as an Ugly beyond the normal dumb \\"tricks\\" Uglies do for sport and, of course, being ugly. She drinks champagne, parties all night, stays up until the wee hours of the morning, and wakes up just in time to get ready for the next evening shindig. The only problem is Tally's also forgotten why she became pretty. When a mysterious stranger arrives with a message from her past, Tally struggles to remember what brought her to New Pretty Town in the first place.Who's Croy and what does he have to do with David--a name and face that rises out of her past like a ghost--or, for that matter, with her new best friend, Shay, or boyfriend, Zane? What do the terrifying Specials want with her and why are she and her friends now being closely monitored?I struggled at first with Scott Westerfeld's use of the terms ugly, pretty, and special (the namesake of the titles of this series) when I read Uglies. It's a choice that makes for interesting wordplays and double-entendres like, \\"He had no business stepping out of her ugly past\\" (p. 35) or \\"This was a Special Circumstance\\" (p.95). In context for the former it's clear Tally means coming from a time before she had her operation (ugly with a capital u, so to say); it's also inclusive of the phrase that connotes a negative feeling toward her past; both versions work. There's a lot of lines like that, especially in the first book since Tally's life as an ugly is overly concerned with herself as an ugly. It might make some readers roll their eyes at the pun in a \\"ha ha\\" way, but it finally stopped grating against my sensibilities. Juxtaposed against what it means to be Pretty, even though I couldn't get rid of the deeply rooted sense of wrong every time I read a line like the one quoted above, I couldn't help laughing at a lot of instances similar to this: \\"...memories of the aging ugly faces that still brought her awake screaming sometimes.\\" (p. 21) I wonder if Westerfeld keeps a straight face when writing something like that.There's a lot less criticism of \\"Rusty\\" society and their wasteful ways than in Uglies which made this one less of a cautionary tale and finger-wag lecture and more of an exploration of the experiment to turn people pretty. Whereas before Westerfeld had the job of introducing us to everything in his new world, now we're familiar with it all and ready to understand the nitty gritty behind the operation. We've moved on from what and why to how. In Pretties we get to see further into the lengths the government goes to in order to create a docile society.For starters, pretties have a language of their own (\\"pretty talk\\") that reenforces their vapid personalities and pack mentality. Tally and Shay also make frequent use of nicknames sure to make your skin crawl depending on how you imagine the inflection of their voices when saying \\"Shay-la\\" or \\"Tally-wa.\\" A lot of things can be described as \\"-missing\\" or \\"-making\\"; when the concept is combined with the overused \\"bogus\\" you can make all sorts of new words, or something like \\"bogus-smelling\\". If talking this way isn't enough to dull your brain, then the amount of alcohol consumed by your average pretty will.In an attempt to fight against this post-surgery stupor, Tally and Zane struggle to remain \\"bubbly.\\" They get thrills out of things once considered ugly \\"tricks\\" that keep their adrenaline high, their minds sharp, alert, focused, and make them feel alive, or, bubbly--not like a typical pretty. Pretties is all about awakening; one section is even titled \\"Sleeping Beauty.\\" Tally has to break free of her Pretty hangover and has to convince fellow Crims what really happens during the pretty surgery and explain their memory loss. As she begins to awaken from the strange, pretty-induced dream-reality state, she pulls them along with her as she plots with Zane how to escape New Pretty Town and return to the Rusty Ruins as living proof that Maddy's new cure works.Along the way she finds Andrew Simpson Smith. He lives in a village of pre-Rusty savages with a deeply rooted thirst for violence and revenge. What she discovers there is sinister, but not unexpected. What is unexpected, and a little curious, is why the Pretty Committee would choose to make all Pretties have olive-colored skin. It may just be me, but I don't understand the choice. Despite this, I liked the fairy tale theme threaded throughout the book. As each person or group manages to wake to a new reality, it really reveals the ugly truth behind New Pretty Town: all that glitters isn't gold; the dream of having a tame, non-violent, non-problematic society is just that--a dream.I really liked the ideas and themes Westerfeld presents in this series. He touches upon a lot of topics most dystopian books do (wasteful habits, environmental issues, dependence on oil, dependence on technology), but in a way very relatable to younger audiences. I thought Tally was infinitely more enjoyable this time around, despite not being able to stop bringing trouble down on her friends. She struggles with guilt, but isn't given too much time to wallow. Like Uglies, Pretties propels the reader to a quick ending. The only surprise will be how Tally breaks free of her new situation. She's less inclined to be so black and white now that she's Pretty and the moral ambiguity of her situation presents itself clearly in things such as having to explain her current relationship with Zane to David, the boy she left behind. As she works her way deeper into the motivations of New Pretty Town she begins to realize just how large and complex society has become. It isn't just Uglies and Pretties anymore. The consequences have become larger and the words, significantly less annoying by the end.If you can push past the hyphenated pretty talk, there's a lot to enjoy in Pretties that Uglies couldn't offer. Just be sure you have Specials nearby because you're going to want to pick it up quickly to find out what happens. I've got my copy right here.Thanks to Kathryn at Simon & Schuster UK for the review copy!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"The true sign of good writing is when the author makes you feel frustrated at the characters, fed-up, or even furious or irate. The fact that the author is willing to play with those types of emotions, even knowing that it could cause you to possibly hate the book, is a true sign of a good author. Scott Westerfield definitely does this in this book.PRETTIES starts off a few weeks after where UGLIES left off. Tally Youngblood is now a pretty and is loving every minute of it. She completely forgots some aspects of her Ugly life, and is living happily, yet unaware in Prettytown. Along with her best friend Shay, Tally is now a member of the Crims, a gang of Pretties who were \\"bad\\" back in their Ugly past. The Crims are led by the smoldering Zane, who (obviously) becomes Tally's love interest later in the book. But Tally's perfect Pretty world is turned upside down when an old friend from the (now destroyed) Smoke comes with a message for her from David, a past love interest whom Tally barely remembers. The result of this leads to Tally and Zane finding a mysterious bottle of pills that they believe can make them \\"bubbly\\". And at first, it does. But then Zane starts getting crippling headaches, Shay starts cutting herself, and everything that Tally once believed in she must now reconsider. Many favorite characters from UGLIES come back, along with some new ones, too, and PRETTIES is sure to leave you (once again) wanting more.This is possibly one of the only books I've read in which my favorite aspect of it is also the part of it that I hated the most. In this case, its the characters. For the most part, Scott Westerfield develops his characters quite well, and I thoroughly enjoyed the secondary characters. The three characters that were devloped the best, however, were also the three that I hated the most: Tally, Zane, and Shay. For Tally, I ended up hating her in the beginning for letting the lesions get to her, and then hating her in the end again because of the hurtful way she treats David (whom I love). Zane as a whole just bugged me from start to finish: the way he craftily took over the \\"hero\\" role, the way he stole Tally's heart without even bothering to think about the feelings she had for David, and his tagging along with Tally which resulted in both of them getting captured. I think most of us who have read the book can agree that, in the end, if Zane had made just one good decision when it was really needed, Tally would've ended up in a much better situation. However, he was neccesary to the story, and I credit him for that. And lastly, Shay. Ever since she became Pretty and dragged Tally into it with her, I've despised that girl. She lets her jealousy of Tally get to her, and ends up going down, yet always bringing Tally with her. If Tally's life would've been marginally better if Zane had made good decisions, imagine how much better her life would be if Shay hadn't gotten so jealous. My blood boils when I think of all she did to Tally, especially in PRETTIES.Overall (21.5/25):Plot: 4.5/5- At first it was pretty predicitable, but there were many twists and turns later in the book.Characters: 5/5- Scott Westerfield experiments with his characters so well in this book! I loved hating them!Setting: 5/5- I especially enjoyed the primitive world which Tally crash-lands into- it was so creative yet made perfect sense!Romance: 2/5- Tally's romance with Zane was very predictable, but the way she ends up hurting David (sob) was not.Teenage Factor (because I am one): 5/5- Any girl (or boy, although its more geared towards girls) who has read UGLIES will not want to miss this one."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"*May contain spoilers from Uglies*I love the cover on this one too. The twinkle in the girl's eye draws me in. The tagline for this one is, \\"What happens when perfection isn't good enough?\\" This leads us to believe that life isn't as good for the \\"pretties\\" as the pre-16 year olds are lead to believe.Once again, I really appreciated that Westerfeld addressed issues that are relevant to teens without being overly preachy. Superficiality is one of the main ones, but questioning authority and even questioning who you are is present throughout the book. *SPOILERS from Pretties* It becomes aware that even the pretties face societal issues when Peris makes the decision to go back to New Pretty Town instead of heading out into the wilderness and roughing it. He prefers to be blissfully unaware of the lesions on his brain and what they do. *END SPOILERS*It was fun to see how the pretties live. I was overly intrigued with how and why the new pretties decided to alter their bodies for each new party or just because they felt like it. They get tattoos, put gems in their eyes and dye their skin. It is interesting that essentially these new pretties are perfect, yet they are still altering themselves to keep up with each new fad. It reminded me of the people who are addicted to plastic surgery. Tally even mentions that they are supposed to limit themselves to one transformation per week (I believe). Also, the pretties (especially in Tally's group) will starve themselves, do dangerous stunts and even some cut themselves all to feel the rush and coherence it gives them. This just screams teen behavior and is mostly dangerous behavior. The parallels to our world are often striking and thought provoking in this series."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"While Pretties isn't my absolute favorite of the series, I loved finally being able to \\"see\\" life as a Pretty.

Loved the series and cannot wait to read more from this author!!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I don't know what I was expecting when I picked up Pretties, but it ended up not being what I expected...but in a good way.Pretties opens after Tally has had the operation and is living in New Pretty Town. The tone of Pretties is very different from Uglies because TALLY is different. While I thought the change was interesting and clever, I have to admit that after a few chapters the CONSTANT bubbly/bogus/pretty-making terminology really got on my nerves. I know why the author did it and I liked it, but it was a little overdone, at least for me. Luckily this only lasts for about the first quarter of the book.The plot takes a bunch of twists I didn't expect and even though there are several similarities to Uglies SPOILERS: (the indecision on Tally's part, the 'escape', the journey in the wild and then the being returned to the city)I felt it was done in a different way that kept it interesting. The introduction of the 'wild men' was completely unexpected and a little odd but I hope they play a role in the next book.I really liked the character of Zane even though it will probably bring out about the dreaded 'love triangle' in the last book (there's a small bit of it in Pretties, but not much mainly because David is missing for most of the novel) and thought Shay's transformation was interesting (especially at the end).I didn't like the treatment of Peris. I had hoped that while he was mostly a plot device to get Tally into New Pretty Town in Uglies that he would be fleshed out in Pretties. He isn't. He's rarely mentioned and his 'big moment' is good but doesn't have much weight because the reader doesn't know much about him. SPOILERS: I didn't care that he chose to stay pretty instead of escaping because I knew nothing about his character. He was a 'best friend forever' that was rarely around Tally and when he was he did nothing but smile and laugh. Peris is a disappointment in Pretties.What I like most about this series is that I have no idea where it will go next. I mean, it's a triology with an evil overlord government so one would assume Tally is going to take them down, but how does she get to that point? What will happen to Peris? Zane? Shay? Maddy? David? That's what makes a reader want to continue with a series. What will happen to the world we've known and the characters we've grown to love? I can't wait for the last book!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"There isnt much to say about this book its an excellent book that is very well thought out and well written. that being said it suffers slightly from middle book syndrome. its was not able to compare to the original but it was a good book that is able to hold its own compartively. The main problem with that is also its greatest asset is the fact the characters are nearly completly different we see very little of david and instead are introduced to a new male side character beginning the eponymous love triangle (it is YA fiction if you have a problem with love triangles find a different genre). And due to what we find out from the last book the pretty operation has understandably made her and shay act like pretties. The thing i like about Tally though is her unwilingess to give up and accept defeat! IU dont like the direction they are taking one of the main characters. this is definitly the penultimate in the series. and I assure that if you loved uglies you will love or at the very least like pretties. This book series comes with my highest recomendation."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I ordered this book for my daughter and she loved it. It came quicker than expected and in better condition than some of the books a have bought at my local book store."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Tally finally gets what she wants and becomes a pretty. Unfortunately, pretty Tally reminded me of Ugly Tally. I didn't really see a huge personality swap. At times, I could tell she was a pretty, using all that annoying slang, but mostly, I felt she was too...there. Unlike the pretties we've read about before, Tally just doesn't act like them and I'm slightly disappointed.The story this time around revolves around Tally and her escape from New Pretty Town. Not too different from Uglies, but this time she throwing some serious tricks. Tally has teamed up with Zane, leader of the Crims, and together, they're trying their best to escape and raise awareness about the New Smoke. I didn't enjoy the beginning, I liked some parts, but I didn't really get into it until about 80 or so pages in when the action started to happen.I did like Tally better in Pretties than I did in Uglies and I think it's mostly thanks to Zane. He's pretty much a cool cat in my book now. Peris on the other hand...I just don't see how they were ever best friends. He just seemed to be some kind of plot device (if you could call him that) and he had no real personality or interaction with Tally. His purpose in Uglies was to lead her over to New Pretty Town and meet Shay. In Pretties, he's just there for her to meet more new characters. He just has no real purpose other than being a tool.I'm beginning to see a trend: have Tally jump off high things, have Tally tromp through the wilderness by herself, and have Tally save people. Not that I particularly mind any of that. In a way, I sort of wish Tally wasn't such a strong character. She deserves a break every once in awhile.I definitely had fun reading Pretties, especially cause there were a bunch of things that I absolutely did not see coming (and that twisted ending...gosh).

I'm glad that I did decide to read it. The concept of seeing how the \\"Pretties\\" think was quite interesting to me and I was satisfied with the development of this story. One thing that very much bothered me throughout the novel was the way that the \\"New Pretties\\" talked. Goodness, it drove me crazy! I found it irritating and immature. I understand the reasoning that Westerfeld decided to write it this way - to make the \\"Pretties\\" seem ditsy and brainless - but I wish he would have found another way of doing so. Here's a few examples of what drove me crazy, so you can see for yourself what I'm talking about:Tally tried to be bubbly.She was nervous about saying something bogus.This went totally missing on everyone.Kissing Zane was dizzy-making.Funny how that kick to the head had left her brain-missing for a moment.The characters were nicely developed. I especially enjoyed seeing all the different sides to Tally - her as a \\"Pretty\\" and then transforming back into her old, \\"Ugly\\" self again. The new character, and Tally's new love-interest, Zane was a very likeable character. His development was good as well. The characters were all changing in this book from the way they were presented in the first one, which was interesting to see.The writing is decent. Still, something seemed a bit off to me about it, just like the first book. But, it was able to keep me interested.Overall, I would recommend this book to fans of YA Dystopia, I would advise not to get your hopes up too much. This book was good, but not great. It was interesting, but not completely captivating. The novel ended with a bang and an unexpected twist, but I didn't care for it for this reason: SPOILER!! DON'T READ THE FOLLOWING IF YOU DON'T WANT THE BOOK TO BE SPOILED: it ended suspiciously similar to the first book, with Shay changing just like the ending of the first book. Then, Tally is captured. Although, this time against her will. But she is following the same path as Shay again. It just felt kind of like a copy-cat of the first novel's ending, just in a slightly different direction. I'm not saying exactly what happened in case you are reading this and haven't read the book. I don't want to give away the complete ending!Read more of my reviews on my blog: SIK Book Reviews"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I absoulty love this series.

I found it started out a lot better than the Uglies, the character of Tally had developed further.

Couldn't wait to read Specials after this one!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This is a good trilogy series for teenagers/young adults. It makes you think twice about how superficial people and society can be, and the damaging effects it could have on people. Although the book is far-fetched about how power and greed can make you superficial, it is based on the future so who knows what could occur!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Like most teenage girls, I sometimes dream or hope that people will find me to be the prettiest or most popular girl in school even if I don't admit it to myself or consciously think about it everyday. Sometimes I may be unhappy about minor blemishes on my face or I worry that my figure doesn't resemble the girl on the cover of a magazine. However, it has never occurred to me to surgically change how I look or disregard my moral compass to make others like me. In this novel, I felt a direct connection between myself and the main character of the Pretties, Tally. We both ultimately want to be true to ourselves and not let societies ideas of what we should be mold us into something we are not, such in Talley's case choosing a path that is not popular or myself choosing a sport that is non traditional for a person of my sex and race.The Pretties is the second book of the series written by Scott Westerfield. It focuses on a society in the future that is trying to stop the emotional devastation that we do to ourselves in this present day time by trying do whatever it takes to fit in no matter what the cost monetarily or mentally. In the first book the Uglies, Tally follows her friend Shay to the Smoke, a place that is primitive. The people there don't worry about whether they are pretty or ugly. They hunt for their own food and there is no society to tell them what to do. There she finally finds what she has been missing. In both books, she did not have the luxury of expressing her own opinions and ideas because of the rules of the Society. After Tally attains all the wonderful trappings of life that a teenage would find awesome, such as all the latest fads in clothes, and new gadgets she still feels something is not right. She is now a very beautiful girl and has a really cute boyfriend and she is on everyone's guest list to the best parties. Everyone knows \\"Tally Youngblood\\"! Behind her pretty appearance and all the great parties, she realizes that something is still wrong. She begins to feel that she longs to be somewhere else. After a visit by her old friends, she realizes that her society is not all that great and she now has a new goal other than to follow the rules. She is ready to escape and to follow her heart. Maybe to her previous life.Ally Condie, in her novel, Matched, wrote about this same utopian society, where there were people in charge who told you what to do in every aspect of your life. Both novels discuss a battle that I think most teenagers have within themselves of wanting independence but also still wanting that safety net of parents telling what to do. Both main characters, Talley and Cassia think that the life that has been laid out before them is the life they were destined to live until outside forces and similar love triangles make them question what they really want.This is a great book to read if you are a teenager wanting a thrilling novel, with lots of adventure and romance. The novel asks you to question your beliefs about what it means to be popular and pretty and to what extent would you go to achieve these characteristics. In today's society when we as teenagers are bombarded with the need for material things and the quest for outer beauty, this books puts into perspective what is really important to have a happy life and how much less we need to achieve that life. I highly recommend reading the entire series, Uglies, Pretties, Specials, and Extras because once you read the first one you won't be able to wait to get your hands on the others."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I thought this book was so much better than the first installment. I was totally hooked on this series by the second half of the first book, which was rather boring in the beginning.Tally has now had the surgery to become a Pretty and is living a life of luxury and non-stop parties in New Pretty Town. But everything is disrupted by a letter she receives that she wrote to herself when she was still an Ugly. She has promised to take 2 pills to heal brain lesions caused by the transformation. The lesions cause individuals to become peaces loving, unquestioning, and dense. Scared to attempt the cure alone, and leave her boyfriend Zane behind, she splits the pills with him.The actions begins when Tally and Zane search for the Ruins where the pills have come from and get help for Zane who seems to be having a bad response to the dose. With the Specials on their tail, the journey is an exciting adventure.I have a fondness for post-apocalyptic books and I love the world Westerfeld has created and the surprises along the way.This installment kept me on my toes and made it extremely hard to put down. I started the third book in the series immediately! Review on the third book, Specials, will be coming soon!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This series has a wonderful storyline and plot. It is so well written. Sure, sometimes it gets confusing, but it is amazing what the inference does for the opening! This is such a good author, and I would recommend this to any teen, girl or boy, who is looking for a good story. It is the perfect balance between a girl's dream to look perfect, and a boy's desire of action and thrill."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This book was good, not as thrilling as the first in the series but still not bad. By the very end, though,it sunk in that it was pretty formulaic and Westerfield never can seem to give happy endings to his stories -at least from what I've seen in the Midnighter's series and here-. It is a page turner, and you want to see the end, but you get the feeling it just could have been more enjoyable. My biggest complaint, by far, though, is the sheer number of errors in the kind version. Quotation marks are turned into letters, new lines don't start where they probably were intended to and the pages are littered with other small errors. Some ended up being very confusing until you read a few more sentences to piece it together. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"In the follow up to Uglies, Tally has become a pretty. We all know why, but Tally doesn't remember much about her last few days as an ugly or why she ended up pretty. There are a lot of things she isn't sure of, thanks to a procedure that affects the brain. But events conspire to help Tally remember why she became pretty and how she can regain the clarity and understanding that was taken away from her in the operation.The story remains imaginative and interesting. Westerfeld has delved into his world and let us see the inner workings of pretty town (which were as mysterious to us as to the uglies in book one). Seeing this helps fill in the details that were missing before.Like in the first book, there are long stretches of time where Tally is alone or stuck in her head. Sometimes it gets a little slow because of this, but it does help portray just how different the operation makes a person.Shay's storyline is a bit shocking and I am not sure I truly believe her character would take the turn she does. I won't go into detail because I don't want to ruin it. (Perhaps if the change was a bit more gradual it would be a bit more believable, but it seems fairly sudden and very extreme considering who she was before.) In a way, it almost feels like it was done for shock value over anything else. It was a good twist, but not the most realistic one.One of the more interesting elements of the book was the love triangle involved. Since Tally does not remember David much, it makes sense that she would fall for someone else in New Pretty Town. This is one storyline that I would have liked to see more of and it felt like when the issue could finally be confronted, so many other things were happening and we didn't get a chance to really go into it. If I could change one thing about book two, it would have been that. Even one more day would have been nice.The series remains exciting and I can't wait to see where book three takes it."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This book is great! I started out with it but then couldn't understand what was going on so I had to read the first one, Uglies, which is just as good. Reading them in order makes it a lot more interesting bc u know whats going on."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Pretties is the 2nd book in Westerfeld's dystopian trilogy. I highly recommend reading the first book before this one, or even reading this review. Plotlines could be revealed.Tally has been changed into a Prettie after going back to civilization in the guise of wanting to turn herself in. She and her friend Shay are just like any other pretties now; they love to party and think of the next things to do for fun. But something never settles quite right for Tally. She feels like there's something she's missing. When a New Smoke representative manages to talk to her it makes those questions even larger. She finds a secret and things start changing at a rapid rate, and she starts remembering and thinking again.Westerfeld creates some great characters. They are very engaging and realistic. Even Tally, though she has her flaws, just seems to be a real person, albeit in a future very different than any you can imagine. I liked the addition of Zane too. I thought he was interesting and made a good partner for Tally. Shay on the other hand I wasn't sure what to think about in this book. I still feel very sorry for her as she seems to get the short end of the stick every time. I was disappointed to see that the characters of Smoke barely got to make any appearances in this book. Most of the time everyone was in New Pretty town so there wasn't a chance for them to have a lot of book time.This book wasn't as well done as the first. The pacing wasn't as good and was slower moving. The amount of time spent on the parties was just excruciating at times. I understand it was to show the culture, but it was still a little much for those of us readers who aren't \\"pretties\\". This is a young adult book and as such lacks strong language or themes, although sex is mentioned, just not described. Probably the most interesting part of the writing is the lexicon that was developed for pretty speak. It cutesified everything and was very inventive.I did like the book, I just didn't think it was as good as the first. I am looking forward to the next one though and can't wait to read it.PrettiesCopyright 2005370 pagesReview by M.

Otherwise the story was great and kept me glued to reading it. I enjoyed all the twists and turns in the novel. I liked Tally's character development and experiencing her trying to find the truth and staying \\"bubbly\\". If you liked the first novel, the Uglies, then you will also enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This review was originally published at [...]After accidentally betraying The Smoke, resulting in Shay becoming a brainless Pretty, Tally decides to sacrifice herself for her friend. She gives herself up to the Specials to become Pretty herself, in order that she can test the Cure to Pretty-Headedness, making sure it's safe enough for Shay to take, too.I found it really hard to relate to Tally in this book. I get that she is now brain-damaged, and therefore a totally different person, but... she's now a totally different person! I mean, I liked Tally! I liked her a lot! And now there's this new Tally who is all... pretty-minded.That was one of the best things about the book: the use of Pretty Newspeak, with tip of hat to 1984. Things aren't fun, or interesting, or relaxing. They're 'bubbly-making'. Things aren't bad, or annoying, or vexing. They're 'bogus' or 'bogus-making'. When you're drunk or hungover (most of the time) or generally going with the flow, you're 'pretty-minded'. Very, very cool reference to the classic of dystopian literature.The events of this book take Tally's situation from bad to worse. It's like reading about Frodo as he tromps through Mordor. Only, with Frodo, you know him and you love him. This Tally, as I mentioned, is someone new, and keeps changing throughout the book. It all makes sense within the story, but it's still really hard to keep reading about bad things happening to someone who feels like a stranger. It was really frustrating. Would you have read through a bazillion pages of Frodo-in-Mordor if you couldn't relate to him? Maybe not.I love the not-so-subtle message of this book, especially because it is intended for younger readers. Being pretty isn't all it's cracked up to be! Think for yourself! Etcetera!(mild spoiler alert for the next paragraph)However, at one point in Pretties, Tally discovers a clan of people living outside of her city as a secret experiment in human nature. These people are living a tribal lifestyle reminiscent of indigenous cultures everywhere, only they are portrayed as, well, nasty brutish and short, literally. They're malnourished, they kill each other, they're simpleminded and easily coerced. I really didn't like that part, because it complicated the message in an unrealistic way that didn't really have a point. These people were portrayed as obviously backwards, unsophisticated, almost barbaric in their lack of culture. It fit in with the whole \\"humanity is a disease and also progress is great\\" theme that wove its way through the story, but frankly, that theme doesn't make much sense. Our culture might be a disease, but the indigenous lifestyle vilified in this passage is certainly not. 'Progress' is the problem, not humans.Ok spoilers finished.I am torn about whether to buy Specials, the next in the series. On the one hand, the plot has become complex and intriguing, with lots of mysteries still to solve. On the other, I no longer feel ANY connection with Tally. Shay, who was a confusing character to begin with, is now a straight up bad guy. The interesting rebels from The Smoke seem to be out of the picture, and I wasn't a big fan of this book's new love interest, Zane."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I loved this book so much better than the first!

Tally Youngblood has become a pretty. (If you do not know what an ugly and pretty is, please look at my review for Uglies.) At first Tally is happy. She gets to go to parties all the time, becomes a Crim, she's back with Peris and Shay and she has a great boyfriend. When she receives a note and present from the Smokies (and her past), everything changes. Tally realizes what is going on and starts to remember her past more clearly. Shay (Tally's friend) gets mad at Tally when she discovers that Tally has been keeping secrets from her. Shay decides to form her own group called the Cutters. Tally and other Crims decide to go and escape the city. Unfortunately while escaping she gets separated from the group and has to get to the New Smoke on her own. Luckily Tally gets help from a few people on the way. Finally David and Tally see each other after a long period of separation. Since Tally is a pretty she does not think highly of David's looks since he is an ugly. Zane (Tally's boyfriend) has terrible headaches but David's mom finds out why and finds a cure for them. After arriving at the New Smoke Tally realizes that she has to decide between Zane and David. She cannot decide because all that she has been through with each of them. Once again David and Tally become separated from each other. Tally and Zane get taken back to the city by Special Circumstances. After reading Pretties I realize how weird the covers of the books look so strange; both the old (the one on my reviews) and new covers for the trilogy. I do not like how the story ends but it does make me want to read the next book in the series which is Specials. In my opinion the story line of Uglies was written better than Pretties.

This book I thought was the lightest of the series, and I think that is why I enjoyed it the most, it was not at all what I expected, or what I thought I would have wanted, but I absolutely loved it and not just because I really enjoy the characters in this world and their relationships with each other but because this book (well the whole series actually ) really made me think, way after I was even done reading.I think I would have given the book four stars, but there is one part about a third of the way into the book that I thought was a little slow and dragged out, but other than that the pace was good and the character development was great!This whole series is definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This is a very unique book. I have read many books for my thirteen year old age, but none like this. This book is special, interesting. It is one of those books that absorbes your attention so totally, you don't notice the time untill your dsd starts banging on the door and yelling that yiu need sleep. We're ready for more!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"this book is my favorite out of all four books in this series. the series is really good, good plot and characters. they are very short reads. Pretties may sound like a really weird book when u read the summery buy its actually a decent books.the time period is kinda different from most books i normally read because its about the future with all the new technology. it made me think of peoples lives in 100 years and wonder if it will be anything like this. the authors writing makes you want to wonder \\"what is going to happen next?\\" and before you know it u will be done with the book. overall very good : )"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Uglies had me hanging on to every word, and I also enjoyed reading this one. Tally is a sixteen-year-old girl who was turned pretty in this book, and therefore, as said in the first book, parts of her brain are blocked out. I was disappointed by how she could just move on past her normal life and all the friends that she left behind so easily, but I guess that's just from my point of view. Overall, Scott Westerfeld wrote a great follow-up to Uglies and I look forward to reading the third book."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I'm going to attempt to not spoil the novels I review, but I may have spoilers relating to previous novels in a series- you have been warned. Pretties is a very good follow-up to Uglies. Westerfeld does a great job of maintaining a slightly claustrophobic atmosphere while still painting the Pretty world in great detail. There are a few aspects of it that I'm uncomfortable with, but I'm hoping they somehow get resolved in the next book, which I am prepared with this time. The characters are largely written well and realistically. This one seemed almost to cover more material than Uglies did, or maybe it wasn't as tightly woven together. I get the feeling that this one isn't supposed to be as tight of a story, though- like it's supposed to feel a little manic and scattered in places. Parts of the journey seemed out of place, but as with the issues I mentioned above, I also have hope that they will be resolved in the follow-up to this story. I can see the themes presented in this series sparking a lot of discussion if read in a book group or just amongst a group of friends.Here are some standardized questions I'll be asking myself for book reviewing purposes:Was it worth my time AND money?Yes, I was well and truly captivated again.Will it be seeing a trip to the local used bookstore as a trade-in?I doubt it.Was there ever a point where I groaned because I just knew X-event had to happen?Not about any of the major plot points. I had suspicions, for sure, but that was it.Was there anything truly incredible or surprising about this story?Quite a few things. One of the themes that tends to be repeated in YA novels I've read is that the only love that means anything is the kind that is consuming and lasts forever, but this tended toward valuing love as it comes, in a variety of imperfect forms.Did the characters ever act in a way that felt forced or inconsistent with the rules of the universe as the author has presented them? (Or, did the author in any way hijack the characters and sacrifice their realism for the sake of a plot point?)Yes, and I'm not talking about the Pretty state of being. There's enough room left in the story (given that there are 2 more books set in this universe) that I might be wrong, but I don't think so. As of now, I feel like Shay was hijacked a bit, though.Is it a guilty pleasure?No, as with the first book in the series, I find the writing solid enough to recommend it openly.Two word summary:Horrifying, philosophical"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I will keep this short and sweet. The second book in the Uglies series bypassed the first book. This book was everything a novel should be, well written, deeply developed characters, well thought out plot...the list goes on. Nothing was predictable or a let down in this second installment. Tally moved from a character I respected, but didn't know if I liked, to a character I really enjoy reading about. At each twist and turn of the plot I was right there with her, saddened, excited and scared. The author didn't trick with any \\"easy-out\\" threads which completely brought my estimation of him way way up. I had jury duty today and finished the book while I sat there and waited for my name to be called. If I had a glass of wine I would offer a toast to Mr. Westerfeld. Nice job."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"\\"*Humanity is a cancer, and we are the cure.* Violence is what the cities had been built to end, and part of what the operation switched off in pretties' brains. The whole world that Tally had grown up in was a firebreak against this awful cycle. But here was the natural state of the species, right in front of her. In running from the city, perhaps this is what Tally was running toward.\\" (\\"Pretties,\\" page 280.)It wasn't until I was halfway through \\"Pretties\\" that I realized that I had accidentally started with the middle book in the trilogy that starts with \\"Uglies.\\" This helped to me to realize why it seemed like a slow start to this thought-provoking sci-fi story that picks up speed as it hovers along.At first I had trouble understanding the \\"pretty speak\\" and \\"bubbly\\" mentality of New Pretty Town, and it took me a while to really care about the main characters, Tally and Zane. In the end, their adventure to escape to the Rusty Ruins with their friends, the Crims, had me fully engaged.I'm not a big fan of sci-fi or fantasy, unless there's some thoughtful content that accompanies it, and the social commentary in \\"Pretties\\" on a society that lives for pleasure and beauty is worth the effort. Also the commentary on the cure is interesting, but I won't be a spoiler here and tell you about it.I look forward to reading the other books in the series in the future."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"The book begins right in the midst of Tally's days as a Pretty. She has been brainwashed with the lesions, forgetting most of what happened in the Smoke, including David. However, Tally gets glimpses of her past, and blots them out because she doesn't like the feeling those memories bring her, which is guilt. Tally also knows she's different--she isn't completely brainwashed, and when she meets Zane, things change for Tally once again.Zane helps her change and remember, and keep a clear head. Most of the book consists of the two attempting to escape to the New Smoke after she is smuggled pills to take to destroy the lesions in her brain. She shares the two pills (which she was supposed to take alone) with Zane, so both of them are clearheaded and able to escape. But a few problems arise as the two set out, leading to another fantastic book in this series.Though this book was not as exciting as the Uglies, and I felt as if I was constantly waiting for them to escape, I still thought it was fantastic. I liked Zane a lot more than David because Zane was intelligent enough to get past the Pretty lesions, but maybe David would have just gone along with the flow, and not been able to overcome them and taken the alternative path that Tally always seems to take. I think the reason this book was not as exciting was there wasn't enough mystery. In the Uglies there was the mystery of the brain lesions and whether or not Tally would betray the Smoke--in this book the only mystery was whether or not they would be able to escape. There was also the worried conflict over what would happen once Zane and David met, but this didn't occur until the end of the book, winding up to be rather anti-climatic. I would give this book 4 stars in comparison with the Uglies but as a book unto itself I give it 5."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This was interesting. Plus, it has a bonus point already for being sequel. I guess my best way to describe it is like a roller coaster... Up & down. Sometimes I couldn't breathe, and sometimes I wanted to stop reading. Nevertheless, Westerfeld is an amazing writer. I loved the way he manages to let you know with a completely different writing, when the world -Tally's mind- is bubbly and when its bogus.That was what I liked the most, along with the way he mocks reality. It's hard to think he is so right. Everything he says -about the actual world- is now playing with my mind. In this book, he doesn't focus so much in pretty/ugly issues, more in the self-destructing predator and war-lover that the world today has become. It is really amazing his point of view. That fact alone, makes it an incredible reading.I have mixed emotions about this book. I fell he complicated things too much. But I did like it. I guess I'm just heartbroken for David. And it is rare, when the reader doesn't have a preference in the love-conflict (Yeah, by \\"the reader\\" I mean me). I love them both!!! I can't decide! So, that makes the story and the characters amazing. I thought for a moment we'd have three -Andrew- to choose from. I'm glad that didn't happen (it would be interesting huh?). The cover though, did not impress me. Its hard to top that first one. It's an amazing book for fiction lovers."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I am probably repeating most of what has been said here, but it is worth repeating. This book has several problems:1) The books is divided into three \\"books\\". I found Book 1 nearly unreadable. I understand that the author's point in putting in all the \\"pretty-speak\\" was to give us an idea of what it's like to be a \\"pretty-head\\" (read: empty-head), but it got old and tiring fast. I agree with another reviewer who said that it was almost \\"too pretty\\". I think readers got the point 50 pages into it. I admit, I found myself skimming through much of Book 1.2) So much time was spent dragging out much unnecessary detail in the first 2/3 of the book that the last 1/3 seemed unfairly rushed and almost shoved down your throat. A tremendous amount of information and action is condensed to a couple of paragraphs here and a few sentences there. Sadly, this last 1/3 of the book is the most engaging, interesting, and enjoyable,and deserved to have been given a lot more attention than it received. I have a feeling this goes with the territory of being a middle book in a trilogy.3) This books is wrought with both spelling and grammatical errors. It is not the first time that I have come across a typo in a book before, but it is the first time that I have encountered it in such a rampant manner. At one point, I read about 50 pages straight, each with a typo of some sort. It takes away so much enjoyment from a book when you have to read through these kind of errors. I actually felt as if I was reading the author's unedited, rough, cut. I am still not convinced that I was not. It was that bad. This book needs to be edited, badly.But if you can hang in there, get past the pretty-speak, and make it past all the typos, there is a story to be told about the flawed heroine Tally and the turns and challenges her life takes in the \\"Pretty\\" chapter of her life. Again, while I wished more time was spent wrapping up the end of this book, I am still looking forward to, and expecting more out of the next book, 'Specials'."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This book was really good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes read adventure, action, romance, and fantasy!!##"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I loved this book so much!

Tally becomes a mostly unlikeable character as she becomes 'cured' of the Pretty brain surgery but still retains much of her shallowness. I am not sure if I will read the next instalment due to the lack of plot progression.

I can see where the whole pretty talk can get annoying. But if you look beyond that, you see that the talk is just another aspect to some really dynamic characters that Scott Westerfield has created. I read it quickly and was not disappointed. The plot twists are original and real (the book doesn't feel contrived), and kept you intriguid from start to finish. I see that you can preorder the last one, Specials, already. I would not hesitate if you have been following the series!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I had very mixed feelings about Pretties, the second books in The Uglies series. Pretties was definitely entertaining but it couldn't compare to Uglies. Pretties is written in the slang of Pretties which was a very over-whelming and annoying style. Every five seconds the words \\"bubbly\\" and \\"bogus\\" were used and I just couldn't stand it at all. I understand Pretties are supposed to be \\"airheads\\" and simpleminded but I felt Westerfeld overused his slang.Most of the characters from Uglies return in Pretties but we are also introduced to some new characters. Pretties introduces a love interest for Tally thus creating a love triangle. I am really sick and tired of all these love triangles in YA books because they are way too overused. A love triangle didn't really add much to Pretties at all and just was pretty unnecessary. Zane was a likable character but he just wasn't developed enough. Zane lacked emotional depth that could set him apart from other love interests.I really liked the world-building of Uglies and I hoped Westerfeld would have developed it more in Pretties. Westerfeld added what life was like outside the city but I still want to know more about the city itself. Pretties really had an opportunity to strengthen the Pretty and Ugly Cities but that never happened. This was a really disappointing factor for me because Uglies had such interesting world building.Pretties was a bit cliche and I definitely knew what was going to happen next in the novel. When reading I like to be surprised with plot twists but I saw most of Pretties's twists coming. Maybe I have just read way too many dystopias because I felt like Pretties was nothing new. At the end there was a plot twist that I definitely didn't see coming though and that may have been the only surprising twist in the book. Sometimes I felt like Pretties was pretty much Uglies with a love triangle because the plots were very similar.It sounds like I didn't really like Pretties considering all my critique but that is not the case. Pretties was an entertaining read but I felt like it was just like any other dystopian novel I read. Pretties didn't add anything special to the Dystopian genre and followed basically the same plot-line of Uglies. Pretties was a good and entertaining read but I don't think I'll be reading Specials."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Boring. As simple as that. I read Uglies and the concept was good enough to finish the book, but Pretties is just boring. I hate not finishing books, but I think I need to this time. Pretties is slow and has no feel of action. There is &#34;action&#34;, but the writing gives me no thrill. This could have been a great series with the concept of the books, but the writer just didnt execute it very well."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This was an excellent follow-up of the first book, one that I didn't expect to favor more than the first but \\"Pretties\\" definitely surpassed it. I loved the addition of Zane, a fantastic new character who quickly became my favorite. It was really interesting to read about his and Tally's adventures as they try to keep a clear head and attempt to free themselves from the tracing device placed on them by the officials and leave the city. Readers continuing on from \\"Uglies\\" will not be disappointed with this sequel."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Pretties was not as spunky and fresh as the first book, Uglies, but it definitely feeds one's curiosity in the same way. It continues the story and adds a twist in the romance and, in the Uglies-series-way of Scott Westerfield, a shocker to end out te story. With issues that catch teen's attention, such as love, friends, independence, and even cutting, Pretties is not a book to miss."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"While I devoured Uglies and was sucked in from early on, I had a much more difficult time getting into Pretties. My biggest problem with the book was the language that the Pretties used--it was really annoying, and unfortunately highly prevalent during most of the first half of the book. They have a habit of hyphenating words together to get a descriptive point across, like \\"pretty-making,\\" \\"brain-missing,\\" and \\"dizzy-making.\\" Another irritation, adding a syllable to the end of their names--such as Shay-la and Tally-wa. It just sounds obnoxious.OK, now that I'm done ranting about that, I'll get to the rest of this review. :-) In the end, I did enjoy the book, as thankfully the story redeemed itself as the Pretties started clearing their heads a bit, fighting the lesions (first mentioned in Uglies) that were added to their brains during their operation to become pretty. In this book, Tally becomes good friends with fellow pretty Zane, and it seems David and The Smoke are a distant memory. Through the first half, they are doing everything possible to stay \\"bubbly,\\" as they call it, but, near as I can tell, that essentially means that their heads are clearer and they aren't just thinking \\"pretty thoughts,\\" and they're even recovering any memories they may have of The Smoke. Unsurprisingly, through it all Shay and Tally end up on the outs again, as Shay remembers what happened in The Smoke, and accuses Tally of further betrayal again in Pretties.Without giving away too much, eventually Tally, Zane and a group of their fellow \\"Crims\\" (Criminals, their clique) escape via hot air balloons, trying to reach the New Smoke. They are successful, but before making it to the Rusty Ruins, Tally has a side adventure that leads her to some descendants of the Rusties, and her reunion with David didn't turn out quite how she'd expected... There's another great twist and cliffhanger at the end of this one, so you'll probably want to have Specials handy to start reading after finishing this one."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I LOVED Uglies. Honestly, I was kind of disappointed in Pretties. I thought it could have been so much better. I just couldn't get into it. I didn't have that same incredibly, amazed feeling I had while reading Uglies. I see that mostly everyone else has loved it, but I didn't. I don't even know exactly why. It just didn't keep me entertained."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Tally Youngblood, now pretty, is having the time of her life - or so she thinks. She's beautiful, healthy, and completely spoiled. Encouraged to party and \\"surge\\" (surgically alter herself) and be generally vapid, Tally gets twinges that she's not happy like she's supposed to be. Then she gets a message from her old, ugly self. She knows what's wrong. She and her clique, the \\"Crims,\\" attempt to keep their heads clear - to keep \\"bubbly\\" instead of \\"pretty-headed\\" and to escape from the clutches of the city authorities known as Special Circumstances.Pretties was a good follow-up to Uglies, though not quite as gripping. True, it was still fast-paced and when I picked it up I didn't want to put it down, but I didn't have the driving urge to pick it back up once I'd put it down that I had when I read Uglies. That could have been because Tally was already pretty and was constantly fighting the pretty-headed fog surgically altered into her brain, and that fog certainly comes across in the prose of the book.In all, I liked the book, and want to know what happens in Specials and then in Extras."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I really loved the book! Though, without reading the first book, Uglies, understanding what was going on would be very difficult. I think that Scott Westerfield is an awesome author!

I defenitely suggest reading the book!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This book is just as exceptional as its predecessor, with thought-stirring ideas and perfectly placed plot twists to keep you reading until the last page is done. Now that Tally Youngblood is a pretty, she is living the high life with an avalanche of parties to attend; the hardest decision on her mind is what to wear to a costume party. Then a mysteriously familiar person gives her directions to a pouch containing something seemingly important. It takes all the wit her fuzzily pretty mind can manage to get it. When she does, she finds a letter written to herself from back when she was ugly. Along with it, she finds the cure described to her while with Maddy and David. In a last second decision, she and her newly-found boyfriend Zane split the pills. They both seem pretty much clear minded, even when Zane gets some headaches every few mornings. But when they escape to the New Smoke, Tally learns that something went terribly wrong. Another must-read with a cliff-hanger ending. Left me waiting in suspence for the final part in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This I have not read yet, but I am sure my daughter will be reading the Uglies and Pretties this summer. they look wonderful."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"The word bubbly totally ruined the entire book. At first, it you couldn't tell what the heck it meant, so you were incredibly confused. Once they explained it, you hated the word because it was used so much! Sorry Scott Westerfield, but BUBBLY is a horrible word! Great book, some bad word choice."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I decided to read these books after I had seen numerous amounts of people who have read them on Facebook. I should have asked their opinions. It was awful. The first book was decent, Uglies. It had a good story line with good ideas. It relates to many girls who find themselves ugly and how ridiculas it all seems. After my slight content with the first one, even though it had bad writing and misspelled words, I decided to read Pretties. OH, what a Mistake.The book starts out really bad. We are sitting in Tabby's room and she stressing over something that is pointless. Showing us how meaningless her life is. Then comes the ridiculas made up words. BUBBLY-MAKING!!!! that is not ok. Every five words bubbly pops up. I mean no teenager would ever talk like that. They use it like a replacement for \\"like'\\" in modern times. The book fails to be interesting over the first couple pages as we discover Tibby's past and she does lame action sequences. Then when she denies being a special you just wonder where the hell the book is going. They are waiting for the \\"New Smoke\\" but it is just not exciting or suspensful.That is when I have to admit I just put it down. I couldn't finish the book. I am in college so my time for reading outside of homework is very precious, so I did not waste my time reading this poorly written Tween novel. It's like the author thinks just because they are young they don't know how to spell or use the correct verbs! I would just stay away from this series if I were you unless you like reading books with really bad plots and character development."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I thought this book was \\"totally bubbly bogus\\" I was so sick of these three words that I found the book distracting! I actually started circling the words every time they appeared, (and that's a lot of circles per page!) I felt insulted, teenagers have a much bigger vocabulary!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Pretties continues the story Scott Westerfeld started in Uglies. Set in a dystopic future where everyone gets an operation at age sixteen to make one pretty, teenaged Tally is learning that everything may not be as peaceful as it seems.When last we left Tally, she and her friend Shay had attempted to evade the authorities and protect the secret location of the Smoke, a settlement where people who refuse the surgery could find refuge. Pretties opens with Tally and her buddies getting ready for a party. They are extremely happy and \\"bubbly,\\" all Pretties now, condoning conformity rather than condemning it. How and why did this happen? Readers may be surprised.Readers who cheered for Tally in Uglies will continue to do so in Pretties. She is sharper in this story than in the previous tale. In fact, \\"sharper\\" may be taken literally when she discovers a painful way to reclaim her wits.Tally must decide whether or not to follow through on the promises and bargains she has made. Not every decision is an easy one, and none of friends will make it through this journey unscathed.Trilogies often sag in the middle, producing a second book which is not quite as good as the first and not as important as the last. Such is not the case here. Pretties is more than a mere second step. It is just as fast-paced as Uglies and perhaps even more thought-provoking. It is followed up excellently with Specials, the final book in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This was a great sequel to Uglies! I think that this is a great story, especially the types of things the pretties say. Like \\"bubbly\\" and \\"pretty making\\" and their nicknames. I like how when they are bubbly the lesions dont work. And how Tally had cured herself, and how she gave in to being special at the end so the rest of the New Smokies can be free. And how she had forgotten about her romance with David, and was with Zane and chooses him.I reccomend this book to anyone who liked Uglies."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I loved Pretties. It was a great sequal to Uglies which was also a good book. Pretties was always exciting with not a boring page throughout the whole story.

And during David and Tally's fight i silently screamed no!!!!!!!!!! I didnt like how shay turned out I really hope that she turns from the \\"dark side\\" in the next book. And I loved the ending! I'm still thinking its just not fair. I give this book a five because it kept me on the edge.

I think I may like it even better!!! Tally is finally a pretty and all she cares about is getting in with the Crims, one of the most popular cliques in New Pretty Town. At a costume party, she sees a dark figure from her past. She starts remembering things from before the operation, and with Zane's help, she fights to stay bubbly. There are some new characters as well as some old ones (hint, hint.) She does things never thought possible and pushes her boundaries to the limit. There are some new words that get really annoying, but it doesn't matter because the plot makes up for it. I loved the ending when Shay was talking to her. I can't wait to read \\"Specials\\"!!! Pretties was an awesome book that I would seriously recommend!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Well anyways pretties was incredibly good and very bubbly. I must say its totally bogus everyones insulting of the word because if you think about it the're pretty-minded and and arent very bubbly at all,The word even changes its meaning and such much same way of the word Smurf. It is so totally bubbly.Well i have my insulting of others done and will actually speak of the book. It's a good book over all and near impossible to put down for book addicts such as myself. It shows what its like to be pretty-minded as Tally slowly fights for memories of when she was ugly and her confusion over her prince.In order to attempt to save one she must forsake another. Her real adventures start as she attempts to keep her mind clear while fighting against the brain damage and her new prince has some bad effects from it which are also constly fought.In case you weren't paying attention to the titles the ending was fairly easy to guess but still worked out, especially after a little chat tally has with Doc Cable.Pretties goes more into depth about the society, uglies, pretties, and specials and more dim corners are lit up. Its a good read.I only give it a four because I read too much and know of books that out distance it."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Maybe I am too old for this book, but I enjoyed Uglies, and I enjoy reading YA novels for the most part, I picked this series because it had such high reviews and a lot of people compared it to Hunger Games in their reviews. Let me just say it is NOTHING like the Hunger Games. Like I said I was entertained by Uglies even though I thought the writing was horrible. I figured I could overlook it and get through the rest of the series. I couldn't even finish this book. His use of the word bubbly drove me insane. The language he used for the pretties was just awful \\"pretty-making\\", \\"sad-making\\", etc. I get it, they are supposed to be brain damaged so it's supposed be shallow and juvenile; but I just found it super annoying and lacking of creativity. After a few chapters I couldn't take anymore of it. The story moves at a slow pace and is boring. It's full of nonsense and the writing is even worse than The Uglies. The breaking point for me was when Mr. Westerfield, who I gather is a liberal, tree hugging, hippie, and an atheist, insulted every religious person in the world by refering to God as that \\"invisible superheros in the sky\\". Really??? I had just about had enough of his stupid political ranting coming through the books, calling all of us gas guzzlers stupid, and all, but that one pushed me over my limit. So just be warned it's a pretty left-winged book. How this book has such high reviews is beyond me. I read a lot, and I can honestly say this is the worst book I have ever read. I wasted my money on this one and I never say that."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Grrrowl I was so mad when I got to the end of this book.

Her friendshipe with Shay completely fell apart, and Shay ended up being hte completely mindless one, when in the first book, Shay was the adventurous one with a mind of her own who was all for staying ugly and running away.I was just extremely disappointed in what I thought was going to be an extremely promising book."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"it would be a shame if you read this book before book 1.the uglies series reminds me of the books that came in multiple volumes (long before i began reading.)there are books that are for more literate than the Robert A.

It took me under 12 hours to read it. (Okay, I slept about 12 hours in between, but still)Doesn't that kind of say it all? I have never read a book that fast. Not even Harry Potter and The Deathly Hollows. Okay, it was longer, but still!!It might make you wonder why I only gave it 4/5 stars then. Well - I'm not sure I understand it either really... What kept me going was, of course, the thrilling story line, that was always on edge! But I also think it has something to do with David. I just wanted to meet him again, probably as badly as Tally. And that, even though we didn't really hear her thinking about him that often. If at all, actually...If was nothing like I expected. But that didn't make me like it any less. Not even the language they speak in New Pretty Town, made me annoyed, which I actually thought it would... But it didn't, and I think it's because the whole sci-fi story is so well thought through. You don't ever doubt it. Its amazing.So why did I only give it 4/5 stars? It really doesn't make any sense. I liked the story. I liked the plot. I liked the characters. It only took me twelve hours to read... I really don't understand it... But I didn't feel like giving it 5 stars. Something in my gut - I don't know. Yet when I had to choose betweeen putting it in my \\"favourites\\"-shelf or not, I chose to do it. 'Cause it was exceptional.Maybe when you read this review, I will have changed it to 5 stars. Maybe I just need time to think about it. Or maybe it is just one of those things I can't explain... Anyway - if you've read Uglies, you will want to read Pretties, and I say - GO FOR IT!

It captured my attention and kept it. When I was finished, I immediately downloaded the next installment, Specials. I'd recommend it to everyone. It's the kind of book you can't put down. The author keeps the tension going right up until the end."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Westerfeld manages to do a complete one-eighty with Pretties and throw our characters into such a different world than they had just come from in Uglies. Tally has finally gotten the one thing she always wanted; To be pretty. She goes from living in the woods and growing her own food to living in a mansion, drinking champagne all night, sleeping all day and talking like a complete idiot most of the time. I have to admit I was disappointed at first, and more than a little bit mad at the author for demeaning the characters that way. It felt like such a huge step backwards for our hero, but after my brain got used to this \\"new\\" Tally and Shay, I couldn't help but enjoy them in this form as well. And pick up even more bubbly slang! I wanted to take a long vacation to this world of decadent food (complete with calorie purging tablets), hot-air balloon rides, floating ice rinks, and endless Hollywood-style parties. And it's apparent why Westerfeld went this route. Not only does it let us see inside the Pretties world, it shows us how the surgery completely transforms Tally's brain as well as her body. Well perhaps not completely, but you'll have to read to find out. I would say of the first two books in the series, this one is a touch more adult than the first. There is a lot of teen drinking, implied sexuality and just general recklessness. And he makes all this irresponsibility look so fun and carefree. At least at first. But we do get to glimpse a bit of the grittier side of the Pretty lifestyle as well. Later on there are instances of self-harm, which might be a bit shocking even for older readers. And it's a difficult topic to try to explain to teens. As much as I love the books, I'd put off recommending them to my nephew at this point based on the more adult scenes in the second book. Everything gets very chaotic towards the end and once again Westerfeld leaves us on the edge of a cliff and sets the third book up for another complete reversal with the characters. Specials and Extras, the final two books in this series are cued up on my Nook and lying here on my bed with all the other books currently screaming for my attention and I'm hoping to get to them very soon. In the mean-time Westerfeld has completely succeeded in jumping onto my radar as well as my list of favorite authors for teens.On a related note...I have to say that I fell in love with the covers for these books. So much so, that even in the middle of reading them, I would find myself lost in the covers which include a singular haunting image wrapped from back to front. The boxy 6.9 x 5.1 dimensions, were also fresh and made the books jump off the shelf. The design by Rodrigo Corral is absolutely stunning.Review originally posted on Aurelia."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Once upon a time there was a girl named Tally. She lived an intriguing life of peril and excitement. And then she shows her brave, pretty face. Will Tally turn from ugly to pretty to special?Scott Westerfeld is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. This is the second in the Uglies series and I must admit he's made this futuristic world real for me. When I read his writing it's like I'm literally standing next to Tally as she goes through the events in this novel. Can't wait to start the next book in this series!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"First things first: I liked Pretties more or less the same amount as I liked Uglies. There were plenty of annoying aspects about Pretties, but the story was unique. In fact, I have to admit, the trilogy is really starting to grow on me.Let's start with what I disliked the most about Pretties so we can move on to the good stuff. The lingo. The lingo sucked big time. It reminded me of Neal Bortz when he tries to sound like a valley girl with all the \\"like this\\" and \\"like that\\" \\"like\\" \\"like.\\" Okay... we get it. It's obnoxious. Now can we get OVER it?Same thing with Pretties. Everything was bogus or bubbly or whatever-making, and totally overboard. I don't know if the overuse of the special lingo was purposeful, but the excessiveness of it made it seem like an adult trying to fit in the young crowd but failing miserably.What I enjoyed? I loved that despite being transformed into a Pretty, Tally was still the same person inside -- pretty but still full of insecurities. Instead of the focus being on her outward appearance and being adored, the focus shifted to fitting in. Just like when she was ugly, she still had doubts about being good enough.In a way, it was sad. We had a society which perfected individuals physically... in essence, giving them all they dreamed of having. To help the pretties along, they turned them into the addle-brained, content with having fun. They created an utopian environment, at least it appeared that way to an ugly looking in. Well, even Pretties believed they were living the ultimate life despite their continual strive to be cool. In reality, they had a broken society full of daft people who never had an opportunity to be comfortable with who they were.Though I consider the books middle of the road reads thus far, I still think the trilogy is worthy of attention. Well, I'm working on the last book of the trilogy. It'll be interesting to see how everything resolved itself."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This was by far my favorite of the stories in the Uglies Series with the main character as Tally Youngblood. I loved the conflict of feelings it created in conjunction with Book 1: the Uglies and I felt the story moved at a more compelling pace. I had that feeling of not wanting to put the book down, unlike Book 1 that took off slowly and took more commitment to get through. One of the things I loved, was how Westerfeld portrays the actions and relationships of teenagers, such as Tally and Shay's friendship-one minute everything can be going along just swimmingly and then one small change in perception and you have to reanalyze the whole situation. My other love of this book was the character, Zane. It was his storyline that kept me wondering how everything was going to turn out and the reason I would stay up to 1:30 in the morning reading."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This is a fun romp. Fast moving, with good character development. As the sequel to uglies it brings us further into the world of pretties. We delve further into the under belly of the authorities and more is exposed about the order of this civilisation. Made it's not all as pretty as it looks?Definitely worth a read. Fast moving enough even for the reluctant reader."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This book's greatest strength is its story. Compared with Book 1, this book had a more compelling, more unified plot. (For example, it's much easier to summarize this book's plot than the first book's plot.) And while I wasn't a huge fan of all the developments, the ending (that is, the last page) was more satisfying than the previous book's ending.Westerfeld still doesn't write like Shakespeare, but his plotting strength can overcome other weaknesses.Unfortunately, this book hits a false note. One of its predecessor's main themes is \\"True beauty is internal, not external.\\" But this book's main theme is probably \\"You can save yourself/You can make yourself beautiful.\\" But in reality--in our own Story--pulling yourself up by your bootstraps can't save you; we need Outside Help. Just saying \\"do it yourself\\" ultimately leads to despair, not hope.Westerfeld is certainly gifted, but it's ironic and disappointing how Materialistic this installment of this anti-materialism tale is.(Disclaimer: I haven't read any further books in this series, so I could be wrong about the series' worldview. But this is the impression that I have thus far.)"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I enjoyed this book more than the first. It was a bit more fast paced.

Its alot like \\"the uglies\\" but with different plot twists. And okay, the guy named Zane in this story, she like COMPLETELY described him as Zayn Malik. Of course, One Direction wasn't even a band in 2008. Weirdness. Anyways, it's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"In Uglies, Tally couldn't wait to be Pretty and put her old Ugly life behind her. Now that she finally is, all kinds of niggling doubts keep her from fully embracing her new life - and Zane, the head of her new clique, isn't helping: instead of calming her doubts, he encourages them. Why does Tally feel guilty whenever she talks to Shay? Why can't she really remember anything that happened before she was Pretty? And who is this Ugly who's crashed their party?Like Uglies, Pretties starts in a hurry and keeps up the pace throughout: parties, tricks, and stunts; hoverboarding, hot-air balloons, and helicopters; if it's not one thing, it's something else.Pretties is a good (and fun) story, though maybe not as poignant or powerful as Uglies. There are more tricks and games and less internal struggles, even though the tricks and games are for a greater purpose. Tally is again caught in a web of lies and betrayal, although she doesn't realize it until it's too late.This may be the weakest book in the trilogy, but a weak Scott Westerfeld book is still miles better than the average book off the shelf."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Tally Youngblood is a Pretty. Once an 'Ugly' she was transformed through surgery to be admired, looked upon, but not to think. Her life is filled with mindless parties, dressing up, talking dumb and constantly thinking up the next 'surge' (surgery) that will transform her into the next best thing.But she can't quite give up her earlier life of evading the system and so with the help of another Pretty, Zane, and her former Uglies, she leads an escape from the city to the outskirts. Along the way she risks a lifelong friendship or two, or three, and she discovers just why the Pretties are kept the way they are and how their society evolved after the near destruction of the earth by the Rusties (our car- and machine-driven society).Westerfeld does a good job in relaying the salient points of the first book within 'Pretties'. I wished the explanation of the regime's goals had come a bit sooner (circa page 135); the last half of the book's pacing was quicker than the first half. Westerfield offers interesting themes for young adult readers around the environment, mankind, superficial beauty and friendship.Lisa ArdAuthor of 'Fright Flight, Dream Seekers Book One'"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This is a pretty standard trilogy of a Young adult novel - young girl in a not-so-near post-apocalyptic future, thrust into the middle of a struggle between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\", in love with boy A in first novel, in love with boy B in second, and choosing between the two in the third. That said, I still couldn't put any of the books down until I was done with them. A nice variation on our possible future and a pretty original \\"end of the world\\" scenario.

However he has always been different than the stereotypical Pretty. He does not share the same attitude as them. He is more serious than the Pretties who all seem to share the same \\"blonde\\" mindset. Zane is also the leader of the clique known as the Crims. The Crims are pretties who act like the uglies. They play tricks and get into trouble. These are things that are unheard of in the Pretties community. The Crims goal is to stay bubbly. Bubbly is where they stay on almost an adrenaline rush.Tally Youngblood is a Pretty. Tally has given herself up to the Specials so that she could get the antidote that will cure the lesions in the brains of the Pretties. Tally is introduced to the Crims and later on becomes the female leader of them. Zane and Tally work side by side to stay bubbly and get the antidote.The story of the Pretties is about Tally and Zane defeating the Specials and helping the new smoke rise. Fighting alongside Tally and Zane are most of the Crims, the new smokies and some uglies. Zane and Tally get the antidote. It is two pills, and they each take one. Tally is cured, Zane is also but he has horrible headaches as a side effect. Shay, one of Tally's friends, becomes obsessed with Tally and finds that cutting yourself will also make you bubbly. She gets a lot of followers to start cutting themselves as well. The Crims try to escape from new Pretty Town to get to the New Smokies headquarters. This is not an easy task because the Specials are keeping the new Pretties in, and they are monitoring Tallies every move. While escaping everyone gets separated from each other and Tally gets lost without any gear to help her survival. When she gets to new smoke the doctors tell her that she was never cured by the antidote, she had cured herself somehow. And that Zane had nanobytes eating his brain the pill that she took was supposed to cure that. Zane has now lost his motor skills. The specials arrive because they had a tracking devise in his tooth. Tally refuses to leave Zane so the specials forcibly make her a special.The Pretties kept me up all night reading. I had to work the next day on only an hour of sleep because I could simply not put it down! The book was different than the normal books I like. Futuristic but no aliens or overly science fiction. They talk about us the rusties which I thought was cool. I like how it opened my eyes on how we are destroying the planet, because the rusties almost kill everyone and the earth. The one thing that the book was missing was romance. There was a definite chemistry between Zane and Tally but I wish it would have been more elaborated on. Zane and Tally are going steady but they never get too mushy. They say I love you which are a big deal in the story. I like this because it seems that every relationship that teenagers have means that they are in love, but I wanted nice mushy romance. The other thing that was missing was all the definitions of future technology. It took me awhile to figure out what bubbly was even. I really like the way the book ended. Tally became what she was fighting so hard against, and it leaves you craving the next book.Scott Westerfeld has written three other young adult series.

It's the adventure that keeps you going on to the next chapter and not putting the book down. Tally Youngblood is a smart young girl who has just turned \\"pretty\\". Before she turned pretty she trucked along outside of her city, where she belongs, to find this place called \\"the smoke\\". She was sent by Specials to get her friend Shay back and change her mind about turning pretty, but when she gets there and finds out what it is like to be out of the city she doesn't want to go back, but it's to late, the specials are there and getting rid of the smoke and it's all Tally's fault. But she might be able to stop it. Now Tally is pretty and everything is going okay but she has this feeling that something isn't right, that there is something she was meant to do. And that is saving the New Smoke. Tally goes through many different adventures to stay \\"bubbly\\" and keep the memory about the smoke fresh. Will Tally get away from the city again and save the smoke? Or will the Specials defeat them again?The book Pretties, follows up on Scott Westerfeld's other books Uglies and after Pretties is Specials. Scott has written many wonderful books beside these three.I like this book because even though it's in the future I can relate to Tally, she is outgoing and adventurous and that's what I picture myself as. This book kept me turning pages and going on to the next chapter, who doesn't like a book that does that? I didn't like the ending of the book because it left you hanging, even though there is another book after it I wanted it to be over and know what happens.I would recommend this book to Hanna Wilson because we seem to like the same books, and she has already started Uglies and I know she will like this one too.

I think it is going to be really good."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This is a review on the audio book version of \\"Pretties\\" written by Scott Westerfeld and performed by the great and talented Carine Montbertrand.This book, although disguised in Young Adult clothes, makes you think about serious issues in society today. We all watch the news and stare in horror at all the violence, and wars, and economic downfall. We wish there was a cure for disease, and a way to make everyone satisfied with their lives. We buy books on finding our true selves, and spend millions of dollars on makeup and clothes. We have all seen movies like \\"The Stepford Wives\\" and watched how dangerous it is to try and make everything \\"perfect\\". Most of the time good intentions are plagued with rotten disastrous outcomes. This book takes the \\"what ifs\\" and explores their ramifications.Let's say our government, after looking at the state of the world, comes up with the \\"ultimate\\" plan. They want to eradicate poverty, war, disease, pollution, and unhappiness. They see the divide between the rich and poor, beautiful and ugly, privileged and downtrodden. So why not make everyone equal? It would solve everything! If everyone were pretty, and were able to go to parties and wear what they want and just be on permanent vacation than they wouldn't want to take drugs or murder or act like savages. If the government took care of everything like housing, health, and recreation we would have no worries! If we were told that we were ugly from birth and made to live in drab dorms in an even drabbier town all the while observing from arms length the Pretties who live in luxery have gorgeous faces, and are bubbly 24/7....we would count down till that birthday with baited breath.There are of course, going to be the people who realize that this transformation is wrong. That Ugly isn't Ugly its normal, and the government is so screwed up that they have to escape and live outside the city limits even though it's hard. There are those amongst these outcasts or \\"smokies\\" who once worked for the government and they have realized that the citizens aren't being transformed into just the beautiful people; they have been given serious brain lesions to keep them good little automatons forever. But they have a Cure, and someone has to test it.This is where Tally Youngblood comes in. In the first book she is so desperate to become pretty that she agrees to betray the Smokies, but soon falls in love with one of them and is told about the lesions. After the government's most deadly agents, the Specials, find the smokies anyway Tally has a decision to make. Stay with the Smokies, or make the sacrifice to become pretty and test the cure. The difficulty is that once Tally is Pretty, she will be Pretty-minded, which basically means Air headed. She won't want to be anything but \\"bubbly\\" as they put it. She belongs to a clique of pretties called the \\"Crims\\" because they play serious tricks, and since Tally once ran away to the smokies she is prime Crim material. Tally is friends again with Shay, who she betrayed in the first book but neither remember that taking place, she also finds a new boyfriend Zane. She and Zane soon realize that deep inside something is different about them and the Crims. They not only play tricks, they are fascinated by the Smokies, and when Tally's promise to test the cure comes back to her, Zane is right beside her to test it.In \\"Pretties\\" we get to experience Tally and Zane and the Crims struggle to overcome their \\"pretty-mindedness\\" constantly risking their lives, risking the Specials catching them. Tally has to again choose between Shay and a boyfriend. And Shay starts to follow her own path towards change. The cure works, but something is deadly wrong with Zane and Tally will do anything to save him. I wont give away the ending, but again I zipped out and got the third book because I couldn't wait to find out what happens. I listened to this book, read by Carine Montbertrand, and I cannot recommend it enough. She puts voices to these characters so amazing well and Scott Westerfeld has once again written a book that appeals to all my senses."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"When I first read the series i was amazed!

Anyways, Zane and Tally get some of the other Crims to run away with them, because Zane is getting headaches from the pill.In the end, Tally is discovered with Zane and they force him to become Pretty again and she is forced to become a Special.I like this book better than the other because I can sort of get a clue of what happens, but it isn't oh so obvious.

Fearful of war and violence cities now operate as independent states (think Renaissance Italy as opposed to contemporary Italy). Isolated and self-sufficient, the cities have agreed to certain standards for the greater good.\\"New technology ensures that citizens never want for food or luxury items, weapons of any kind are largely illegal, and at the age of sixteen everyone undergoes a series of extreme surgeries to better conform to societal standards of beauty. The logic being that, since humans are preconditioned to respond to certain visual cues in each other already (big eyes are non-threatening, a clear complexion and good teeth indicate that a person is healthy), applying these beauty standards will reduce conflict and create a more harmonious society.\\"But in a world where everyone is movie-star-gorgeous (oldies like Rudolph Valentino and Greta Garbo are considered \\"natural pretties\\"), normal people are so not pretty. In short, they're ugly.\\"At the end of the first book, our heroine Tally Youngblood also learns that normal people are smarter than the Pretties. As part of the government's plan to keep the population in line, Pretties' brains are surgically altered with lesions to make Pretties more complacent. The government's logic can be summed up in four dangerous words: for the greater good.At the end of Uglies, knowing now that the operation has to be stopped, Tally makes the ultimate sacrifice--she allows herself to undergo the Operation in order to become an undercover operative of sorts. The only problem is that, because of the Operation, she forgets everything she learned about the Operation, the government, and perhaps most importantly about Special Circumstances (Westerfeld's interpretation of secret service/black ops types).In other words, Tally starts Pretties with a basically clean slate. She and best friend Shay know that they lived with the resistance group known as The Smoke, but little else. Looking for something \\"bubbly\\" to do as Pretties, the girls decide to join the Crims--a clique known for pulling dramatic stunts in order to stay bubbly and consequently think a little more clearly than Pretties usually do. As Tally becomes more involved with the Crims and their leader, Zane, pieces of Tally's past begin to fall into place. But, the more Tally learns about her past, the more confusing things become as she has to decide between her past and her present.Of the trilogy, this one is my least favorite. The characters, being Pretties, seemed the most unreal. Although Westerfeld evoked a very realistic world in Uglies it all rings a little less true here. I love how much slang these novels use and how easy it is to follow, but that too got to be a bit much.The novel ends on a dramatic note, Tally once again rallying against those who would maintain the status quo. But at the same time, like in Uglies, she is once again a victim of circumstances. So, although the ending is great, it's also a bit too familiar. Since Pretties is part of a trilogy, it is a must-read to see what happens to Tally. But, in this reviewer's opinion, the second installment in the trilogy doesn't quite live up to the hype created by the first."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I'm more of a person interested in good stories. I love Star Wars, Harry Potter, Narnia, etc...This book and the others that are in the Trilogy fit right into that genra for me. Good read! And, great purchase!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Before I started reading this book, I thought I'd be disappointed, because a friend had said she didn't like the other ones as much as the first book, Uglies. It started out OK because Tally changed completely as a pretty because of the leisures. Then things changed again and it got very exciting. She went through new adventures, some quite scary, and made new companions such as the very important, Zane. The action in these books are great! There were, however, some boring moments for me when she was having trouble with something, but that's just because I liked reading about when she was with her friends.I won't say much more because I actually can't stand hearing people's thoughts on a book before, or while I'm reading it. Maybe not even after. And I don't want to spoil the suspense-filled story for anyone.I suggest any type of person to buy these series. I am not a big fan of scientific theories and such, but these books are just eye-catching; you just can't let go of the book once you get into the story! They have a lot to do with just, life itself. I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to reading the other two, Specials and Extras, but until then, I need a break from reading!^-^"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"The further adventures of Tally Youngblood, this book is the slowest from the trilogy and my least favorite. BUT it still delivers in action and the adventure. It is more of a social analysis of the pretties and the uglies and the way they live their lives. It deals with enslavement and true freedom. This book is still good, but is the slowest of the series."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"\\"Pretties\\" is the sequel to\\"Uglies\\", and picks up right where \\"Uglies\\" left off. Tally, our main character, has turned sixteen, been forcibly returned to her city, and undergone the surgery to turn pretty. Along with Shay and her childhood best friend Peris, she joins a clique known as the Crims. The Crims is led by a boy from Shay's past named Zane. Although Tally knows the terrible secret of the pretty surgery, she isn't able to keep it at bay, and behaves like every other pretty: drinking champagne, going to parties, worrying only about what to wear.Until the night that she is to be inducted into the Crims, that is. Her past catches up with her and reminds her both of her promise to them to test the cure and to try to return to the Smoke. She and Zane each take one of the two pills that constitute the cure. Zane reveals his past, and that he has come up with his own ways to avoid the usual pretty fog that is brought about by the surgery: lots of coffee and very little food. Together, they and the Crims work to let the residents of the Smoke know that Tally is cured. Meanwhile, Zane is experiencing ever-worse headaches. Zane, Tally, and the rest of the Crims flee from the city, with Special Circumstances in hot pursuit.In their flight, Tally is thrown off-course and ends up being far away from the meeting point. As a result, she discovers another secret of her city: there are more people outside the city than she realised, and these ones are being kept there for social experimentation. She finally makes it back to the meeting point, to discover that Zane is very ill and that he has unknowingly had a tracking device placed in his body by Special Circumstances. She and Zane send the Smokies off running, and stay there to face the music and get Zane the needed medical treatment. There, Tally learns that Shay has become a Special, and is going to make Tally into one too. The book ends with the start of Tally's surgery to transform into a Special.As with\\"Uglies\\", I finished it in a day. Westerfeld tells a great story, one that grabs hold and doesn't let go until the end. Now it's off to read the last book in the trilogy,\\"Specials\\", to see how it all wraps up."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"It's most unfortunate I read this book *after* I read the other three books in the series. (This book wasn't available in my library until recently.) I found this book to have a much stronger storyline than most of the other books, as well as the most enriching and growing characterization, particularly for Shay. I felt she grew much more in this book than in the third one. Also, the intensity of the relationship between Zane and Tally was a strong point and was a nice conflicting point when they met David/Tally remembered about David."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This is the second book in the Uglies trilogy by Scott Westerfield. This book was much better than the first novel of the series but still feel a little flat for me.At the beginning of this book we meet Tally (who has been turned into a Pretty) and Shay getting ready for a costume party. At the party Tally has a strange encounter with someone dressed like Special Circumstances. Tally is trying to get accepted into a group of Pretties called the Crims. Who, as their name suggests, all committed \\"criminal\\" acts as Uglies. Zane, the leader of the Crims, suspects that more is just changed during the Pretty operation than their faces. Zane and the other Crims make it a goal to pull off daring stunts in order to \\"stay bubbly\\" and be able to see through the Pretty induced mental haze.This was a much faster paced novel than the previous one. It was very interesting how different Tally's personality was as a Pretty and how she fought internally with the Prettiness. Zane is an interesting character and a good addition to the series. It was fun to read about the exploits of the Crims. In general this was a decent book; full of action and interesting personality changes.That being said, for me, there was still something a little off about this book. I wasn't that attached to the characters and the action scenes didn't really come alive for me. I am not sure what it is but there is something that stops this novel from becoming wonderful; I think it may be that the writing style is a bit unpolished and simplistic for me. I also think that the author is still dumbing down things too much for his audience.I will definitely read the next book because this book ends on a bit of a cliffhanger much like the first one.www.karissabooks.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Finally, a sequel that does not disappoint!Tally finally has all she ever wanted: She's pretty, she's popular, she's in the coolest clique in New Pretty Town.

All of a sudden Tally and her new friend Zane not only have a mystery to solve, but two tiny white pills to take...and no clue what they will do to them.Once again Westerfeld has whisked us off to a sci-fi adventure world with more twists and turns that even a Hoverboard can handle.

Scott Westerfeld is such a great author and he really makes all his books shine, you can imagine what the characters look like and the setting is clearly described and that's a reason he's such a great author. But anyway this is a great book about Tally Youngblood being pretty and...well I won't say the rest."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This was a good book. After the cliff-hanger ending in Uglies, I especially wanted to see what would happen. However, I was somewhat disappointed.The plot is not quite as tight and well-planned, and I thought it was somewhat less creative than Uglies. It became just a little predictable, and I quickly tired of the romantic relationship between Tally and Zane. It just seemed like they rushed into the relationship, and seemed like an unlikely match anyway.That said, I am still a fan of this trilogy, and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes teen fiction and the culture-obsessed-with beauty thing. I am very happy that we still have Specials to look forward too."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"While I enjoyed Uglies more, Pretties is fantastic. An easy, enjoyable read I got it and read it before bed. I can't wait for Specials!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This was an interesting second installment of the Uglies series. I loved Uglies and Pretties has a very different feel, taking place mostly in New Pretty with lots of \\"bubbly\\" language and mindless parties.Tally has sacrificed herself and has become pretty so that they will have a test subject for their cure to the brain lesions. We get to know Shay better and are introduced to Zane, Tally's new love interest. I liked Zane and the way he tried so hard to keep his brain from going pretty.Tally's character was good, though some of her indecisiveness drives me crazy, but it's probably supposed to because her ugly brain is at odds with her pretty brain.I liked the development of the brain science and the idea of the lesions. And, again, the social commentary on the idea of pretty and ugly is terrific. Then there is the great twist at the end of the book. I love that kind of thing.However, this book had the feel of a transition book for me. There was a lot of action and movement, but somehow, it still left me wanting something else. Hopefully, I'll find it in Specials. Maybe it's because I found the world in Uglies so much more interesting than the world in Pretties. Overall, though, it was worth the read and I'm anxious to get onto the next book."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Read this a the recommendation of a friend.

I liked all of the action though."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Pretties was an ok book. I was expecting a little more action than a drag on how Zane ad Tally try to figure on how to meet the people from the smoke. I was VERY sick of the word bubbly. It was repetitive and annoying. Bubbly also determines too many meanings. It could mean that you are very grateful to you feeling a buzz. I was always confused on what bubbly actually meant. The story did pick up in the middle, but Tally's personality bugger me as it did in Uglies. Action was added more towards the end and there were a few things that you would have not expected. It was just an ok book. I enjoyed it, but I felt like Tally was a hypocrite in some parts. Like when she starts starving herself even though she thought the disease was dreadful. Honestly, since the author decided to have Tally starve, it should have been more focused on. Like if she faints or any side effect. Even if you are a pretty. I will read Specials anticipating that it will better. Also because I am curious what Extras are in the fourth one since they have not mentioned that. I do recomend people to read it, but expect that you will probably get bored in some parts."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"My daughter (who is 12) read this series and recommended it to me. She and I share a love of fantasy / sf novels, and we often trade books back and forth.I thought this series would be a bit juvenile, and yes, it is definitely targeted for teens. However, it is also well written and entertaining, with some fascinating concepts centered around a dystopian-but-hopeful future society. If you are a fan of light science fiction, dystopian fiction, or &#34;futures imperfect&#34; type stories, you will enjoy it I think. It's a quick read and a real page-turner.This is the second book in the series, and was my favorite of the four.

I thought the original plot was inventive and imagination even though Westerfeld couldn't deliver on the writing. It doesn't get much better with Pretties.Some things did improve. I thought there was a lot more action in the first half of Pretties. In Uglies, nothing happens for half the book until Tally runs away. Westerfeld was able to rely on all the new things that would be in Tally's world after becoming pretty, and what that world was like. The Smoke plotline also makes its appearance much earlier, which was smart.The secondary and tertiary characters are also given more personality. Shay is better developed this time around (and probably the only redeemable main character) and newcomer Zane is more fleshed out than David had been - his motivations and romance with Tally make much more sense than David's did.I also liked that Westerfeld seemed more comfortable in his universe. I'm not sure whether it was intentional or not (it would have been pretty clever if it was), but I liked how everyone is meant to be turned into beautiful ideals that everyone wants to be, but while reading I only got the impression that the people, their looks and their world, was all nightmarish and distorted. Instead of feeling like I was in a fantasy world full of beautiful people, I felt like they were monsters, inhuman even, frightening, wrong. I didn't like, though, that there is never a description of what new pretty Tally looks like, so even though there is lip service paid to her being beautiful mostly my mental image of her stayed ugly. He spent so much time in the last book describing Tally's looks and what made her ugly and didn't make a single description of what she now looked like and how she was beautiful. Maybe that was intentional, but since Westerfeld doesn't strike me as particularly shrewd through his writing, I doubt it.Despite these improvements, the writing was still just too unavoidably problematic. Westerfeld still has a problem with vagueness, leaving everything feeling foggy. He still spends unnecessary detail on minute processes like hoverboarding - the whole thing with burning off the cuffs could not have lasted longer. The world still doesn't feel fully formed, with flexible rules that make the laws of the universe seem cheap. You can't decide on a whim what is and isn't possible - that's too easy and lazy.It was also really, really unfortunate that the word \\"bubbly\\" appeared so many times. I get that it was a \\"thing\\" to go along with the whole pretty universe, but, synonyms exist for a reason even if you are trying to get across some new, made up concept. Pretty-making and nervous-making and spinning and brain-missing - none of these things worked, the effort wasn't that high for constructing his \\"pretty language.\\" I could say that the all-encompassing, inclusive nature of the terms they used (turning complicated concepts or feelings into simplified offhand by sticking a -making or -missing on the end of it) was supposed to be indicative of how simple-minded you become when you are pretty and brain damaged, but again, the overall quality of Westerfeld's writing makes me hesitant to give him credit for that. It really does just seem like he couldn't come up with anything better, even if that was what he was trying to convey.I also don't understand why, in a world allegedly centuries into the future, for some reason mankind regresses to tribal primitivism. Why are short cavemen in this unidentified area of forest that is for some reason near the island where it was totally never indicated that that's where this story was taking place? Suddenly they're on an island? How does that even work? What island is near a city that used to have a population of hundreds of millions? It's like he didn't even try. I guess he figured well kids are stupid they'll never know the difference. He didn't even try to use any sort of geographical accuracy. They might as well be on a different planet to be honest (but we know they aren't, since the previous book referenced the Mojave desert).And speaking of which, while, in general, I mostly agree with Westerfeld's politics - environmentalism, pacifism, atheism etc - I could definitely see how it would be insulting and condescending to those who don't. He so matter of factly calls gods old-timey \\"superheroes in the sky.\\" That's gotta be pretty unnecessarily jarring for a 12 year old who believes in god to see, just thrown out there like that.Anyway, by the time I got to the part of the story where the random cavemen think this beautifully crafted young girl is a real God and treat her with deferential reverence, I just hung it up. What, exactly, are you trying to say here, dude? I don't think he even knows.This series was maybe just a ploy to create popular books rather than tell a story he really cared about. Because if he had, he could have taken a great idea (and the ideas behind these books are pretty good) and crafted something really good to go with it. Or maybe he did and he just doesn't have the writing chops to pull it off. In either case, this book just left me with the impression that he wasn't smart enough."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Pretties continue the story where Uglies finished. In the second book to the trilogy- Tally has become a pretty. Finally she can spend time with her good friends Peri and Shay in New Pretty Town. Life for Tally couldn't be better. She is popular, she has a boyfriend and she goes to parties every day. She is also totally criminal. But Tally's perfect life cracks when she finds out a dark secret, and when the dark past tumbles over her.This is a good book to the trilogy and I found it a good read, interesting and funny. I really came close to Tally and I liked the whole Pretty setting. I really enjoyed Uglies and Pretties was pretty good too. I enjoyed the colourful language and the whole aspect of New Pretty Town. It is definitely worthy of this amazing, original trilogy."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I am amused by two things:a) That so many readers are frustrated by the excessive usage of the term 'bubbly,' myself included, and thatb) Scott Westerfeld has managed to produce a decent sequel to Uglies.I am not insinuating that Westerfeld is not capable of writing an appropriate sequel to the well-received Uglies, but generalizing that most sequels are just really not up to par with their predecessors. Congrats/props/kudos.Pretties, I feel, was a bit rushed, however. The plot seems like it was squashed into it's complexity, simply to equal or avenge the first book's. Pretties doesn't delve into detail as expertly as Uglies has.All in all, the books are highly enjoyable. I find Westerfeld's conception of the fantasy world particularly appealing in the books. It is well thought-out with great imagery. I recommend the series for leisure, in an intellectual, involved sort of way."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"It only took me three hours to read this.

Be forewarned there are some errors that I would assume are probably (hopefully) just in the Kindle version (as of May 2010). They don't make it totally unreadable, but they are a bit annoying.

Or \\"I'm scared\\" being \\"Fm scared\\". Silly things that could have been found if the editor had simply skimmed the Kindle / eBook edition even once. 2/5 to the editor.Okay, that said, onto the content. It is nowhere near as good as the first book in the series:Uglies. Probably because we're now focusing on the lives of pretties. The language has changed. Some new characters have been added. Everything is so \\"Bubbly\\" to the point you'll be sick of the word \\"bubbly\\" by the end of the book. Still it is good. Not great, but good. We follow Tally as she's already been made Pretty. Will David come back for her with a cure in hand? Will she really want it if he does? That's what this book is all about. Picking up right where Uglies left off, seeing just how much prettydom has changed Tally. Can it be undone? Is there a cure? If so is there a price?

Tally Youngblood is your average pretty, going to parties, getting drunk, and not thinking more ahead than the next form of entertainment. See, in Tally's town when you turn sixteen you receive an operation that turns you from an ugly(normal person) to a mindless pretty. While Tally was still an Ugly, she was at a rebel camp called New Smoke that had figured out the operation ad was trying to spread the word about brain lesions you develop after the pretty cosmetic surgery. Tally volunteered herself to try the pills that the New Smoke made to see if they got rid of the lesions, but after she became pretty, she forgot everything about her life as an ugly and the pills. So when the random boy comes up to Tally and gives her the note she wrote giving permission to take the pills, she is bewildered. With her boyfriend Zane, she goes to take the pills, but splits them with him so that they each get one. Slowly things start to become clearer and clearer to them, but Zane starts getting huge headaches and Special Circumstances Doctor Cable is on their trail to find out about the pills. Suddenly Shay, Tally's best friend, stops talking to Tally and is found cutting herself on the arm with a group of friends. When Zane's headaches get so bad that he can barely get out of bed, Tally plans a hot air balloon escape to find the New Smoke to cure him. When they reach the New Smoke doctor, she says that Zane took the pill that eats away the lesions and your brain, and Tally took the pill that gets rid of the things that eat away the lesions, so Zane has had things eating away at his brain for a month or two, and Tally has had nothing happen to her brain. On their way back, their hot air balloon is overtaken by Special Circumstances hoverboards flown by the Cutters, a new brand of Specials led by none other than Shay, who takes Tally to Doctor Cable where she too becomes a Cutter. This is a swift and exiting read that has a predictable but exiting plot and a futuristic setting.This book is well written. The author doesn't linger on topics such as the pills for more than a few pages and the story is never boring. There are always new topics in this book that gain importance. When Zane has an attack as Tally and him were spying on Shay, Tally flies him to the Emergency Ward, but not before he hits a tree a breaks his hand in three places, taking a dreadful half hour to repair. After Zane is out of the Hospital, they find a way to remove the bracelets around their wrists that record everything that they say for Doctor Cable by heating them to 2,000 degrees (while wearing gloves) and slipping the bracelets off.The plot to this book can get a little too predictable at times. At the beginning of the book when Tally starts covering her bracelet with layers of cloth to mute her voice, you can tell that sooner or later she will get it removed. I already knew that Tally was going to become Special in the beginning of the book from the way Special Circumstances was mentioned, When Tally escapes the city for a trip to New Smoke, she finds a city of giants that say she talks in the language of the gods that bring food, who just happen to be Specials also.This book is Science Fiction. Nearly the entire human race had been wiped out when there was no more trees to burn for electricity, so Tally's city is run on magnets, and there is a magnetic grid under the city for hoverboards. Tally's city is divided into two parts by a river: the ugly side and the pretty side. New medicine techniques use nanos to sew things together and form new bones.This book is a wonderful sequel, but I would advise reading Uglies before Pretties so that it isn't as confusing.

(eyeroll)The pacing is slow, the characters are shallow, the females are weak, the plot of the first book is recycled for the second, the \\"resolutions\\" are nonsensical (SPOILER: She cures herself? Really? END SPOILER), and the preaching just becomes noise. Westerfeld does all he can to paint the past as evil, and even those who continue to reside outside of the society are painted as horrific savages without a drop of sense. Yet I'm assuming I'm also supposed to think a group of people operating on teenagers' brains to make them vapid is evil, so who am I sympathizing with? I'll choose the savages because at least their vocabulary consisted of more than three words.The pros? The amount of time spent describing hoverboarding is down?

One of the best by Scott Westerfled."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Pretties' contains an intriguing plot, creative style and interesting characters. The tapestry of this story is woven in such a way that my view of the story and its characters changes with the characters themselves. Typically I prefer the characters I read to develop and then mature, which Tally does, but she is constantly shifting, and I find that my wants for the series shift with her. At the conclusion of Uglies, I was devastated that Tally was leaving David and the Smoke in order to turn pretty and test the cure. I wanted nothing more than to have Tally take the cure and go back to him. But as Tally fights her Pretty-headedness, she falls in love with Zane, and so did I. Now I find myself wanting nothing more than for Tally and Zane to end up with one another. Never have I encountered an author who can change their characters so drastically and yet so seamlessly. Even more compelling is the intricacy of the plot. In a world filled with Pretties, no one is, and in an effort to fight the pretty haze, individuals are starving and cutting themselves just to feel something real. Not very pretty like, but intriguing none the less"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Just like \\"Uglies,\\" \\"Pretties\\" is an entertaining read. Tally's adventures continue as she becomes pretty and fights to regain her awareness. We meet some new characters, including Tally's new love interest. The story moves fast and gets more intense in the third part of the book. Like many mentioned before, the \\"pretty talk\\" gets annoying. There is only so many times you can take the word \\"bubbly\\" repeated. But I guess the author was trying to create a \\"pretty language\\" indicative of the slow pretty thinking...Having said that, this series, though entertaining, still lacks something for me. I think this \\"something\\" is emotional depth and intensity of feeling. There are some other authors (Suzanne Collins and Neal Shusterman, for example) who can convey emotions much better than Westerfeld, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I actually ended up staying up late to finish this book because I could not wait to see what happened. I really liked Zane's character and I couldn't wait to see what happens between Shay and Tally in case she ever realizes what Tally cost her by accidentally betraying the Smokies. Of course this one had to leave you at a cliffhanger and wanting to read the final book, Specials, as soon as possible. What will happen between Zane, David, Shay and Tally?One thing I have to say is I'll be glad never to have to hear about someone feeling \\"bubbly\\" again. That was really starting to get on my nerves."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I read the Uglies trilogy after months of urging by my middle-school-aged son, yes, son, and I am glad that I listened to him.As you probably know from the other reviews and editorial blurbs, Pretties is about Tally Youngblood and associates, who live in a post-apocalyptic America, in a society where the various stages of life are clearly demarcated both geographically and surgically. Society gets around \\"looksism,\\" for example, by surgically rendering everyone \\"pretty\\" at age 16 -- later in life they have additional surgery to become a \\"late pretty\\" and apparently get a job and perhaps a family.Anyway, there is a dark side to \\"pretty,\\" of course, and our heroine and her friends continue to fight the status quo, getting in deeper and deeper.What I was most impressed by in these books is the author's handling of various mental states -- how our mental states affect us, and how we affect our mental states. How do we judge others? How do we judge ourselves? What changes us? One reviewer said that Tally wrestles with her demons, and I think that that is a very accurate description of the entire series, really.Pretties is a consistent continuation from Uglies, and is full of surprises as well as sort of predictable events. I think it's some of the best YA speculative fiction that I've read in decades."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"In a world that finds Paris Hilton to be an interesting person, Britany Spears to be a musical talent and Lauren Conrad to be worthy of an hour a week of attention, Pretties carries an important message.

I like the fact that the word beautiful is reserved for only the most beautiful things.

I would recommend it to anyone. But always read the first book firs or this book would not make that much sense."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This book took me by surprise! I assumed that since Tally was turned into a \\"pretty-head\\" the book would be off track and boring, but man was I wrong. Scott Westerfeld did it again! He worked just enough emotion, action, romance, and intrigue to make this second book in the series just as great at the first. Although, there were some things that frustrated me the book as a whole was amazing!Tally is one of my frustrations! I like her character, yet I hate her character. Tally is quite gullible and keeps running into these traps. She just seems full of it to me. Her thought process can leave you quite annoyed sometimes. I feel like I cannot relate to her on as many levels as I would have liked. On the other hand, she is a good person at heart. She cares about her friends and even people she just meets. Tally is a fighter, which is another reason I actually like her character. She does not back down easily.The romance in this book is another thing that has thrown me off. I know that we do not always end up with our first loves, but Tally has really screwed up in this one. She now has two guys that she \\"loves\\". At first I went along with it thinking \\"Oh ok, she lost her memory when she became a pretty it's cool\\", until she remembered everything and still chose to choose another guy, Zane. I would not have been so annoyed with this information had I felt that David and her separated rationally. There are places in the book that make you feel like maybe she does not want him anymore because he is so \\"unattractive\\".The twists in this book just keep getting better and better. Tally has made friends with a new \\"camp\\", and she experiences how their life is manipulated from day to day. She also finds out what happens when you take matters into your own hands and make irrational decisions (more than once let me add). The main twists are what had me on the edge of my seat. I was absolutely shocked with the ending!With that being said, the ending was amazing! It is a perfect place to pick up from on the next book. I am eager to find out what happens to Zane, Shay, Tally, and David. ******SPOILER SO PLEASE SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH********* After finding out that Shay has become a special, I have no clue how Tally will manage to save the day now. Not to mention that Zane has had half his brain destroyed. How will they possibly fix him? And how will Tally make their love last?I have become neutral with Shay's character in this book. At first I liked her because she wanted to be different, but now I feel that she has jumped off the deep end. I understand that she has had her mind messed with and she cannot quite put her finger on the \\"weird feelings\\" bothering her, but she has become a total monster. I am kind of sad about this because I really wanted to like her character. I feel bad for her and I want her to be the hero at the end of the day, but I also wonder what this story would become if she were to miraculously see the light of day. This has left me with a feeling of \\"whatever\\" on how her character turns out in the end.The story has become a little confusing at this point. (move to next paragraph to skip this spoiler)*****SPOILER***** In this book, you find out there is another civilization living under the control of Special Circumstances and \\"The Pretties\\". There is a slight amount of information that explains why they keep them trapped in their environment, but I found myself wanting a little more. We find out that they are the reason for the lesions in the brain. Their civilization has been in a blood feud for years, and for no apparent reason as far as we know. The lesions keep the pretties from conflict and anger. I get the fact that studying them helps progress their research, but where did they find these people and how long has this been going on. Why does no one really know about them?All in all, I really enjoyed this book. It has some pretty interesting concepts on what the future could hold. The characters may need some improvement, but I still have a couple I route for. I am eager to read the next book in this series to see where Westerfeld goes with this story. I would strongly recommend this read to anyone.

She and Zane risk their lives to join up with David only to find out that the Specials have a whole new way to find them. Tally once again betrays and is betrayed. I'm enjoying this series.

This legend combines plastic surgery, superhumans, and a few drops of love to keep you turning pages until the end.Tally Youngblood has gone from ugly to pretty, in an operation that changes more than her looks. The surgery also gives Pretties brain lesions, which causes them to forget their past and exclude negative emotions for a fun-filled atmosphere. Tally's life is all play until someone from her past returns. In a place called The Smoke, Uglies who know about the lesions are trying to create a life in the wilderness. It was destroyed by Tally's perfidy in Uglies, but is now rebuilt. Tally and her boyfriend, Zane, recieve pills from The New Smoke to cure their lesions. Now, Tally must decide whether to stay mindless or take a risk she might not want to take, bringing up old memories she might not want to have again. In a time where anyone normal is ugly and anyone pretty is braindamaged, Tally's out breaking all the rules... again.Scott Westerfeld's style of writing is a paragon of perfect wording. He gives Tally's thoughts and feelings subtly in third person and uses only as much detail as needed to give off the desired effect. Westerfeld's word choice is refreshing and precise, as well.I rated this book a four out of five because I enjoyed Westerfeld's style of writing and I thought the plot was creative and well-planned. The problem was it seemed rushed, like there wasn't time before another big event of the panoply occured. I also read Uglies and in comparison, I think Pretties was just as good, even though it moved faster. I can't wait to read Specials, the third book of the trilogy."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"\\"Remember that the most beautiful things in life are the most useless.\\" -John Ruskin. (Pg. 1)Of all of the things that I imagined for this book, it turned out to be nothing like I thought. Scott Westerfeld's Pretties is the amazingly suspenseful sequel in the Tally Youngblood series. Tally moves up to New Pretty Town only to face a whole new set of challenges. Things like, parties, cliques, and trying to fit in. When Tally meets Zane you can automatically tell that they will go through a lot together. After taking the pills, the days zoom by, one leading right into the next. Scott Westerfeld describes all of the places Tally visits in her journey to the New Smoke in great detail. He writes to make you feel like you know the characters, and have actually been traveling with them.I don't normally like futuristic books but Uglies and Pretties were really great. I liked that it wasn't repetitive and something new was always happening. The things I didn't like were all of her dreams about the ugly and pretty princes. This book is probably best suited for girls who like dramatic, future-set books. Overall this book may have changed my opinion about futuristic books, like this series."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Getting dressed used to be the hardest part of Tally's day, but then she gottangled up with her true self, two pills, and Zane. Pretties by Scott Westerfeldwas the second book in the Uglies trilogy and it was about Tally Youngblood'sjourney. Finally Tally got the \\"operation\\" that turned her \\"pretty,\\" so she goesto live in New Pretty Town at age sixteen. Once in the Crims, a clique, Tallymeets Zane who make her feel quite \\"bubbly\\" until one party when Tally seesfamiliar faces: residents of the forbidden city Smoke, who gave Tally a letterfrom herself (when she was \\"ugly\\") telling her to take two pills, which theSmokies also gave her. She was afraid, though, to take the pills so she took oneand Zane took one. Then after many parties and tricks, such as breaking thehover ice skating rink, Tally and the Crims decided to escape to the New Smoke,but Tally got lost in an unknown place outside of the city. While there, Tallymet uncivilized humans, stole a hover car, and so she eventually made it to theNew Smoke. Upon arriving, though, there was chaos because the Specials, orpolice, were coming to destroy everything. Tally refused to try to escape,though, because Zane couldn't go, so they were both captured. I liked this bookand it made read the sequel, but it wasn't as good as the first book.\\"She had to get out of this balloon now. Then Tally saw the river. And,clutching her hover board, she threw herself into the void.\\" Scenes like thatone happened over and over again in Pretties, each new surprise or action filledchapter made this book an awesome page turner. When Tally jumped from theballoon or fell through a hovering ice skating ring, the reader was constantlyon the edge of the seat. Also when Zane was about to crush his hand to get histracking cuff off, there was a lot of tension and the reader got very nervousfor Zane. I liked this book because it was action packed and exciting.Another reason that I like this novel was because it was a very descriptive andincluded a lot of figurative language. For example, when describing what thecrusher looked like when it was turned on the author wrote, \\"... as if the metalhad suddenly become liquid and alive.\\" Because this novel was set in the future,the author used descriptions that a modern person could understand. One exampleof this was when Tally was staying with the uncivilized people living outsidethe city and a hover car landed in the forest. The hover car was described as \\"...a noisy was to travel, the wind roiling the trees like a storm.\\" Those types ofsimiles helped me to understand the futuristic terms.To keep the book or old characters form getting boring, the author added newcharacters such as Zane, Fausto, and Andrew Simpson Smith. Zane was a mainperson in Tally's life, especially after they took the pills. He was brave,curious, and open, mostly to Tally, who he loved. Fausto was a Crimp with Tallyand Zane, coming with them to the Crusher and escaping to the New Smoke, he wasclever, caring, and daring. Andrew Simpson Smith was the holy man of theuncivilized tribe of humans. He was friendly, helpful, and generous in helpingTally understand his tribe and then in getting to the New Smoke. Thesecharacters added something interesting and exciting to the novel.In conclusion I really liked this book because it was exciting and descriptivewith new characters. The reason that the first book in the trilogy was better,though, was because of the ending to Pretties. In the end Tally called herprevious boyfriend, David, ugly and screamed at him to leave. Then she stayedwith Zane (because he couldn't move) so they were both captured by the Specialsand Tally became one of them. Even though the end was upsetting, I woulddefinitely recommend Pretties to anyone ages 12 and up.-C. Chaudhury"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I liked this book a lot!

While I didn't find Pretties as 'on the edge of my seat' exciting, I still loved it! The one thing I really liked is that I'm already a part of this world of Tally's so I'm familiar with the people and what's going on. It felt like getting together with old friends on their next adventure. Just as a note this review will contain spoilers from the first book so if you're planning on reading the series, you may not want to go any further.In Pretties, Tally is now a pretty. She's beautiful and has everything she could want now except of course the ability to think on her own anymore. She's heading to the parties and drinking all night, only to be hung over the whole next day and then start over. This is the life of a new pretty. Tally's only concern right now is to make it into the Crim clique - even in the world of Pretties, there are still the 'in' groups in which to belong. All of her old friends - Shay and Peris- belong to the this group along with an intriguing boy named Zane, who is the leader. Of course Tally makes it into this desired group and not only that she seems to attract the attention of Zane.However Tally keeps having these nagging thoughts about what she assumes is her past but they are a jumble. This is where she and Zane really connect. Zane explains things to Tally, how you can stay bubbly to keep your mind alert instead of in a fog. When bubbly, things appear a lot more clear to Tally. In the meantime, someone from her past shows up and leaves her the pills to make her normal again along with the letter she wrote herself back in Uglies. Tally is terrified to take the pills - there is two of them - Zane is with her when she finds them. Yes, you guessed it; they each take one. Now the question is, was this a really good idea to take these pills or not?The second half of the book really picks up and kept me on the edge of my seat again while I was very busy rooting for Tally and Zane to become normal again. Together they make a great couple and I enjoyed them together much more than Tally and David. Zane just seems to be the other half of Tally for some reason. Again I loved Tally. She is still my favorite character in this series. However do things ever really go smoothly where Tally is concerned? It seems she can't escape the pretty world no matter how hard she tries.Once again I was left hanging at the end of the book wanting more! Thankfully I had Specials ready and waiting and have, of course, given it a teeny tiny start already. I just can't seem to control myself once I start one of these books. This is a great series that I am thoroughly enjoying!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I was really looking forward to this second book in the series after reading and LOVING uglies but this book unfortunetly a bit of a let-down, it took me a long time to get through, and i felt like i was constantly bored. I honestly thought this book was going to focus more on Talley's life as being a pretty but it was more about her escaping being a pretty and being on the outside again. I kept wanting something exciting to happen, but for me it just didn't happen. The love triangle or lack there of between David, Zane and Tally kind-of bothered me too, because I felt like it just hung there without anything of real substance happening.I think a lot of people will probably disagree with this review because I know a lot of people loved it, but different strokes for different folks I guess. I didn't hate it, it just didn't fufill my expectations and was lacking something for me. I plan on continuing with the series and finishing it, because theres only two books left, but I sincerely hope that specials picks up for me!!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"In this book, the story of Tally Youngblood continues.

She then meets the love of her life, and takes the cure she promised to test, making her think like a real person again. She and her boyfriend, Zane run away after unraveling the conspiracy that the world governments put into place.I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it is exciting, contains all of the elements of a great book. Among these elements are romance, action, mystery, and a corrupt government system. The storyline is very well put together, making it very easy to read, and exceedingly enjoyable as well.I would recommend this book to anyone. Even those who despise reading will savor the exciting plotline and intriguing characters. The first time I read this book I was barely able to put it down. I would not be surprised if this applies for you as well.I hope this book review was useful to you. If you chose to purchase/read this book, you are making an excellent decision."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"THIS BOOK IS SO GOOD!!! A great sequel to the classic first book (Uglies). Tells a great story of life after you become pretty, but your brain is fighting back. Definitely a good book to read, read it now, or you will never have lived a complete life. (Definitely don't read before reading the first book...)"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"In the sequel to Uglies, Tally has finally become a pretty, and life is a big, bubbly party with other beautiful people, a fog of drinks and high-tech and costumes. But Tally begins to remember her life outside of this world, back in the wilderness, and her mind begins to clear. She begins to remember how ugly her world is. With her new boyfriend, Zane, she begins to fight back, and to fight to get back to the wilderness, finding herself in a truly ugly place of horrific violence. Meanwhile, her best friend, Shay, goes to some desperate measures to fight against the pretty world. The second book in the series is as strong as the first, though the writing style is deceptively simple (a good thing for weak young readers), as it captures the vapidity of Tally's \\"pretty\\" and shallow world brilliantly. The plot is exciting and dramatic, perfect for young readers, but it is the post-apocalyptic, allegorical message of a disturbingly shallow, controlling, beauty-obsessed world that makes this a gem of the young adult science fiction/fantasy genre. Refreshing, thought-provoking, and complex series that I highly recommend to any young person of our own beauty-obsessed world. Grade: A-"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I love this series. This is the second book, and I love it so far. I really hate what happens with Tally and David, but she seems to get along with Zane much better anyway, although I really liked her and David in the first book. Can't wait to see what happens :-)"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I enjoyed the second installation in the Uglies series just as much as I did in the first. It was really interesting to see Tally become Pretty, not only physically, but in the mental sense as well - completely forgetting all that she used to value and becoming sucked up in the new Pretty lifestyle. I really enjoyed the entry of the character Zane. It was awesome to see a character who wasn't completely a Prettyhead, and he had gotten that clarity on his own. It may not be quite as exciting as the first book, but it really paints an interesting picture of what the Pretties' world is like and why they act the way they do. There is an interesting revelation at the end, and a great cliffhanger that I did not see coming. If you enjoyed the first Uglies book, I highly recommend you continue with the second. It is just as good."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I read the first book uglies and now I have read this one (pretties).Book was in fair condition considering I paid a dollar for it(hehe).It's a great read so I would recommend getting the whole series.I can't wait to buy the next few books to this series.Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I'm laughing reading the reviews because I can see that the use of the word \\"bubbly\\" and \\"bogus\\" have severly annoyed people and I understand, but I actually didnt mind the terms.I'm an adult reader but found myself doing an incredibly brain-missing thing yesterday and of course \\"brain-missing\\" was the term that jumped into my head! Now wasn't that totally bogus. Slang is funny that way...it kind of catches you thinking it or saying it without realizing it.For the vapid nature of the characters and the degree to which they were just supposed to look pretty and not think or do anything more I could imagine their vocabulary would have words like bubbly in it to mean a plethora of things, depending on their whims. That really does make sense to me and I thought it was clever. Why expand your brain when you are pretty, just use a simple easy-to-reach-for word to cover what you want to say and expect others to understand, but even if they dont, they wont mind because you are so pretty they'll agree with whatever comes out of your mouth (e.g. \\"That's Hot\\" and we all know which \\"pretty\\" that one comes from). I get it, life's fun and it's time to go to the next party anyhow...(reminds me of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\"...it's \\"time for a drink\\").Okay...now to the things that bug me...I know it's a book, but the whole operation thing was simply not plausable. I was thinking that it would come to be revealed that they were actually getting brain transplants or something because grinding bones down and re-seeding skin is a little bit far-fetched for me and I love sci-fi.As with any post-apocolyptic world, a society is going to try to fix what it saw the errors with the previous society and come up with a new a better way of running things (like removing the desire to disagree and start wars), but then their society too has it's pros and cons, which is why books exist to stretch our minds...Still not yet finished reading Pretties but I'm enjoying the ride and look forward to the rest of the books in the series."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"The first book grabbed my interest. The second book, Pretties, held my interest. It took interesting unexpected turns and left me wanting to start the the third book right away. A good quick read that gives you alot to think about."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"The continuation of this series was well-done, in my opinion, and kept me coming back for more. It was a little slower in the beginning then the first installment, but the detail was needed to allow for the story to flow. Others were unhappy with the use of the various terms from the \\"pretties\\" to explain their mindfulness at the time, but one has to remember that these characters in the book have had their minds tampered with to make sure that they were able to be controlled by the government. They were also teenagers that were only concerned about the banalities of life so far, such as having fun, being beautiful and fitting in. I (as an adult reader) felt the author did a fantastic job in continuing his story in this second installment and highly recommend that readers continue on. I am now reading the third of the series \\"Specials\\" and have the fourth \\"Extras\\" ready to go when I finish the third.As I said in my previous review of \\"Uglies\\", I look for series that are futuristic in nature and really enjoyed \\"The Hunger Games\\" series.

It was given to my 13 year old daughter as a birthday present. She is in process of reading the first book and seems to be thrilled with it."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"The follow up to Uglies, Pretties takes place after Tally has had the surgery and is loving life as a Pretty. After she receives a message from the Uglies she used to live with, she tries to shake off the juju that's making her feel like she's missing something. It's not quite as simple as the book's blurb makes it sound, though. She doesn't just \\"wake up.\\" She has to decide if she wants to, then she has to fight hard to do it.The writing was similar to Uglies, so Pretties felt familiar. There were new words (balance missing, mili helens, pretty making, crim) and I eventually tired of their repetitiveness (especially combined with the narrator's gravelly voice). If I never hear the word \`bubbly' again in my lifetime, it will be too soon. The same world-building was there, and expanded upon. We learned quite a bit more about the Specials and their role in society and the different technological ways the Pretties can play around with their appearances, and I have to say, most of them were darn weird.The same characters were back with a few more thrown in. We got to know Shay more (and it turns out she's darn weird, too) and we were introduced to Zane, meant to form a love triangle with Tally and David. Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't get behind Zane. He was okay, but he was Pretty, you know? In my mind, he was no match for the Ugly David. Dr. Cable made several appearances and she was just as freaky and sneaky as ever.The narrator does a fine job, nothing spectacular. The cover is okay, a bit generic for me. There's a girl with red hair (did Tally ever have red hair? I can't remember) and a boy trying to push his way into the picture. Meh."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Pretties by Scott WesterfeldReview by Kara GrantMinor SpoilersWhat happens when perfection isn't good enough?My ReviewI was slightly disappointed by how this part of Tally's life begins. The story skips her operation and goes into her current goals as a Pretty. She wants to become part of a group called The Crims, the members of this group were troublemakers when they were Uglies and they only allow certain Pretties into their group. If she gets their vote, she'll be able to hang out with Peris and Shay whenever she wants while enjoying the Pretty life. Sounds simple enough, right? Unfortunately, things are never simple for Tally.Tally isn't a Pretty for very long when she receives a message from her past. She is unable to ignore it and then her memories start coming back from when she was an Ugly. At the same time she is processing what to do next, she meets and gets serious with Crims leader, Zane, who vows to help find the cure for being Pretty. Together her and Zane lead The Crims and find out who will join this cause.With Pretties, the story is much more serious and more mysteries are thrown in. Tally and Zane spend most of the story outsmarting Special Circumstances, preparing their group for the New Smoke, and keeping their minds intact. Shay also goes weird in this story and their friendship is put to the ultimate test. Tally never loses focus of her goals, but she stays in communication with her previous friends and she continues to make sacrifices for others. A triangle is introduced here and I'm not quite sure what happens to her love interest at the end.What I didn't like:Tally and Zane live together for a month in his apartment while formulating plans for their cause.Shay becomes jealous of Tally and decides to go rogue.Dr. Cable returns with a new proposition for Tally.The New Smoke only makes an appearance at the end and only briefly.There is violence in the story, but most of the action is about Tally's and Zane's stunts in their group. The cure is given to them, but something goes wrong with it. Zane breaks his hand in an attempt to get medical attention without revealing his brain's status. Tally jumps from a hot air balloon with her hoverboard, but she lands badly. She ends up destroying the board and hurting herself in the landing. The way her character is written, she can recover from any injury. Tally discovers anthropologists studying a group of people and steals one of their hovercars. She almost gets killed when the people find her camping out and they call her a god because she \\"fell from the sky.\\"I wasn't into this book as much, but it ends in such a way that I'm looking forward to the next book. There is more betrayal, Tally dreams of one man but has feelings for another, Special Circumstances is determined to spy on Tally wherever she goes, and her friendship with Peris finally ends. This is the 2005 edition, also in three parts, with original cover that I prefer, and it's from the library. Again, I would say this book can be read as a stand alone, but I wouldn't recommend that because the story is right in the middle with Pretties. The reader will not understand Tally's memories or certain references Tally and Zane both discuss if Uglies isn't read. However, it is possible to only read these first two books and not continue the rest of the series. For me, Tally is still the best part of the story, but the situations she is placed into creates such drama and not much enjoyment. It would be nice if her friends were just as strong and character driven as she is. However, these crazy friendships show what a good leader she is and that's the reason the story is worth reading."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Things that annoyed me:1. We're only told that Tally's Pretty. What does she look like?2. Now, this might be a weird this to complain about, but where was the school Tally was taught in? Who taught her? Pretties? Specials? Some futureistic-robot?3. I hated, HATED, the words that were constantly used; Bubbly and Bogus. Then Zane said; \\"Bubbly is bogus.\\" Oh god, I nearly lost the plot when he said that.Things that I loved:1. The plot. It's still unique!2. Scott's writing is still impeccable. I could see every tiny detail.3. Tally is a dimwit at the start, but soon gets her fiestyness back. Hoorah! Shay was a compleat brat, as pre-usual, sadly we didn't see David that much, Zane is likeable and I still love Dr. Cable in all of her creepiness."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"After finishing Uglies I couldn't wait to start reading Pretties. Like the first novel, the book's beginning wasn't too impressive. What followed was the entertaining recount of how Tally became bubbly.The term bubbly became so redundant and annoying after only a few chapters. The definition could mean pretty much anything good I guess because it was used in several different ways. Aside from the bubbly though the book was good, not great, but good.Tally has made the ultimate sacrifice in order to test a new drug, she has become Pretty. Now her days are filled with parties and shopping and trying to become a Crim. Crim's are a group of new Pretties that have a tricky past and Tally's only goal in life is to become a member because she wants to belong. Things become a little complicated at a costume party Tally attends, someone has come dressed up as Special Circumstances but as far as she knows, the only Pretties who even know that they really exist are her and Shay. Hidden behind the scary mask is a person from Tally's not so distant past and he has left her a present, hidden in New Pretty Town.After a lunch with the leader of the Crims, Zane, Tally starts to remember things from her past, things that she can't believe she could have forgotten. Their search for the truth to their past leads them to a pouch of pills and finally, they're starting to think clearly. Desperate to help their friends, Tally and Zane make it their mission to help the Crims escape the fakeness of what it means to be Pretty.The return of the memories proves to be a double edged sword for Tally's friend Shay because Shay starts to remember her true feelings for Tally and things just keep getting worse from there. Dr. Cable is even more suspicious of Tally now that she has become a Pretty and worse of all, Zane is getting headaches that she fears stem from the pills they took. When the moment is right Tally and her friends decide to escape but not everyone wants to come along.When the escape doesn't happen the way Tally planned, she begins a trek that leads her to even more answers as to how far the leaders of the Pretties are willing to go to protect their ways. Tally just wants to leave and be with her friends in the New Smoke (even if it means an awkward meet up with David and Zane) but it seems no matter how hard she tries to make things better, she just manages to make them worse.Pretties is a decent sequel to the popular Uglies but I found myself wanting more from the novel. The first 2 sections of the book were a bit drawn out and redundant. This wasn't quite the page turner that Uglies had been, if fact I skimmed a few chapters just to get to the good stuff. Once I got to the final section of the book I was interested and relieve that I didn't have to read that damned word again. The end didn't hold as much power as the first book had but I still am compelled to see how Tally journey ends so onto the next book I go."},{"Title":"Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I really enjoyed the second installment to this series.

But circumstances override his intentions when an Englishwoman on their train suffers an attack of appendicitus requiring immediate surgery, the Allens agree to take charge of her, and the only qualified surgeon in the area is one working with the drug ring. Allen's cover is quickly blown, and in order to distract him from further investigation the drug ring members kidnap his child.SPINSTERS IN JEOPARDY is quite unlike most Marsh novels for it is not a mystery per se; the criminals are immediately apparent, and although there is a somewhat covert mystery afoot Marsh relies almost exclusively upon suspense and her knack for creating vividly-painted characters to substain interest. While this is certainly enough to make the novel entertaining, it is not enough to make this particular novel--the plot of which relies on coincidence upon coincidence--as memorable as her other work. Even so, the book is quite enjoyable in a Hitchcockian sort of way, reminding one a bit of the director's THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. Agatha Christie fans will also recognize that Marsh uses a plot a device similar to Christie's THE 4:50 FROM PADDINGTON, in which a passenger unexpectedly witnesses a murder through a train window. A pleasant read, but not among the first rank of Marsh novels.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Spinsters in jeopardy","review":"Agatha Troy - married to Roderick Alleyn - Chief Inspector at Scotland Yard, has been receiving strange letters from a distant cousin who is living in France. Alleyn himself has been asked to take a trip to the same area of France and try and find out, in conjunction with the French police, what is going on at a strange chateau and at a nearby factory.Troy and Alleyn decide to make a family holiday of it and take their small son, Ricky, with them. When they both see what appears to be a murder from the train window (shades of Agatha Christie and 4.50 from Paddington) they are worried about what is going on.This is a complex plot involving kidnapping, a strange religious sect not a million miles away from black magic, drug production and sale and a revelation about Troy's cousin. I loved the characters and the villains are suitably villainous and unpleasant.The story is a bit of a change from the norm as the reader, and the police know who the criminals are from the start and the name of the game is to get enough evidence on them to charge them with the crimes. I thought it was exciting, the background is interesting and the story is well written as are all the rest of this enjoyable series."},{"Title":"Spinsters in jeopardy","review":"First I noted on the cover at the top was written about NgaioMarsh: She writes better than christie-New York Times. This Ido disagree with. Marsh was very good but her mysteries for t hemost part were rather eccentric, hard to follow in some cases.Inspector Alleyn, his wife , Troy and 8 year old son, Rickywere planning a trip to the Mediterranean as a vacation.As they getting off the train at Roqueville, a passenger suddenlysuffered an attack of appendicitis. Alleyn felt it his duty totry to get her help as she had no relations. There were nodocters around and he discovered there was a Dr. Oberon atthis chateau high up in the mountains. He knew of Oberon as beinga famous, excellent physician so Alleyn and his family got ataxi and took her up to the chateau. Now this is one weird placewhere rites of the sun god were being held. Alleyn felt theywere selling and transporting drugs buthe left the passengerthere as he trusted Oberon. Alleyn, Troy and Ricky go downto a local hotel to stay. They occupy two bedrooms with a bathseperating them with Ricky staying in one and Troy and Alleynin the other. Then they proceeded to go to lunch in the hotelleaving Ricky sleeping. When they to check on him, he is gone.This is the part I find hard to believe; they know the placethey have been in that there is something definitely wrongwith it yet they leave Ricky upstairs sleeping by himself.He has been kidnapped(surprise, surprise). The Chateau iswondering just who Alleyn is; he did not inform them he wasa police Inspector. They are afraid their little shadyoperations will be discovered and will leave no stone unturnedto make sure it is not. Also I am still not sure why thistitle was chosen: Spinsters in Jeopardy. When I first saw it,I immediately thought of something with old maid spinstersliving together in a village(a la Christie) and suspiciousdoings going on. I am sure there are die hard Marsh fansout there who would disagree with my review but this is theway I saw it."},{"Title":"Spinsters in jeopardy","review":"This book is not what we usually see when we read a Roderick Alleyn mystery. For one thing, the basic premise behind the book is actually borrowed from an Agatha Christie story. Also, the book is not really a mystery as such. It is more an expose of some criminal activity that occured on the Continent to do with the early drug trade. In it we meet some truly odious characters and Ms. Marsh does a really good job of depicting these nefarious people. We also get a pretty good description of the world of Cults and witchcraft as seen through the eyes of Alleyn and his wife Troy. Ms. Marsh can write a good story, and even if she steps out of her comfort zone, she does a pretty good job with a plot that's quite different from her usual."},{"Title":"Spinsters in jeopardy","review":"My wife introduced me to Nagaio Marsh last year and since then I have been soaking up her books.

There's a little bit of racism on the menu.

The word itself debuted in 1806, and &quot;bartender&quot; arrived on the scene in 1836.He relates delightful tales of illustrious mixers and saloons, as well as the history -- as best it can be divined -- of specific drinks from the Manhattan and the daiquiri to many lost and unlamented experiments such as the Lightning Smash, the Alabama Fog-Cutter, and the Free Silver Fizz.Apart from anecdotes about Dickens and Washington Irving sharing a mint julep in Baltimore (1842), or the fact that Sherwood Anderson died of peritonitis brought on by the swallowing of a martini olive toothpick, Grimes's colonial pre-history of the cocktail is perhaps the most interesting part of the book. He also notes the evolution of today's standards: for example, Rangoon Ruby to Bog Fog to Cape Codder.The text is garnished with passages from Bunuel, Ben Franklin, Dreiser, Twain, Hawthorne, O'Hara, and of course Hemingway. (Fitzgerald's Turkey Cocktail will make you laugh out loud.)The reason I give this lovely book only 3 stars is that it's so short. There's but 126 pages of text, plus about 36 pages of cocktail recipes. That's a drawback for a stout and heavy reader like myself, but it might make this book the perfect gift for the person who does not read a lot beyond the Wall Street Journal and Forbes -- someone who truly does appreciate the cocktail in this age of Chardonnay nuts and tae bo, and might be most inclined to experiment with the 103 recommended recipes in the back."},{"Title":"Straight Up Or on the Rocks: the Story of the American Cocktail","review":"Grimes traces the history of that uniquely American invention, the cocktail, from its origins in colonial times to its current revival. He is particularly entertaining when reviewing extinct drinks -- ever wonder what a shandy is? -- but the storied bartenders and venues are also a pleasure.The second half of the book is recipes. For these, you're probably better off with a bartender's handbook.Net -- mix yourself a drink and settle into your favorite armchair for this one."},{"Title":"Mac Guide to Family Health 3e","review":"I bought one of these family health guides for my parents who are not medically-related people and they find easy to use."},{"Title":"Windows Nt Server 4.0 Advanced Technical Reference: Advanced Technical Reference","review":"This is the ultimate reference tool for the IT Professional required to work with NT Server.

What I liked about this book is that it included the Smith and Wessons and other lesser celebrated revolvers such as M&H and Remington, not just the standard Peacemakers. My only complaint as a S&W fan is that it did not extend to the pocket pistols such as 38 S&W and 32 S&W - there are tons of these around at a reasonable price, so I know I am not the only one who wants to shoot them, and according to Chicoine no top breaks should be fired with smokeless powder. Maybe a future book on pocket pistols of the old west? Anyhow, tons of good detailed information, lots of models, good read for reloaders and shooters.

This is a subject not much taught in British schools where we tend to to be complacent about our &quot;unwritten Constitution&quot;. I found this book to be an excellent overview for a first time student. It raises fascinating revealations on the such issues as the States entered the constitution , inter ailia, to increase their sovereignty (actually their survival) which is the opposite to the view currently expressed in Britain. The book did not satisfy me for its lack of detail on the Founding Fathers deliberations but it has led me to further research. I suspect that this was the authors intent."},{"Title":"Creating the Constitution: 1787 (Drama of American History)","review":"Concise, but powerful. This book puts the year 1787 in context, explaining the failure of the Articles of Confederation to address the many problems of the new American nation. The two most powerful chapters are \\"Compromises\\" detailing the debate over the Constitution and \\"Principles\\" which details the ideas written into the Constitution. The \\"Compromises\\" chapter makes vivid the most important divisions in the Convention and how they were bridged to reach consensus. The \\"Principles\\" chapter rather than listing the Articles and ammendments, instead highlights ideas like unalienable rights, social contract, rule of people, federalism, nationalism, limits on Congressional power, and checks and balances. All these ideas are presented in clear terms that most children 10+ years should understand.

Great way to add to your Bible reading!"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"Valley of Vision is an incredible collection of Puritan Prayers that can serve as a great devotional for the true Christian. The humility, praise, and love for the Lord expressed by these Christians is awe inspiring and truly uncommon in this day and age. I whole-heartedly recommend this collection of mediations for the Christian following hard after Christ."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"Are there times when you have difficulty going to the Lord in prayer?

I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a supplement to their daily devotion."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I bought this book for myself but I have found that it is great for family prayer times. The prayers remind me of so many facets of my faith, my walk, and my God that I come away every time I read with a more firmly established belief in the power of God."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This is a wonderful book if you have never read it. I was very pleased with the copy I received, and it was a great price. Thanks for always being a main competitor in the \\"book world\\""},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This is a fantastic book for encouragement that will spur you on in amping up your prayer life. This little collection is a powerful incentive to reexamine the content and character of your prayer life. We are, as frail humans, inclined to offer up self-absorbed prayers that reflect very little concern, or awareness, of God's glory and purposes as we treat Him like a genie in a bottle pressing Him to grant our wishes.The prayers contained in this powerful little book are organized by theme. They are Christ-centered (which is to say God centered), humble and sometimes poetic \\"little offerings\\" to a Giant God, who does all things well. While modern culture seems content to paint cartoon-like portrayals of the Puritans, these prayers grant us insight into the deeply spiritual and personable people who suffered from the same trials and temptations as we.The candor and child like transparency with which they approach the one true God is touching, revealing, and encouraging---and entirely biblical. If you want to bless your soul, gain insight into a mature and maturing prayer life and perhaps find good examples of how to pray, then buy this book. Obviously, our prayers must be from the heart (as these are). You may wish to begin your prayer time by reading one of these prayers and using them to jump start your prayer time. Of course these prayers are not Scripture but they are a reminder that a deeper, richer, and more God-honoring prayer life is ours for the taking, if we but try. Buy this book."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I highly recommend this book to those who want to expand their prayer life. This book really encouraged me and helped me to see how weak my prayer life really was! But at the same time, gave me a great vision for what my prayer life could be and IS BECOMING, thanks to this little book!"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"Each year I have endeavored to read through this profound collection of Puritan prayers (Spurgeon is also included although not a Puritan as far as his timeline bit nonetheless a modern Puritan). The author lists where he got the prayers from (which books) but does not give specific footnotes as to the individual prayers which I wish he had done. The book has deeply reverential prayers for all occasions. I find it educational too to read how they address God. They certainly did not address Him as a pal or buddy as so many contemporary Christians do, the breezy easy familiarity with God which I see so much of today was non-existent in their praying. They saw God as high and lifted up and totally other.One reviewer said the vocabulary was tough. There are a some words that need to be looked up in a dictionary but overall the book is quite readable.The leather copy is compact yet has excellent print. It comes with a ribbon marker (a dab of clear finger nail polish on both sides of the end of the ribbon will prevent it from fraying).There are 193 different prayers addressing various aspects of the Christian life. Some of the prayers cut deep, others are soothing and healing, there is something for everyone here. It is not to be used as a prayer book but as an example on how to pray and to get one's mind into the right mood to pray.I owned the paperback edition but bought the leather one back in 1999 and it has held up extremely well. It is worth the extra ten dollars or so to get the leather edition.Few books are as serious and as helpful as this collection of prayers. I have given away at least six leather copies to others.I understand too that this is the most popular title produced by the Banner of Truth Trust."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This collection of prayers and devotions has a depth in their understanding and love for God. They take the reader to a place where you can almost feel the richness of God's love, His faithfulness, the depth of our despair and the joy of being one of Christ's children. Get one and gift it to a friend. You and they will treasure this beautifully bound volume."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"Other than the Bible, this is my favorite book.The size is perfect, the construction is amazing, and the typography is beautiful.The prayers are short, but incredibly deep. You can spend a whole week on just one, thinking on it & praying it. They are so rich in the true gospel of Jesus Christ!Grace upon grace."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I bought this book when I was a student at Emmaus Bible College. I spent ten dollars on it. (And for a college student, that's a nice chunk of change)...well, I can now say I would have spent waaaaay more on it! this book is well worth it. it is so beautiful, so poetic, and so thought provoking. i keep a pen by it on my nightstand so i can read one in the morning and at night and make notes and thoughts on the side margins for myself. i love this book and it turns your thoughts to the Savior again and again. if i could give it six stars i would. if you're looking for an offbeat and fresh devotional type book, this is it. not your typical idea of a devotional, and that's why i love it!"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"The Valley of Vision, a collection of Puritan prayers, is a wonderful God-centered tool to lift your heart up in prayer. I use it often at the beginning or end of a day. Carefully reading through and praying the prayers in the book encourages me without fail. At the end of a hard day I am often blessed by the encouragement these great prayers bring. At the beginning of the day, as all the demands and details of the day begin to rush in, the Valley of Vision is a means to help me push those thoughts back for a few momnents to focus on the greater reality of the person and work of God in my life. This book is no substitute for Scripture or personal prayer, but often creates in me a great hunger for both prayer and the Word."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I have had several friends recommend this book, and I have not been disappointed. There is a depth and maturity in the material. It's something to be read slow and reflected upon rather than skimmed over. The prayers reflect a knowledge of doctrine that is both helpful and refreshing."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"These historical puritan prayers are meant to jog the Christian's prayer life. I use the book daily to help me enter into a more sincere dependence on Jesus through prayer. The idea is that as you read one of the scripted prayers (beautiful poetry in their own right), your own thoughts would tangent to the prayers that are on your heart. In this manner, I will read the same prayer several days in a row before moving on. The famous prayers in this book helped fuel the \\"modern missionary movement,\\" so if you know much about the historical context, then the prayers are just that much sweeter. I was looking for a book to help jog my personal prayer life, and I found what I believe will be a resource to that end for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"Out side the Bible this is the most influential book on my spiritual life. The theology of the prayers written here are life changing. I pray them daily. God has used this book as a tool to overcome the many sins in my life. I thank God for preserveing these prayers to bless the generations that have followed."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This is a must have for every serious Christian seeking to live a transparent and pleasing life to God. Praise Him for the puritan prayers and the revealing of their hearts for Him that we may be challenged in our own hearts to live holy lives unto the Lord."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"The Puritan viewpoint is well-expressed throughout the collection, and their doctrines are very clearly consistent and reverent to the God whom they worship. The book shows not only how the sovereign, triune God can be both revered and loved, but it offers insights into His character, delivering them concisely while still remaining poetic. I would recommend no other book above this for an inquisitive Christian to adopt as a daily devotional and complement to their Bible. For those interested in religious aspect of the Puritan way of thinking, I would recommend no other volume above this."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This is a fabulous book of prayers. It is a must have for serious Christian prayers."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This collection of prayers by some of the Puritan fathers is one of the best sources for devotional reading, introspection, and meditation. The prayers of these men attempt to express the inexpressible greatness of God, while confessing their own utterdepravity. But these prayers really go far beyond this: they serve as a personal challenge to expand and elevate one's estimation of God, which can never be too high.A friend recently gave me a copy as a gift. After reading a few of these prayers, I, too, gave some out as gifts. Is there anything greater than knowing God? Yes! and that is to know even more of His incomprehensible greatness. Let these prayers push you to a higher realm in your personal relationship with Him."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"If I only could keep one book, other than my Bible, this would be the one I would keep."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"The Puritans were amazing men of God. Their reverance for God and their humble hearts are convicting and encouraging. The church today desperately needs more men and women like them. This book of prayers and devotions would be a great source of nourishment for the soul of any Christian."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This book is so very good. Please read and enjoy. If you need a lift and want someone to understand please get this book."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that if he could keep one book beside his bible, this would be the one.I was always taught that prayer should be extemporaneous, and I agree with that, but sometimes my extemporaneous prayers just aren't going anywhere. I find that I can always open this book and find the prayer of some godly saint from yesteryear who can express the desires of my heart better than I can. Or, these prayers often create in me new desires for repentance and holiness and the presence of God.I would recommend this to anyone who needs a boost in their prayer life."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This is a collection of Puritan prayers written by numerous authors. It is fantastic. It is different and deeper than any devotional out there at this time. It is separated into categories so it is quite accessible. Your heart and mind will certainly be encouraged by this book and you will want to give it as a gift to all of your Christian friends."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This book is full of wonderful prayers that help to lead me in my personal devotions. Our church also uses selections to say corporately in our worship service. I ordered enough to give our oldest 6 children one for Christmas. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This book will take the average Christian to new levels of thoughtful prayer not present in today's \\"I'm not so bad\\" mentality. I absolutely would recommend Puritan Prayers to everyone looking to break out of the mundane and into the tender place between exultation and humiliation. You have to see what you've been missing!"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"Have you ever heard someone pray and said to yourself, \\"I wish I could pray like that?\\" It was not ornate words or fresh expressions that caught your attention. No, it was something else -- there was something worshipful and availing in the prayer that transported you to the throne of God. Such are the puritan prayers in The Valley of Vision by Arthur Bennett (2009).The prayers in this book fit my definition of 'best practices,' to wit, practical techniques gained from observation and experience that others may use to improve internal processes.The concept of best practices originated in the mundane world of business management and soon expanded to include sales, manufacturing, and programming software. Before long, best practices made their way into other commonplace domains, such as, teaching/education, performance engineering, pollution control, local governance, road construction, health care, insurance, accounting, and so on. But long before any of these everyday best practices were conceived and published, puritan prayers had already passed the test of time to become standards of excellence in the sphere of Christian devotions.These are the prayers of mortal men rising above their frailty: Richard Baxter, David Brainerd, John Bunyan, Philip Doddridge, Christmas Evans, William Jay, Henry Law, William Romain, Thomas Shepard, Charles Haddon Spurgeon, Augustus M. Toplady, Thomas Watson, Isaac Watts, and William Williams -- puritans all.Please take this review as a challenge. Try reading the following puritan prayer in the absence of spiritual feeling. If you are a devoted believer, I daresay it can't be done.EVENING PRAISEGiver of all,another day is ended and I take my place beneath my great redeemer's cross,where healing streams continually descend,where balm is poured into every wound,where I wash anew in the all-cleansing blood,assured that Thou seest in me no spots of sin.Yet a little while and I shall go to Thy home and be no more seen;help me to gird up the loins of my mind,to quicken my step,to speed as if each moment were my last,that my life be joy,my death glory.I thank Thee for the temporal blessings of this world--the refreshing air,the light of the sun,the food that renews strength,the raiment that clothes,the dwelling that shelters,the sleep that gives rest,the starry canopy of night,the summer breeze,the flowers' sweetness,the music of flowing streams,the happy endearments of family, kindred, friends.Things animate,things inanimate,minister to my comfort.My cup runs over.Suffer me not to be insensible to these daily mercies.Thy hand bestows blessings:Thy power averts evil.I bring my tribute of thanks for spiritual graces,the full warmth of faith,the cheering presence of Thy Spirit,the strength of Thy restraining will,Thy spiking of hell's artillery.Blessed be my sovereign Lord!~The Valley of Vision, 224-225."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This is an amazing collection of Holy Spirit inspired prayers from the Puritans of old.

It is filled with truth and passion for God."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"In their writings you can see the puritan's love for God. This is not just poetry or beautifully written prayers, but men's heart poured out for a God who has given them a new heart.

As a personal devotional source as well as use as a homily or congregational meditation or prayer, Valley of Vision without exception causes someone from those listening to step forward and ask to see the book. This time I ordered the leather bound edition, which better suits my current uses. The photograph on the cover of the soft cover edition captures exactly the content of this wonderful legacy from the Puritans."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I had heard of this book and dismissed it for years as yet another Puritan reprint. I found the books of Puritan sermons good but mostly boring. However, these prayers make the rich Puritan theology not only accessible to today's readers but also wonderful guides for prayer and praise.

People just don't write or talk like this anymore. The devotion, purity, truth and eloquence that fills these prayers is one of the most spiritually uplifting influences I've encountered."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"It can be difficult for all of us to separate actual biblical beliefs from the influences of our own cultures. One way to do this is to read books from different cultures, including books written long ago. While this book was compiled recently, it presents prayers written long ago. While God is my Father, and I can rightfully and lovingly call Him \\"Daddy\\", He is also the God of the universe, and as such commands my respect and my reverence. Balancing these can be difficult, and it is interesting to see how the Puritans managed it. As a bonus, some of these prayers are quite moving. Here is a portion of one, dealing with confession of sins:I deny them not, frame no excuse, but confess, \`Father, I have sinned';Yet still I live, and fly repenting to thy outstretched arms;Thou wilt not cast me off, for Jesus brings me near,Thou wilt not condemn me, for he died in my stead,Thou wilt not mark my mountains of sin, for he leveled all,And his beauty covers my deformities.O my God, I bid farewell to sin by clinging to his cross, hiding in his wounds, and sheltering in his side."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"If one desires to gain deeper insights into the minds and hearts of Godly men and women in past centuries, this easy to read volume will accomplish this in a life-changing way.

Every ardent follower of the Lord Jesus Christ should have this in their library and should commit to read it at least once a year. The Puritans were passionate about their faith and were thinkers. There is depth to their writing and they were master wordsmiths. Your heart will be stirred and your love for the Lord strengthened as you read this timeless work!"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This is a book of Puritan prayers and devotionals. One of these prayers was read at Ruth Graham's funeral. That's what made me interested. The Puritans avoided pride like the plague, so some of the prayers may seem that they were \\"down on themselves.\\" However, each phrase has such deep thought it could be contemplated all day and ends on positive praise for God. The language is poetic and beautiful, early American English. I purchased one for myself and 7 to give as gifts (to be used as a devotional book reading one each day.)"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"The Puritans were know for their deep devotion to God.

What a wonderful tool to use alongside of daily prayer and bible study for one to bow humbly before the Lord."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I first read a copy of this collection of prayers when I was at the bedside of a gentleman who was dying. One of the prayers was the last thing he read and probably thought about. I was so moved, I stood by his bed until his family arrived and gave them the book.The prayers are humble, profound and a journey of well said, deeply felt searching for God.I recommend this book as a devotional or as a glimpse into the faith of those who struggled hard to find a way to worship and be faithful."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I bought this in February 2007 and my prayer life has been enriched and challenged since that time. The Puritans truly knew the Lord and how to pray to Him. Get this book and draw close to God!"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This is a really fantastic set of prayers. It gives you a great sense of Puritan piety, which is obviously much richer than that of today. The prayers themselves easily get five stars; they are emotionally challenging, theologically deep, and just beautifully written. But I had to knock Valley of Vision down to four stars because the editor turned every 'we' into 'I'. We need to be praying as a Body, not as lone individuals, and this editorial choice does not serve to challenge pietistic individualism."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"It is hard to find prayers that are deep in meaning and spiritual. This collection of prayers by Puritans (such as, Thomas Watson, Richard Baxter, John Bunyan, Isaac Watts, David Brainerd, Augustus Toplady, C.H. Spurgeon, etc) had a tremendous impact on my life. Their prayer are deep (really deep) and profoundly meaningful. It exhibits their intimate relationship with God, and their deep understanding of the gospel of grace in their lives. Here is a sample:\\"O God of grace... But in my Christian walk I am still in rags; my best prayers are stained with sin; my penitential tears are so much impurity... I need to repent of my repentance; I need my tears to be washed... Grant me never to lose sight of the exceeding sinfulness of sin, the exceeding righteousness of salvation, the exceeding glory of Christ, the exceeding beauty of holiness, the exceeding wonder of grace\\" (p. 76, paperback edition).My heart resonates with such beat of prayer. The book is filled such deep longings and cries of the heart. I love the prayer book so much that I bought a leather bound edition. The leather-bound edition is smaller than the softcover book and has better quality papers with bigger fonts.If you are looking for a spiritual prayers, consider this gem. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"What a marvelous collection of Scripturally sound, worshipful prayers!

What a service the editor has done in compiling together these beauty-filled, theologically-rooted, passionate, Puritan prayers for our use today! In an age where prayer is all too often treated with flippancy, rather than reverence and as a means to get things rather than as a channel for communion with God, this is a refreshing book.

I read it to my kids almost every night, even though the language is at a higher level, they hear it like poetry and love it. We discuss a lot of the truths within the prayers, and it enriches our devotional times together. I have given this as gifts to many friends who have also enjoyed it. So rich, and so good.

I love the language that they use. It puts it better than anything I have ever read, and to know that these were real people who struggle with some of the same things that we do, and to hear their heart for it and also God's heart for His people through them, its an absolutely amazing book.

I feel my prayer life has deepened by using these prayers.I have given lots of these away as gifts to friends."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This book contains prayers from Puritans. While I don't agree with each and every doctrine of the Puritans, I have found their prayers to be very encouraging. Each one is like a sermon in and of itself. They draw your heart closer to the Father. These men had very close and special relationships with Jesus and we can benefit from that.We were given a copy several years ago, and in turn have shared the leather bound book with others. We have given it to our mothers, our Pastor, evangelist, etc.Buy one for yourself, and you'll want to share this book with everyone you love."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I received this book as a gift from a friend who knows the value of prayer and how I also treasure this communication with God. I now give the book to those whom I feel led to share so that they, too, can be touched by these praises and petitions from the hearts of those in a simpler time of life. To meditate on these moves me to know my own heart's desires and slows me down so that I can value and embrace my relationship with God. I am encouraged to be more of who God wants me to be."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"Excellent :) I would like to know who wrote each prayer, but this is an amazing collection of prayers, written by awesome men of God."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"It has been praised so much, I can hardly add much that has not been said. Valley of Vision is deep, rewarding, rich and vast in scope. The prayers of the Puritans cover so much of life, theology and doctrine that one could almost (note the 'almost') come to a fairly complete understanding of the heart of Reformed Theology with this book alone. It gives a clear and intimate look into the heart of the Puritans who have been portrayed in so much negative light for so long that such exposure is striking and fresh.As for practical use, it is second to none as a teacher of prayer and humble but confident petition.Valley of Vision is so beautiful in verse that the book reads more like poetry than prayer. It is certainly a worthy purchase for anyone of the protestant stripe."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"My daughters and I have been blessed tremendously with the reading and praying of this book. It gave us comfort and reassurance of God's promises to His children in the time of need or just to be refreshed. This book was recommended to us and we will definitely recommend it to others."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This collection of prayers is so deep, so honest, and so thoughtful, that it almost exceeds my ability to describe. The Puritan mindset expressed in these prayers is first shown in the high view of God, and second in the low, humble view of self.The beauty of the carefully constructed prayers contrasts dramatically with much of what is written today. I have found, as a worship leader, that these prayers are entirely appropriate and a welcome addition to corporate worship. Whether in public use or private devotion, reading them aloud is a remarkable experience."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This book offers an excellent assortment of composed, Puritan prayers. Excellent for devotional and/or liturgical use!"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"The Valley of Vision is a remarkable collection of prayers from people who really grasped the idea of communicating with God. The wording is eloquent, but surprisingly accessible. What people were praying during the Puritan time was not too different from how we pray today, and you will be encouraged and inspired by these people's insight. Aside from the Bible, this is the one book I keep nearby."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I was first introduced to the paperback version of this book and loved it. I wanted something more enduring and appropriate and was thrilled that it is in leather. I think the leather edition is beautiful and better laid out than the paperback version.Truly Spiritually refreshing!!"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This devotional book is one of the very best I have ever read. It reminds me of who God is, who I am before Him and inspires me to love Him more. Today there is so little depth in most Christian writings. This book is solid doctrine and yet not just doctrine but infused with the Holy Spirit's life and power causing me to humble myself before the Lord Jesus Christ and creating within me a hunger to know Him more and more. These saints of old knew Him in a deep way and we are blessed to be able to glean from their writings."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"Someone gave me this book years ago and I now kick myself for letting in languish. Another friend recently gave me the leather edition and I committed to adding a daily reading to my devotional time. What a blessing!In the crush of today's &quot;press&quot; of activities where nearly all of us find ourselves, these prayers truly restore the soul and put the focus squarely back where it should be. What magnificent joy to be reminded of our awesome God in words and tone that honor Him.I echo the wish that Bennett had identified the writer of each prayer--but perhaps, as also noted, it would indeed distract from the clear intent to draw attention solely to our God.How much do I like The Valley of Vision? It will be our corporate gift to about 350 friends and family this next Christmas ... what better way to launch a new year than with this &quot;simply&quot; beautiful work in hand. But don't YOU wait that long!"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This book will change your perspective on God's (and man's) true position in the Christian life. These people had the right idea on honoring God, and confessing sin. If you cherish a relationship with God and yet have a hard time finding the right words to say when asking forgiveness (or worshiping), this book will help &quot;guide&quot; you along the way, but it should not to take the place of scripture reading."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I came across this book because Chuck Swindoll quoted one of its prayers (\\"Man a Nothing\\") in one of his own books, and my first impression after reading that prayer was one of having found a great and rare treasure. I actually copied that prayer out of Swindoll's book word-for-word into my own Bible, and read it over and over, many times. Several years ago, I then bought a bonded leather copy of \\"The Valley of Vision\\", and without exaggeration would have to state that aside from my Bible this is the most helpful, most theologically sound, inspiring spiritual work (or more accurately, collection of works) that I have ever read.As you know by now, this is a collection of prayers from various Puritan authors all compiled and arranged into a single, valuable resource for readers to be able to draw upon today. In John chapter 7, it is recorded for us how the Pharisees sent officers to arrest Jesus. Upon returning from their mission empty-handed these officers were asked by the Pharisees why it was that they had not taken Jesus and brought Him to them. Their simple, yet profound answer was that \\"Never has man spake like this man\\". They were amazed, astounded, and obviously affected by Jesus' words, and their bosses the Pharisees accused them of having been deceived. I can assure you that if you read the prayers of this book, slowly and deliberately, carefully and thoughtfully, earnestly and sincerely, that you will be like the officers of the Pharisees and find your own self to be amazed, astounded, and deeply affected. People today just do not write the way these Puritans wrote. One of the criticisms I have read about this book is the old, flowery, Puritan language and use of words being out of style and perhaps difficult to understand. May I suggest to you, the potential reader, that the very use of words and phrases of which we are not much accustomed to today could be the primary means by which your attention is powerfully captured, and your mind drawn deeply into the message the writer is conveying in their written prayer, causing you to thereby pick up on the earnestness, piety, and godliness that you will find in them. They are so utterly inspiring; these writers have eloquently penned the thoughts which I have had, or that I want to have, but could never accurately or adequately put into words. I can't think of too many works that have affected me as much as this collection of prayers has done and as a result this book has the prominent place of being on my nightstand, right next to my Bible where it is easily accessible and often read.Another criticism I have read is that the editor Arthur Bennett did not place the actual Puritan authors name next to each individual prayer, and thereby people are hindered from being able to know who wrote which prayer, and to seek out writings from that author. Let me just submit that I think leaving the individual authors names off of each prayer is fitting for this book and the humble, godly attitude that is conveyed throughout. None of these men would care to be lifted up in the minds of their listeners or readers, but would rather have any glory be given solely to the Subject and Inspiration of their works. The editor gives a list of the men from whom these prayers originated in the Preface and Bibliography found in the front of the book for those interested in following up with more reading of their other works. I would venture to say that most of the Puritan writers, and certainly all listed as authors of the prayers in this book, are without a doubt very worthy of further reading.Here's a suggestion for you: purchase the less costly paperback edition of this gem and begin to explore the treasures that you will find inside. Once you have determined the usefulness and the value of having this book in your own library, you can then invest in the more durable bonded leather copy to keep forever and graciously pass along your paperback copy to another believer, thereby sharing a very valuable resource in our pursuit of the heart of God. They can then do the same.As we all press to become more like Christ, this book can and will be used by God to help us in our individual sanctification. I know you will enjoy and profit from having it."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"\\"The soul learns to pray by praying; for prayer is communion with a transcendent and immanent God who on the ground of his nature and attributes calls forth all the powers of the redeemed soul in acts of total adoration and dedication.\\" (Preface)The Puritans recognized that prayer and doctrine are not to be separated. In their prayers they kept the two together. In fact it was their doctrinal understanding, which indeed produced such deep, and lasting prayers. Theology instilled a thorough passion for prayer. Likewise it is prayer, which sinks us deeper into the mysteries of God's self-disclosure of himself. It is prayer, which furthers our theology.It is to this end which we, as Christians must strive. We must search out our Triune God in prayer and devotion as we seek him in his word and through our prayers.Arthur Bennett has provided the Church a great service by collecting the prayers of the saints. The book is arranged topically under the following headings: 1. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; 2. Redemption and Reconciliation; 3. Penitence and Deprecation; 4. Needs and Devotions; 5. Holy Aspirations; 6. Approach to God; 7. Gifts of Grace; 8. Service and Ministry; 9. Valediction; 10. A Week's Shared Prayers.This book is excellent for both private and public devotion. The only disadvantage I found to the book was that each individual prayer was not attributed to its corresponding author. However this is probably a good idea in keeping with the intent of the book. Its intention is as a guide to lead us to prayer when the heart is cold or to further pour fuel on the heart, which is already aflame.May this be used of the Lord to ignite our hearts in a holy passion toward him. O' Lord teach us to pray!"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I can read about three or four prayers before being overwhelmed by the depth and riches of these prayers. They show the depth of knowledge and wisdom of their writers, but even more they show the writers' deep abhorrence of their sin and devotion to God. They also show keen insight into the private sins of our hearts. These prayers are old; I had to frequently consult a dictionary to understand some words that are no longer in common use. I can't help but feel that Christianity in our day is terribly shallow compared to what the Puritans knew.Each prayer is about one page long, has a brief title given by the book's editor, and is presented anonymously. The prayers are grouped into sections such as &quot;Redemption and Reconciliation,&quot; &quot;Holy Aspirations,&quot; and &quot;Approach to God.&quot; A brief preface is the only background given, all the rest of the book is simply the prayers themselves.I have only two faults with the book, but neither merit rating it less than five stars. First, the titles of the sections closely describe the main theme of that section, but the titles of the individual prayers do not consistently (in my mind) state the main theme of that prayer. Second, the prayers are not attributed to their authors, and I would very much like to know who wrote each one. However, I will allow that perhaps Arthur Bennett intended for us not to know so we would focus on the Creator rather than the creature.One other thing to mention is that this is one of the most sturdy, well-published paperback books I have seen. After carrying this book on my commute to work for reading, it has held up much better than other paperbacks. The pages were so thick I often had to check the page numbers to make sure I had not skipped a page.I highly recommend this book for all Christians for personal study to receive greater conviction of sin, more language to express your devotion to God, and instruction on how to pray fervently."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"The Valley of Vision, by Arthur Bennett is a collection of Puritan prayers compiled and listed by topic. With subjects such as the Trinity, penitence and deprecation, approach to God, and Gifts of grace (to name a few), The Valley of Vision gives us insight into the humble piety of the Puritan prayer life. It also shares with us our need for this reverence for God and the importance of true communion with Him through prayer. The first prayer summarizes the purpose of this book with the following words, &quot;Thou hast brought me to the valley of vision, where I live in the depths but see Thee in the heights...\\" The main theme of the book is to show Christians that we are first brought to the valley in order that we may see above the mountaintops. This book is a must have for every Christian. It can be used as a daily devotional as well as a guide for our own prayers. Deeply moving and overflowing with the reflections of God's immeasurable grace, Valley of Vision will touch every home and press every heart towards a closer walk with the Lord."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"\\"The Valley of Vision\\" contains classic first-hand prayers from the great Puritan spiritual writers. Its value is two-fold. Personally, it can strengthen the reader's spiritual life related to one's image of God and one's prayer life. Historically, it can undo the distorted image of the Puritans--they were NOT distant academics who censured others. They were head and heart believers who honored God.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \\"Soul Physicians,\\" \\"Spiritual Friends,\\" \\"Biblical Psychology,\\" \\"Martin Luther's Pastoral Counseling,\\" and \\"Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\\""},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"Arthur Bennett's collection of Puritan prayers is phenomenal. These prayers, drawn from the various Puritan fathers, such as Thomas Watson, Richard Baxter, John Bunyan, Isaac Watts, Henry Law, etc., will touch your soul and help you refocus your thoughts on your relationship with God.May I suggest that you read them slowly. Reflect on the various phrases of the prayers. Allow the prayers to become your prayers to God. And at the same time, allow God to speak to you through these prayers.The only criticism of &quot;The Valley of Vision&quot; I have (and the primary reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that Bennett failed to tell who wrote each prayer. Personally, I would have liked to have been able to go to the original sources and read more by the authors.For those who are looking for modern language prayers, be forewarned that this book retains much of the flavor of the Puritan English.But even with these minor criticisms, I have to admit I have been touched by the prayers in this book many times. I regularly use this book to help focus my time with God.If you want a boost in your devotional time with God, &quot;The Valley of Vision&quot; won't be a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This is truly an invaluable collection. With a little less than 200 prayers, I read one almost every morning during the week, and this lasts me roughly the year. Obviously, these prayers fall within the Reformed tradition, which is more than a little important. Other reviewers have covered what remaining points there might be to make about this book, so I'm going to end by including an example to give you a taste of what is within. This is by no means the best of the prayers; it simply fit my fancy at the time I read it:\\"The Name of Jesus\\" (p. 21)All-Searching God,Thou readest the heart,viewest principles and motives of actions,seest more defilement in my dutiesthan I ever saw in any of my sins.The heavens are not clean in thy sight,and thou chargest the angels with folly;I am ready to flee from myself because of my abominations;Yet thou dost not abhor mebut hast devised means for my return to thee,and that, by thy Son who died to give me life.Thine honour is secured and displayed even in my escape fromthy threats,and that, by means of Jesusin whom mercy and truth meet together,and righteousness and peace kiss each other.In Him the enslaved find redemption,the guilty pardon,the unholy renovation;In Him are everlasting strength for the weak,unsearchable riches for the needy,treasures of wisdom and knowledge for the ignorant,fullness for the empty.At thy gracious call I hear, take, come, apply, receive his grace,not only submit to his mercy but acquiesce in it,not only glory in the cross but in him crucified and slain,not only joy in forgiveness but in the one through whomatonement comes.Thy blessings are as secure as they are glorious;Thou hast provided for my safety and my prosperity,and hast promised that I shall stand firm and grow stronger.O Lord God, without the pardon of my sin I cannot rest satisfiedwithout the renovation of my nature by grace I can neverrest easy,without the hopes of heaven I can never be at peace.All this I have in thy Son Jesus; blessed be his name."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"The Puritans obviously had a connection with the Lord that embarrasses most of us. Every part of their lives revolved around their relationship to Christ. This book of prayers are both inspiring and convicting. Oh, that I would dedicate myself to prayer like this...to God's glory!"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This book, along with my Bible, travels with me everywhere I go. I use it many mornings to begin my devotions. These prayers are so God-centered! They make me want to love God. They make me want to hate my sin.I tried devotionals to help me engage with God in the morning, but they alway seemed so shallow, or so unrelated to actually devoting myself to God, that I gave up. I didn't think that a little prayer book would be exactly what I needed but it was. I give it my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I can think of no other work that I have read that has influenced my prayer life, and the content of my prayers, as much as this gem of a collection that Arthur Bennett has complied and edited from some of the great Purtian divines. I owned the original paperback, and now am very pleased to have this new bonded leather version (complete with ribbon bookmark).These men of faith prayed Scripturally informed, joyous, repentant prayers that never left any doubt that God was the focus, and that pleasing and praising and enjoying Him was the goal of the prayers. Here is just a small sample:&quot;O Lover of the Loveless, it is thy will that I should love thee with heart, soul, mind, strength, and my neighbor as myself. But I am not sufficient for these things. There is by nature no pure love in my soul; Every affection in me is turned from thee; I am bound, as slave to lust, I cannot love thee, lovely as thou art, until thou dost set me free. By grace I am thy freeman and would serve thee, for I believe thou art my God in Jesus, and that through him I am redeemed, and my sins forgiven.&quot; (pp. 250).There is a wonderful sense of joy, hope and love, mixed with seriousness, repentance, and faith. I turn to these prayers again and again when my heart is hard, my mind lacks the right words, or when I am tempted. At our church, we often include prayers from this work in our bulletin for folks to meditate on as they prepare for worship. They are also wonderful for 'jump starting' your own personal worship and prayer times with the Lord. Get a copy today - you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"If you believe the Puritans were mindless, backward, fundamentalist then you have never read The Valley of Vision. This book illustrates the truth that the Puritans were theologians, passionate about Jesus and His kingdom, and sought God with all their hearts (Jeremiah 29:13).Arthur Bennett has done a marvelous job of going through thousands of Puritan prayers (the Puritans were noted for writing their prayers in their journals) and giving us a book that has Puritans prayers divided by separate headings. I love to read these prayers as I get ready for bed. The English language is beautiful from the pages of these Puritan saints. I long simply to pray with the hunger and desire that they prayed (Luke 11:1; 18:1; Colossians 4:2)."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"My husband never has a list for what he would like for Christmas, but this is the one item he asked for by name.

This volume is a wonderful and majestic collection of Puritan prayers gleaned from the writings of a variety of authors, and categorized by theme.

Each prayer provides the reader a unique opportunity to step into the writer's place and share his common experience as a fellow sinner and as a joint heir of the grace of life.

I thought at first it would be too much for some that were in the beginning of their walk but I was so wrong. The words in here are timeless and limitless in what they have to offer. I pray you will pick them up today and glorify God in your growth. The amazing men that put down these words knew far more then we seem to know today about the importance of our walk with Christ; as you bring these words into your heart you too will feel that gap between yourself and your Lord disappear. The paramount message is our union with Christ and there just are not enough teachings on this available today that show us that as clearly and consistantly. Share these with your family (there is an amazing piece called 'The Family' as a matter of fact) in your devotional time. If you dont currently have devotional time or dont feel it is all you want it to be make this your new years resolution to pick up each day and gift to your loved ones.The Valley of Vision: A Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"The Valley of Vision is a collection of Puritan prayers. It has greatly enhanced and livened my personal prayer life. There are few men these days who pray with this kind of intensity, clarity and reality.

I strongly recommend this as a very appropriate gift for any Christian."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"The Valley of Vision is an encouraging book, and it makes an excellent gift for encouragement, especially for a significant occasion such as birthdays or graduation.

I am amazed by the metaphors weaved throughout which use the big and the small of God's creation helping me to see His wonder in ways I've not seen before.

It is often challenging to pray with a depth that goes beyond the normal wants and desires and these prayers can help.

Prayer is the spiritual pulse. By this the spiritual health may always be tested.\\" What he is getting at is that one's piety is proportional to the fervency, faithfulness, and diligence of his or her prayer habit. Though we have no access to how frequently the Puritans prayed, but in \\"The Valley of Vision\\"; which is a selected collection of their devotions and prayers, we have the evidence and vision of their souls in their relationship to God, that I believe explains their zeal for the Lord, holding on to the worldly concerns loosely, earnestness and discipline to live a life pleasing to him as pilgrims travelling to the heavenly Canaan. If I were to describe the characteristics of them, I would use the words reverence, awe, self-abasement, Triune God-centeredness, child-like love to God, and heavenly-mindedness. While they are examples to follow in piety and there is plenty to learn from their prayers, I would be careful not to be so infatuated by them, and use this book as some sort of a prayer book. It is still important to pray from the heart though it may not be as eloquent as their prayers, and in some cases they seem to resonate to the particular situation you are going through."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I received this book quickly with great packaging. The book itself was a clean, tight copy with no markings, but it smelled strongly of cigarette smoke.

On a more positive note, I would definitely recommend the book to anyone seeking after a deeper prayer life. It is a wonderful devotional and will always be a classic."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"The only problem I have with the book is that you ought to sell a dictionary along with it. think the working is a bit too much for the average person."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"Two other Pastor's on our staff mentioned this little Puritan Prayer Book to me. I went on line and ordered the leather bound version, mainly because something like this seems more appropriately packaged in leather than paperback.The book is wonderful. It is a great collection of prayers that are just timeless. The prayers are divided up by theme and well documented in the table of contents. You can pick and choose based on your mood or the stresses that you are facing in life. Or you can read through one right after the other. By reading the entire book of prayers you will gain a good feel of how to pray through your Bible.This particular binding is wonderful, it is well made and doesn't feel cheap nor does it feel as though it will fall apart quickly. Also, the print is a bit larger and on crisp bright white paper. It is easy to read and the pages don't have hardly any bleed through.This is a great little book and will become a good companion for your daily devotional time.

The Puritans knew the value of theologically correct and deep prayers and this book is a reflection of that.

At times I've felt like there's so much on my mind and heart that I don't know where to start in prayer, and this book has been a great help in focusing my thoughts and prayers. I typically read one prayer before going to bed, reading through it out loud and then sometimes reading through it a second time, making it more personal to my current situation, my struggles and reasons to give thanks, etc. The prayers are rich in doctrine and give much food for thought, but are very digestible at the same time. I'm ordering more copies to give as gifts, and look forward to my friends being just as blessed as I have been."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This book was amazing! The Puritans had a real grasp of the worship of God in spirit and truth. They understood clearly the vast separation between Holy God and depraved sinners.

The Puritians were on to something."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This book is a collection of prayers written by Puritans. It's unique, however, in that these are not really corporate prayers. They are very private, personal prayers about their spiritual walk. These prayers, each only about one page long, take you inside the prayer lives of people who were greatly used by God.The book is divided into general sections -- such as repentance, devotion, thanksgiving -- but it's not necessarily a book to read front to back. You can open it up and read any prayer and it quickly becomes your own. The words are true to the original, but easy to understand.It's really amazing how these prayers are so similar to situations I face daily. This book is a wonderful way to bring your prayer life back on track or to add a depth you might not have imagined before.I just bought the paperback version, but this will be a book I keep beside my Bible and refer to for years to come."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I just received this book. I ordered two, one to keep and one to give away. The contents of the book look like something I am going to enjoy using. However, in the description it was listed as \\"leather bound\\". It is not leather bound, it is stamped \\"bonded leather\\" on the back cover. I probably would have ordered the paperback if I had known that because bonded leather doesn't wear any better than a paperback. You might want to correct that in the description."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This book was recommended by Todd Friel. It is awesome. It's humbling. It's eye opening. Dare I say this is my favorite book next to the Bible? Somehow, every thought I have about God, about Christ and about myself is so eloquently expressed here. The devotions in this book are accurate depictions of sincere honest submission to God. Though these prayers were offered up to God by another, they are so personal that I fall to my knees in tears and penitence. I urge you to read this book!"},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"A lady in my prayer group recommended this and it rocked me. First, each meditation is a mini-5 pt Calvinism theology lesson/reminder. The thinking is so radically counter-cultural (e.g., reliance on the completed work of Christ as opposed to our effort/willpower)that I need at least a daily reminder so its more than helpful in my prayer/reflection. Second, you've seen the frowning portraits of the puritans and, frankly, I never imagined I would share anything with them. But in these writings I see hearts that remind me of my splintered heart and my longing to become what I will fully become (and am in Christ and hope) when I go home. So across these centuries...dead puritans and me."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"The Puritans were masters at the art of prayer.

Over all a must have for anyone who is serious about prayer."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"I have never been a fan of printed prayers, believing instead that the Christian should pray to God spontaneously. However, this book is breathtakingly beautiful in its heart for God. I read one every morning and have shed tears while reading the prayers. You can almost feel the heart for God of the authors as they beseeched God to guide them in His mercy. They hold true completly for today. If the language of the time bothers you, you could simply substitute 'you or your' for 'thy or thine'. I pray them the way they were written. This is an absolutely wonderful and spiritual book. Don't hesitate to purchase it."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"What a wonderful way to start the day - with this book! The compiler of these prayers says that it's not meant to be used as a formula for praying, but for me it became a \\"discipline\\" for praying. It has enhanced my prayer life ten-fold. It is so richly grounded in Biblical truth, and the men who wrote these prayers had such a simple way of digging to the core of the human soul with words. I highly recommend this book to any Christian who feels comfortable reading the KJV and other works of age."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"If you're looking for a model on how to pray (outside of Jesus' example in the gospel), this is the book for you. The Puritans seem to have an awe-inspiring ability to capture repentance, purity of thought, sincerity, true love, and genuine desire for more of the things of the Lord than just about anyone else I've read. You can read all the modern emerging church books you want, many of which I love, but these prayers hold up against the test of all time and will stir your heart like very little else. The only other non-Bible book that has had a greater impact on my spiritual walk than the Valley of Vision is probably My Utmost for His Highest by Oswald Chambers. Neither is light reading, but heavy, drenched with the Spirit wisdom for learning what it means to be called by the name of the One who saves."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This is a wonderful little book of prayers. I try to read it every day before I pray because it reminds me of who He is, who I am and to know the difference. He is all and I am nothing; anything I am is only through Him. I am reminded that my life is not about me, but rather about Him; I need to be reminded every day. This book is an exercise in wonderful humility."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"This book of prayers is like a treasure trove. You can only read one or two (maybe three) at a time, because there is so much depth and thoughtfulness to each one of them. They are good for helping your prayer life, but also just to think upon. They are also a beautiful read, no matter what you believe! They are encouraging, inspiring, and challenging. I definitely recommend this collection of prayers."},{"Title":"The Valley of Vision: a Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions","review":"The most valuable book of prayer and the most beneficial instruction on prayer that I've ever read.

Tanner spent many months in the fast-disappearing Southern old-growth forests in the 30s, and probably saw more ivory-bills than anyone in the 20th century. He describes their feeding, mating, etc., habits and regional differences.The sad thing here is that Tanner was well-aware that the birds were on the verge of extinction, and the tone of the book is quite poignant.I just wish this edition had more material on how the book affected later researchers and some updated material on the possible rediscovery of the bird."},{"Title":"The ivory-billed woodpecker (Research report no. 1 of the National Audubon Society)","review":"I now live in NE TN where James T.

Towards the end of his career he wrote two books, fiction yet clearly based on his own experiences, taking place during World War 2, which are his finest works. Pacific Interlude is the second one, and it is one of my favorite books. It tells the story of the latter part of the Pacific war seen from the unlikely location of a small gas tanker, and particularly the perspective of the young 24 year old captain who finds himself in command. The book manages to attain total credibility, giving the reader a true feeling of what it must have been like living aboard that tanker. The ups and downs, matters petty and great, tragic and comic, all are mixed in a completely believable way. The book gives an excellent feeling of time and place, and while reading the novel a reader can almost feel like a silent crewmember of the ship. Everything from fear of fire and explosions from the flammable cargo, to fear of enemy warplanes, to fear of each other, is captured at various points. Wilson builds an interesting crew of fellow officers, each with differing strengths -- and definitely weaknesses -- during their forced voyage together. What I think really puts this book into the top tier in addition to the fact that it is a natural adventure story is the portrayal of the captain, Sylvester Grant. He is always conscious of feeling that he must play the part of captain, though he is never exactly sure what that is. His adjustments, uncertainty, and, despite living in extremely crowded quarters, loneliness, is portrayed perfectly. The first and last parts of the book take place on land -- Brisbane, Australia and the Philippines, and add to our understanding of the personalities of the people involved. Interspersed with the action of the story is the thinking, and musings of the captain. At various points of the novel, particularly the parts taking place on shore, the Captain's ambivalent views about his future post-war life, and his marriage and civilian career are highlighted. In a very natural almost subtle way, the book weaves together a great adventure story with an equally fascinating story of personal growth of the generally appealing but very human captain of the gas tanker. Sloan Wilson is clearly a writer of unusual talent, and combined with his vivid ability to put us into the situation, his ability to portray people in an interesting and realistic way sets this book apart from many other \\"war\\" stories. My sole complaint with the book is the ending -- it stops before the end of the war, and we never find out answers to various questions about Captain Grant, his crew or his ship. It could have at least used a postscript. But that is a small complaint regarding one of the best stories that I have ever read. This book may be hard to find, but it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Pacific Interlude","review":"If you like Sloan Wilson, you will like this story about a gasoline tanker during the Pacific Islands campaigns. His best novel was the Ice Brothers. This about two Coast Guard Officers engaged the Greenland Patrol. Pacific Interlude follows the trials of a small gas tanker and the perils involved. Different but interesting because little,fact or fiction, has been written about the guys who got the fuel and resources to the troops in the front lines.The gross lack of equipment and repair parts as well as manpower and worn out ships makes one wonder how they got the job done. A good read."},{"Title":"Driving by Memory","review":"What a letdown. Yes, the prose is decent, and the premise is undeniably attractive but, for anybody who holds the drive to Las Vegas close to their heart, these 3 separate tales of driving across the desert toward that glittery focal point called Sin City will all leave you feeling cheated. Why? Well, most of all, the author TURNS OFF THE HIGHWAY BEFORE GETTING TO VEGAS! How can you leave out the final 5 miles!? If you have to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into a casino, what in the world are you doing writing a book with Vegas at its center? Yes, the author shows that he knows the road, and what the various mountains are called, etc., but he obviously has no understanding of what compels most of us to take that road so many times in our lives. Skip this book and spend the money on a tank of gas yourself. This book has no Elvis."},{"Title":"Driving by Memory","review":"Last November, I flew into las Vegas for the first time on a bright, sunny day. I had my nose pressed to the window most of the way, and was in awe of the what lay below. I followed the roads through the desert that led to Vegas and vowed to make the drive myself some day. I couldn't believe my luck when I happened across this book. But, the book left me bored and disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much, but even the author's reader-friendly prose could not make this an interesting read."},{"Title":"Driving by Memory","review":"Though published by a university press, this is no dry academic tome. It's an unusally creative attempt to capture the spirit and the meaning of the drive through the desert. Fox writes of three approaches to the archetypal desert city, Las Vegas: from Sante Fe, from Los Angeles and from Reno. His writing is personal, captivating and will make you see the desert (and our paths through it) in entirely new ways."},{"Title":"Driving by Memory","review":"In \\"Driving by Memory,\\" William L. Fox writes about three road trips to Las Vegas. Fox drives to his destination from three cities: Santa Fe, Los Angeles and Reno. In addition to documenting three particular trips, the author draws on the memories of many previous drives to Sin City. In the introduction, the author writes about his first trip to Nevada. At nine years old, he left his home in Santa Barbara to spent six weeks in a Reno divorce ranch. This experience was the beginning of William L. Fox's love affair with the Silver State. The first of the three main road trips is from Santa Fe. While driving through Arizona's Painted Desert, Fox discusses one of his recurring themes: the historical basis that influences how we mentally convert land into landscape. The author also has many interesting observations on the nature of the interstate itself. Earthworks are another recurring topic for Fox. In particular, the Roden Crater Project is just off the highway. James Turrell's Roden Crater is an artistic creation carved out of an actual crater. Before getting into the car, the second third of the book begins with a good deal of family background on the author. It becomes clear that the goal of driving to Vegas from three cities isn't just an excuse to write a book. Partly fueled by nostalgia, the trips serve as therapy. The hope is that the author will come closer to self-realization as his past, present and future converge en route to Las Vegas. On the drive from Los Angeles, Fox offers interesting comparisons between LA and Vegas. Much of the drive takes place in San Bernardino County and Fox remarks on the military installations, natural areas, historical sites and towns along the way. Fox takes a side trip into Afton Canyon. Unfortunately, William L. Fox and his wife Beth only scratch the surface of the adventure contained there. Back on I-15, the author ultimately arrives in Sin City. There, observations are made on gambling and the uniqueness of Las Vegas. The last third of the book begins in Reno and runs along Route 95 from Reno. Possibly because this is the one trip that isn't on a homogenized interstate, this may be the most interesting chapter. Going beyond a simple examination of Reno, Fox makes some fascinating comparisons between Las Vegas and Reno. Always working art and especially architecture into his work, Peter and Turkey Stremmel's truck stop inspired home is examined. The author is accompanied by two companions as the trio drives through the weirdness that is Fallon, Hawthorne, Walker Lake, Luning and Mina. In this chapter, Fox has much to write about the militarized nature of Nevada. \\"Over 80 percent of Nevada is owned by the federal government.\\" Anyone who has driven this road can appreciate that \\"the scale along this part of the drive is hard to grasp, almost hallucinatory, and twenty miles feels like an hour, as if we're crawling slowly through a still photograph.\\" Fox reminds us of themes in \\"The Void, The Grid & The Sign\\" when he writes of the difficulties that we have in perceiving the desert. \\"Driving by Memory\\" is not really about Las Vegas; it is about the experience of driving to the entertainment capitol of the world. That written, William L. Fox does finally unleash some of his wit on the largest city in Nevada.\\"Driving by Memory\\" is a good read with some potential issues. First, previously driving these three routes is greatly instrumental in appreciating the book. The title may be inaccessible to those who have not driven these particular roads. Second, the Santa Fe trip is the weakest chapter. As the initial drive, it has the power to turn off readers from what is otherwise a satisfying book. Fox spends a good deal of page time counting overpasses, truck initials, pedestrians, trash and even road kill. Many readers would do well to simply skip this third of the book or come back to it last. Third, a good deal of time is spent on the author's life story. Unless the reader is already a fan of William L. Fox, this may seem self-indulgent and uninteresting. Such sections are mostly necessary as the inspiration of the book is to help the author move towards self-realization by connecting himself to Vegas from three points. A final concern is that since the author took these drives in the 1990s, the book is always becoming increasingly outdated. In the end, the substance of the book is solid enough to be relevant for a very long time. Alas, \\"Driving by Memory,\\" is a good read that combines personal desires with art, geography, history and science."},{"Title":"Driving by Memory","review":"Fox's wit, charm, and intellect combine to create a fascinating book that is part memoir and part geography, culture, and history lessons. A rare combination that suits a reader like me who is always looking for books that help me see life through a clear new lens!"},{"Title":"A Balanced Introduction to Computer Science","review":"There are generally two courses for beginners in computing. \\"Introduction to Computers\\" is usually designed for people who know very little about computers and are interested in using them in their daily life. While \\"Introduction to Computer Science\\" covers some of the same material, it is designed for those who want to know how computers work, and perhaps even take some courses in computer science. This book is written for the second type of course.Programming is introduced via HTML, which is in complete agreement with what I tell everyone who expresses an interest in learning to program. HTML is easy to understand, demonstrates some of the ideas of advanced programming and the feedback is immediate. Furthermore, initial programs can be small and since the student will most certainly be familiar with surfing the web, the results will make sense to them.What most people consider to be true programming, writing code with variables, functions, if constructs, loops and user interaction, are introduced with JavaScript. This is also a sound decision, JavaScript is powerful enough to introduce the basics of programming, builds on the previous HTML coding and is freely available. Other chapters cover a brief history of computing, how data is represented in computers, the fundamentals of digital logic and the impact computers are having on society. A large number of images are used to reinforce the text, and exercises are embedded inside the chapters with another set at the end of the chapter.If you are in the queue to teach an introduction to computer science course, then you should examine this book. It is well written and the level of presentation is appropriate for the typical student taking such a course. It could also be used for self-study."},{"Title":"A Balanced Introduction to Computer Science","review":"This book was required for a college course. It is a great book to learn about Computer Science in general. The book focuses on the internet and creating basic Web-pages. You will learn how to work with JavaScript and HTML code. You gain the knowledge to generally understand how to possibly make a Forum website. The book stresses text/number input, manipulation of text/numbers, and then output of text/numbers in various ways. You will learn about the history of the internet, the difference between what the Internet is and the World Wide Web. Yes, there is a difference! The drawback to this book is that there are a lot of type-o's in the code examples. You will learn enough in the book to be able to proof read the example, but it may cause you some headaches."},{"Title":"A Balanced Introduction to Computer Science","review":"I had to buy this book for class, and I've been trudging through the exercises for the last month. Reed does a good job of explaining things and starting with basics and then building on them. I don't ever stress about the exercises, because in general they are rather easy, though they do consistently take longer than I expect them to take. Good for learning HTML & Javascript basics."},{"Title":"A Balanced Introduction to Computer Science","review":"This book has a well balanced approach to explaining the topic of computer science. The author covers the history of computer science along with real world applications. The book breaks down key computer science topics with good diagrams and easy to understand language in addressing issues like the internet, networking, the internal workings of computers, and application development. In addition, the book provides thought provoking questions and introduces example programs that help the reader solidify their understanding of the concepts. I recommend this book to anyone trying to grasp the world of computer science."},{"Title":"A Balanced Introduction to Computer Science","review":"I was asked to grade students' homework based on Chapter 10 of this book. I found that this book contains a lot of mistakes and complicates the subject greatly. Moreover, some side-notes miss the right-most part of the text, i.e. you cannot read those side-notes without guessing what letters are missing.For example, in the aforementioned Chapter 10, there is a diagram, which shows that public-key encryption involves the following: the sender first encrypts the message with private key, then with public key; the recipient first decrypts the message with private key, then with public key. This sounds quite complicated, and looks like they have tried to present encryption and signature-verification at the same time, but call it \\"public key encryption\\". Clearly, it should not have been this complicated, or at least it should have been called appropriately.As one more example from Chapter 10: they say that for LANs Ethernet technology is used. They claim that this technology uses Ethernet bus, and when one computer sends a message to another computer, all computers receive the message and check the intended recipient of the message, and discard the messages that they are not intended to receive. (Clearly, this describes how Ethernet Hubs work, which can be found rarely these days as opposed to Fast Ethernet Switches.) However, later on they say that the speed of the aforementioned Ethernet is 10, 100, or 1000 Mbits per second. This is where the problem begins -- I have never saw a Gigabit Ethernet Hub (as opposed to Switch), and I don't think that Fast Ethernet Hubs were popular either. Clearly, this is one more instance of confusing the reader and presenting false information.I would never recommend this book to anyone. If the author wanted to keep the subject simple, he should have avoided the technical details all together. If he wanted to present some technical detail, then he should have made sure that they don't contradict each other and are not missing important points and updates."},{"Title":"A Balanced Introduction to Computer Science","review":"The book took a lot of time to come in, about two weeks, but it was almost new when it did come in, for a used book. I am a happy camper."},{"Title":"ALE, EDI, & IDoc Technologies for SAP, 2nd Edition (Prima Tech's SAP Book Series)","review":"I've read both the Arvind Nagpal and Rajeev Kasturi books, and I conclude that the Nagpal book is much better for me, a person who has been doing SAP EDI for several years.I do not know either of these authors. I do not have anything to do with the publishers. I bet this is more than many of the reviewers here can say!I know that sheer bulk is not what we are buying here, but let's do some numbers to examine one aspect of the comparison. The Kasturi book starts with 388 pages. Well over 100 pages in the back are tables out of SAP that we can print any time we want (or save a tree and just pull up a screen). Since I've worked with SAP EDI for a few years, I didn't expect a lot of things to be new to me in the first 3 or 4 chapters, but man, there was nothing even moderatly interesting to me in the early part of the book. That left about 150 pages in the middle that, I'll admit, I only skimmed. But the per-page cost of those few possibly valuable pages is quite high! There was a strong ALE / example flavor to the book. As if someone wrote about a few of their favorite implementations.Now, the Nagpal book starts with quite a few more pages (786). There is NOT a huge section of this book dedicated to stuff I could print out of or look up in SAP. Yes, some of this stuff is 'light' too. And again, I'll admit to skimming a lot of it that I didn't have a pressing need to know right now. And yes, there are quite a few print-screens in the book (but I LIKE print-screens). The bottom line is that I, a person who's been using SAP-EDI quite a while, found the Nagpal title MORE INTERESTING, INFORMATIVE, and found it had MORE INFORMATION than the Kasturi book.--Dale--"},{"Title":"ALE, EDI, & IDoc Technologies for SAP, 2nd Edition (Prima Tech's SAP Book Series)","review":"Thank you for an excellent book! I think it would be safe to say that this book has saved my company more than $30K in consulting costs already. I expect the savings to increase because his recommendations will allow us to implement a system with the proper controls in place to avoid costly errors. I have found Mr. Nagpal's book an invaluable reference to assist me in connecting our SAP 4.0B system to our major Canadian retailer customers.I think SAP or the EAI vendors should give this book out with every licence! It's like a patient (and affordable!) SAP EDI consultant walking you through every step of the way.I own both books and this one is by far the most useful.

It's one of those rare books where each line makes so much of sense to an expert yet crystal clear to even new comers. This books covers almost everything that an ALE/EDI consultant should know. It starts with the basic concepts of EDI, ALE, IDocs and Workflow while explaining the typical business processes involved. This should help people aspiring to get into this field. Then it dwells more deeply on the concepts of ALE/EDI configuration (Customer Distribution Model, RFC destinations, ports &amp; partner profile), Message Control, Workflow configuration, Idoc programming/reduction/extension and so on. Even a seasoned ALE/EDI/IDoc expert would find a few techniques/tips/work-arounds that are really helpful in practicality.The presentation is really cool and is enhanced greatly by neat diagrams (nowhere else did I find such explanatory diagrams, certainly neither in SAP documentation nor in their training material...perhaps it came from the author's years of practice and teaching!).Finally, I have been working in ALE/EDI/IDocs for the past 1.5 years and I feel that whatever I learnt so far has been, more or less, consolidated into this ALE/EDI/IDocs bible!!!-Venkat"},{"Title":"ALE, EDI, & IDoc Technologies for SAP, 2nd Edition (Prima Tech's SAP Book Series)","review":"I have worked on two SAP implementations as a programmer in the ALE and EDI area.

The breadth and depth of the material covered in the book has been well balanced. I found it fairly simple to navigate quickly to my area of interest.....thanks to a detailed table of contents. It was nice to see some of the same tips and suggestions as he has regularly shared with us on the SAP Internet discussion groups for several years.

The characters are largely true to their counterparts in the movie, and both the expanded dialogue and the internal thoughts of the crew have a ring of the genuine to them.This novelization was apparently based on an extremely early transcript of the screenplay and there are several noticeable differences between the film and the book, which is slightly disappointing if you read film novelizations as a companion to flesh out the film more fully. Most notably, the dead alien with the chest-burst rib cage is missing - a very jarring omission which had me flipping back and forth, wondering where it had got to - and a great deal of the final plot with Ash's betrayal is different, with Ash deliberately and openly interceding to save the alien from being shot out an airlock.Even considering the omissions, there is a great deal here for fans of the movie to enjoy. The alien facehugger is described very nicely, with frequent allusions to its 'skeletal hand' appearance. (The final form of the alien is described almost not at all, however, presumably due to vagueness in the written screenplay.) The internal thoughts of the crew are fleshed out nicely, with a particular emphasis on Ripley of course, but with flourishes that greatly humanize Dallas and Parker in particular. There is foreshadowing of Kane's ultimate demise, with a mysterious black 'blotch' on the medical scanner over Kane's lungs, and Ash explains how the Company had known that the alien was there (having picked up and translated the warning via long-range scans), and had substituted Ash for the previous science officer right before the Nostromo's regularly scheduled trip, in the hopes that they would pick up an alien and 'accidentally' bring it back to Earth, bypassing the questions and quarantines that a direct mission would have generated. There is also a very nice included scene that was eventually (and in my opinion, unfortunately) cut from the film, where Ripley discovers a cocooned Brett and Dallas, and is forced to euthanize her former friend.The most disappointing aspect of this book, however, is that the pacing is excessively slow and dull, particularly in the beginning. Even the first few pages crawl painfully, as Foster \\"introduces\\" each cryo-sleeping crew member by describing their dreams and discussing whether they would be candidates for 'professional dreamers' and whether their dreams are restless or ordered, pleasant or painful, hazy or distinct. The writing style is what I would deem 'experimental' and I think it might have even worked well if Foster had felt comfortable including more physical detail, but since he was trying to match a movie that apparently hadn't finished yet, details like the appearance of the crew, the ship, the planet, and the alien are kept to a minimum, leaving only the heavy speculative prose.If you're a die-hard fan of the series, this book is worth checking out, but just factor in the slow-pacing and don't expect too much. For what it is worth, I am now reading Foster's sequelAliens, and so far the author seems to have corrected all the writing 'mistakes' in \\"Alien\\", indicating either growth on the part of the author, or a more complete screenplay source, or both. So if there's a chance that you might read the entire series of alien film novelizations, I recommend starting with this one and just remembering that they get better.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Alien","review":"Having never seen the movie in its entirety, I came into this book without having any preconceived notions of what was supposed to happen, as according to the movie. It was an interesting premise, given that the crew was sent to their slaughter to find out why another alien vessel was warning everyone to stay away from the planet, and just what happened to the people that were chosen to host the alien offspring. The most disconcerting thing was that the alien was never fully described, so even though I had an image based off of what little I have seen, I was also able to think up something rather scary to me. All in all a very suspenseful read for me, since I didn't know how it would end."},{"Title":"Alien","review":"Novelizing a screenplay is a funny idea in itself. The passive voice/faux eloquence can certainly be laughable, but the real entertainment comes from scenes that deviate so strongly from the film that you end up scratching your head even if you initially sneer. It's worth it for the curiosity factor, but don't expect it to add any weight or depth to the Alien mythos."},{"Title":"Alien","review":"Based on the 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot;, this novel is one of my favorites. It is very interesting, suspensful, and dramatic. A survival story of the crew on the spaceship &quot;Nostromo&quot;, who land on an uncharted planet to investigate what they believe to be a distress call, and bring back the most horrifying creature they've ever seen. When I first read it, I was so intrigued, I read the entire book in one sitting. You've never read a Sci-Fi novel until you've read &quot;Alien&quot;! That's my two cents."},{"Title":"Alien","review":"I was eleven, I think, when Alien came out. Being a die-hard nerd kid and into Star Trek, Star Wars, and all that, I begged and pleaded my parents to take me to this movie. They refused, saying I was too young, but we had a long-standing tradition in our family of the kids being allowed to read anything we could get our grubby little hands on, even though movies, television, and music were under tight parental control.So, my dad let me read the book.It scared the living crap out of me, and I have nightmares to this day about it.Some years later, when I did eventually rent and watch the movie, it was no big deal. I found it kind of silly, actually, and HR Geiger's images never particularly bothered me. I was probably sixteen by then. Was the book really that much scarier than the movie, or did it have the effect on me that it did because I was so young? You have to understand, when I read the book, I had no idea what the plot was, had never seen any pictures of Geiger's monster, and the only image I had for the whole thing was the ominous cracking egg on the front cover. That egg, if you didn't already know, bears no resemblance at all to the pods in the movies. If anything, it looks like it's about to hatch a radioactive chicken, but that can be pretty scary stuff to an eleven-year-old with an active imagination.And that is where Foster shines in this adaptation. He lets your imagination run wild. The pacing of the book is slow, but that kind of sucks you into that world. If the monster just jumps out at you in the first page, it's not as scary. He lets the suspense build, and when the monster does arrive, he never shows it to you, never offers a physical description. He lets you come up with that, and the monster in my head was much worse (to me) than anything Geiger could do.None of you reading this, probably, will start from the blank slate I did back then, so you are unlikely to have the same experience I had reading this book. In our media-saturated culture, it may not be possible to duplicate that experience. More's the pity.I'm ordering this for my own son, who is thirteen and has never seen any of the movies. I think he is too young for them, but I will let him read the book..."},{"Title":"Alien","review":"In space, no one can hear you scream.Seven cryogenically frozen dreamers are awakened aboard the interstellar tug Nostromo.

Both treatments are made precisely and Mr. Foster deserves the highest rank."},{"Title":"Alien","review":"When I was a teenager, I had scores of guilty pleasures; after shedding the majority of them in my twenties, few remain. Among these last silly indulgences are movie novelizations, the first feature-length books that I read as a child. Revisiting these books in the twilight of my young adulthood, I've noted that most of them are terrible, but a few do exist that are worth reading. Alan Dean Foster's adaptation of Ridley Scott's widely (and rightly) celebrated space horror film is among the latter of these.Based very loosely on an early draft of O'Bannon and Shusett's script, Foster's Alien differs greatly from the film. The basic scenario and the characters are essentially the same, but the differences aren't limited to mere details. Scribed from a source prior to numerous rewrites, the influence exerted by visual genius H.R. Giger, on-set tweaking and Scott's own judicious post-production editing, this is certainly not what you'll see onscreen.That said, the book is capably written. It only hints at the sporadic brilliance that Foster would later develop and implement in numerous film novelizations and his own original fantasy and sci-fi novels, but it is effective. The pace of the narrative is deliberately uneven and yields mixed results. While the book's slow first half does gradually generate tension, it's also quite dull in spots, often concentrating on minutiae that isn't of much interest. On the other hand, the last fifteen pages are a whirlwind of action, much of which is quite thrilling.While the fully-grown alien is revealed sparingly throughout the film, Foster wisely chose not to describe its' appearance, only acknowledging its' large size to imply the creature's power and ability to intimidate. The more gruesome happenings are also hinted at with great effect, allowing the reader's imagination to visualize the gore between the lines.Quite a few sequences in the book aren't to be seen in the original theatrical cut of the movie. Most of these are based on scenes that were cut from earlier script drafts, a few that were only partially shot, and numerous well-known outtakes that later resurfaced in laserdisc and DVD editions of the film, as well as the 2003 director's cut. While many of these portions were cut to preserve pacing, consistency or overall quality, they're all very effective in a written context. Foster's depiction of a scene wherein Ripley discovers Dallas and Brett's cocooned bodies is far more creepy than the middling equivalent that was cut from the 1979 theatrical release.Most tie-in novelizations are subject to poor quality control, but I only noticed a few misspellings here. However, Dallas casually glances at Brett (actually Parker) nine pages after the assistant engineer has been picked off! This is the only serious mistake that I found in this book.Of course, no tie-in novelization ever came close to crossing over as a serious work of genuine literature. But Alien is a pretty solid pop novel for its' genre. Employing the slightly prolix dialogue, uncompromising situations and exhaustive detail characteristic of 20th century science fiction, this would probably be regarded as a minor classic had it been released as an original novel in the '20s or '30s. As it is, it's still superior to most of the laughably juvenile trash that passes for adult sci-fi these days.This is one of Foster's earliest movie novelizations and his second adaptation of a screenplay by Dan O'Bannon; the first is that of Dark Star, the quirky B-movie that O'Bannon created in collaboration with John Carpenter. Just as certain elements of Dark Star were recycled in Alien, the same recurring features can be found in both books. Although these novels have long since gone out of print, they're both cheaply available via Amazon and make for a fun (albeit brief) reading double-bill.Just don't expect high terror on the order of Lovecraft."},{"Title":"Alien","review":"Even if you have seen the un-cut version of the movie, this novelization adds so much more to the story."},{"Title":"Alien","review":"This is the review for the novelization of Alien - for some reason, every other review that I've found here has been for the movie.Alan Dean Foster's novelization of Alien is a stark, somewhat barren re-telling of the story that most of us are familiar with. However, the rather dry, impersonal style used in narrating the story actually adds to the horror and sense of hopelessness.Some interesting tidbits which were either added to the story by Foster or which were in the original script and ended up on the cutting room floor are:1) Ripley sensing something odd about Ash and asking Lambert if she had ever slept with him (the answer is: no - Lambert goes on to say that she never even got the sense that Ash was interested).2) Lambert suggesting an \\"alternative\\" to hunting down the Alien...suicide...she holds up a bunch of suicide pills and states that this is a pretty painless alternative to getting ripped to pieces by the Alien. For me, this added to the almost depressing sense of hopelessness of the story - the situation of the crew was so dismal that some of them began to consider suicide as an 'option'.3) The crew discovers the Alien has escaped into the air ducts after they burst into a supply room and flame the contents - which happen to be canned food, etc. - the Alien didn't grow that big before killing Brett by just metabolizing air.4) Ash, when he tells the crew that they can not kill the Alien, states that the crew of the derelict space ship in which the eggs were found were, no doubt, larger/stronger and more intelligent than humans...and even they were overcome.5) Ripley, before she abandons ship, discovers the bodies of Brett and Dallas. They have both been cacooned by the Alien and impregnated by a parasite. The life cycle of the Alien as conceived in this version is much different from that of the social insect analog as pictured in Aliens - in fact, Ash compares the Alien to certain species of parasitic wasps which lay their eggs in unsuspecting spiders which go about their lives while the wasp larvae eat/kill them alive. This scene was actually filmed and can be seen in certain cuts of the film but I was disappointed...the scene, as conveyed in the novelization, was pretty macabre...the actual filmed scene was not very convincing (which was probably one of the reasons - outside of pacing - it was cut from the final theatrical cut).6) As mentioned above, Ash hypthesizes that the life cycle of the Alien is similar to certain parasitic wasps on Earth. The Alien was envisioned as being more of a solitary animal rather than the social insect analog seen in the sequels. Essentially, the facehugger implants the embryo, the embryo bursts out, grows, captures prey, cacoons them, implants them with an egg. etc. This was a more satisfying hypothetical life cycle for me since the whole 'parasite-social insect' angle doesn't really seem too convincing to me.7) Passing mention is made of Ripley's home town - a little village somewhere in El Salvador.In my experience, most novelizations of movies tend to be \\"lacking\\"...they're either bare bones, providing nothing more than a threadbare summary of the narrative of the movie itself or they go off the deep end, providing a lot of \\"extra\\" information that often fails to mesh with the original narrative. Alien is one of the few movie novelizations that I've read which actually seems to work and has merit as an entity separate from the movie itself. It would be difficult for any novelization to capture the sense of disgust and fascination that H. Geiger's design of the Alien evoked in many viewers and Foster doesn't (wisely) even try - instead, he concentrates on the feeling of hopelessness on the part of the crew as they attempt to deal with an entity that always seemes to be one step ahead of them and whose goal is nothing more than a metaphorical rape and forced pregnancy (and eventual, horribly painful childbirth) of its victims."},{"Title":"Alien","review":"This was a really well-written book, not like most awful movie and TV novelizations these days. I'm guessing it was written before that turned into mass market industry.Alan Dean Foster is actually a real writer, with real talent, so this book is worth reading even if you've seen the movie- In fact it will tell you a lot more stuff not told, or only briefly mentioned in the movie, and you get to know the other characters better, besides Ripley."},{"Title":"Alien","review":"I really enjoyed reading the book Alien becuse it didn't have over-descriptions on the situations and all the junk that normal books have and that I don't care about. I also liked it because the story was good, (I originally got it because of the movie), and that it was more in depth on the characters than normal books are. I like the originality of the writing style, a little crude at times, but effective. I think that it could be read by children, although it is fairly violent, (not any more than most TV shows, and less than the movie), and it has some vocabluary that children won't know, (there were actually I few that I didn't). But, if you're a sci-fi fan, or just a fan of the movie, I suggest this book."},{"Title":"Alien","review":"(...)To set the record straight, the very first Alien movie will always be regarded as a classic instead of blatant imitators like Predator. Whereas Predator looked and feel blatantly 1980s, Alien still look like it could have been shot a year ago. Alien set the blueprint and the standards for the film of the genre, which none, in my opinion,has surpassed, much less equaled. It is a film that you watch with repeated viewing and learn to appreciate its complexity whereas its imitators (and unfortunately, sequels) relied on cheap thrills, gore, and caters to those with the attention span of a gnat. Granted, I enjoy shoot em up non stop action. Just don't compare these films to Alien as an equal. It is easier to film a shoot 'em up than to film a movie that manipulate the audience's imagination and senses.Now, onto the book. Alan Dean Foster's novelization, compared to the film, is a bit of a let down...espcially when the film relied on stunning (and spooky) set designs. Reading the book you don't seem to get the impression that the alien is this phallic-headed double jawed skeletal monstrosity. In fact, the alien is barely described at all.The novel is more sci-fi and less horror, and it is based on previous screenplays of films, many of the elements (and dialouge) of which was discarded in the film. Because it is not based on what was shot but what WAS written, the novel differs from the film in various key points: the attack scene of Parker and Lambert was kind of bland and straightforward, Ripley never even found her compatriot's bodies. She just realized she was the last survivor and tore butt out of there. The scene with the alien in the airlock (which was never filmed) was retained, and so was the cocoon sequence and Lambert and Ripley's altercation. All of the character retain their basic personality...with the exception of Lambert. In the film, she and Ripley were polar opposites, in the book, there was really no differentiation between the two women...she wasn't teary or hysterical.In all, the novelization of Alien kind of dull the film. The illustrated version, if you can find it, is more accurate...and it showed how Brett was REALLY killed in the film before the Ridley Scott went editing crazy."},{"Title":"Alien","review":"When reading this book I was expecting it to be a lot like the film. It does have a lot of similarities to the film but not as much as I expected. Odviously more happens in the book than the film, as scenes are longer with more dramatism and more interaction between characters. The book, just like the film, starts off pretty slow. Leading the reader into a snail pace introduction that lasts for a about 100 pages before reaching anything interesting. But when some activity starts to happen, the book becomes very interesting and a little engrossing. 'Alien' is a very good story in my opinion, so when reading the book I was expecting more. However, I got less. More stuff does happen in the book, but its the way its described and explained that dissapoints me. Terrorizing scenes that show the alien are very basic. For example: the part where the alien burts out of a crew members chest is short, bland and not detailed enough for the reader to experience. This moment is described breifly with less emotion and with no sence of atmosphere than expected. Another thing in this book thats dissapointing, is the description of the alien itself. There is almost no description of the alien's features, movement, size and appearence. The book's description if the alien entering a room is e.g.\\"Then Ripley saw the alien enter the control room\\", which to me is weak.*[I know that i'm referring the differences between the film and the book, because I saw the film before reading this book which results in an automatic differenciation. Which is normal.]*As the book progresses, sightings of the alien aswell as horrific deaths are slightly different from the film and less engaging. This is a shame but still acceptable as it is the story that counts. The climatic ending is very different from the film and shortened. Which results in the book's fair conclusion to a close.Overall, 'Alien' by Alan Dean Foster is an OK book. More of a sci-fi thriller than a horror, I would give this novel 3.5 stars as it is a good read and a brilliant story. The only thing that let it down for me is the book's attention to detail. Perhaps if I had read the novel before seeing the brilliant film, I might have given it a higher rating. So, in this case the book is NOT as good as the film."},{"Title":"Alien","review":"THIS BOOK IS CLOSE TO THE WAY THE MOVIE WENT. IT HAS SOME MINOR CHANGES BUT NOTHING EARTH SHAKING.

Being published in 1993, it cannot be expected to deal with digital photography, which since then has completely replaced film photography except in minor specialty niches. Film-related chapters cover about one-third of the book. The rest of the book materials, however, remain largely relevant and useful. Perhaps the most useful parts today relate to the setting up of studios, including tripod and lighting placement, and the principles of outdoors photography with ambient light.The subjects are treated in a qualitative way, and slightly more in depth that typical for books on beginner amateur photography. This book can help an amateur photographer move from beginner to intermediate level, but it should be complemented by more recent literature. It is not likely to be particularly useful to an advanced amateur or professional photographer, although it can deserve a place on a shelf of photography books for occasional consultation."},{"Title":"Readings in Artificial Intelligence and Databases","review":"This book covers the essence of expert systems, and the use of expert systems supported by databases.

As a historical document regarding the history of Wicca in particular and Neopaganism in general, it should be on every bookshelf. As a source of insight into the actual practice, it is, by necessity, as others have pointed out, incomplete. I should mention that, as a Pagan, but not Wiccan, occultist with a keen amateur interest in the history of the Pagan and occult revivals, my own point of view partakes of both.I found it fascinating to watch Gardner (GBG) alternate between the etic viewpoint of an anthropologist, describing the coven from an outsider's view, and the emic viewpoint of an initiate, the latter view often introduced by the phrase, \\"when I was inside.\\" When he describes ritual, or places certain customs in context by reference to their effect on magick, he does not generally cite his own experience, but refers to \\"the Witches\\" as if he were not one. I suppose he is trying to project an image of objective scholarship, but it comes off more as coyness or ingenuousness to my eyes.If you're an initiate of Trad Witchcraft, you already know much more than what GBG reveals here, and if you are not, you'll have to just respect the fact that he seems to have honored his oaths and not told any important secrets other than that the revived Craft existed (and, yes, according to the Ardanes, that is a protected secret), which I have to suppose was his intent, in which he succeeded, probably beyond his wildest imaginings.My own current _theory_, based on extensive but by no means complete readings of the available material, is that GBG did indeed meet people who were practicing the Craft in what they thought was an ancient form, based on the available materials (which have since been cast into considerable doubt by scholars), and at some point he needed to decide between following and elaborating on Witchcraft or pursuing his previous project of reviving the O.T.O. in Britain. He obviously chose the former, and presided over the public launching of a creative and influential current in the Pagan and occult revivals."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"\\"Witchcraft Today\\" is Gardner's 4th book &amp; his1st non-fiction book dealing specifically with Wicca. First publishedin 1953 it supports Margaret Murray's theory that witchcraft was a pre-Christian pagan religion in Britain. It then takes the theory one step farther as Gardner makes claim to having found &amp; joined a coven of witches whom he believed to be the last remnants of this old religion. Sworn to secrecy, Gardner finds himself in the difficult position of wanting to explain the details without breaking his oath. The end result is rather disappointing. While this is indeed the 1st book on Wicca &amp; has become the founding text for most Wiccans, the book actually contains very little Wiccan material. Those seeking actual Wiccan rituals described in detail must look elsewhere. Gardner omits any such step by step instructions &amp; gives us only tantalizing hints, glimpses &amp; references instead. Critics like Aidan Kelly often claim this is because Gardner was making up the material as he went &amp; at this point much of the material had yet to be written. Other, more friendly, critics like Doreen Valiente say Gardener's vagueness comes from his vow of secrecy &amp; is evidence that he truly did discover a pre-existing coven. They argue that if Gardner did fabricate the whole thing himself he would have publicized the material as much as possible &amp; his hesitation shows that the material wasn't his to freely disperse. Either way, the book remains required reading to most Wiccans today &amp; is an interesting study of pagan ideas through time &amp; space. Like his predecessor, Margaret Murray, Gardner tries to show that \\"the old religion\\" is indeed old, possibly even an echo of pre-Christian druidic beliefs. He seeks for evidence of the cult in all time periods from the Neolithic to modern England. Not only does he scour the whole of time but he also circles the globe, pulling in hints &amp; traces from nearly every continent in his desire to show that Wicca is a continuation of ancient pagan religious ideas. Whether or not you believe Gardner's claim, it's clear that \\"Witchcraft Today\\" is the catalyst that touched off the Wiccan movement that has grown to dominate the modern pagan community."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"These days it seems the fashion to be a dabbler in the occult. People who are followers of the fashion, and not the religion, need not waste their money on anything by Gardner. If you want to don your \\"mystical\\" robe, flap your hands and recite \\"all-powerful\\" spells and incantations, *please* do NOT buy this book. There are too many serious students out there who need it more than you. You would do much better to buy a book of spells that has a really \\"cool\\" cover that your friends can Oooh and Ahhh over while you whisper that you're a *Witch*.Meanwhile, if you are a serious student of the Craft, this book is for you. Many people say that it's a let-down because it doesn't spell out the how-to's of Wiccan ritual, or that its best quality is its historical importance. Yes, that's all true. It's also true that Gardner had a rather dry (if intriguing) writing style. However, better than giving the ABCs of writing a spell or ritual, GBG gives you an *understanding* of Witchcraft. This book makes you flex your gray matter and actually *think* about Witchcraft as more than just a Hollywood stereotype. There is a reason \\"Witchcraft Today\\" is on almost every recommended reading list for Groves and Covens: it is fundamental preparation for insights yet to come..."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"In his classic 1954 work _Witchcraft Today_, Gerald Gardner constructed an intricate theory for the origin of the ancient witch-cult whose rituals, he claimed, he had been invited to witness and report on. According to Gardner, these British witches were carrying on a tradition handed down to them by their parents and grandparents, practices originating far back in the mists of time. Since he did not disclose identifying details about who or where these witches were, meaning that nothing of them can be verified, it is impossible to tell if he had truly penetrated an ancient, secretive cult, or if the story he told was nothing more than an elaborate fantasy. Claiming that the witches themselves did not know their origins, Gardner weaves together a rather incredible explanation on their behalf: Witches, he said, were the descendants of an aboriginal British race driven into hiding for their continuing practice of their indigenous religion, magic. What's more, this aboriginal race was actually a pygmy race which, when driven into hiding, gave rise to legends of \\"little people,\\" faeries, pixies, elves, and other magical folk, who even though eventually intermarrying with the larger population, still retained their magical ways.There are a number of problems with this explanation. First, there is the historical problem. Gardner identifies the Picts, a non-Celtic people of Britain inhabiting the northern area of Britain (modern Scotland) from pre-Roman times, and which by 900 A.D. had disappeared, as the aboriginal pygymy race from which the witches derive their traditions. According to him, \\"they were much the same as the present-day pygmies of Africa, small people bullied by their bigger neighbours and driven out of the best lands into the hills and woods and other inaccessible places. They raid cultivated fields and play pranks, but if their thefts are forgiven and food is sometimes left out for them, they will, in return, leave gifts of their hunting spoils, meat, ivory and skins\\" (p. 56). Additionally, he finds a linguistic link in the English word pixie and the Roman name for these peoples, the Picti.It all sounds good at first, but it doesn't hold water. First off, none of the sources contemporary to the Picts describe them as being pygmies! Roman accounts of the invasion and conquest of Britain and her native peoples make no mention of the Picts' unusual size, nor do the Anglo-Saxons some five hundred years later. Bede, historian of the English people, writing in the seventh century, when the Picts were still known, does not describe them thus; in fact, it is not until the fifteenth century, five hundred years after they had ceased to be known as a separate people, that anyone describes them as being little: the Bishop of the Orkneys says of them that they \\"were only a little exceeding pygmies on stature and worked wonderfully in the construction of their cities evening and morning, but at midday they hid themselves in little underground houses, fearing light.\\"Further, there is a lack of archeological evidence to support the idea that the Picts were little people. No skeletons, no systematic ruins, nothing. The totality of Gardner's archeological evidence for the Picts' pygmy nature rests on a handful of inexplicably cramped cells. Given the fevered pitch of the medieval imagination, it's likely that it was just this sort of random cell which gave rise to the original suspicion of the ancient peoples' being pygmies.But what happened to the Picts? The same thing that happened to every other native population: They intermarried with the invaders and formed a new stock of people. It isn't as interesting as the theory that they hid themselves for a few hundred years, but it is, unfortunately for romantics, standard operating procedure in the world of conquest and invasion. Another cultural habit kicks in here too: The memory of the \\"savage Picts\\" slowly transformed into folklore about an unnatural people to be feared, folklore with which to frighten children into being good and which bonded its tellers together against an unknown \\"other.\\" And it is this folklore which Gardner relies on as proof of the continued existence of the Picts as mysterious, magical \\"little people\\" feared by \\"civilized society.\\" All societies participate in this demonization of the other; its processes are too familiar to be taken seriously as a record of actual events.So, if not the survival of the practices of an ancient pixie-folk, what was Gardner's witch-cult? Probably not what he made it out to be. Did countryfolk of Gardner's day practice folk magic? Certainly, and one hopes customs of the sort will not be lost to modernization. Did they learn the custom from their parents and grandparents? Certainly. Was it the watered-down memory of ancient pagan practices? Absolutely. Were its practitioners voluble about the sorts of folk magic they knew? Most likely not, but not out of fear of Christian persecution--it is more likely that it was the magic itself they feared. But none of this adds up to the sort of cult Gardner describes, a more or less organized group practicing an elaborate ritual which reenacts a central myth remembered from pre-Christian times.The cult he describes, in fact, sounds suspiciously like the product of the theories current in Gardner's Victorian/Edwardian youth. Remember that science, particularly Darwin's theory of evolution, and archaeology, particularly the recent discovery of the Epic of Gilgamesh, with a Flood account which predated the account in Genesis, had effectively made belief in the Bible as a literal account of history difficult for educated people. Add to this the Romantic movement of the nineteenth century, with its concepts of the noble savage and the divinity of nature, and Gardner's proffered witch-cult becomes less plausible and more obviously the fruit of common nineteenth-century fancies. His witch-cult was a \\"purer\\" religion, one bequeathed to us by nobler ancestors, carried on in secret, and tuned in to nature, one to replace the discarded Christian religion. It was, in short, the perfect religion for its time."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"What if witches have really been around all along?To me, that's the main theory proposed by Gardner, and, if true, would require the rewriting of a great many textbooks.When one hears the word \\"witch\\", one usually thinks of Europe.Although the vast majority of the book deals with Europe, Gardner offers up possible bits and pieces of evidence from Africa and the Middle East. While all these are of varying quality, it is nice to see that someone took the time to offer a broader picture.Gardner quotes numerous passages from his various sources to further strengthen his theory, but even with all this there is much to be desired.For one, much of Gardner's research is, like it or not, hearsay. He supposedly got in touch with some witches, but alas, they can't give him all the details. The irony is that if those witches had made an exception and broke their silence, perhaps Gardner's theory might have become reality.I found it shocking too that even this supposed group of witches didn't know the answers to \\"the real meaning of the Sabbath\\" (pg. 147) and \\"do not know the origin of their cult\\" (pg. 43).To Gardner's credit, he doesn't try and pass his theory as proof. There are literally dozens of times where he says \\"possibly\\", \\"perhaps\\", \\"maybe\\", \\"presumably\\" and other words common when the topic is in a hypothetical stage.However, there are some times where his \\"facts\\" are skewed or not very well documented.On page 33 he mentions the Biblical \\"Huldah the Sorceress\\" of 2 Kings 22:14 and 2 Chronicles 34:22.However, there is no Bible that I'm aware of that translates her occupation as such. In the New International Version (US and UK), King James, New King James, New American Standard and even the Luther 1545 Bible, all translate it as \\"prophetess\\"--a very different occupation.The next thing that struck me was his claim on page 151 (and elsewhere) that \\"about nine million people died by torture in one way or another during the persecution.\\"I find this number hard to believe, for a couple of reasons. First of all, even allowing that the \\"Burning Times\\" were from 1300 to 1700 (a generous span of 400 years), a figure of 9 million would mean that every year 22,500 people were caught, tried and tortured/hanged/burned, or that for 400 years 61 people died daily as a result of the persecutions/inquisitions.Secondly, Gardner simply offers no documentation of these numbers.While definitely interesting, there is too much speculation and not enough hard evidence, making Gardner's idea of an old religion a witch's concoction that is hard to swallow."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to see what Gardner said in his first book that sparked the resurgance in Wicca. I did not find it. The book is very dated, both content and style, and some of the authors speculation is far fetched at best. I now realize I read it back in the early 1960's and thought it a poor read even then. If you are interested in Wicca you might want this book for its historic value, but don't expect to learn anything useful from it."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"If you want to know why you have been called a fluffy bunny, then read Gerald Gardner's books. If you want to know the differences between Wicca (what is often called today by some British Traditional Wicca) and what some are calling NeoWicca then you need to abandoned what you think you know about Wicca, and start with the person who first introduced Wicca to the world. There is a big difference between the religion of Wicca, and the New Age spirituality called Wicca today. The only way you will know is if you educate yourself."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"While I think that people should read this book, since it was the first of its kind and the basis of modern Wicca/Witchcraft, it's no &#34;How to&#34; book. It's not even a very good &#34;History&#34; book. It reads more like a journal than anything and often tends to venture down tangents and focus (what seemed to me) excess attention on topics that only seemed to be loosely associated with the Craft. Thought/concept organization was fair to poor, but if you're patient and stick it out, it will get you thinking and will give you a glimpse into the mind and thought processes of the Wiccan &#34;movement&#34; at the time and one man's role within it."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"Enjoyed this book immensely - very informative of the history, misperceptions and how things evolved. Would recommend to anyone interested in a practical realistic view of the reality of The Craft."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"Consider that the book was written back in 1956 when the subject of witchcraft was relegated to the shadow and laws against witchcraft had recently been repealed. Gardner had been initiated into the coven in the 1930's. He writes as though he were a disinterested anthropologist yet he was a practitioner. What may have been an appropriate introduction back then is just a cursory view today. Gardner was the founder of Wicca or modern Wicca, so from that stand point the book has some value.If one wants a more thorough view of Wicca and the Witchcraft \\"Revival\\" one would do well to read books by Raymond Buckland, Doreen Valiente and others.Gerald Gardner writes his book to inform us that witches, though belonging to a dying cult, are still around. They have been around through the centuries and the worship of theancient God and Goddess has never died. Witches used to be rather influential and powerful often times they being the ones running things behind the scens and always for the benefit of mankind. The God and Goddess wanted only the best and though they were not all powerful they could use our help so they could in turn help us.Witches have been toruted relentlesy by the Catholic Church so that now their meeting are held quietly in someones home. They met in groups of thirteen and they keptr their knowledge of each other secret. The Church spread all soprts of rumor that they were Satanic and their rituals made mockery of the Catholic services. All is lies.Witches bliweve that it is wrong to harm other anhd so animal sacrifice is out of the question. Blood is not used in rituals despite it's extra power boost. Ceremonial magicians use their own blood. Sometimes Soecerer used the services of witches. The power of withc craft and psycghic abilities are al drawn from power generated with in. The dancing in the circle raises energy and to get results you need to whip your self up into a frenzy.Gardner seems to believe that the religion is inherited from the pygmies that used to inhabit the British isles before the invaders came. These pygmies were the fairies and they were armed with poisoned darts and magical powers. After a while they inter bred with the invader and became normal sized. Their powers faded as well.It is believed that the religion has Eastern origin possibly from Egypt. From Egypt part of the religion went into Europe and the other into West Africa. The book was designed it seems as a defense of Witchcraft. There are no spell or ritualsd denoted as that is all oathbound. TH books only value is that it is written by the father of Modern Day Witch Craft."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"only read if you are of the old way. If so it will turn your world upside down."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"I'm not going to speak ill of Mr Gardener, I know better. At a time when coming out of the broom closet was social suicide he went and wrote the primer for paganism. I don't agree with everything he writes, but the book is one all pagans/wiccans should read, if only to be familiar with his work. I should also mention it's easy to read, and at times hard to put down."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"Gardner takes you into the present knowledge and dis-information that is attached to this type of knowledge. It is very informative and educational."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"This text is usually required reading for some Traditional Wicca. It was more interesting than I thought it would be.From the material inside the book, one can research on their own with other material and get a good \\"guess\\" on who the Gardnerian God/dess are. Read material by Caesar, Sumer, Egypt, and modern (non Trad) Wicca books and you will be able to find much of what Gardner likely did inside his original groups. At the very least, reading this with the suggested material above will give you an edge on any paper you would have to write for the training groups.Also, the part about the Little People (chapter V), you have to take with a grain of salt. There has been no archeological proof that there ever were any little people in ancient Europe. If there were, why didn't Caesar (for one) write about them? Or any skeletons found? Or even the buildings (yes, I have been to Europe and have seen that the buildings are slightly shorter back then. But, the people were still above 5 feet tall and some of the building architecture was deliberately done the way it was for battle).Even though the book was originally written in the 1950's, the chapter on the aura is very interesting.Overall, get the book with the updated comments. It helps out with the rational of the author."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"this was cutting edge stuff when it first came out in the 1950s, but nowadays, it's mainly of historic value.

Interesting, nevertheless."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"With Hollywood and other media hype making witchcraft and the occult the cool thing, author Gerald Gardner is relatively unknown. This is THE book you should read if you want to be a practicing with, then get some spell books. This is hardcore if you take a look at the few pictures in this book there is a picture of a ritual room with a magick circle made in the fashion of the Key of Solomon. If you are interested in the history of the craft this is the first real book on witchcraft that put it into a belief system and alternative religion."},{"Title":"Witchcraft today","review":"Learning Gardner's ways is one of the best ways to learn where true wicca began.

Some have been a good read, others not. In all of them I have found at least something worthwhile. Not this time.This is the most confusing, redundant, turgid, and poorly edited book I have ever read. There seems to be an inverse relation between the amount of text devoted to a topic and its' complexity, e.g. \\"percentaging (sic) a table\\". The discussion, in chapter 16, on correlation and regression is without a doubt the single worst presentation on the topic I have ever seen. Since this is the 10th edition, you would think Babbie and the publisher would have gotten it right. They didn't. I think a more appropriate description is a first edition repeated nine times.Babbie may be a fine instructor and a prominent researcher, but this is a terrible piece of babble and banality.I would give the book a zero if the system allowed it."},{"Title":"The Practice of Social Research (with CD-ROM and InfoTrac)","review":"good service, a book matches description. suggest everyone to use this provider. i don't remember exactly how many days it took to deliver my order, but it was not too long. i am very satisfied with everything."},{"Title":"The Practice of Social Research (with CD-ROM and InfoTrac)","review":"Just started my master in educational research.

Clint Van Zandt provides a little background material about his growing up and makes no apologies for being a family man who loves his country and his agency. However, the autobiography takes off with the specific incidents including some overseas especially the more famous ones like the 1985 siege of the Covenant, the 1993 Waco confrontation with the Branch Davidians, the Unabomber, and his paradigm suggestion that Oklahoma City was tied to Waco not the Middle East. This is an excellent autobiography of a dedicated law enforcement official who spent a career FACING DOWN EVIL as it is the behind the scenes look at these cases and more that will grip the audience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Facing Down Evil","review":"\\"Facing Down Evil\\" is a legitimate, keenly observed look at the FBI and Hostage Negotiations by one of it's key players. Van Zandt brings a unique perspective of the Bureau to the page. He is real in his emotion and attitude and doesn't play the glory card so many others do in their memoirs. You actually feel as if you walk a mile in his shoes and it is a tough, yet gratifying path.

Given the authors background I was hoping for a book that went into some detail into his methods, beliefs and techniques of crisis negotiation. What I got was a very light but enjoyable read that covered his career in the FBI (including his battles with the beaucracy which I felt did not add to the story) and four incidents of crisis negotiating, which had some good basic tips. Waco got a mention - but only to say he will leave it to the next book - rather frustrating.My recommendation is, if you want a book on techniques, buy one of the others on the market (for example Van Zandt's fellow ex-agent Fred Lanceley's \\"On Scene Guide for Crisis Negotiators\\", or even Frank Bolz 'Hostage Cop\\"), but if you want a good read and an interesting story then this would be a good book to get."},{"Title":"Facing Down Evil","review":"I recommend this book to any one who enjoys a true-to-life FBI drama.Each chapter told a different edge-of-your seat story about this author's fascinating life as a negotiator/profiler for the FBI.Exceptional book and a great read!"},{"Title":"Facing Down Evil","review":"I really enjoyed this book and it had many interesting thoughts and details for someone looking to get into the FBI, like myself. However, I felt it layed a little too heavily on his family issues and Christian background. Not that I'm opposed to either, but I had assumed, by the synopsis of the book that the author would go into more detail about high profile cases he had worked on but did the exact opposite. He talked about cases that were probably least known to anyone reading the book.

She so adored them that she reread the seashore one several times and has since ordered it for her granddaughter.In particular, the books inspired our daughter to want to be a naturalist, or archeologist.

This book moves quite fast and you need to pay attention otherwise, you will lose the plot.The writing style for this book reflects the anxiety of the main characters as they track the components for a dirty bomb through Central Asia. If that was the intent then the authors achieved their goal.However, I think they missed an interesting subplot by not playing up the friction between Corrine (the lady lawyer) and Ferguson (who is trying to get killd before he dies of cancer).This is an average thriller against the back drop of the War on Terror."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"I have a new \\"worst book I've ever read\\" on my list after trudging through this garbage for the last three weeks. First Team has two things going for it. First, the book summary on the jacket because that is the only hope you have of following the plot, and second, the captions beginning each chapter that indicate where the characters are.Larry Bond's books have all been high quality novels, even though the last one he wrote wasn't as good. But he hasn't written anything in awhile then returns with this effort with co-author Jim Defilice. I don't know who wrote what, but somewhere along the line, they really botched this book up.The story involves a team that operates outside the law tracking terrorists. It has CIA man Fergeson, two special forces memberts Rankins and Connors and a marine called Guns. They are on the trail of terrorists trying to prevent a dirty bomb being set off in the USA.I seriously considered quitting this book after about 100 pages. At this point the problem wasn't the storytelling, but the horrendeous dialogue among the \\"First Team\\". I guess the authors were trying to add character to these people, but every other word was a joke or a lewd comment. This detracted from the story because it often seemed forced and out of place and incredibly unrealistic. I doubt soldiers trade crass jokes in the heat of battle.The horrible dialogue tapers off somewhat and then the horrible story takes over. The authors can't describe scenery at all and do a horrible job of telling the reader why characters are in Iran, then in Russia, then split up into teams, then together. Why are they following a train? Why do they stop? How do they get to a US airbase from following a train? Those easy questions are never answered.This book has the typical computer nerd working in a messy office at headquarters and he finds some useful info and shares it with the team in the field. Or at least I think he did. What he finds out and tracks makes no sense. The authors mention a May 11 memo. Where did this come from. Did I miss its introduction early in the novel?The president of the USA sends a sexy 26 year old attorney who amazingly has gone through special forces training out in the field to go with the \\"Team\\" and to make all key decisions. Ridiculous.The \\"authors\\" do a horrible job of setting up the premsis for the existence of the \\"First Team.\\" They do a baq job of writing characters and dialogue.

No plot; no believable characters; no suspense; no fun. By the end of this novel - if you get that far - you may well wonder as I did, why you wasted the time.

I immediately purchased this new novel as soon as available with great expectations. Alas, was not to be. This book was terribly disappointing, and a hard to finish reading. The story was choppy, the characters only cardboard cutouts that you could care less about. Nothing was in-depth and read like a book thrown together overnight by a couple of buddies over a beer. Even the hero, Ferguson, seemed more of an accident waiting to happen, and inept to say the least, to be leading a special forces strike team.

It all breaks down by the time the lead, Ferguson starts talking. When he and his team start talking it is nothing but wisecracks and misogynistic filth spewing out Ferguson and his team's mouth. The characters seems like cardboard cutouts. Devoid of life.On a side note when members of the team call a member named \\"Connors\\" who is neither the team leader nor over the age of 40 the nickname \\"dad\\". It is something that was super awkward whenever I read and bothered me a lot. That is not how normal people talk. I can't imagine anyone calling someone who is perhaps no more than 8 years older that. Just another example of the horrible dialogue.I especially despise the character Ferguson, he ruins the book for me. Somehow he is allowed on highly dangerous deep cover operations despite the fact he has thyroid cancer. It is barely explained (at least not where I made it to. I never finished) what he is doing about it. It just makes him unbelievable as a character. The fact is random and barely affects his personality. Other than he gets shaky when he doesnt have his pills.I could complain so much more about this book (such as the 26 year old lawyer who made it through special forces training just for the hell of it, uh I dont think thats possible) but I'd like to highlight one more thing. Things aren't explained well in this book. For example The Team goes to Iran. Its never really emphasized why or what importance it has to the plot. Events that happened are hardly explained why they're happening. Just more bad writing.So overall this poorly written, unbelievable piece of garbage is better left untouched.

Buying books, Larry Bond's and others, by way of Amazon.com is the cheapest and easiest way to find a good book. If you like action/adventure kinda books, all of Larry Bond's are great!"},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"What happened to Larry Bond? How could he - with even a little bit of self-respect - attach his name to this monstrosity? I've read all of Bond's works which preceded this awfulness, and found them quite interesting - even realistic and thought-provoking. They were always relevant to the political and military machinations of the times. That's why this book is such an oddball: the plot - as thin as that is - is absolutely unrealistic. The characters are all uber-stereotypical. The dialogue is immature. Its reads like a 12-year-old boy's soldier fantasies. I rolled my eyes through the 1st few chapters, then it got so bad that I started to skim through it, and my life was none the worse for it.This lacks any of the previous Larry Bond excellence that techno-thriller fans have come to enjoy, so I have to assume that Jim DeFelice - the co-author of this nonsense - bears the brunt of the responsibility. I will never read another book in the 'First Team' series again. This is the worst thing I've ever read."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"I was estatic when I found this book. I have been a fan of Larry Bond ever since I first Read \\"Red Storm Rising\\" which he co-wrote with Tom Clancy, following through every one of his other books. He writes a War Story as well as anyone in the business today. As a Veteran who has seen quite a lot of combat I know.I am VERY sad to say that this was not a very good book. The Story didn't make much sense. The charactors were not developed, heck in most cases, the characters weren't even explained as to WHO they were. I have read EVERY other book by Larry Bond and this is the only one I thought was bad. In all of his previous books the charactors were very detailed and real. In this book the charactors weren't even good enough to be called two-dimensional. Mr Bond always seems to colaborate with someone when he writes (Patrick Larkin and Tom Clancy) and It is VERY CLEAR in this instance which parts were written by Mr. Bond and which parts were written by Mr. Jim DeFelice.Please Mr. Bond, drop the Co-authors and write your next book alone. I know that Mr. Bond has a new book due out in May, 2005. I only hope he has gotten back to his roots in telling good stories with believable charactors."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"Potentially a good plot, but anemic characters.

From the first page to the last I found the plot twists and characters to be very entertaining."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"The plot of this book follows the normal thriller pattern - you meet the hero, there's a problem, more problems, blind alleys, etc. Which is all good. It moves very fast and there's a lot of action, etc. It doesn't skimp on combat, etc.But what stood out for me were the characters. They actually seemed affected by what happened in the book - they were more like real people, even the supposedly minor ones, than a lot of other books I seem to be reading these days. So much so that at some points they did things that annoyed me, even though they made sense to the characters themselves. By the end of the book I really cared about what was happening to them and I wanted to find out more - which I think is a sign that it was very good. I'd definitely pick up a sequel."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"I read a lot...and I love techo-thrillers, spies, war stories et al. I couldn't even finish this book.

Starts with a bang, and keeps on firing! Written as the first book of a series, the only thing missing in this book is the seriousness that we are used to seeing in Bond's earlier books.The plot is good, considering today's regular warnings of possible terrorist attacks within the U.S. Let's just hope Bin Ladin and his evil cohorts played their best card first, on Sept. 11, 2001, and that we don't have to worry about something like this happening in the near, or distant future.A little too much comaderie, and male bonding for a bunch of tough, action oriented Special Forces guys, but you need something to make these guys human, and not just cardboard cutouts of cartoon heroes. You get the feeling from the second chapter that this is the beginning of a series, but still, all in all, it was fun to read, if you don't take it TOO seriously.So just sit back and enjoy the action. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team","review":"The main idea is good but the action is really slow. People waiting for things to happen!

Not only an enigmatic and deeply disturbing tale about the individual's struggle against the chains of authoritarian oppression. The unnamed narrator (calling to memory \\"Big Brother\\" from Orwell's \\"1984\\") attempts repeatedly to put Biscuit to bed. This is one pup, however, with what Rand called \\"a strong sense of self,\\" what Heidegger referred to as \\"dasein\\". This is a dog that will not submit. The ending, left amibguous, seems to imply a victory on the part of the \\"Big Brother\\" character. But anyone with even the most basic understanding of denouement and characterization can tell that this is simply an allegory for the crushing weight of society breaking the backs of every individual--and, more than that, it is a cliffhanger. Because Biscuit will not quit. But even without the biting social commentary, \\"Biscuit\\" remains a classic of modern suspense. Will Biscuit EVER go to bed? Though I have already given the ending away, with this masterwork of post-modern existentialism, it is the journey, not the destination, that is key."},{"Title":"Biscuit (First I Can Read Book)","review":"My daughter is in first grade, and really struggles with reading.

Well, he wants \\"to play, a snack, a drink, to hear a story, his blanket, his doll, a hug, a kiss, a light on, to be tucked in, one more kiss, one more hug, and to curl up.\\" Thirty-five simple words are introduced and many are used over and over again so that the text eventually averages a little more than six words per page.

Biscuit is small. Biscuit is yellow. Every page includes the word Biscuit, so you either memorize the spelling or the meaning, or both). Perfect for kids in either age range. The only problem with the repetitiveness is that, well, it is repetitive. And without a rhyme or rhythm to hold you through, you might get bored reading it.

The binding on the book itself is soft, the pages cannot be turned easily which is frustrating for toddlers."},{"Title":"Biscuit (First I Can Read Book)","review":"The world contains a variety of easy reader books. Of these, most are pure drivel, some are fine but not terribly imaginative, and a very scant few, but the few that count, are remarkably witty for their simple constructions. \\"Biscuit\\" falls into the middle category. It's not going to knock your socks off or even surprise you any. But it contains what may well be one of the most adorable puppies ever to grace an \\"I Can Read Book\\". Reviewing \\"Biscuit\\" is difficult, if only because it's hardly any more sophisticated than those mind-numbingly dull \\"Spot\\" books by Eric Hill. So the verdict is, as I see it, that if you've found that your child adores reading \\"Biscuit\\" books (and there is quite a series of them out there) you could undoubtedly suffer a worse fate in life. It's a rather sweet story.Meet Biscuit. A puppy with pretensions of wide-awakefullness. As a little girl attempts to cajole her pup into bed, Biscuit (by mere woofing alone) comes up with a long list of demands. A snack, a drink, a story, and several other requests later, Biscuit is alone in bed but isn't sleepy in the least. So he high-tails it up to bed to tug on his mistress's bed sheets. Then, just as she peeks over, he snuggles down for a good night's rest.Like so many other books, this story takes an animal and places it in a situation that children will be familiar with the world over. Now, illustrator Pat Schories's pictures are very cute, yes. And author Alyssa Satin Capucilli's words are simple and easy for children to understand. But allow me to point out that the lesson taught in this tale was done in a far more amusing and (dare I say) adorable manner with Shelley Moore Thomas's easy reader book, \\"Good Night, Good Knight\\". Not that the two books are mutually exclusive. If your child has already fallen in love with Biscuit's antics (I'm just counting the days until there's a PBS tv show about him) then this is a cute tale to reread again. But if you're casually searching for good beginning reader tales and you'd like a story similar but better than this one, go get yourself a little \\"Good Night, Good Knight\\" for your troubles. This is a nice story. Just not a great one."},{"Title":"Biscuit (First I Can Read Book)","review":"We received 'Biscuit' as part of theI Can Read 50th Anniversary Box Set (I Can Read Book 1). Within the \\"I Can Read\\" series, Biscuit is rated at the very first level of proficiency, or 'Shared Reading', which happens to be exactly where my little girl is at this time.The book features large typefaces, absolutely lovely illustrations and a relatively small vocabulary, suitable for the 4-5 yr. old children to whom it is targeted.My little girl liked the story line - the interaction between a little girl and her puppy as the puppy is getting ready for bed. She enjoyed the reading experience so much, she made me promise that we are going to read it again tomorrow.The simple words, give her confidence and encourage her to apply the 'sounding' skills she develops at the kindergarten.Learning progresses as each page tends to introduce one new word while previously read words repeat.Following our 'Biscuit' experience, we decided to order theBiscuit Storybook Collection (Biscuit)which has 10 Biscuit adventures. Biscuit gets 5 stars without any reservations. Many thanks to both the author, Alisa Satin Capucilli and Pat Schories, the talented illustrator for making my girl happy and motivated to practice her reading.One note of caution: I was able to verify and I am testifying that Biscuit is a perfect book for a little girl. I am not sure if a little boy learning to read would be equally interested in the story line or impressed by it - basically what it takes to putting the little puppy to bed. It is possible that subsequent Biscuit adventure are more dynamic but I would not know it until I actually receive the 10-story collection."},{"Title":"More Peers","review":"This is another of Hilaire Belloc's classic verse books, illustrated by Basil Blackwood, originally published circa 1910.Like Cautionary Tales For Children, this one is meant to be a childrens' book but it was aimed primarily at adults. It's a sarcastic book about the British aristocracy. The first verse, for example, is about a member of the House of Lords whose doctor advises him to avoid talking for a few weeks for sake of his health. The unreleased words create such pent up pressure inside the Lord that he literally explodes, leaving the doctor unable to collect his consultation fee and resolved to collect his future fees in advance, in cash.The only problem with this free download is that is only contains the text; it does not include the Blackwood illustrations in the print version.

It doesn't help that the only film I could find that he gave a four-star review to (ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA II) was one that he happened to have a strong supporting role as an actor in. While there are some interesting items in the book in regards to the Hong Kong film industry, there simply aren't enough to make it worth wading through Fonoroff's continuous seeming hatred of his subject."},{"Title":"At the Hong Kong Movies: 600 Reviews from 1988 Till the Handover","review":"at a glance this book seems like a treasure for those who love HK movies and want a handy reference.

Start looking at the logic of things and these movies tend to fall apart (as do most all movies).He loses the sheer exhilaration of the viewer.So please, someone out there who actually loves these films---put together a comprehensive plot/review of HK films."},{"Title":"At the Hong Kong Movies: 600 Reviews from 1988 Till the Handover","review":"A middlebrow book with highbrow pretensions. I picked this book up at the airport hoping for a nice light read on the plane, and ended up wishing there was an 'EJECT' chute as I was halfway over the Pacific. Rarely have I ever read a book so bristling with enmity and disdain for its subject matter, and with such terrific cultural ignorance one wonders if any research was done other than hanging around the 'western' concessions and expat hangouts. I had thought that such 'colonial' condescension had passed with the times, but apparently it is still alive and well. That is the tone which informs this entire tome and permeates every review therein.. which is terribly unfortunate, given that the author's rather rare and privileged position would have afforded him valuable glimpses behind this once vibrant filmic community ( one can always hope for a second flowering, considering the recent output and the success of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, though not made in HK)... if only one had chosen to see with fresh eyes, rather than attempt to shoehorn every filmic tradition into tired Hollywood conventions of narrative film making.When faced with situations like this, one should give pause to one's examination of the subject at hand, and call into question the yardstick which is being used to take its measure.Also MOST notable for missing the boat on Wong Kar Wai."},{"Title":"At the Hong Kong Movies: 600 Reviews from 1988 Till the Handover","review":"Fonoroff's book is very comprehensive, covering if not all, then certainly most, HK films made between 1988 to 1997. He also knows the HK film industry well and it shows in the book. I don't disagree with all the comments below save one. This is NOT a book for the fan or the uninitiated. Fonoroff is perhaps a little too critical to satisfy the ordinary fan and certainly not complimentary enough to attract the uninitiated to the charms of HK cinema. Fonoroff is a film critic and so will be hard on films. However, for a man who has the patience to review 600 HK films, you would think that he must have some love for them. I think that perhaps Fonoroff does love/like HK cinema but you can hardly tell, he compliments too few of them. One comes away feeling that Fonoroff's just watches and reviews them because it's part of the job. I know this is a collection of his reviews written for the paper but I still can't help coming away feeling a little alienated. That said, I still think the book is good, I own it and will recommend it. I appreciate his alternative and objective views which sets this book apart from Logan's &quot;HK Action Cinema&quot; and Hammond's &quot;Sex and Zen and Bullet in the Head.&quot; I just don't recommend it to those who are HK film fanatics no matter what. And if you are trying to entice your friend into sampling a different kind of cinema get Hammond's or Logan's book. Now, if you don't need a ra-ra fan book AND would like a reference book then I say get this book. You'll get an insight into how the HK film industry works and you'll get some if not good, then at least alternative, commentary on 600 films."},{"Title":"At the Hong Kong Movies: 600 Reviews from 1988 Till the Handover","review":"I found the book extemely useful as a reference, particularly since the credits are in both English and Chinese. This is especially useful to movie fans over here in Singapore, where most HK movie fans would know the titles only in Chinese and often there is little or no relationship between the movie's Chinese and English titles.

Fonoroff is highly critical but he supports his opinions well. It's refreshing to hear such honest opinions and not the usual \\"rah rah\\" \\"isn't it wonderful\\" that so many Asian movie addicts feel obligated to dish out. Fonoroff is also lavish with his praise when he finds a movie he respects, which admittedly is rare. He also likes the trashy guilty pleasure flicks. I think what he respects most is movies that aren't pretentious, which includes the bad & the ugly along with the good. You can't deny he doesn't know his stuff. Unlike most foreign critics of Hong Kong movies, he's lived there for 20 years and speaks the language, plus he has a solid background in Hong Kong cinema."},{"Title":"At the Hong Kong Movies: 600 Reviews from 1988 Till the Handover","review":"I can't believe some of the negative comments I've read here by other reviewers. Whether or not you agree with Fonoroff's opinions, this book is an authorative and informative document covering the decade from the late 1980s to the late 1990s. Unlike a lot of Westerners who review Hong Kong movies on DVD long after their release, Fonoroff saw them when they first came out, and his reviews include many topical references that give an overall feeling for the time and place in which they were made. Plus, there's over 600 reviews in the book, covering all the major and most of the minor movies of the period. There isn't another book in English like it."},{"Title":"At the Hong Kong Movies: 600 Reviews from 1988 Till the Handover","review":"This book has universal appeal for all film enthusiasts. Fonoroff's comments are full of wit and wisdom. He provides a lively overview of a ten-year span of Hong Kong movies. Even though only a few of these films may be familiar, the reader gains insight into the essential elements that define a good movie -- in any language.These reviews show why Fonoroff has become a popular film critic and historian in China today."},{"Title":"At the Hong Kong Movies: 600 Reviews from 1988 Till the Handover","review":"This book is not only a collection of reviews, but a veritable history of recent Hong Kong cinema, as seen through the eyes of the man who is arguably the leading expert on Chinese Film today. The reviews are not only informed, elegant, witty, and to the point; together they reveal a consistent and illuminating perspective on the Hong Kong film industry of the last decade. Fonoroff clearly has his own, Hollywood-derived aesthetic, but in this his judgments always have the ring of truth insofar as the Hollywood style remains the pretension of most mainstream Honk Kong film products through to today. In this respect, Fonoroff's &quot;At the Hong Kong Movies&quot; is an excellent companion piece to his earlier volume &quot;Silver Light&quot; (still largely unavailable in the US), which is an indispensible pictorial history of Hong Kong cinema from its inception through the 1960s. Together the two volumes provide the best introduction to Hong Kong film that one could wish."},{"Title":"At the Hong Kong Movies: 600 Reviews from 1988 Till the Handover","review":"This book is unique.

After having read prominent 20th century texts from Camus to Derrida, I figured it was time to read something by Nietzsche, perhaps the most famous first figure to doubt what was &quot;knowable.&quot; Nietzsche, anticipating the cynicism and angst that would become the hallmark of existential texts, was equally scornful of religion AND science (both, which he argued, were reductionist and misleading). The ultimate skeptic, Nietzsche warned readers about believing to deeply in &quot;certain truths&quot; often framed within the dichotomy of binary opposites (good vs. evil, black vs. white, heaven vs. hell; in short, everything the Western world bases its moral framework on).I've given Beyond Good and Evil five stars, but there are some problems with the book that the unintiated may want to know. First, although this is the most straight-forward and accessible of Nietzsche's works, it's still a difficult read. Second, although Nietzsche's writing style is full of verve and gusto (or, to use N's own word, &quot;brio&quot;) and although this style makes for delightful anti-philosophic reading, his points do become burdensome after a while. After reading the introduction and the first 30 pages or so, I found myself saying, &quot;Okay, okay, I got it.&quot; Nietzsche's misogyny, his failure to provide concrete examples (occassionally) and his belief in a human two-level caste system (&quot;...life itself in its essence means appropriating, injuring, overpowering those who are foreign and weaker&quot; (152-153)) may challenge (or turn off) some readers. Neverhtheless, at 180 slim pages, Beyond Good and Evil accomplishes its task before it becomes tiresome."},{"Title":"Nietzsche: Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy)","review":"Though he was all but unread during his actual lifetime, the eventual impact of Friedrich Nietzsche's writings have had something of the effect of a hydrogen bomb being dropped on the world of philosophy. Though this is perhaps not Nietzsche's best book, it is probably the best one to read if you are not familar with his works, as it is a nice and concise introduction to his philosophy, and easier to get into than other works, such as the more famous Thus Spoke Zarathustra. In the course of this book, Nietzsche does nothing less than shake all of Western philosophy, including some of its most sacred and long-held tenets, to its core. Starting with the ancient Greeks and going all the way through the then-contemporary Schopenhauer, no one and nothing is safe from the scathing, vitrolic attack of Nietzsche's pen, being a critical assestment and denunciation of philosophy the level of which had not been seen since Voltaire - a man Nietzsche seems to have held a somewhat-reluctant admiration for (though he also speaks of a certain philosopher as being \\"more profound than Voltaire... and consequently a good deal more silent.\\") Nietzsche, herein, attacks some of our most sacred and fundamentally-held beliefs: boldly declaring that good and evil, ethics and morality, and more are simply mere cultural inventions, and cannot be objectively defined, while also telling us that there is no God, no soul, and that life is essentially meaningless and absurd. While all of these are obvious implications of Nietzsche's famous perspectiveism - and clearly give him full claim to the title of Grandfather of postmodernism and existentialinism - he was not, as is often claimed, a nihilist. No, Nietzsche tells us that there is one thing, at least, that is noble (if not quite virtuous): that which affirms life. Though this aspect of Nietzsche's philosophy is expanded upon much further in Zarathustra, we see that he was not, as one may tend to think from his writings, a pessimistic, gloomy, hopeless individual, but an enthusiastic person, full of zest for life, vowing that, despite everything, he would do it all over again. How many of us can truly say the same? That said, the book is not perfect: much of it is mere polemic, only vaguely philosophical, and, at times, downright embarrassing when read with the benefit of hindsight; the core of the book resides in the first two sections. Still, for those two alone, this book remains an essential philosophy read."},{"Title":"Nietzsche: Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy)","review":"Beyond Good and Evil is a criticism of the most profound depths of human existence. A testimony from a heightened spirit and his journey upon the fine line between attacking the system unaided and falling into the &quot;abyss&quot; of nihilism.Nietzsche antagonizes the school of thought that says 'the status quo of all things human leaves room for progression of the human mind, spirit and physiology.' All around him, Nietzsche sees that human existence is corrupted by the &quot;monsters&quot; encompassing it. These &quot;monsters&quot; are Nietzsche's metaphor for human ideas, modern and ancient, primitive or sophisticated. These ideas endemic of humanity, which he defines as limiting to human creativity, expression, and progression are: religion, equality, morality, democracy, nationalism, communism, classicism, stoicism, and belief in fixed human nature, (there are many more). Nietzsche fears that these ideas will plague humanity like unseen skeletons in the closet, making all men neither savage, nor great; these ideas will breed a population of mediocre humans, whom are oblivious to the self-destructive nature of their coveted ideas. And in ultimate effect: no mediocre man will dare antagonize the &quot;herd&quot; and its ideas; as Nietzsche so vividly illustrates that he can.Even if one disagrees with some of the criticism, no open-minded reader will be left untouched with a sense of uncertainty for today's existence.Beyond Good and Evil is a masterpiece to the individualist and an unnecessary evil to those of convention. This book is a compass that encourages the individual to define oneself and find one's own niche among existence. Thus a philosophy for the future: where individuals using conscience and reason set in place their own self-guiding principles; and individual path through existence devoid of a world where such things as the 'normal people' and other superficial mechanisms exist.What Nietzsche shows us among this cacophony of criticism for humanity's ugliness, is that there is a great spirit within all of us, and if we refuse convention, then we are on our first step to finding that true self. Nietzsche follows the methodology that only through harsh, yet logical, criticism/ skepticism of conventions and ideas can one cultivate the essence of humanity's evolutionary progression (or in other words, by freeing the individual mind from the oppressive force of the mainstream, a new beginning in human thought will take place). Nietzsche provides the first beginning for this new world: he has thrown off the blanket of good and evil which has been covering all our eyes since the history of human civilization. And has made it possible for a future exclusive of gratuitous limitation on the human: psyche, mind, creativity and evolution beyond....As one can see, my analysis and rating consider this work by Nietzsche an intellectual masterpiece. I highly recommend it to those with an open mind and a taste for philosophy."},{"Title":"Nietzsche: Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy)","review":"While I don't worship Nietzsche as I did when I was young, I think this is a very challenging and worthwhile book.

Those of us whose eyes are not what they were at the dawn, and who spend a lot of time driving, love to have books like this recorded, so we can enjoy them without getting out the specs and instead of driving along idiotically listening to commercials or the nostrums of PBS. Unfortunately, this particular product was a disappointment.This is a very dense CD that needs a special player, so anyone who has anything but a recent vintage car will have to get the mp3-DVD-whatever player to listen to it. That is not such a big deal, but the quality of the readers cannot be improved with any machinery.This is a translation into English, which is fairly fluent, but the various graduate students (I presume) who read the chapters cannot handle the English language into which it is translated. There is one reader with a thick accent that indicates some language other than English to have been his mother tongue who reads a completely incomprehensible chapter, but he can be forgiven (although the choice of this lad for this assignment is to be questioned.) The native speakers frequently don't know how to pronounced English words. Mispronunciations are common, and often so far from the actual word that the sense of the sentences get lost. Bits in French or Latin are simply relayed as gibberish.Another odd touch is that, possibly because Nietzsche is so famously radical and immoral in his writings, the readers feel a need to add a dash of drama to the presentation, so a few of them affect the hushed inflections of children reading ghost stories. This comes of as particularly asinine when they then mispronounce the big words and come with a surprise to more words in sentences they thought they had finished.I was appalled that readers couldn't read.The book itself is great."},{"Title":"Nietzsche: Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy)","review":"This is the clearest, most measured exposition of Nietzsche's mature philosophy, the ideal counterpoint to the parables of Also Sprach Zarathustra.

Unfortunately the translation leaves something to be desired, especially in comparison to that of Nietzsche's best translator, Walter Kaufmann. Still, it's a worthwhile read, and better still, reread. The more one delves into the works of this brilliant and often mischaracterized thinker, the more one appreciates his enormous culture, wit, and prescience.

You can imagine my joy when I read the preface to this book: &quot;Supposing truth to be a woman. . .&quot; Now supposing this book to be a woman- what? is the suspicion not well founded that all readers of Nietzsche, when they have been dogmatists, have had little understanding of women? My answer: no it is not well founded! There are many students of this moustached master who indeed know the ways of this &quot;woman,&quot; who lust after her as a wench and worship her as a goddess! Philosophy is very much a dance, and Nietzsche has told us plenty about our partners. Nietzsche is not denying the human understanding of truth, but rather affirming a different, more intimate association with it. This relationship, I find, is very adequately illuminated in the analogy of romance. And it is in the embrace of this truth that Nietzsche finds Life, in the New Testament sense.There ends my real review, but before I conclude, I find it necessary to touch on a particular issue. I have read many an interpretation of Nietzsche that describes him as either discriminatory or over-critical or both. Indeed: the two are by no means unrelated. One must first realize that in his criticisms, if you find that Nietzsche is singling out a certain group of people, you are probably not reading the book. This is the only solution I have found for the problem of Nietzsche being perceived as discriminatory. I have seen passages cited from his books as &quot;proof&quot; that he was misogynistic and therefore unenlightened. These people, therefore, must not have read any of his books, excluding the said citations. For am I the only one to notice that for every paragraph he has written against women, there are 200 pages written against men? Nietzsche is not at all concerned with destroying individual groups of people.Now the second problem: that he is negative and over-critical. All I can say here is that this is not the objective of his writing, that although he is the philosopher with a hammer, he is not inherently a destroyer. Although this might sound somewhat cliche, nonetheless pay heed: he is destroying the current state of affairs to make way for what is new and better. It is because he loves what he has seen in his visions that he &quot;makes straight the path of the Lord,&quot; as Isaiah so eloquently put it (and John the Baptist so aptly reitterated). The Christian analogy goes even further. Jesus says that he does not come to bring peace. Would anyone interpret that to mean that Jesus's teachings are all about destruction? Certainly not. Such it is with Nietzsche.For a bird to be born, it must destroy its egg. If you dislike Nietzsche's criticism (or my own criticism and censure, for that matter), then you are cursing the flying bird for cracking the shell."},{"Title":"Nietzsche: Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy)","review":"Essential!

Nietzsche certainly does not move beyond the realm of value judgments altogether (which is about the best thing I can say for him in this regard). Nor does he even offer a genuine alternative to conventional conceptions of good and evil. Rather, he simply takes the flip-side of that coin and reverses the labels, ascribing (at least by strong implication) moral superiority to what would conventionally be called the \\"evil\\" and moral inferiority to what society had generally come to accept as the \\"good\\". On this last, much of his criticism of Christianity, which he aptly described as \\"slave-morality\\", is quite accurate; but in his own positive views, he unfortunately failed to move beyond the Christian moral framework and offer a genuine alternative. For example, instead of saying that the strong should sacrifice themselves to the weak, he held that the strong should sacrifice the weak to themselves. He completely accepted the view that morality was about masters and slaves, and only argued as to who should be sacrificed to whom.He writes, for instance: \\"The essential thing, however, in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should...accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion of individuals, who, FOR ITS SAKE, must be suppressed and reduced to imperfect men, to slaves and instruments. Its fundamental belief must be precisely that society is NOT allowed to exist for its own sake, but only as a foundation and scaffolding, by means of which a select class of beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties, and in general to a higher EXISTENCE...\\"This illustrates the problem with this sort of Nietzschean pseudo-egoism very well: one cannot accept egoism except on the basis of individualism---the \\"ego\\" is, after all, the \\"I\\", the individual self as distinct from other selves. Nietzsche senses this and tries to uphold the individual (e.g., \\"the individual dares to be individual and detach himself\\")---but one cannot uphold the individual while at the same time speaking of sacrificing legions of individuals. It's simply not consistent...if it is right for some people to exist for their own sake as individuals, then by the same token every other individual has that same right (Nietzsche's separation of them into \\"noble\\" and \\"despicable\\" classes notwithstanding).The alternative to populism is not elitism, but individualism...and elitism is by definition not individualism. As one dictionary aptly puts it, elitism is \\"consciousness of or pride in belonging to a select or favored group\\"...it may be a smaller group, but it is still defining oneself primarily in terms of and in relation to the group. Indeed, Nietzche writes: \\"...egoism belongs to the essence of a noble soul, I mean the unalterable belief that to a being such as 'we,' other beings must naturally be in subjection, and have to sacrifice themselves...\\" Note the \\"we\\" where one would expect an \\"I\\", followed by the calls for sacrifice of one group to another...clearly, Nietzsche is not a genuine individualist, but a common elitist merely posing as one.All of this follows from what might be called his metaethical principles, for example that \\"...life itself is ESSENTIALLY appropriation, injury, conquest of the strange and weak, suppression, severity, obtrusion of peculiar forms, incorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest, exploitation...\\" This is of course true of animals, but not of human beings in the moral sense. You might think that Nietzsche recognizes this as he describes the egoist as a \\"CREATOR OF VALUES\\", but he means that only in the sense that he subjectively defines values for himself, not that he actually creates the values his life requires rather than appropriating them from those who do create them. So for Nietzsche, the \\"egoist\\" is existentially a parasite on those who are actually creative and productive.Nietzsche does insist that the highest men are not simply those who are physically superior, but spiritually (for lack of a better word---Nietzsche uses the term \\"psychically\\" in the translation I'm using) as well---the great individuals who shape a culture rather than merely being shaped by it, the Wagners, the, well...the Nietzsches! But given that these men are simply those who have the greatest concentration of the Will to Power, and not through any morally praiseworthy choices of their own, as Nietzsche denies freedom of the will, it's not clear that their superior status is in any sense \\"deserved\\". And whether their domination over others is through sheer force of will, or by actual physical domination, it still basically comes down to \\"might makes right\\".The \\"Will to Power\\" is itself a sort of half-baked idea. Robert C. Solomon makes a lot out of Nietzsche's rejection of Plato and Schopenhauer, and of metaphysics in general, but interpreting his \\"Will to Power\\" as a merely psychological phenomenon (even a universal one) is a bit of a stretch, when he largely took the idea from Schopenhauer's \\"Will\\" or \\"Will to Live\\" and when its place in Nietzsche's philosophy is similar in form and function (if not in content) to Plato's Form of the Good. But to be fair, interpreting Nietzsche is not exactly a clear-cut undertaking, considering the unsystematic nature of his writings.Even Nietzsche's comments on peripheral subjects don't stand up very well in retrospect. Many of his remarks about women are extremely unfortunate, and his attempt at music criticism is almost laughable as he dismisses Mendelssohn, Schumann, and the Romantics (and even Beethoven as the transition between Mozart and them) as unsubstantial and therefore short-lived and already forgotten---when his own musical compositions (yes, Nietzsche was himself something of an amateur composer!) have actually been forgotten (though they're not too bad) much more so than those.So is there any value in reading Nietzsche today? Certainly, for those interested in the history of philosophy...it is interesting, for example, how Nietzsche's emphasis on feeling or \\"the passions\\" over rational thought bridged the gap between Hegel as well as the German Romantic philosophers such as Schelling, and the existentialists, on the one hand; and on the other how his proto-phenomenology bridged the gap between Kant and not only the existentialists but also the pragmatists.And Beyond Good and Evil does contain some beautifully expressed thoughts, including one of my all-time favorite passages: \\"...it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about itself, something which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and perhaps, also, is not to be lost.--THE NOBLE SOUL HAS REVERENCE FOR ITSELF.\\" That is a beautiful, and (properly understood) profoundly true, idea.

As such, many readers are probably already familiar with this title. I, however, had never seen it before. As a Christian and a fan of Peanuts, I found it to be a very good book.One of the reasons I think I like it is that, since it was written in 1968, it's not one of these wishy-washy new-age/ spirituality books that have become so common. Someone looking for \\"inspiration\\" should look elsewhere. This book is a serious theological tract that uses Peanuts cartoons to illustrate various points. I found this to be a very clever approach with which Charles Schulz himself \\"could not be more pleased.\\"I also like the fact that Short is not afraid to come out and say what he thinks. He tackles the tough questions of Christianity and gives the answers he believes are true. He doesn't try to sugar-coat the cross that a Christian is required to carry and he tries to make his way down to the very core of Christian belief. This is a worthwhile task.On the other hand, I did find Short to be a bit repetitive in his writing. He hammers away his points over and over. Additionally, I have to say that I'm not a believer in everything he has to say. That, in and of itself, is fine with me. People willing to state their convictions make me willing to examine my own more deeply. This is something we all--even Mr. Short--need to do from time to time if we are to keep our faith strong."},{"Title":"The Parables of Peanuts","review":"Robert L. Short uses Charles Schulz's \\"Peanuts\\" cartoons to illustrate his theology, which is broadly speaking, Calvinist. As he is aware, his interpretations are not the only ones possible, but he has the merit of showing the depths of Schulz's work. He cites various thinkers and writers to illustrate his points, such as Kierkegaard, Barth, Bonhoefer, Pascal, Herman Melville, Kafka, Einstein, T. S. Eliot, and Paul Tillich. He takes account of modern biblical scholarship and theology on such things as original sin and hell. It is a very good book, which describes and illustrates many features of human life and the need for saving grace. The fact that I disagree with some of the theology doesn't change that. I will contrast some of his theology with more Catholic views.Short points out that Schulz quite explicitly communicated Christian themes in his cartoons, but knew well he could not impose his own interpretations on them. As Jacques Maritain pointed out long ago, if art is to be Christian, it must be real art. Having read enough devotional and didactic stories and pictures in my life, I can attest to their general dullness. In great part, I think, Schulz has created real art in his Peanuts cartoons. As Short points out, they say something; they are more than mere entertainment.Short summarizes the freedoms offered by Christian faith: first, the freedom from worship of false gods, idols; second the dreadful freedom of being deprived of being left with nothing to hold on to; third, the freedom of living under the easy yoke of Jesus Christ; and fourth, the freedom to use any legitimate means to spread the message of Christ. This can serve as a summary of the many descriptive themes of the book. One can see that in many ways, Christian faith lights up reality, the world as it is. However, he regards doctrines of free will as illusions.Short is convinced that human beings are basically depraved, and that one must discover this fact before one can become a Christian. Along with this is predestination, although he conceives God's love as so universal as to preclude final damnation. This is hard to argue with, for there is nothing in Christian belief that implies that anyone has ever been consigned to Hell.There is no question that human beings can be very evil indeed. Schulz was a master in showing the self-deception, arrogance, and confusion to which we are prone. The Peanuts are often quite cruel to one another. Short quite skilfully uses various cartoons to illustrate many aspects of human life in the light of the Gospel, and this is one of the great strengths of the book. However, people often do a great deal of good, and sometimes this comes out even in \\"Peanuts.\\" Does it make sense to consider human beings as totally depraved? Not really. For one thing, evil is a deformation or misuse of something good. It has no independent existence. While one can agree that wounded human nature cannot attain the salvation without God's help, there are serious objections to removing all goodness.As well, to whom would the Christian message be preached if human nature were totally depraved? Preaching would respond to nothing in human nature. Only if we were created for something better does salvation make sense. Short evidently sees the force of this objection and cites Pascal, who follows Aristotle and St. Thomas here, that human beings desire happiness, something Short does not elucidate. For Aristotle, happiness was eudemonia, well being. Short points out that Jesus wished to bring new life and joy. He finds support in T. S. Eliot, among others, to the effect that only God is capable of giving full happiness and that human beings are prone to seeking happiness in the wrong places and in the wrong ways. In other words, if there were not tendency to good in human beings, there would be nothing in them to respond to Christian teaching. But then what becomes of the doctrine of total depravity?Following on his view of human nature, Short also proposes that human beings must be driven to despair before they can become Christians, a view historically reflected in much evangelical preaching. What this really means is that only persons of the right psychological types with the right experiences can become Christians.Short accepts predestination of a deterministic kind. In particular, in the chapter, \\"Just Who\`s in Charge Here?\\", Short proposes that doctrines of free will are simply attempts to assert our independence from God. This appeal to a motive is not a valid argument against free will. Technically, it is a circumstantial ad hominem. As well, he opposes free will to the sovereignty of God. The view that the more one attributes to the creatures, the less one attributes to God has antecedents has antecedents in St. Bonaventure, Luther, Barth and others. But really, how grand is it when God can only create puppets? Thomists such as Etienne Gilson and existential ontologists such as Paul Tillich and John MacQuarrie point out that this is to treat human beings as things rather than persons, and misrepresents the relationships between human beings and God. On a more theoretical theological plane, they also hold that the creation of free beings shows the wisdom and majesty of God far better than the creation of mere things. For myself, I would rather worship a God who can create free beings, rather than one who cannot.The Parables of Peanuts is a very effective popular presentation of a particular sort of Christian theology. I have tried to indicate some the areas I think the theology falls short, but there is so much good in it that I give it a top rating. After all, there is nothing else quite like Short's way with \\"Peanuts.\\""},{"Title":"The Parables of Peanuts","review":"As a huge fan of Charles Schultz and Peanuts, I was really looking forward to reading this book. And, indeed, much of it is excellent. However, Robert Short gets into real trouble when he starts attempting to explain what he calls the &quot;heresy of eternal damnation&quot;. Short winds up stating that no one is damned, that all eventually will be in heaven with God. It's an argument that can make one feel good, but his arguments against the reality of hell as presented in the New Testament are weak and against the whole of orthodox Christianity. If Short stated this was his theory, that would be one thing; it's another entirely to call a central belief of the Christian church heresy. Short is right in emphasizing that the message of Christianity is positive; those who preach Christ as an escape from hell are missing the point entirely. But Short has an annoying habit of throwing away the real difficulties of Christianity, providing simple explanations that soothe the reader but don't provide a genuine picture of what the church has struggled with for millenia. Ultimately, Short comes across as just another unhelpful liberal theologian. However, Schultz's comics which illustrate the book throughout are as timeless as ever, and though Short doesn't always work them into his text well, they stand on their own as they always have."},{"Title":"The Parables of Peanuts","review":"Online reviewers of Robert L. Short's landmark books, drawing parallels between popular culture and the gospels, sometimes are suspicious of his theology -- so let me perhaps re-orient the conversation a little bit.No, not all Christians will agree with Short's theology. It's true that in the middle of this 1968-vintage book, he talks more explicitly about a theme that began to emerge in his classic 1965 book, \\"The Gospel According to Peanuts.\\" By 1968, Short was moving in the direction that he would land firmly after 2000 -- to a kind of Christian universalism that preaches a strong Christian gospel, but without the threat of hellfire and eternal damnation. Right in the middle of this 1968 book, in a chapter called \\"Good News of Great Joy,\\" he wrestles with this teaching. And, yes, he even throws a few very pointed darts at hellfire preachers who he calls \\"vulture-evangelists.\\"Did you half smile as you read that phrase? That's really the strength of Short's books -- making us think about our faith and the culture all around us. I don't agree with Robert L. Short on every theological point -- just as Protestants don't agree with Catholics on every point -- and evangelicals don't agree with mainliners -- and even the man or woman sitting next to me in my pew on Sunday morning probably disagrees with me on various points.But faith calls us to news of great joy and Robert L. Short was the godfather -- the creative catalyst that touched off a whole genre of \\"Gospel According To ...\\" books. His most important point is that we all, as people of faith, should engage our popular culture -- critique what's negative, warn against what's deadly, celebrate what's life giving and, together, talk about these issues so close to our hearts in a hopeful way.That remains a mighty good recipe for small groups. Even though this book turns 40 in 2008, I think it's still a great choice for a six- or eight-week series. And, beyond the theology -- hey, the Charles Schulz cartoons in this book are a hoot!"},{"Title":"The Parables of Peanuts","review":"I really want to like this book. Its premise is appealing and clever and it has a lot of good ideas. Simply put, it wants to relate the life lessons of Charles Schulz's famous Peanuts comic strip to the lessons of the Christian faith (or at least, that's what it claims). And there are indeed a lot of strips sampled in the book that seem designed to make subtle points (by \\"art-parable\\") for a strong, humane, and thoughtful Christianity. The strips are in good company: Short also brings in a wonderful sampling of other important thinkers on the questions, from obvious choices like Luther and Bonhoeffer, to delightful surprises like Kierkegaard and Camus.My problem with the book is that all this never really gels, that Short engages a lot of topics \\"in a rush\\" and without making it clear to the reader where he's tending overall. Each chapter treats a different aspect of Christianity--sort of--but when the reader is finished with a chapter, he/she will be lucky if he/she can remember just what it was about. Like some of the denser theological discussions I've read, Short's reasoning is so quote-heavy and so poorly signposted that, however interesting or even inspiring a particular section may be, the main points are lost. Often the Peanuts cartoons seem only to serve as weak accompaniments to the thread of Short's argument, which would be fine if the book didn't purport to be about them.There are some really excellent thoughts here, and, no doubt, more genuine theology than any dozen inspiration-lite books around. But surely a book about parables should be subtle rather than pedantic. I would expect a book on Christ's parables to be about symbolism, and folk formulas, and indirect communication. Above all, I'd expect it to be about the graceful way parables do a lot of work with very little textual material. It would have been nice if Short's book had really done this with the Peanuts cartoons, rather than using them as...well, illustrations."},{"Title":"The Parables of Peanuts","review":"This one is more theologically deep than Short's other two books on the Peanuts characters in that he uses words and thoughts that are harder to follow and understand without having gone through seminary but nevertheless it is still worth reading."},{"Title":"The Parables of Peanuts","review":"I love this book!The presentation is fantastic and as a fan of Peanuts doubley so! The Theology touched up in the book is exactly that touched upon, an introduction if you will.Not too confronting The Parables of Peanuts will get the mind ticking over more thoroughly than you anticipate.

For Christians, there is enough in the Parables of Peanuts to make it worthwhile.You will smile reading this."},{"Title":"The Parables of Peanuts","review":"I can't really rate this as yet.

I found this book to be very helpful, with the use of theraband exercise aids (those long, stretchy neon colored things you've all seen) I can work out specific muscle groups and areas of my body as I need. A large number of the exercises can be done in a seated position. The line drawings are clear and very helpful. This would be a good book for anyone, able bodied or not who wants to ease into fitness following an injury, surgery, or just years of couch potato life. The spiral binding made it easy to keep the book open in front of my while doing the stretches. This is a very practical consideration usually overlooked by writers of exercise manuals."},{"Title":"Stretch & strengthen for rehabilitation and development","review":"A friend, from eBay no less, first told me about Bob Andersen and his books on stretching and exercise. Since that time I have acquired four of his texts and a video. Why? Because his well written books and the superb video have given me my active life back to me. I would not consider starting my day without doing a 30 minute regimen of stretching exercises that he refers to as the essential daily stretches. I'm 61 and lead a moderately active life. But a couple of years ago I noticed I was having more pains in my feet, joints and back than normal. My range of motion was decreasing and before I knew it, normal motion of bending and stooping or getting in and out of a car was becoming difficult for me. Along came the friend's recommendation on Bob Andersen and I was very skeptical. Before the week was out, the pains were gone. I was no longer limping as I walked from my car to my job, I could go up and downstairs as I had always done, not one step for two feet at a time. The rotation in my lower back and torso has been greatly extended so that I'm looking forward to playing golf once more. His advice is very simple, concise and easy to understand. He has made my life much more enjoyable and I'm grateful for these books and the video. I can't recommend him enough for anyone of any age who wants to stay fit or is interested in stretching and its benefits which are many."},{"Title":"Stretch & strengthen for rehabilitation and development","review":"As a yoga teacher for Seniors, I found this book very helpful since many of my students are only able to do exercises in a chair. I had used many of the exercises already and my students love them. I think its very important to add resistance training to every exercise program, especially our seniors. I purchased flexbands and my seniors love using them. This is a great reference book for anyone who teaches exercises for rehab or seniors."},{"Title":"Stretch & strengthen for rehabilitation and development","review":"This is a great little book with easy to follow stretches and strengthening exercises. I bought it to help my husband as he recovers from Guillain Barre. The exercises are easy to adjust to his capabilities.

Many of the exercises use Therabands which you will need to buy separately."},{"Title":"Stretch & strengthen for rehabilitation and development","review":"I found this book to be very good. It progresses slowly until you are exercising every part of your body. It reminds you to stretch after each exercise.

I felt like I had a good work out after I completed the exercises."},{"Title":"Stretch & strengthen for rehabilitation and development","review":"I work with seniors, primarily those with balance issues, who in turn have strength issues. This small book has given me an unbelievable amount of ideas.

Save your poor badly needed funds and don't let this con artist get your money."},{"Title":"Time to Teleport and The Genetic General","review":"It was a common practice for Ace Books to saddle their novels with absolutely awful titles-- even when the novel was originally known under a much superior title. This was the case with _Time to Teleport_ and _The Genetic General_, both by Gordon R. Dickson (1960). The first novel appeared in _Science Fiction Stories_ under the title \\"No More Barriers\\" in 1955. The second was serialized in _Astounding_ as \\"Dorsai!\\" in 1959. _Time to Teleport_ is a passable but routine piece. _The Genetic General_, in spite of some minor flaws, is a real classic.Let us start with _Time to Teleport_. The original magazine title had multiple meanings. The first meaning is the obvious one. Once the characters succeed in finding a way to master teleportation, there will be no physical barriers. But Dickson is concerned with efforts to remove other barriers as well. The novel is set in a future in which the barriers of nationalism have been removed. Political organization is now built around services-- Transportation, Communication, Undersea, Plastics, Atomics, Metals, and so on. This ridding of national barriers has-- so far-- kept the world at peace. Reason: You don't fight a service that you desperately need. Finally, the novel is concerned with the downfall of personal barriers between family, friends, and even political rivals.The plot involves the speaker for Transportation who wants to Take Over, the speaker for Undersea who is abruptly (and somewhat selfishly) resigning, a band of medical technicians, an underground movement that wants to create a race of supermen, the head of security for the Undersea politician, and an unknown assassin. Most of the action takes place by or under the sea.At least one contemporary reviewer (who shall remain nameless) dismissed this novel as a \\"miserable piece of hackwork.\\" Well, it's not great. But it's not that bad either. It is reasonably well crafted and intelligent. I give it a three star rating._The Genetic General_ is part of Dickson's _Childe_ sequence of stories. Briefly, the stories are set against a background in which mankind has spread throughout the galaxy and has evolved into a number of \\"splinter cultures\\"-- the religious Friendlies, the scientific Newtonians, the philosophical Exotics, and the militaristic Dorsai.The novel opens with the line, \\"The boy was odd.\\" The boy is a young Dorsai named Donal Graeme. He knows that others think him odd, but he is not quite sure why. Yet the novel is essentially an account of his upward rise, partly from military genious and partly from some other characteristics that Donal himself considers of minor importance. At one point, when he shows some talents of the exotics, he shakes them off and insists: \\"I am a Dorsai.\\" At the close of the novel, it is clear that he is still denying the existence of his full powers.Dickson gets a lot of things right. The dynamics of a family at the table when Donal comes of age, the customs and rituals of the military, the way that people would talk in a political or military staff meeting, the battle scenes on alien planets or in deep space. These are all totally believeable, as is Donal's growth from boyhood to man.The problem with the novel is Dickson's treatment of Anea, the heroine. For roughly nine-tenths of the novel, she persists in misunderstanding the hero and practically spits in his face every time that they meet-- a period of time covering a little over five years. Then in the last few pages of the novel, she has a change of heart and decides to marry him. In spite of some hugger-mugger about genetic programming, the change is not convincing.Dickson implies that much of the misunderstanding has to do with the immaturity of Anea-- as indeed it does. But if I were in Anea's position-- a kind of indentured servant to a powerful and ruthless prince-- I can't say that much of Donal's behavior would inspire confidence in me. There is a faintly patronizing attitude toward women-- a sense that men are just so much more reasonable-- that weakens the novel.Still and all, an excellent novel. There was another science fiction novel with military subject matter that was published in 1959-- Robert A. Heinlein's _Starship Troopers_. It won the Hugo for best science fiction novel of the year. For my money, _The Genetic General_ is the better novel. I give it a five star rating._Time to Teleport_ has an excellent cover by Ed Emshwiller. _The Genetic General_ has a rather horrendous cover in the style of Ed Valigursky."},{"Title":"Time to Teleport and The Genetic General","review":"For those who like military science fiction, 1960 must have felt like Bordeaux vintage. Starship Troopers were introduced, won the Hugo and set the tone of voice for many many writers and novels. However, the Dorsai (soldiers extraordinaire in Gordon Dickson's universe) deserved, if not the same, at least half the recognition. The main hero, Donal Graeme is interesting, fascinating, caring, suffering and even has his own wikipedia article. His war tactics will appeal to you, and his coming of age will feel natural. One can definitely find traces of Dune here, and the scope of the worlds is so big, that Gordon Dickson wrote 9 novels and 4 novellas, without achieving to fill it by the time of his death. All in all, once you get passed the ridiculous book cover, you will enjoy very much the Dorsai. 4 stars."},{"Title":"Amberwell","review":"My mother gave me her copies of \\"Amberwell\\" and \\"Summerhills\\", its sequel, and I enjoyed them emensely. While this book was labled on the cover \\"A Romance\\", it is a more a family story (and a dysfunctional family at that). Stevenson looks for the positve in everything and inspires the reader to do the same. The children in the Ayrton family are survivors. They are able to rise above it all despite what WW II does to the family and the family home of Amberwell which they all come to love and cherish.While the books center around the Ayrton family of Lowland Scotland, it is actually more about all the people who live on the Amberwell estate ( and the surrounding district), servant as well as master. The war breaks down the class barrier and brings everyone together as a unit to preserve the home that they all love and to help build the school that they would eventually call Summerhills. It is a joy to read. I would also recommend \\"Celia's House\\" and \\"Listening Valley\\"."},{"Title":"Amberwell","review":"I love the way this book is written--so simple and sweet with vivid, but not flowery or wordy, pictures and descriptions. It gives the reader a look into life on a Scottish estate, not focusing too much on any one character, but letting us have a close glimpse of each of the five children as they grow up. It is a &quot;real&quot; story--life happens naturally, not with too much melodrama. I recommend it for any audience."},{"Title":"Amberwell","review":"D. E. Stevenson wrote about 50 novels mostly set in rural south west lowlands Scotland in the middle part of the 20th century, with WWII often looming just before or after the time of the book. In this one we go through the war. The story of an estate and its family, it uses Stevenson's common elements of distracted, neglectful, and irascible parents or other authority figures by whom the children are damaged, and must find their way to wholeness and independence. It's fascinating to see the old pre-war way of life (eight house servants to care for a simple family of 7) give way to the deprivation of warand its aftermath. A very easy read with a beautiful setting and great characters."},{"Title":"Psychiatry: PreTest Self-Assessment & Review (PreTest Series)","review":"This was the only book I used during my clinical rotation in Psych.

Unfortunately, this seems to be most common when there are a couple answer choices that both might be good options--it is in these situations where an explanation of why one answer is better than the other is most important, and it is in these situations where the \\"second choice\\" answer is conspicuously absent. For example, this book states that methadone is the best option for treating a heroine addiction, but even though buprenorphine is one of the answer choices no explanation is given as to why methadone would be a better choice."},{"Title":"Psychiatry: PreTest Self-Assessment & Review (PreTest Series)","review":"This book had very similar test questions to those that were asked on the COMAT shelf-exam. It is a great tool to test your knowledge to see what you know and what you need to study more.

He did what he thought was his duty as a human being and a pacifist. In 1939 Nicholas Winton a Stockbroker from London set about trying to save the doomed children Jewish children of an about to be invaded Czechoslovakia. His efforts saved 669 of them.In 1939 there were some 15,000 Czech Jewish children in existence. By the end of the war in 1945 only 100 or so of these children were left alive plus the 669 that Nicholas Winton had managed to save and get to the UK before the European borders closed down.One of these children was Vera Gissing who co-wrote this book. For a long time she wanted to know who had saved her and eventually she found out. This book is her testament to one man's selfless spirit and his desire to do what he considered was right.In theory Nicholas Winton could be considered a \\"righteous man\\" a gentile who helped the Jewish people in their time of need. But Nicholas Winton himself was born Jewish though he did not practice his faith, and nor did his family so he could not be bestowed with this honour (for he was Jewish in the eyes of Jewish law) but he could be recognised and acknowledged by those that he helped save.Vera Gissing has co-written a marvellously engrossing book about one man and his life and times, and it is only as you read each page do you understand what Nicholas Winton did to get those 669 children to safety.This is not a sentimental story, but you should be prepared to invest in a BIG box of tissues, because this story will move you to tears.A wonderful book which like \\"The Diary of Anne Frank,\\" and \\"The Colour of Justice,\\" should be on the shelf of every school in the land."},{"Title":"Nicholas Winton and the Rescued Generation: Save One Life, Save the World (The Library of Holocaust Testimonies)","review":"This is a heart-warming story of a caring person who did something to help others in World War II. I was not familiar with the story of Nicholas Winton and was fascinated by what he was able to accomplish. His actions impacted the lives of so many children and gave them an opportunity they would not otherwise have received. I highly recommend this book as one that will add to our understanding of those who sacrificed of themselves to lessen the horror of Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"Nicholas Winton and the Rescued Generation: Save One Life, Save the World (The Library of Holocaust Testimonies)","review":"When I was considering purchasing a book about Nicholas Winton, I looked him up on the internet. Much to my amazement I found he is still alive and a bit over 100 years old. Nicholas was born in 1909 to parents who were both originally German Jews. His family settled in England and he and his siblings were all baptized and confirmed. To me it seemed at times Nicholas was kind of between two worlds. He was hardly a practising Jew, but neither was he a practising Catholic. As an adult Nicholas studied banking, working for some large banks and dealing with the Stock Exchange. He became friends with a man named Martin Blake who asked Nicholas to join his rescue mission of Czech children around Christmas 1938. Nicholas was well suited to this job; young, energetic, and a model of organization. He didn't have enough people helping him, not enough money, and not enough foster parents for the refugees. He did have lots of refugee children, however, and succeeded in getting out over 600 of them mostly to England in 1939. Since World War II started in September 1939 that ended the rescue mission. A wonderful book about an amazing man who never mentioned the rescue mission for over 50 years. The only reason I gave this review 4 stars was because I knew much of the story already. I highly recommend this book for everybody about an amazing and very modest man who didn't think he had done anything that special."},{"Title":"Nestle Aland with Concise English-Greek Dictionary-FL (Greek Edition)","review":"The 27th edition of the Greek New Testament text in a critical edition is one of two standard presentations of the Greek text used by scholars. The other is published by the United Bible Societies. Think of them as Windows and Macintosh. Both do the same job and do it well, but they use different techniques to achieve their goals. Publishing New Testament scholars use both critical editions.Among the scholarly guild, every new edition (this is, of course, the 27th) of 'Nestle-Aland' or 'NA' is greeted with an outpouring of precious funds from professorial book budgets around the world. I remember the move from 26 to 27 like a flock of migrating birds. Usuallly the changes are few and tend to be corrections in lists of manuscripts cited by the 'apparatus' at the bottom of each page. Still, when you're working with a text considered sacred by millions of Christians - not to mention your scholarly colleagues who pour over every publication - you can't but use the latest edition.The Deutsche Bibelgeselschaft always brings out Nestle-Aland in superb binding that is built to last. Still, I remember with awe the day my college Greek professor loaned out his pile of 'wornout' Greek New Testaments. I've since worn out a few myself.An introduction in both German and English introduces the reader to the sigla one needs to understand in order to use this book adequately. After that the biblical text follows. NA presents what scholars call an 'eclectic text'. That is, all extant manuscripts are scoured for the various readings of every syllable, word, and phrase they might present. Text critics then utilize a mixture of art and science to suggest the 'best' reading, which - in spite of much scholarly ferment over the matter - usually means the reading that approximates to the 'original'. The original manuscripts of the Bible no longer exist. In the New Testament the existing variants to not bring into question any real dogma of Christian faith, conspiracy theories to the contrary. Still, they are of utmost importance for the close reading and understanding of the text, to say nothing of the teaching and preaching that emanate from it.If you're a university or seminary student in an institution where you are required to or choose to learn Greek - shame on you if you have the opportunity and don't seize it! - you'll likely end up buying 'NA27' or UBS4'.Computers have cut away a bit at the need to own this expensive text in printed form. But middle-aged codgers like me who've worn a few out and use our computers for what they do best still can't imagine lingering over the New Testament without holding 'NA' or 'UBS' in reverent hands."},{"Title":"Nestle Aland with Concise English-Greek Dictionary-FL (Greek Edition)","review":"This is the latest version of the Greek New Testament by Nestle and Aland.

Which is more than can be said about a lot of the poker books that are out there. This is a man that knows his theory, and is not shy about letting you know it, to be frank.In Tournament Poker for Advanced Players Sklansky is his typical informed self, and the advice he gives on how to play based on stack, blinds, and other contextual information is pretty useful, if a little broad in places. His suggestions on maximizing value and winning percentage is also pretty solid and one of Sklansky's real strengths. Still, I can't help thinking that there are better books out there, and some of them by Sklansky himself. If you have a particular love of Sklansky's insight and writing style you should definitely consider adding this to your shelf, but otherwise you may just want to save up for Harrington on Hold'em 1 & 2."},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"With all of the books currently on the market about poker and, specificly tournament poker, this is not the one I would recommend. Sklansky's books about limit poker are excellent reads, however, this book is lacking of any advanced poker theory. For beginners, I would recommend any books by Tom McEvoy and T.J. Cloutier. For advanced players, I would definitely recommend the Harrington on Hold 'em books by Dan Harrington, both volumes.

I have been playing in poker tournaments for 6 months and have made one final table, finishing 5th. Before I started reading poker books, I just played by gut instinct, and I think I was better off. This book is heavy on theory. Sklansky talks extensively on determining the Exptected Value of a hand and gives lots of mathematical equations to figure out EV, pot odds, and hand winning percentages. Frankly, I don't do math, so all of that went right over my head. The main concept that this book puts forth is the Gap Concept, which is useful. Basically, that means you need a better hand to call a raise (or reraise) with than you do to initiate a bet or a raise. In other words, if you are going to limp in with a hand, you'd better like it enough to call a raise with it.I'll give this book a second read, but the math really turned me off. I found Ken Warren's book \\"Winner's Guide to Texas Hold 'Em\\" more useful, even though it isn't geared towared tournament play. One thing I did like about this book is the hand scenarios. It's interesting to see how you would play a hand measures up to what a pro says you should do.

Excellent source of info on types of tournaments available and a good foundation of knowledge for getting comfortable in a tournament setting."},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"As a tournament player for just over three years now (both in card rooms and online) I found this book to be lacking in very little useful strategy information. Although the title of the book carries the \\"for Advanced Players\\" tag, I feel that this book is better geared towards someone just starting out playing poker tournaments. The strategy and guidelines are very basic. If you play just a few tournaments (small or big), you'll understand the basics of tournament play much better than this book can explain in words. Much of the basic tournament strategy covered here can also be found by looking at online websites. Another problem with this book is that it is a general \\"tournament\\" poker book. It's not specifically geared towards Texas Hold Em, Omaha, or Stud. So the advice given is very general and at times \\"skips\\", jumping from Hold Em advice in one paragraph then Stud to the next. The problem is that I would have preferred more in-depth information devoted to just Hold Em (or stud or Omaha) since the games are very different from one another. So except for the generalities that can apply across the board to the 3 different games, there's no real \\"meat\\". Other than a few pages devoted to the \\"gap\\" concept, I didn't find anything that new or interesting presented by this book. A series of books I did like were the \\"Tournament\\" books by Cloutier and McEvoy. There's one book devoted to tournament limit hold em, one for no-limit and pot-limit, and one for Omaha. The Sklansky book would have been much better if it were devoted solely to playing Texas Hold Em Tournaments (or Omaha or Stud) rather than trying to cover all 3 at once. If you're looking for a basic introduction to tournaments, this is recommended. But for anyone past the beginning stage, this book may not have much to offer. Overall, this was a very disappointing book as Sklansky's \\"Hold Em for Advanced Players\\" book was very good."},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"a few things first. i believe his holdem for advanced players is the seminal work poker work since super system.

I'll answer the question for you partially right now: you're not on David Sklansky's level (unless you're Sammy Farha and you're reading this, in which case, I bow to your superior firepower). But you don't have to be in the stratosphere to be good. Pick up volume III of Harrington on Hold'em, take the quizzes, see how you do. You should be able to figure out from the descriptions of each level whether you qualify.And qualifying matters. At one point in this book, Sklansky glosses over a fundamental concept, and as an aside, says that if you don't know what he's talking about, you're not ready for this book, and you deserve to lose. Harsh, but true. (Shades of Dick Mitchell in the horseplaying world, but Sklansky's far more blunt.) If you run into something you don't understand, you should probably peruse a few other books, and put in some hours of practical experience, before attempting to set up shop here. Otherwise, you're going to be in way, way over your head when you try to apply these concepts. (Harrington, whose books make liberal use of Sklansky's applied concepts in this book, is a good start in one specific area: while Sklansky explains the Gap Concept and devotes a few pages to talking about it, Harrington harps on it, with copious examples, and makes it somewhat clearer. And you need to understand the Gap Concept.)After all that, if you've got enough going for you that you understand what Sklansky's on about, there are a number of nuggets of wisdom here that will be beneficial to the tournament player. Some of them will seem familiar, especially if you're reading it for the first time now; a number of authors (including Sklansky) have cited this book in more recent works, and have addressed a number of these concepts in their own work. This is not to say there's nothing new here for you if you're well-read in the area; you'll find something you need. And you do need it. ***"},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"This book holds some good information, but if your not a \\"numbers\\" player then it will be of little use to you.

I thought I had a handle on tournaments since I play in at least three a week here but, being that they are free tourneys, they are not the same as real-money tourneys and the player's mentalities aren't the same. I played in one real-money tourney at the Aladdin in Vegas and placed 56th of 89 players (it was a bad beat, but still); two days later, after reading his book, I placed 6th out of 98 players and I would've finished better had I not deviated from his advice (I probably would've been 5th or 4th, due to chip count). To be honest, I called a raise with a hand he advises to open with but not call or raise with. It was my mistake.

However, portions of the book would lead one to conclude that he doesn't have a great deal of experience actually playing in tournaments.In most tournaments, first place is worth twice as much as second place, four times as much as third place, and six times as much as fourth place. Therefore, in the final stages of the tournament, it is often more important to facilitate eliminating other players than to maximize the number of chips that can be won during the course of a hand. Thus it is dead wrong to suggest that some Omaha High-Low hands are so strong that a player should always raise with the hand. That suggestion, which may be appropriate for a live game, could be disastrous in the last stages of a tournament."},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"David Sklansky is quick to use words like 'moron', 'idiot', and 'illiterate' when describing people who don't play poker well. Because someone doesn't play poker well does not make them an idiot or a moron just as someone that doesn't play guitar well is not necessarily an idiot or a moron. Instructors I've had that displayed this tendency to berate people seemed to not be all that secure about their own convictions, talents, and skills. Lashing out at others to prime oneself up however is not to me a viable solution.That being said this, like all of Slansky's books, is probably a must have for anyone serious about playing poker. A lot of things that are mathematically correct but not intuitively obvious are presented here. The adjustments that need to be made from ring game play are also pointed out in detail.This book seems geared more for brick and mortar play than online play but online play is addressed. He uses more hand examples in this than in other volumes. They are not nearly the caliber of, say Harrington's, but they are helpful none the less.He's dispensed with a lot of the '105 calculations you should make' in the 40 seconds prior to having to make a move which is a relief but there's no getting around the mathematics of the game. Using math he does describe some of the motivations for his recommendations.It got three stars from me because it's a recommended must have for any serious poker player. It did not get four stars because calling people idiots and morons is unconscionable (especially by an author to potential customers - yes Mr Sklansky, some may buy your book who do not play poker well to help improve their game). It did not get five stars because it is simply not in the league as far as writing, style or work put into it that would deserve five stars. Again I would refer you to Harrington's volumes on tournament play."},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"4.6 starsI've been playing poker tournaments for nearly a decade now and thought there was nothing more for me to learn. Boy was I wrong.Sklansky's poker mind is so far advanced it is scary. He thinks about the game in the way it should be thought of: a never ending game that is repetitive. Luckily for us, he has decided to apply that thinking to tournament poker.The way the book slowly unfolds is wonderful and there is something to draw from every chapter. He takes into account the logic of each scenario from multiple points of view. As you know, a different decision could be made at every point of each hand, and often times there is a fine line between the choices you could make which leaves you questioning your call in hindsight when it doesn't go as planned. Sklansky knows this. He runs these decisions through brilliant mathematical formulas and tells you which decisions are best for what outcome you're looking for. When it gets to a certain point in a tournament, you can either go for the win, or go for the cash. Sklansky lets you know which decision is best for what outcome you want. That is something I had thought of before, but not to the extent which Sklansky takes it to.I do have some problems with his NL strategy though. In my humble opinion he elects to shove with AK too much. He does point out why it is the better decision, but I've never liked doing that. Regardless of what I think though, I'm sure Sklansky's methods are wiser. After all, he does have a few million more dollars of winnings than I do.If you are playing poker on a daily basis and the majority of games you play in are tournaments then you must read this. Not only will it improve your game by providing insights you never realized, but it will keep you thinking about the game away from the felt which is always beneficial for the consistent player."},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"I found myself thiking this could have been so much better.Sklansky is no doubt the master when it comes to breaking down expert concepts into easily digestible form. His theory of poker and Holdem for Advanced players are absolute must reads. Even the great Harrington relies very heavily on Sklansky concepts in his 3 part series.However Sklansky really hasn't taken it to the next level in this book like he has in some previous offerings. He highlights some fundamentally important concepts in tournament poker, particularly the gap concept, but then fails to take it further by showing the reader what to do with his new found knowledge.If your serious about playing tournaments, of course you have to read any offering than Sklansky makes on the subject. But don't expect too much help in applying the concepts he descibes. You'll have to rely on Harrington for that."},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"A book that provides help in converting a good ring game player into a good tournament almost sounds too good to be true.

Reading this book you will learn one of the most powerful tournament principles-The Gap Theory-and learn how to apply it. The last third of the book are quizzes that discuss possible situations that arise during play.One concept that is very important to understand is there are times you fold a great hand in tournament play. Once you can throw them away, you will be better off. My first tournament, I left in the second round. Two weeks later and this book, I finished second out of fifty.

However as an author I believe that being a Subject Matter Expert is not enough. You need to be able to express your self with clarity and without judging the others. By that I mean that he's always classifying other players in bad terms, you should respect the ones that are not at your level if nothing else but because they will give you money at the tables and at the library.Then, about his style, he's too frequently using tow phrases to share a message, one will do if properly written and it's always worth re-reading a phrase IF needed, rather than being forced to.Having said all that, and having purchased other books by Mr.Sklansly in the past (also showing that behaviour) Why I bought this one? well simply put, the books has some good advices for the medium to advanced side game player willing to move into the tournament space. But... I would go for other books before this one, including the FTP Tournament Strategy Guide by Chris Fergusson,Gus Hansen, Mike Mattusow and up to 11 other Pros.It presents various strategies and concepts well structured for diferement games, No Limit Holdem, Limit Holdem, Omaha, Omaha Hi/Lo, Razz,... and contrary to Sklansky book each games has his own chapters, rather than everything being throw up at the same time.Also I would recommend you the \\"Every Hand Revealed\\" by Gus Hansen before this one if you already have covered the basics of what a poker tournament is.Another questionable approach arises in this expanded edition two fold. First and foremost the back cover claims well over 100 new pages in a new NLH section ... ironically, it way short of 100 pages this section.Then why he has been so lazy to put the new section in place rather than incorporating it in the relevant sections, oh, yes it would have been more tedious and have forced him to review / rewrite a book originally written in 2002."},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"\\"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players\\" by David Sklansky is solid background information on how to cope with the details of Tournament Poker.

It is not enough to appreciate that you have to make minor adjustments your stragegy to get into the next round. Rather than always working with the psychology of shearing the sheep, you need to focus on the immediate details that will get you into the big money in the here and now. (Sometimes you have to just go ahead and do the obvious.)This book provides the kind of grounding in the fundamentals of tournament play that will keep you from kicking yourself for making mistakes that are obvious, after the fact.

His description of why the value of a chip changes during a tournament is clear, concise, and spot-on, and what he calls the &quot;gap concept&quot; is something that every solid tournament player understands intuitively.&quot;Advanced Players&quot; is a misnomer, though. If you've played a few dozen tournaments, you probably know most of what is in this book. I was hoping to see a mathematical analysis of such things as tournament equity, all-in equities, and special considerations for different games and tournament formats, and it wasn't there. I think the book is moderately good, though technically light.David isn't really a tournament expert, and it shows. He places far too much emphasis on moving up the payscale, and not nearly enough on playing to win. I understand that he gave exactly this sort of performance in the 2002 WSOP main event-- getting into the money, then basically blinding off his stack without playing many hands.If you're serious about tournament poker you should read this book, but you should do so with a critical eye-- I believe it does contain some misinformation. It's certainly better than the first embarrassing tournament offering from Two Plus Two."},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"The ambiguity in the name of this book is something that confuses a lot of people, including some reviewers. The target audience of this book is ADVANCED poker players who have NOT played much in tournaments.

So, if you are looking for advanced tournament tips, skip this one, save some money and aggravation, and drop me a \\"thank you\\" note. :-)This said, the book accomplishes what it is set to do rather well. There is a large number of very solid poker players who almost never play in tournaments simply because the price of learning tournament basics through first-hand experience is rather high. On the other hand, explaining tournament basics to an advanced player is easy, or at least Sklansky makes it seem this way. If you are a good player thinking of playing tournaments, read this book -- it has answers to most of your questions."},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"Tournaments and cash games require different strategies. In fact, many winning cash players avoid tournaments, and many successful tournament players (including a few famous champions) do poorly or even avoid cash games.Chris Ferguson, winner of the 2000 World Series of Poker, is one of those champions. With his immense talent he could certainly beat most cash games. However, because he has an ideal tournament strategy, he concentrates on them because he has a bigger edge. Chris has called it: \\"The best poker tournament poker book ever written.\\"We've all read that tournaments make unusual demands, but they have never been clearly defined, and nobody told us exactly how to adjust to them. I've read nearly all of the tournament books, and they all disappointed me. Their greatest weakness is teaching basic poker strategy. You and I already know that strategy, but what else do we have to do?This book answers that question. Unlike other tournament books, it does not try to teach us how to play good poker. Sklansky wrote: \\"This book ... will explain how your play should differ when in a tournament from how you play in a regular game... This book will show you exactly where strategy changes, compared to normal games, are indicated, and why. What this book will not do, however, is teach you how to play good poker. It assumes that you already do that. The changes that you make in a tournament won't help you much if you don't already play well.\\"The table of contents clearly shows this difference. There are no chapters on types of games (such as Omaha or hold'em), or how to play on third street, or any of the subjects of most poker books.Instead, the entire focus is on subjects that matter only in tournaments. A few chapter are titled: \\"Prize Structure Implications,\\" \\"When Will Your Table Break Up?,\\" \\"Adjusting Strategy Because the Stakes Rise,\\" \\"Just Out of the Money,\\" \\"The Last Table,\\" \\"Down to Two Players,\\" and \\"Making Deals.\\"My favorite chapter was \\"The Gap Concept\\" because it affects so many hands. He wrote: \\"The difference between the hand you need to call an opener with, and that with which you would open yourself, I call the 'Gap.' ... in a tournament, this Gap is often extremely high. In other words, in a tournament it is often right to open raise with hands far inferior to those with which you would need to call someone else who open raised. ...\\" Dan Negreanu, a world class tournament and cash player, recently praised this chapter in \\"Cardplayer\\" magazine, and he also stated that it is: \\"the first book that clearly explains exactly how and why your strategy changes in poker tournaments.\\"Since I live in Las Vegas and write about poker, I meet lots of talented players, and everyone praises this book. Parts of this review were taken from my \\"Poker Digest\\" series, \\"Darwin at the poker table.\\" Darwin's central principle is that situational changes create new demands, and only those who adapt to them survive. Poker is a game of information management, and all new, high quality information will make the competition tougher and threaten people who do not adapt to it.Thousands of good players have already read this book, and thousands more are going to read it. They will gain an edge over those who don't.You may think that one book cannot have that much impact, but the historical facts are quite clear. His previous books, especially \\"The Theory of Poker\\" and \\"Hold'em Poker For Advanced Players,\\" have revolutionized poker. Virtually every winning player has read his books, and most of them follow his advice. Even his critics concede that you must read his books to understand what other players are doing.My \\"Poker Digest\\" series was based on the Darwinian principle that only those who adapt well to change will prosper or perhaps even survive.

I don't have the previous edition, but in this new expanded edition, there are viii + 346 pages, including the 8-page index. The principal new portion is Part Five: \\"Additional No-Limit Hold'em Concepts\\" which runs from page 214 to page 282. The rear cover flatly states that this edition \\"contains over 100 pages of updated material.\\"Having read about 1/3 of the text so far, my conclusion is that this book will be helpful to those who are beginner-to-intermediate tournament players, but who are already familiar with the basics of No-Limit Hold'Em (NLHE). This volume contains many useful hand examples, but it is not loaded down with irrelevant mathematics of the \\"if you have this and he has that or that or that, and he then does this X% of the time, then you should bet Y% of the pot\\" etc. In other words, this book focuses more on effective strategies at different parts of the tournament rather than on the supercilious \\"I'm a math genius and you're not\\" writing that characterizes the NLHE: Theory and Practice volume, also by Sklanksy and Miller.There is advice on what to do if you want to maximize your expected gain, or what to do if you want to maximize your chance of winning outright with expected gain be darned. Several alternative suggestions are presented on how to play certain hands depending on stack size, stage of the tournament, etc. The advice strikes a balance between being specific and general in nature.Part Four: \\"Hand Quizzes\\" runs from page 156 to page 211. Unfortunately, only 11 out of the 50 hand quizzes are specifically concerned with No-Limit Hold'Em, although maybe another 9 or 10 questions concern Limit Hold'Em. The rest concern Omaha and Hi-Low and Stud and other uninteresting forms of poker.There are a few typos and inadvertent grammatical errors, but not enough to be too annoying.If you are already an experienced NLHE tournament player, then you probably don't need this volume."},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"I must admit after reading some of Sklansky's other books I was a little disappointed.

However if you have read some other books on poker and tournaments in general and have played some tournaments then this book will not be very helpful"},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"Poker seems very simple if you see it from the standpoint of \\"the high hand wins\\". The thing that makes all variations of poker infinitely more complicated is the human factor. Add the variation of draw poker and the unknowns of what the end result increase geometrically since every hand changes with each new card that comes out. To balance out the impossible task of having to commit to memory every possible factor that could take place, players must base decisions on probability/odds of their hand in comparison to any other possible hand.Every poker book in existence offers tips on probability of certain hands and how to play them against categories of opponents in various situations. Since the mood of the player population is in constant turmoil and with every book that is released, many players create strategies to counter any newly discovered information that becomes effective. There will never be an end to poker books and new information.The point that I always stress when it comes to poker is that information is your Ace. It is impossible to have too much information or too many poker books. Tournament Poker for Advanced Players covers strategy on situations that could come up in various tournaments like plays that would work in no-limit as opposed to the same ideal that wouldn't work in limit. It is already assumed that you have at least an amateur to intermediate understanding on poker play.Is it possible that there would be a situation where pocket Aces should be dropped? Yes, if there are 4 players left in a tournament and you are last in chips, the 3 players go all in on a hand. Just by dropping out of the hand, you are almost assured to get 2nd place. If you happen to lose, then you're out at 4th place, the difference in the prize purse could be several hundred thousand dollars so it is quite possible that you are justified to drop pocket Aces! This is just one example of a topic covered in Tournament Poker for Advanced Players.If any poker book gives you a piece of information that helps you earn a pot or save a stack of chips, it easily pays for its cover price and in turn that information becomes at worst free. From my standpoint, this book is not a gamble but required reading for any tournament player."},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"Guys and Gals,After a break in period online playing poker, my play started to improve to the point where I was slowly earning money. Of course, I couldn't leave well enough alone and started reading poker books.I was particularly interested in playing better tournament poker, since the site I go to had $6 buy-in single table tournaments, and I could get a good half hour of poker in for ONLY $6.I was winning about 1/3rd of the single table tournaments I played, but I wanted to make final tables of multitable tournaments. Just making the final table of a fairly low buy in multi would win my back all I lost when I first started playing online in the ring games. I had placed well in multi, but never in the money. I bought Sklansky's book.I read about his &quot;System&quot; and the &quot;success&quot; stories he had with his system. His &quot;improved system&quot; is a move all-in or fold system based on the size of the blinds, the amount of chips at risk, the # of people yet to act including the blinds, and the # of people that limped in. With a raise in front of you the only hands you don't fold are AA, KK, or AK.Like a moron I decided to put my own money on the line and try to use his &quot;improved&quot; system. Time and time again I'd do the quick calculation, and then look at my holdings.Before very long (4-5 levels) my calculation would dictate - according to his system - that I go all-in with a hand I honestly would never call a blind with, much less put all my chips in.I mean look, Sklansky is obviously an accomplished player, and his statistics and odds calculations are right on the mark. But his &quot;system&quot;, which is admittedly experimental, could never work unless you caught an extremely lucky run of cards. Let's face it - if you catch that 1/10000 run of cards - you don't need to know what beats what - much less need to use a &quot;system&quot;.Skip pages 122-133 of his book and you'll save yourself a lot of money."},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that this book is not terribly useful for advanced tournament players.

Each time I've read it I've found something useful that I hadn't noticed before. I am an experienced mid limit poker player. I play a lot of 15-30 Holdem and Seven Card Stud. However, I would really prefer to play tournaments as a professional. I know how to play poker. I was looking for a book that explaind the nuances of Tournament Play. Sklansky's book does all of that. The \\"Gap Concept\\" is something that is known among experienced poker players. But Sklansky puts it on paper and explains it's effect during tournament play. His explanation of the Gap Principal is worth the price of the book alone. Sklansky also does a good job in explaining the value of chips and how that value changes throughout the tournament. He goes on to expalin when it is advisable to be aggressive and when one should sit back and try and survive. The book is definitely written in general terms and must be read a few times to glean the important information contained within. If you plan on giving Tournament Poker a shot and already know how to play poker well this is a book for you.Vince Lepore"},{"Title":"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players (Advance Player)","review":"This is not Sklansky's best work.

On the other hand, for those of us who grew up weaned on the individual Arden editions in school, with their gloriously thorough footnotes, this is bound to disappoint.I guess this is a good volume to have to ensure you have everything, from womb to tomb, soup to nuts. Then, hie oneself off to look for the older individual editions for the footnotes we crave. Nice to have (a bit pricey, even as big as it is), but not really complete."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"Arrived promptly and packaged nicely. This is intended to be a Christmas gift and I know she will love it!"},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"Shakespeare requires no introduction -- he is \\"the Bard,\\" the most imposing playwright and storyteller in the English language. And \\"The Complete Pelican Shakespeare\\" brings together every one of his plays, ranging from harrowing tragedies to airy little puffs of comedy -- and even the lesser plays are still brilliant.The plays basically are divided into comedies, histories and tragedies. The tragedies are pretty much... tragic, the comedies are not always funny but end semi-happily, and the histories... well, dramatizations of history.And everybody has heard of the greats here -- the Scottish lord who murders his way to kingship, young lovers divided by a feud, a Moorish general who is driven mad with jealousy, an elderly king whose arrogance rips his life apart, a very cleaned-up version of Henry VIII's split from his first wife, the goofy Prince Hal and his growth into a great king. There are feuding fairies, bickering lovers, romantic tangles, Julius Caesar's demise, gender-bending, an exiled duke/magician on his island, and the infamous \\"pound of flesh\\" bargain.But Shakespeare also wrote a bunch of lesser-known plays that often can't be so neatly categorized -- a rotten love affair during the siege of Troy, a Roman general attacking his own city, an Athenian gentleman embittered by humanity, Richard III's Machiavellian plot to become king, two sets of twins separated at birth, a corrupt judge obsessed with a lovely nun, Falstaff's doomed efforts to make money, and so on. Some of these (\\"Troilus and Cressida\\") aren't nearly as good as his \\"main\\" body of work, but they're still excellent.For all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read them AFTER you've seen a good performance. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to. But if you've seen performances of any/all of Shakespeare's plays, then his vibrant stories and poetry leap off the page.There are long eloquent speeches, puns, clever linguistic twists, and evocative language that soaks the play in atmosphere (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\"). In fact, his plays are diamond mines of quotations -- some are infamous (\\"To be or not to be\\") and some of which have floated into public knowledge without labels (\\"Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once\\").And while some of his plays are basically fluff, he manages to weave in moral questions, criticism and explorations of the human soul. And his characters range as far as his plots -- kings and princes, teenage lovers, proud but doomed men, bratty queens, the witty but combative Beatrice and Benedick, and even the puppet-master mage Prospero.Shakespeare's \\"Complete Works\\" is a must-have for anyone who loves the English language -- his writing was unparalleled, and even his lesser plays are a cut above the rest."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"Don't buy this book: you'll regret it. (The single star is for the edition, obviously not for the works themselves.)The Arden Shakespeare paperbacks are great: you'll love them. The font is easy on the eye, there are footnotes at the bottom of each page, and there are helpful introductions. If you see one, don't hestitate to buy it.Naturally you might think that this big, hardbound book containing all Shakespeare's works is just a collection of all those various Arden paperbacks: you would be wrong.Folks, this is nothing except the text of the plays and sonnets! Yikes! There are NO FOOTNOTES OR GLOSSES for the plays; instead, there's a glossary of extinct English in the back, meant to cover all the material. Why they didn't just anthologize all those wonderful paperbacks is beyond me, but they didn't.There is a very brief introduction before each play (only a few paragraphs), but these introductions talk about folios and textual history, etc. Nothing your Average Joe would be interested in (such as a discussion of themes).In short, a very reader-unfriendly Shakespeare, although it might suit your needs if, say, you were already a credentialed scholar with no need of footnotes whatsoever.If, however, you're like the rest of us -- AND CANNOT READ SHAKESPEARE WITHOUT FOOTNOTES -- you are likely to be angry and disappointed with this expensive book."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"Great copy but has no liner/translation notes.

What superb value for money."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"I see that most of the other reviews of this edition were posted by cry-babies-- \\"Waahhhh!! Waaahhhh!! There are no footnotes!! I can't read it!!! Waaahhh!!\\" If you're a n00b to the Bard and can't yet hang with Elizabethan English, then you should buy either the New Folger paperback editions or the Arden paperback editions-- they've got the training wheels you'll need to get comfortable with Shakespeare's language. However, after you've read three or four plays, you really shouldn't need the footnotes anymore-- at that point they start to get in the way and distract from the enjoyment of reading these wonderful works (it's a lot more rewarding to interact with the mind of a genius without having a \\"filter\\" in the way). Also, as one other reviewer noted, if this edition did include all the glosses and footnotes and annotations from the paperback editions, it would be unmanageably huge (there's a reason the Oxford complete works edition--also very well-edited-- has those ultra-thin Bible-style \\"tracing paper\\" pages). But the fact is, whining and one-star ratings aside, this is simply the best, most trustworthy, and most authoritative edition available of the texts of Shakespeare's works. The Arden editors are full-on awesome and have put together an edition that belongs on the bookshelves of every lover and/or serious student of literature. English majors, English teachers, poets, and all the people out there who just plain love Shakespeare simply have to own this book.Thing is, it's not Arden's fault if you can't read the plays and poems without someone to hold your hand. If you're one of those people, then like I said, there are plenty of other good editions out there. Start with some easy plays like Twelfth Night and Measure for Measure, buy the New Folger or Arden paperback editions, and get yourself comfy with WS's language. Then move on to some tougher plays, and try to begin weaning yourself off the glosses. You really shouldn't need to read more than three or four plays before you can kiss the helping hand goobye. And if you've already read a bunch of Shakespeare's plays and you're still relying on footnotes, then you need to just bite the bullet and at least try to read a play out of this GREAT edition before you give up and come back here to post your negative reviews. Who knows? You might just surprise yourself and get through it much more easily than you thought you could.Am I being \\"spiteful\\" (Amazon says that's a no-no)? Maybe... but I'm really not trying to be. It just irks me to see a bunch of one-star reviews by people who simply do not know what they're talking about. There are three really great, awesomely-edited Complete Works editions out there (this one, the Oxford, and the Penguin), and in the opinion of many, many scholars, the Arden is the best of the best. If you need footnotes, then go buy an edition that says \\"annotated\\" on it-- that's why they're published. But giving this killer book one star because you can't read Shakespeare without help is like giving a terrible review to a high-end Ferrari because it doesn't have an automatic transmission and you can't drive a stick. You're slamming a great book based on a criterion which is simply unfair. So what if it doesn't have footnotes? Unless the publishers tricked you and put the word \\"annotated\\" on the cover (which they didn't), you have no right to complain about the lack of something which was never promised to begin with, and which plenty of readers neither want nor need."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"Shakespeare/Harold Bloom fans should know that Professor Bloom recommends The Arden Shakespeare in his new book, &quot;Shakespeare: the Invention of the Human.&quot; My own comment would be that with his recommendation and a price that is about a third of the Riverside Shakespeare, the Arden is an excellent choice. I did find the introductions briefer than some others, and there are no footnotes (there is a glossary at the end), but I believe this is probably THE one-volume Shakespeare to buy, if you'll only buy one."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"If you want the complete works on a budget, this is the best choice. It's the full Arden text, with a good glossary at the end of the book. Each play begins with a brief introductory note. You don't get the extensive footnotes of the individual Arden plays, but for many readers, that's a bonus."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"Instead of writing a regular review, I figured I'd rate this large book on a scale of 1-10 (ten being good) in several areas to give you idea of what you'd get.As a book: 8The font is great, the words are not scrunched together to save space, which gives it its rather large girth, but if I had to choose between reading at leisure or squinting and using a finger to stay on the right line, I'd choose the first.Compilation: 6It does have everything, and yes, it's in alphabetical order which may irritate some, but when you're a 10th grader looking for Julius Caesar, which would you rather find it quickly via your ABCs or have to find the index to see when it was written?Age Appropriate: 7Easy to follow if you're learning Shakespeare, based on the idea that the teacher is actually teaching you what the text means. It may not be the best first book if you're learning Shakespeare on your own, as it doesn't have an easy reference, but again, it's spacious text allows for easier reading.Reference: 5This is not the best reference book- in all honesty if you want to read Shakespeare indepth you'd be better off getting each play individually or a small collection of a plays with all the info.Pairing: 10Personally I'd rather pair this book with a reference book than have the text jumbled up with footnotes and on-page references (which tend to be squished together ala the King James Bible). You want facts? Pair this book with something like DK's Essential Shakespeare by Leslie Dunton-Downer.Enthusiasts: 9Usually Shakespeare enthusiasts like myself have every play in their own book, but this is a great Complete Works to add to the collection. If you don't need much help reading the texts, it's perfect.Overall Rating: 8As an actor, I can't live without this book. It's great for quickly finding monologues, and, well, it just looks cool and modern. If I need more details, I have a multitude of lectures and gathered knowledge to reference so having this book is a nice clean cut way of studying Shakespeare."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"Well, if you're looking for an affordable collection of Shakespeare's works (plays and sonnets) to read, then this is definitely the book for you! If you're looking to intensely study Shakespeare and get as many footnotes and literary interpretations as possible, this is NOT the one for you. However, this collection's paper quality is all right, the words are actually readable, and you will find some introductory essays as well as a glossary of terms at the back. The glorified cardstock cover is prone to easy damage (even in the mail getting to me, as I discovered), though it is nicely colored."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"I purchased this work for my niece for her graduation from high school. She preferred this edition because she liked the way it looked: all handsome in its red cassette. So I ordered it for her. But behold: the picture doesn't match the actual product! What you get doesn't come in a handsome red cassette, but actually is the oversized regular version with its rather dull jacket.After complaining about this to Amazon, the image mysteriously disappeared for a while, but now it seems to be back. No doubt misleading many more oblivious customers into paying for something they in the end aren't getting. So Amazon: please remove this image, and place the correct one, so at least customers know beforehand what they are getting."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"Quite a bargain for $20, and lightweight compared to other Complete Works that are out there. It doesn't contain the detailed footnotes and endnotes of the individual Arden editions, but is extremely useful as a reference or a way of reading through all of Shakespeare's works."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"This is a great one volume edition of Shakespeare's work. A bit unweildly for casual reading. I would whole heartedly recommend that for a real treat you collect the complete series of Arden Editions. The introductory essays cannot be beat.

The single volume size is perfect for reading in your favorite chair."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"LOVE Shakespeare and was looking forward to reading his works again.

The word I find best to describe it is &quot;clean&quot;, both because of the presentation and the editorial treatment. However, the buyer should know that ISBN# 0174436157 is the hardback of Arden and not the paperback. The ISBN# is correct; it's the format that is misidentified (at least as of this date: 2-5-1999). Some other sites have similarly identified it as paperback, but AMAZON's cousin site in the UK correctly identifies it as a hardback. It's still a great book at a great price, but if a paperback is a must-have requirement, then wait for Arden to issue (or re-issue) it."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"Arden's edition of Shakespeare's works is an essential item in everyone's shelter. It's a great buy (for a carefully sought edition), but it lacks the critical discussion of the single-play edition."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"We at Talisman Theatre use the Arden as our standard for our productions of Shakespeare. They provided the most detailed information regarding the text, sources, and how different editors have made changes to the text."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"For those of us who love (and rely on) the individual editions of the Arden Shakespeare, the Complete Works is a huge disappointment. What has always made the Arden editions stand out from the others is the in-depth scholarly analyses and copious footnotes. The footnotes alone are worth the price of a copy but, guess what? In this edition, they've disposed of all but the most general of critical apparatus. Unfortunately, this serves to make this complete edition just another big book to put on your shelf to impress your friends. Curious readers who want assistance with the complex Elizabethan language in the plays will be much better served by the Folger or Bantam editions. That is, at least until someone gets smart and brings back all the individual Arden editions that have been allowed to go out of print! What were they thinking?"},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"After discovering to my horror that my carefully boxed volumes of the Temple Shakespeare had gone to mold and stain, I sat around for a year or more with nothing but one of these \\"club\\" books printed on onion skin paper, with teeny-tiny print and nothing but \\"some\\" (?) editorial version of the plays. I needed to get my hands on something to use, something convenient, not expensive and all inclusive. The Arden Trade paperback edition was my first choice due to the respect generated by this edition and editors. Also, as it was not a hardcover, I envisioned myself happily schlepping it about with me on the subway, on the plane or train.... This was not to be.1) The volume is HUGE and heavy and too unwieldy - trying to make notes or highlight this while moving about in public transportation is impossible.2) As noted elsewhere, if an unfamiliar or forgotten archaic word pops up, you need to put your finger in your place, flop over to the back of the book (somewhere) to the glossary and hope the definition is there. There are NO footnotes; therefore, no on-the-go interpretation or editorial explanation of the line/word.3) The essays and editorial intros are okay, but not as valuable or lengthy/specific as I've found in the Pelican/Penguin individually published volumes - one play, one volume.If you're intending to use this for purposes I've described and are not such a Shakespearean scholar that you still need help from time to time with an explanatory note or definition, then stay away from this one and get the singles. I now have 4 collections of Complete Works, still searching for the \\"perfect\\" one. Riverside is closest to perfect, I love my very old Signet edited by Barnet and keep it at work for lunch hour browsing/reading. I have the Bevington 4th edition on order (I buy most stuff used at the Amazon marketplace and their competitors or I'd be broke) based on word of mouth.But still-- day to day, I use the Pelican single play copies and mark the heck out of them without worrying about reducing their worth by this practice. Your call."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"I must agree with the reviewers who rated this volume so low because of the lack of footnotes. I remember being introduced to the individual Arden copies when I was acting in college - the footnotes were SUPERB, much better, more authoritative, more in-depth than anything else out there. I was hoping for the same with this collected works - but was quite disappointed not to find it."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"I bought the famed Arden ed. of the Works of Shakespeare, shrink-wrapped. I peeled it open in glee...opened it...and...and...NO NOTES! What a waste of hard-earned money. I'd say stick with the individual plays in the Arden series in paperback. Sheesh!! (I rate the &quot;book&quot; two stars; Shakespeare gets five.)"},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"I have taught several Shakespeare classes with several different texts. In the interest of my student's pocket-books I chose this complete works. The lack of editorial notes makes it unusable in class. I am also surprised by the decision to alphabetize the plays rather than arrange by date of composition (or presumed date of composition.)This is a sturdy volume, for a paperback, which is a mark in its favor, but the Riverside will be my edition of choice in all future classes."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"I received my copy in the post today and immediately immersed myself in it for several hours. This is a superb one-volume edition of Shakespeare's works. It's a very large format hardcover, with a very clear and readable font. The present editors have made some welcome innovations to the usual presentation of the plays, notably the full name of each character prefixing each delivery (as opposed to the normal abbreviation), and a reduction in unnecessary and distracting stage directions, most of which are editorial interpolations from previous editions. There's also a reduction in the size of the numerical annotation, making this the clearest, cleanest publication of Shakespeare's works I've yet seen. There's not much in the way of analysis, but the overview of Shakespeare's life and art, as well as the history of Shakespearian criticism and interpretation, is succinct and reasonable. I can't praise this book highly enough, and at the price offered it's worth every cent. A wonderful treasure."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"As an actress, I often use the individual Arden play texts. The footnotes are numbered as such and touch on not only definitions, but expressions, historical figures, and locations. These appear at the bottom of the page where the word or phrase appears.

Very disappointing."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"The Arden Shakespeare without the notes and the full original critical essays is not the Arden Shakespeare.

I wish somebody would bring out a single-volume edition of them instead of this travesty."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"Even without the notes I've found this edition more than helpful. It's good to have the complete playtexts as verified by the Arden team in a single volume. It also includes introductions by the Arden editors which are very useful.I wonder if the skeptics realise that a Complete Works with all the Arden notes would run to about 10,000 pages? And just for the record (to the best of my knowledge) all the Arden single editions are still in print.A very comprehensive and valuable edition. Mighty pretty-lookin' too..."},{"Title":"ARDEN SHAKESPEARE COMPLETE WORKS","review":"This is a strangely uneven volume. It is a commercial exercise rather than an educational or cultural one. The publisher has taken advantage of the justified reputation of the - not now really current, \\"mark II\\", not \\"mark III\\" - Arden editions of separate works to bring them together into one volume, but has left out a good deal which earned the reputation of those editions. The result is that this edition does offer, on the whole, exceptionally well edited TEXTS (i.e. versions with sensible and accurate modernisation of spelling and modernisation, exhibiting good choices among variants and necessary emendations), but not much else that is not also found, and usually in a superior form, in other collected editions of Shakespeare. The most appalling drawback of this volume is the absence of explanatory notes (which WERE present in the editions of individual works!), without which a modern reader will inevitably misunderstand much of what Shakespeare writes. A glossary (which is offered) is not a good substitute: modern readers usually do not KNOW what they do not understand, as much Elizabethan English looks like modern English but in fact means something different. Only explanatory notes can offer help in such cases, as the Arden editions of individual works very frequently did. Introductions to Shakespeare's work are superior in e.g. Bevington's edition. (See my review of that, which many readers have found helpful.) All in all, I would not recommend this edition, though someone who wants just the text could do worse (by buying one less well edited). If you are keen on the Arden editions of individual works, then buy those, as they offer so much more. New editions of individual works are in the process of appearing, though they are not always better than those they are seeking to replace. Several of the older Arden volumes, e.g. the *Hamlet* or the *Romeo and Juliet* (both from the 80s, so not really \\"old\\"), are hard to surpass, and a very good buy if you can get them, often at low cost.

The book is not badly written, nor does it lack plot or characterization; Locust is passable in all these respects. Rather, the problem with The Day of the Locust is that it does not exceed expectations in these areas. Instead of becoming a standout work, The Day of the Locust remains merely mediocre.To most readers of American literature, the theme of The Day of the Locust is a familiar one: the collapse of the fabled \\"American dream.\\" In Locust, this dream is represented by the promise of fame and fortune in 1930's Hollywood. The Day of the Locust traces its characters' pursuit of this goal toward their ultimate destruction.Unfortunately, this motif has already been explored in such notable works as, for example, F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. Gatsby is often considered to be one of the greatest American novels of all time; therefore, West faces very high standards with The Day of the Locust, and his work is not strong enough to meet them. For instance, in Locust, one character reflects, \\"It is hard to laugh at the need for beauty and romance, no matter how tasteless, how horrible, the results of that need are.\\" This idea is one that has already been successfully expressed in Gatsby and elsewhere. West's words add no insight that cannot be found in other novels on the same theme as Locust.Nathanael West's The Day of the Locust needs to reach new and dazzling literary heights to make itself stand out from novels similar to it. Unfortunately, Locust manages no such accomplishments, establishing itself only as an average work on a theme better covered by others."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"I read this book for a class in LA History, which I find fascinating, alluring and mysterious. I did not enjoy the read as I found West's style difficult to follow. I knew the premise ofthe book and found it to be a critique and indictment of society in general which happened, in this book, to be located in the movie industry in Los Angeles. I think West's point, of many, about the dreams of \\"locusts\\" not being met and the degradation of society, could be aplicable in many different industries in many different cities in America. So, while it is an indictment of Hollywood and what it represents, and portrays the reality of Los Angeles contrasted to its myth, it could be anywhere. What I find is that it is one of those books that stays with you and is great to discuss and think about when you have finished it."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"No matter how good this book is, how can you take it seriously when one of its main characters is named &quot;Homer Simpson&quot;?"},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Ah, a book with cockfights, a true cowboy in LA, and the original Homer Simpson. This book, while not overtly outrageous, it shows scenes of the eccentric life of a few fringe people in Hollywood.Throughout this book, unique characters are introduced and their lives are showed in the most interesting ways. From a lonely man who takes in a woman, to the woman who ruthlessly takes advantage of him, to the woman's father, who tirelessly wants to entertain. A mix of failures, this book portrays a truer Hollywood, where success and glamour are very limited, but where mental diversity is everywhere.While it does do a good job of showing people and situations, the sentence structure is not too fluid. Sometimes a paragraph or two may have to be re-read. Also, this book does not have much cohesiveness to it. With no plot, and no central theme, the book drifts from one scene to the next. Because of this, it's very hard to be captivated. By all means, this is not a page-turner.For those interested in books about people, I would recommend this book. For those looking for insight or story, I would suggest passing up this book."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"&quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; is about the strange, disparate people that invariably get drawn to Los Angeles in the 1930's, a time when studios put out assembly-line low-budget movies and employed revolving crews of extras, writers, and various technicians. The novel seems influenced by Sherwood Anderson's &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; in its portrayal of &quot;grotesques,&quot; emotionally or behaviorally defective people on the fringe of society, but its tone is much more vibrant and frenetic; if &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; is a petting zoo, &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; is a three-ring circus.At the center of the action is an artist and scene designer named Tod Hackett. He observes southern California with a sort of concerned detachment; he sees it as a wasteland of incongruous, tacky architecture and rootless people who come here to die. His discontent is manifested in his extracurricular plan to paint a canvas called &quot;The Burning of Los Angeles.&quot;Even though Tod may be considered the main character, he's the least interesting member of the cast; he's like the &quot;straight man&quot; in a comedy team. He's in love with an aspiring actress and occasional prostitute named Faye Greener who likes to use men. She has managed to hook a shy, lonely unemployed hotel bookkeeper named Homer Simpson (!) who moved to L.A. from Iowa for his health. Homer has compulsively fidgety hands and occasionally even exhibits the simplemindedness of his bald, mustard-colored cartoon namesake. Faye is also attracted to a lanky cowboy named Earle Shoop who works in a Sunset Boulevard saddlery store, does occasional movie work, and doesn't seem to know he's a caricature.There is a cavalcade of other colorful characters, including Faye's father Harry, an ex-vaudeville clown who is now peddling silver polish door-to-door; Abe Kusich, a drunken dwarf; Claude Estee, a successful screenwriter who has a rubber sculpture of dead horse in his swimming pool; Joan Schwartzen, a loud, lewd harridan, who is probably Phyllis Diller's progenitor; Miguel, Earle's chicken-tending Mexican friend; and last but not least, Adore Loomis, an obnoxious aspiring kid star.The novel focuses on the lives of these fringe characters rather than moviemaking, which allows West to demonstrate that he excels at writing unusual, difficult scenes -- a screening of a porn flick, a cockfight, a riot at a movie premiere. The inventiveness, energy, and attitude here cannot be overstated; never have I read a novel that delights so much in pathetic human oddity, in mixing its characters into a violent Molotov cocktail and observing the comical results with jubilation."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"I've read all of West's other novels - The Dream Life of Balso Snell, A Cool Million, Miss Lonelyhearts - and all three seemed to miss something that is hard for me to explain. A little two-dimensional, a little hollow. Neither the characters nor the novels themselves seemed to be totally fleshed out. But The Day of the Locust is different. And ultimately I think it is on this novel that West's reputation will either rise or fall.This book will really live with you long after you've read it. I can easily bring to mind that spectacular cockfight (a fine bit of descriptive writing), Faye's teasing, Harry Greener, the midget, the scene in the nightclub when the cross-dresser sings, and that final horrific scene when the riot breaks out in LA. You can skip West's other novels and you won't be very deprived, but The Day of the Locust is not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Locust does a great job of showing the ugly side of the shiny veneer of Hollywood. The book deals with lust, desire, hope, disappointment, failure, rage, and death. To avoid being misleading, I should say that the movie business is not the front and center story here. The interpersonal relationships between a woman and her father and her suitors is the main plotline. Hollywood acts as a backdrop.Faye is a failed actress who only gets work as an extra, and Homer and Todd are just two of the men who are drunk with desire for her.This alternates with The Sound and the Fury for my favorite book. I've read it 3 times, which is as much as I've read any book....Locust is a quick read and never boring. Check out the movie too."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"The fact that The Day of the Locust was published in 1939, would, I thought, make it a bit too dated or old-fashioned to enjoy. Happily, I was wrong. Nathanael West's novel is like a well-oiled and maintained Disney ride, guaranteed to educate, amuse and thrill. We climb in the car and enter a tunnel into a world that is, of course, gone forever. Truly an insider's novel, the parasitic Todd lives in the bowels of the many-headed Hollywood beast, but he is not \\"of it.\\" He comes to Hollywood to work as a studio artist and is too smart to be trapped by all the fascinating things he sees, especially the beautiful Faye. This sets him apart from the drifters, dreamers and pensioners who have been drawn by the allure and glitter. On a smaller scale, Faye IS Hollywood, drawing men close to eventually destroy them much like the lizard hiding in the plant in Homer's house patiently waiting for the next foolish fly to light on the plant's flowers. The only thing in the novel that disappointed me, and only a little, was the dearth of information about Homer Simpson (not that one). I wanted to know more about this polite, quiet and stoic Midwesterner. We know he came west for his health, but why does he invite Faye to live with him? Why does he put up with the abuse? Then I remembered that West was writing before the age of Freud, before the good doctor's psychoanalysis became the normative tool; people were the way they were ... just because. It was \`in the blood', or they \`took after the father', whatever. Pre-Freud writers gave their characters no breaks for having had a mamma that didn't love them, except perhaps, just a passing mention of the fact.The secondary characters are fascinating in their brazenness and crudeness; you can almost smell them. They are the kind of folk modern middle class readers don't usually come into contact with, like Earl, for instance, the close-mouthed drugstore cowboy, and Miguel the Mexican with his fighting cocks, which are a metaphor for the men who employ them. The violence between Abe, Earl and Miguel struck me as comic, like the sight of two dogs mating on a Sunday sidewalk in front of a busy church. Perhaps it was because, again, we moderns don't see too many middle class men having fistfights, except in videos.Young women, uninterested in marriage, sleeping around as they seek to advance their careers, superficiality, frenzied celebrity-worshipping mobs, plain-looking grown men who stupidly lust after beautiful women who are completely uninterested in them, unbridled egotism, desires, dreams, and very little thinking and planning -- the essence of what West worked with here seems to have long ago been mainstreamed down into the great American masses - think of MTV, MySpace, Christina and Britney videos, Survivor and American Idol. But no one, to my knowledge, has illustrated it as vividly and delightfully as West has.The ending, like the endings of all good novels, drifts slowly away from you, like the beautiful young woman you just held in your arms, fading back into a crowded dance floor. At about 200 pages, a paperback of The Day of the Locust is a must-have addition to your backpack or briefcase, or, perhaps, as an ebook, downloaded into your laptop or cell phone.The sad fact that this brilliant novel and West's earlier works brought him no significant money or recognition gives this writer succor."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"....To read Nathaniel West's description, it would seem so.Every character in this novel of 1930s Hollywood is a greedy scoundrel. Every character is out for him/herself. Everyone's a sinner, and it's absolutely delicious.I love novels with very eccentric, flamboyant characters. The kind of characters who perform on a dime. Faye, the main female character shakes, dances, gyrates, sings....for any audience, no audience etc..Storywise, you never know what's real and what's make-believe....which is a metaphor for Hollywood itself.The plot is Tod Hackett, an illustrator from the Mid-West coming out to Hollywood to work in pictures. The characters he meets, and the variety of personality traits, ticks, neurosis, dysfunctions are astounding. This is a novel of fringe, downscale, periphery Hollywood. The losers behind the scenes. Well, here's to the losers, because they move the plot and this has to be one of the most page-turning classic novels I've ever read.All throughout the novel you get the sense something big is going to go down.....and the characters' own extreme traits drive this. I love it when a writer gets mileage, not from actual plot turns and twists, but solely from personality traits. The story feels like it's just moving along on it's own, as opposed to being heavily contrived.I thought this novel was extremely interesting, thought-provoking, and suspenseful, as you never really know if the characters and scenes are play-acted, or for real. The reader is really left guessing. Is a fight, a real fight, when the participants just laugh the whole thing off at the end? Do these fringe characters really have all these personality ticks? Or, are these just affectations, at the ready for their next audition? Is there a real apocalypse coming, or is it simply simulated apocalypse, just like everything else along the Hollywood landscape?You never really know, which is what makes this novel so deep and thought provoking. It can be anything the reader wants it to be. The hallmark of great storytelling/writing is the many interpretations a reader can bring to it.Either these strange characters are the most creative, inventive people on earth.......or they are the most pathetic, depending on if you really believe (make-believe?) half of what they get themselves involved in.Some of the most memorable personalities in all of literature."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Now I know why Flannery O'Connor so admired West. His prose is crystal clear, his craft virtuoso. His characters, however ugly, are utterly compelling and tragic. There was simply no stopping them. They would hang on to their delusions even if it destroys them. And then there are the people with no hope whatsoever, existing just for surface pleasure and materialism. Tod, the 'artist', tries to help these people, and nearly goes mad with frustration. West's compassion for these people (cloaked by his biting sarcasm and wit) makes this book a great work of art. It, like O'Connor's &quot;Wise Blood,&quot; are among the masterpieces of American fiction. Read it and be ennobled."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"This is the quintessential Los Angeles is Hell book and with good reason. Every character is corrupt or awful in some way, but they are just too funny to dismiss as despicable. The two protagonists, Tod Hacket and Homer Simpson, provide alternating perspectives on the Los Angeles Freak Show, with Tod as a sardonic observer who feels at home and Homer Simpson as the Mid-Westerner whose ultimately destroyed by Los Angeles.Rabelis-like hilarity and 20th century cynicism meet for a funny, disturbing book that's required reading for anyone that wants to mock L.A."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"I lived in Southern California during most of the 1980s (San Diego), and after reading this book, I was amazed at how little had changed since 1939, the year this book was published. West draws perfectly the despair and rootless emptiness underlying the pretty smiles, watered landscapes, imported plants and wonderful lifestyles. Reading this book reminded me of how I found the sight of a palm tree disturbing for years after I moved away.West also insightfully points out that the absurd culture has been produced by the transients, not the long time natives. I remember putting down Southern California in front of a native one time - she became upset and said \\"You people made it like this.\\""},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Nathaniel West's sardonic and dark novel of Hollywood ousiders is as warm and friendly as a dead codfish. A group of oddballs, all living in Hollywood all seem to be slipping towards destruction in this classic of the genre. A studio artist, an aspiring actress and old vaudevillian and others collide with each other in a quest for something intangible, and make glancing blows of emotion during their journey. It's interesting to me that West's novel, though full of tragedy in some sense, is not without humor, and the characters, though gritty, are slightly unreal. It feels to me almost like West has created a sick cartoon of a novel, which is absorbing and full of interesting visual touches, but never quite meant to be taken seriously. It is, however, riveting!"},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"If there is one test that tries all equally, it is the test of time. What is merely a statement of a fad, or a passing whim, quickly fades away. What lasts, thick and thin, good times and bad, passing through fashion and invention and change, proves itself worthy. So has Nathanael West's short novel, \\"The Day of the Locust,\\" passed its test of time. Written in and about the 1930s, it is a portrait of the most superficial of places: Hollywood. And, aside from progress in computerized special effects and the ever quickening turnaround of superstar marriages and divorces, what has changed about this town and its culture? Ah, nothing. The superficial reigns.West calls to stage a most colorful array of, some might say, \\"freaks.\\" But perhaps that is too harsh. These are misfits and fantasizers and wildly hopefuls. There is the actress part-timing as a prostitute, the cowboy without a ranch, the drunken dwarf, the lonely and geekish hotel bookkeeper in stupid devotion to the actress who never quite knows what to do with his immense hands, the screenwriter with a rubber horse in his swimming pool, the obnoxious and precocious child star, and a string of other unusuals that, in Hollywood, are all too usual. Their backdrops and scenarios are no less so: cockfights and porn flick screenings, questionable deaths, business schemes based on anatomy overthinking brain. It's all here. And West handles it all like a fine juggling act, never dropping the ball.His grand finale is indeed grand. It is what brings to mind the locust. This seething insect that acts en masse and without thinking, following just to follow, stampeding and destroying all in its ravenous path, yet not without eruptions of the grotesque.Perhaps what makes this all so moving is that Hollywood brings to spotlight what, after all, exists everywhere. Only here it is the stuff of which movies are made. Or, in this case, a masterly piece of fine literature."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Nathanael West created a haunting, eminently readable novel in 1939. The real twist is that the tale resonates today. West's keen and prescient evaluation of the dark side of L.A. stands up to contemporary times. It is a city that is complex: extremes of wealth and poverty, a city of dreams and nightmares, a place of competition and sublimation, where almost every facet of the city is touched by the \\"industry\\" of film with its vapor trail of glamour and beauty.The protagonist, Tod Hackett, is a frustrated commercial artist working for the movie studios, a \\"sellout\\" according to his art school compatriots back on the East Coast. The narrator's voice never fails to reflect the immediate events around him with fluidity and insight, key to the book's readability. Tod's philosophical examination and keen insight into his adopted City of Angels encompasses the city's unique role as a destination of dreamers that can deteriorate into a nightmare as the distinctions become clear between those that \\"made it,\\" those that think they're going to make it, and those that know they aren't. Tod's experiences with various characters in Hollywood could itself make a movie (and, indeed, has): the capricious survivor Faye Greener and her worn-out father Harry; contentious dwarf Abe Kusich, drugstore cowboy Earle Shoop, and perhaps the most complex and troubled character, Homer Simpson, a Midwest emigrant to the \\"promised land\\" who also is briefly a narrator. Throughout various scenarios ranging from religious revivals, movie openings, the business of a bordello, and the everyday ephemera known as life, West creates a memorable portrait of a man who is seeking something that perhaps can never be found. Tod is overwhelmed with nihilism but seeks to temper it with a dual objectification and repulsion towards Faye Greener.Perhaps what West creates most movingly is a portrait of L.A.- the excitement, the grunge, the messiness, the beauty of it all juxtaposed with the fairy tale meeting cold reality. With so few \\"making it\\" L.A. is a city filled with those who believe they are one step away from success, or have more chillingly, resigned themselves to feeding off the city and its inhabitants through various means. You have to be hungry, smart, and relentless to make it in L.A. Behind the sunshine and palm trees lies a spirit of fierce competition and brutal one-upmanship.I would strongly recommend this book for its straightforward yet beautifully insightful prose, and the unforgettable characterization of Tod Hackett, perhaps one of my favorite male narratorsoutside of Holden Caulfield. Entertaining, witty, and realistic, \\"The Day of the Locust\\" doesn't have a Hollywood ending. But would we want it to?"},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Holloywoodized America is held to the flame until the whole of the marshmallow has bubbled and dripped into the fire.

While largely tragic, this novel seems to have predicted where our society was heading with much success. West's descriptions of everyday life in early Hollywood may provide insight on why life today can seem empty and withdrawn. Los Angeles becomes a city where a way of life is conceived that eventually defines American culture. While its ending is nearly apocalyptic, West describes an alternative to the emptiness of the impending modern age. The &quot;Day of the Locust&quot; is so powerful it has affected the work of the present-day pop artisans Matt Groening and the Cohen brothers. Nathaniel West's life in Los Angeles was the model used for Barton Fink's cinematic travails. The DOTL's protagonist is named Homer Simpson. This is a beautiful piece of work"},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"In this wonderfully crafted mini-novel, Nathanael West captures the cultural essence of boomtown Los Angeles during its tumultuous adolescence. The dark, coarse, seamy side of the &quot;California dream&quot; is vividly portrayed here. The plot is not really the point in this period piece; the truth is in the characters and their always unfortunate interactions. For those who seek to understand the social history of southern California, this novel might be more useful than a half-dozen academic treatises."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Life is the struggle of the fittest. The strongest, both mentally and physically, have a better chance of winning in the competition for survival. In The Day of the Locust by Nathaniel West, a cockfight represents natural selection. A scene from the cockfight is \\"Juju rose but missed. The red thrust weakly with its broken bill. Juju went into the air again and this time drove a gaff through one of the red's eyes into its brain. The red fell over stone cold dead.\\" The many gory scenes of violence between two individuals in the fight for the American dream of wealth and fame leave no space for hope.The prominent theme of the novel is inevitable failure. Many who enter Hollywood are not strong enough to survive the artificiality and surreal atmospheres associated with aspiring actors and actresses. The weaklings in the fight for fame become insane and frail. For example, Mr. Greener, an unsuccessful comedic actor, \\"clowned continuously. It was the sole method of defense. Most people, he had discovered, won't go out of their way to punish a clown.\\" Mr. Greener's dreams were torn apart by the mobs of people who always criticized and patronized struggling actors and actresses. The inevitable destruction ensued by the mobs focuses only on the negative aspects of life in Hollywood. The constant allusion to suffering makes the overall setting of the novel not as interesting to read and not as realistic, because a person's fate can end with the accomplishment of certain dreams."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"This is *the* novel about Hollywood and its place in American culture.

The book is a character study of the interactions of various hanger-ons at the edges of the motion picture industry. The book is written in a tone of absolute dispair, and it tries to point out how pointless dreams and wishes are. There is no joy to be found in sunshine, oranges, the ocean, life... My optimistic soul wanted to rage against the author and the characters. I guess I can understand how a Jewish man would feel a sense of pessimism in 1939, but I can't recommend the book as anything but an example of the wrong way to see the world."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Due to the mediocrity of this novel on all levels, including not having a strong plot, not developing an original theme, and not including elements to make it a novel to surpass all other novels that deal with a similar time period, Nathanael West's The Day of the Locust is not worth its time reading.First of all, this novel has no strong, or even apparent plot. Without a plot, there is no backbone to support any ideas, if West were to introduce any. He does introduce an initial issue where the idealistic character Faye strives to make it big in Hollywood, a typical American Dream of the 1920's: \\"I'm going to be a star one day ... it's the only thing in the whole world that I want.\\" However, this statement is as far as the plot deepens; the rest of the 100 pages of the novel is filled with irrelevant instances that do not serve to continue the plot or even the resolve the issue.Secondly, West does not develop his original theme, which has the potential to be of outstanding interest to the audience. In the first couple of pages of the novel, he introduces his major theme as, \\"It is hard to laugh at the need for beauty and romance, no matter how tasteless, even horrible, the results of that need are. But it is easy to sigh. Few things are sadder than the truly monstrous.\\" He introduces this idea of an ugly side to humanity, however, he never evolves the theme into something more. Without the development of a major idea, this novel continues in its mediocrity.Lastly, there are no existent elements in the novel to make it a classic worth reading. There is no real literary value, since it does nothing to stir feelings within the audience. In addition, there are other outstanding novels that deal with this same time period, such as The Great Gatsby, that are incredibly hard to outshine if mediocrity is the highest level this novel is able to reach.Due to all of these reasons, The Day of the Locust has no real substance to prove that it is worth its time to read. It meets the standards of mediocrity, but only goes as far as just that."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"This book is often called the best book ever written about Hollywood.

When West is writing at his best he functions as a baleful documentor of what would grow into the LA we all know and love. Cults, pseudoreligions, celebrity-worship, crowds, riots, child actors, hodgepodge architecture, and an industry dedicated to the falsification of reality: all of them are here, and West's writing on these afflictions still retains force today. Ultimately, West sees LA as an environment in which no human goodness can survive-a kind of moral black hole-and this is certainly reflected in the novel's array of characters, who are largely a batch of self-centered xenophobes. Even Tod, ostensibly the novel's \\"hero,\\" tries (more than once) to summon up the courage to simply rape Faye. In other words, this book won't be a big hit with people who use \\"I didn't like any of the characters\\" as a criticism: a shame, because there's a reasonably good study of human desperation to be found here, and West's focus on how certain environments and cultures exacerbate that desperation is still profoundly relevant to our own day. A quick read, not very difficult, dense, or lyrical, but a fine addition to the \\"literature\\" on LA."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"West's dark novel of L.A.s fringe culture in the 1930s still packs a punch. Rarely has the seamier and more eccentric side of southern California culture (which I know well since I grew up there) been captured so starkly and been described with such a pitiless eye. It's a little bit like Todd Brown's cult movie, Freaks, in its focus on the lives of the unwanted and neglected rejects of American society. Only in this case, instead of the carnies Brown portrays, they are the Hollywood hopefuls who just barely eke out an existence against the highly polished backdrop of Hollywood's glitter and glamour. But the polish is shown to be a superficial and thin veneer below which lies the real Hollywood, a false but gritty world of forlorn hopes and broken dreams. Overall still a great novel and one that still packs a considerable wollop in its unvarnished and gritty portrayal of the seamy side of L.A. life in the 1930s."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Published in the late 30's, Nathanael West's \\"The Day of the Locust\\" reads like the proof of the betrayal of the American Dream. Both spiritually and materially, this betrayal was what most people had in mind by that time, when they were living the Great Depression. This feeling is so close to this writer prose and literary project that poet W.H. Auden coined the term \\"West's disease\\" to refer to poverty that exists in both a spiritual and economic sense.\\"The Day of the Locust\\" is one of the best novels about the early years Hollywood, when everyone thought it was easy to be a star -- not that nowadays this has changed, but today's starlets don't have the ingenuity that people had by that time. The narrative follows the lives of a couple of characters that are associated to the movie industry.When it was published, \\"The Day of the Locust\\" was little noticed and was considered of \`bad taste' by many critics. West's masterpiece's acclamation came with time, when reader's minds are opener to such a dark and pessimistic tale. Probably, by the time it was published, readers were so immersed in the issues that West brings up in his prose that it was difficult for them to apart from the problems.The narrative floats between two poles. At one side, we have very realistic features -- at the other, the movie industry looks surreal and even dreamy, what makes it very artificial, as a matter of fact. The main character is Tod Hackett, who has recently graduated from Yale University, and works as an illustrator and set designer for a movie company. He lives in the same building of Faye Greener, an aspiring and ambitious actress who doesn't date him, because he is neither handsome, nor rich.Through Heckett-Greener relationship, West will introduce in this book a handful of characters that are somehow linked to the movie industry and the flaw in the American Dream. One of them is Homer Simpson (no relation to the cartoon character), a kind of catatonic man who moved to Hollywood following his doctor's advice after a bout of pneumonia. He doesn't work and lives on the money he has saved. Trying to forget an uncomfortable memory he has of his love experience, he starts meeting Faye. And Tod becomes his friend of out curiosity.The set of characters of \\"The Day of the Locust\\" borderlines the surreal and even, the grotesque. Faye's father for instance is a man who lives in the shadow of his previous years of relative fame when he used to perform vaudeville clown. Now he his job is to sell homemade silver polish door-to-door. However, he still tries to get back to acting and find again the fame he thinks he once had.By using such device, West paints a cruel and realistic portray of the early Hollywood. A bittersweet evocation of a civilization that is cruel and tender to its own citizens. Something that was cool five minutes ago can be outdated now. Actors and other professionals are not people any more -- just tools to make money. Fame is something very relative. In the end, West says that those people will destroy and eat themselves -- just like a mythological monster, making of \\"The Day of the Locust\\" an unforgettable experience."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Interestingly, without any intention, I read this novel immediately after finishing Joan Didion's \\"Play It As It Lays.\\" Each is a burning indictment of Hollywood - this novel was written in 1939 and \\"Play\\" was written in 1970.Like Pynchon's \\"Crying of Lot 49\\", the style of this novel is quirky and many of the moments are meant to shock the reader. Some shocks (remember this is a 1939 novel) include a screening of a french pornographic film at one person's house of prostitution, a detailed description of a cock fight at Homer Simpson's (yes that is the character's name) garage, a beautiful actress's (Faye Greener) decision to pay for her father's funeral by employing herself with a silent screen actor's cat house, an incredible depiction of running through a studio's lot where one backdrop falls into another - distanced by centuries and continents from the prior, and an angry dwarf's (Abe Kusich) confrontation with about anyone he meets.The ending reads heavily. Is it metaphor? Is it purely emblematic? In any event, it is riotous, where the dying mental characters of the novel congregate like frantic sheep and hurt one another in a crowded attempt to \\"get one glance\\" at a movie star at the famous movie house where many films are opened - Kahn's Persian Palace Theatre.The book scoffs Hollywood's allure and sensual delight envisioned by the midwesterners (Homer is from Des Moines, Iowa) and others.\\"Once there, they discover that sunshine isn't enough. They get tired of oranges, even of avocado pears and passion fruit. Nothing happens. They don't know what to do with their time. They haven't the mental equipment for leisure, the money nor the physical equipment for pleasure. . . They watch the waves come in at Venice. There wasn't any ocean where most of them come from, but after you've seen one wave, you've seen them all.\\"The protagonist, Tod Hackett, cannot escape the ennui - the malaise - with which he lives. Like Walter Percy's \\"The Moviegoer\\", the character's life remains in a funk. Unlike Percy's character, Hackett does not escape the ennui, and becomes one of \\"them.\\" Those whose \\". . . boredom becomes more and more terrible. . . They have been cheated and betrayed. They have slaved and saved for nothing.\\" Life (for all of the characters in this book) is miserable under the golden sun of Hollywood.This is depressing - but not like Didion's \\"Play.\\" West does not reach into the mind of the protagonist. Instead, West shows us how unique and simultaneously droll Tod's life can be. One can only wonder if this novel is autobiographical."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Perhaps the best novel ever written about Hollywood, &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; presents a grotesque world in which pretense and reality have become so intertwined that it is impossible to distinguish between them any longer. Shot through with mordant humor (especially a sequence which describes a California funeral home in terms which anticipate Waugh's &quot;The Loved One&quot;), the novel deals with people who are chasing some illusory dream which they cannot even clearly articulate, let alone obtain. West paints a bleak view of humanity's chances, but he does so with such insight and well-honed satire (not to mention his wonderfully sparse prose, in which every word has been carefully chosen for effect) that the book is never less than compelling."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"This book is as relevent today as it was in the thirties...maybe even more so. Why do people flock to California, \\"the land of sunshine and oranges? Once there they discover that sunshine isn't enough. They get tired of the oranges, even of avocado pears and passion fruit. Nothing happens. They don't know what to do with their time. They haven't the mental equipment for pleasure...their boredom becomes more and more terrible. They realize they've been tricked and burn with resentment...the sun is a joke. Oranges can't titillate their jaded pallets. Nothing can ever be violent enough to make taut their slack minds and bodies. They have been cheated and betrayed. They have slaved and saved for nothing.\\" Brilliant stuff that captures the discontent of newcomers to Califonia and specifically jollywood. The joke that Californians are flakes and freaks is reflected not in the natives but those from elsewhere seeking more and more sensual satisfaction. A timeless book."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Extraordinary!This is not caricature. This was the \\"feel\\" of society--as felt by Nathanael West--in the Hollywood of the 1930s.More frighteningly, this was, I believe, West's forecast for the \\"feel\\" of future American society.How correct his vision!"},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Written in the 1930s in the midst of the Depression, \\"Day of the Locust\\" portrays the Hollywood glamour scene from the perspective of the oft forgotten supporting characters. This is, those who came to California with high dreams and have become bitter with resentment and disappointment. The novel is told from the perspective of a recent Yale grad, Tod, who is an aspiring artist who takes a job at a movie studio to pay his bills. Throughout the novel, West masterfully portrays a set of characters, whose twisted dreams and aspirations are intertwined into a delicate web of failure.Although Tod's psyche may be absent of unrealistic dreams of stardom and he is moderately successful, he lets his infatuation overcome him when he meets a talentless wannabe, Faye Greener. Although she may be living a pipe dream (and sings about getting high, for that matter), her vitality and energy enraptures not just Tod, but a whole set of diverse characters, from a dust-bitten cowboy to a painfully shy Midwesterner. Indeed, her mere presence can begin an undercurrent of sexual tension that manifests itself in a violent fury.Throughout the novel, Tod uses his imagination to picture the setting for his masterpiece painting, the \\"Burning of Los Angeles\\". In his months in Los Angeles, he becomes an acute observer of people, often singling out those who have \\"come to California to die\\". This includes not only the wannabe starlets, like Faye, but common laborers from the Midwest and South who came to capture the California dream but have had their dreams relegated to the dustbin.Overall, West succeeds in showing how the \\"other half\\" lived during the heyday of Hollywood, as nary a movie star enters the narrative. This is less a novel about Hollywood and more a novel about unrealistic dreams and their potentially sinister implications if left unfulfilled. Although written more almost seventy years ago, it is still relevant today."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"West makes a successful attempt to show the reality of Hollywood instead of the sugarcoated glamour usually permeated by the media. But is it the reality? Or is it just the perspective of a disillusioned writer? We will never know for sure, but us humans tend to take tragedy as more tangible than fantasy so it sure seems real. What makes this dark uncensored view even more shocking is the fact that it was written in the 1930s, when Hollywood glitz was supposed to be in its heyday. People were still jaded back then as they are now. West has a knack for character psychology, especially when showing how pathetic and desperate humans can be. I recommend Day of the Locusts mainly for that reason; you will find characters who want someone who wants someone else, the desperate young aspiring actress who is not yet corrupted but very soon will be, the stoic midwestern man who is out of his depths in the lies and games of Hollywood folk, the ordinary people around Hollywood just waiting for their chance with a rabid intensity, and the artist-narrator's who invisions all the madness around him as an apocalypse that will end in the \\"Burning of Los Angeles\\". I promise some characters in this book will make an indelible impression on you."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"This kindle edition of THE DAY OF THE LOCUST has a lot of typos. The first chapter alone has three, including \\"truculent\\" spelled as \\"truculentas\\" (Is it being typed in a Tiajuana chop shop?). Annoying. I will read on a bit, but if I find many more, I will be returning the book."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"West's account of Los Angeles is a brilliant counter to the happy, celebrity-filled portrait of Hollywood that pervades the American consciousness. One of the most wrenching indictments of Hollywood culture, it is as applicable today as 60 years ago. A short, superb book."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"What \\"The Day of the Locust\\" lacks in plot, it more than makes up for in character development. This short but powerful novel is about the Hollywood of the 1930s. It's a third person narrative that describes it's subject matter, largely though not exclusively, from the point of view of Tod Hackett, a fledgling set and costume designer newly arrived from the east.As author Nathanael West tells it, Hollywood and California in general is not so much a place as it is a destination. A destination not only for those seeking fame and fortune in movies, but for those yearning to restore their physical, mental and spiritual health. Personifying the latter group is a repressed Iowan with the improbable name of Homer Simpson. Tod becomes acquainted with Homer because of their mutual infatuation with a beautiful but vapid would be starlet named Faye Greener.\\"The Day of the Locust\\" is a skillfully written novel notable for its fascinating cast of characters and its vividly descriptive prose. Written nearly 70 years ago, it has weathered the test of time and passed with flying colors."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"The movie industry is the draw and an incredibly odd collection of characters find themselves living marginalized lives in the shadow of early Hollywood. Their lives interact in a series of bizarre scenes fueled primarily by lust for the one female character who is completely self-absorbed and has somehow transformed the attention from men she encounters into her own fanasy version of celebrity.There is a dark undertone of violence that finally erupts in a random and surprising way that sems to be a rebellion against the perversion of reality that Hollywood represents.Not a great book..but a memorable one."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Too bad Nathanael West didn't live long enough to work with the Coen Brothers! Instead he wrote screenplays for B-grade films in a Hollywood that considered language an obstacle to art. Luckily he also found scraps of time to write five novellas and a couple of stories, and two of those novellas - Day of the Locust & Miss Lonelyhearts - are in a class by themselves, the most original and incisive American fiction of the 1930s.Day of the Locust is a wild and willful satire of Hollywood and the film industry, a Coen Brothers film in very well-crafted prose, killingly funny and at the same time fearfully sad. The focus character is an artist who has come to Hollywood to escape the art-school banality of painting red barns and lily-pads. Now he's working on a single apocalyptic painting -- \\"Hollywood in Flames\\" -- depicting the desperate anomie of \\"those who have come to California to die.\\" In the foreground of his painting will be all the bizarre hapless cast of people in his own grungy screenplay life. The painting is the novella, and the novella is the painting, a point that many readers seem to have missed. It's a quick read, friends, and a tightly assembled script, and I don't really want to mute the excitement of reading it by blabbing too much of the action.As a depiction of Southern California as it was in the 1930s, it's worth a thousand books of sociology, rich with sketches of \\"...the cultists of all sorts, economic as well as religious, the wave, airplane, funeral and preview watchers - all those poor devils who can only be stirred by the promise of miracles and then only to violence... marching behind his banner in a great unified front of screwballs and screwboxes to purify the land.\\" Not even Raymond Chandler ever captured the tawdry menace and lurid intoxication of Los Angeles as well as West. Hollywood was truly the Potemkin Village of desires, where everyone was his own leading lady and the next person's 'extra'.And it's bigger and better-dressed today - Los Angeles, I mean - with the Getty Museum and the Disney Center for the Arts, but anyone who has lived or worked there will know that 'The Day of the Locust' is still a true picture of its permanent impermanence and impending transience."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Nathanael West hits it right on the head. The subject matter of his most famous novel is all the more remarkable in light of the fact that it was written in the 1930's. What we take for granted as the sordid and seedy stories of Hollywood today are actually nothing new, but it takes a shrewd observer like West to show us how even the periphery of the glamour capitol can go down in flames. Perhaps the greatest single symbol is the hero's painting, titled &quot;The Burning of Los Angeles&quot;. Think about that when you conjur images of Watts, Rodney King, Mark Fuhrman, and O.J. Simpson. I picked up this book when I saw it listed on the controversial &quot;100 Greatest English-Language Novels of the 20th Century&quot;. Until then, I knew it only by reputation but it was well worth investigating. Nathanael West is the real godfather of Hollywood. A shame he is not around to comment on it today."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Although this book left me quite depressed after my first read through, it still is one of the best books I ever read.

Shows how society can corrupt even the best persons."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"West presents a satiric, yet saddened look at how dreams are often shattered by reality. In this novella, West uses metaphor after metaphor to show how perverse the society of Los Angeles has become. Love has become nothing more than &quot;a vending machine,&quot; and he describes how the statue of Eros, the God of Love, was hidden in a trash can, covered by yesterday's newspaper. The ultimate question he leaves the reader with is what, if anything, can be done to save this ruined society based on unfulfilled dreams"},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"I bought this to teach to high school seniors instead of the New Directions edition, which also contains Miss Lonelyhearts. I was attracted by the interesting cover, but the inside copy is not professionally laid out. There are misspelled words and the formatting is way off. Lines break in some places for now reason at all. The paragraphing needs work, too. It seems to me that this was rushed to press without quality control. Seeing how the New Directions edition is cheaper,and contains Lonelyhearts I see no reason to buy this. This company should do better work before issuing great books like this."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"Nathanael West's \\"The Day of the Locust\\" was an inspirational book. It is based in the 1930s and centers around Tod Hackett, a man that had just moved from Yale to Hollywood to take a job as a designer. This book is thoroughly enjoyable to read. It explores themes such as materialism and obsession, making it easy to relate to and therefore much more fun to read. Nathanael West develops a handful of stereotypical characters with flat, yet flamboyant personalities. Tod Hackett is really the only character that develops throughout the book, though not necessarily for the better. However, even with stereotypical, flat characters, \\"The Day of the Locust\\" never gets boring.Tod Hackett moves to Hollywood and is immediately disgusted by the type of people there. However, the longer he stayed in Hollywood, the more he conformed to them. He is swept up by Faye Greener, an aspiring actor. He develops a deep obsession for her, one that she does not share. However, Faye is an actor through and through and never has true, genuine feelings. At first, Tod does not realize this whatsoever and continues to try to get with her. Nothing he does ever works, though. He does not understand why until, after living in Hollywood for a while and beginning to understand the type of people that live there, he sees that Faye is just acting when she seems to flirt with him. This leads to Tod's first breakdown and, in a way, is the beginning of the end.\\"The Day of the Locust\\" comes to a dramatic, fantastic ending when the one thing that Tod Hackett hated more than anything else about the people of Hollywood overtakes him: materialism. From the minute he moved to Hollywood he could not understand why the people there were so materialistic. Yet, over time, he develops into the same type of person. Nathanael West did an amazing job in developing Tod Hackett as a person and showing just how much one's environment can change and corrupt someone and how much obsession can effect one's life."},{"Title":"The Day of the Locust (with a New Introduction by Robert Stone)","review":"DO NOT buy this copy of The Day of the Locust. I was shocked at the poor quality, as though it had been translated from another language. It is riddled with typos, and sometimes they even misspell the main character's names. The formatting is awful and the type is very very small. The book is also strangely large for a novel; this is not a professional print job. I can't believe I even paid money for this print, it managed to make reading un-enjoyable. Amazon, don't you do quality control?

The Author is very creative and original in developing each character in the novel. If you are looking for suspence, there's plenty of it. If you are looking for romance, the Author has you covered.

I already have a baby book for all that and was really looking for something to write letters to my baby and keep it all together. This book is just that.The Mommy Journal has made it easy and it's wonderfully decorated. There's no frilly stuff and you have enough space to write something without feeling as if you wrote too little. Also included are helpful &quot;thought provokers&quot; or quotes, in case you're not sure what you want to write about or where to start.I recommend it to any mom, expecting, new or experienced.

I'm disappointed and am returning the Mommy Journal."},{"Title":"The Mommy Journal: Letters To Your Child","review":"I have 3 of these, one for each of my children, and they sit on my nightstand for two reasons. One, I need to remember to write in them! And two, because they are the one thing besides my kids that I want to save in case of fire or other disaster. They really do mean that much to me! Every once in a while I will read through past entries and laugh, cry, or choke up a little as I realize how fast time goes and how much my kids have changed, and they are only 1, 3, and almost 5! Each entry space is not very big, only about 3 inches or so long, perfect for a busy mom to jot a few things down without feeling like I have to fill an entire page. I write about funny things they have said, difficult stages we are going through, their personalities, likes and dislikes, anything I want to remember or think they would find interesting some day. The illustrations are bright, varied, gender neutral, and very kid friendly, but aren't something that will hinder my writing as they get older and more \\"sophisticated\\". They have fun little quotes on some of the pages and a few game and song ideas scattered through the book, easily ignored if you don't like them but give you some inspiration if you need it. There is a space to write down each date but I love that they aren't already filled in because I would surely have a lot of blank useless pages if they were! I did write the names of each of my kids on the fronts of their own books so I can tell at a glance whose is whose and I also used a paperclip to mark the page I'm on to find it quickly, though a bookmark or something else would work equally well. I don't know if my boys will like reading them when they are older, I'm assuming their wives will :) but I hope they get a glimpse of their childhood and how much their mommy loves them based on my observations of their lives and the things we did together. This is easier to keep up with than a baby book, has a lot less guilt associated with it (because who needs more mommy guilt!), and is a great place to write letters to your kids about what you want for their lives, what goals and aspirations you have as a family, and little birthday letters every year. But it's also a great place to write down what they did to their brother, what messes they've made, the hilarious things they come up with, and all sorts of things that make up every day life.Truly a great idea, one I've passed along to many of my friends, and one I will keep up with for a very long time."},{"Title":"The Mommy Journal: Letters To Your Child","review":"this book is perfect. i use it to write down everything and how i feel and what my kid is doing. i love it and there are no restrictions... there are separate entry dates on the page but sometimes i just keep writing if i have alot to say and it won't fit on one section."},{"Title":"The Mommy Journal: Letters To Your Child","review":"I was never a journal keeper, so I really liked this one b/c it keeps it low pressure by giving you room for three entries per page.

I love that fact that it's not structured like a baby book with prompts on what to write in such as family history, first tooth, first steps, birthdays, etc.\\""},{"Title":"The Mommy Journal: Letters To Your Child","review":"I have one of these for each of my children.

LOVE IT"},{"Title":"The Mommy Journal: Letters To Your Child","review":"I really enjoy this journal b/c it takes the pressure off having to write a lot. I've always liked the idea of keeping a journal so that both myself and my daughter can remember all the small details that you think you will never forget but unfortunately do. However, every time I've started a journal, I never got past a few entries b/c I just didn't find the time and felt like it was another chore on my to do list. But with this pre-printed journal which gives just a small space per entry, I don't feel guilty about writing so little and can jot down thoughts very quickly. I would recommend this to any new mom, especially working moms too who will have limited spare time as it is."},{"Title":"The Mommy Journal: Letters To Your Child","review":"Loved the book for my first children (twins!). I had one book for each child, and it worked nice for quick notes or special thoughts to my baby. However, when baby number three came, I found I was no longer able to keep up the first two books, let alone three books. If you have more than one child, I would recommend a single book that could be used for all the children at one time (one that listed date, name of child, location, and a space to write your note). Not as personal to each child. But lets face it - you are busy! However, I have to say overall this is better than the \\"baby books\\" for marking first year milestones. It will sit nicely on your desk or nightstand reminding you to take a moment to jot something down. I have given this book as a gift to first time mommies."},{"Title":"The Mommy Journal: Letters To Your Child","review":"I love having this book to make little notes in when my kids do funny things.

All it is, is pages set up with three areas per page where you can write the date and whatever you want to say about that day. If I have more to say than what will fit in that area, I just use another block. Some other journals had spaces provided for each day/week/month with prompts about what to write (check off these milestones.) At first I thought that would be helpful, as I am not a great journaler, normally, but I think I would have felt constrained by those boundaries. You have to make sure you write something during those pre-determined blocks, or you risk have a half blank babybook, but you can't write more that what there is room for, or you will be into the next time period's space.This book has worked out perfect for me. Actually I bought two, one for each son. I plan to give them their book when the time is right."},{"Title":"The Mommy Journal: Letters To Your Child","review":"This is great.

I kept it, then went on to buy more substantial and specific ones. THEN I became a mother, and this is the only one I've had time to write in! I initially wrote down my daughter's first words and phrases, knowing I wouldn't really remember the order and dates of them. Now I write down some of her funny 2 1/2 year-old quotes or stories, while she adds stickers or drawings. I even jot down her descriptions of her drawings. This journal is now one of my true treasures."},{"Title":"The Mommy Journal: Letters To Your Child","review":"I bought this journal to start writing thoughts and memories about my son. I lost my father at an early age and I would give the moon and stars to have a written book of his thoughts and memories. From the description on Amazon, I thought this journal would have thoughtful little prompts and a nice area to write in. After receiving this journal and looking through it, I can tell that it is a nice journal to write a couple of sentences or record a milestone in but it lacks the space and format to write anything in depth or more than a short paragraph. The quotes throughout the journal are ok but again there is no real format or space to write a response to it. I do like the size and spiral binding of the journal. I will keep it to record a thought or two here and there but will keep looking for a more thoughtful journal. Also the journal pages are unlined and have multiple entries per page."},{"Title":"The Mommy Journal: Letters To Your Child","review":"A friend gave me The Mommy Journal when I was pregnant.

At a Fina gas station they stop to stretch their legs and have something to drink. Waiting for his girlfriend to return, Rex decides to take a picture of the gas station. He does not know that this picture will be the only clue as to what happened to Saskia at that same moment. Years later he still cannot comprehend her disappearance and embarks on an obsessive search for her.This rather short story has a really sharp edge to it. The very well written plot builds up to suspenseful finale, where the reader is enticed to a dance with his own conscience: Can not knowing the truth become an obsession that drives you to the extreme? One thing is certain: this story will not leave your mind easily. It is a disturbing little bugger, but one you cannot but love for its genuineness.This novella, written in 1984 by the Dutch writer Tim Krabbe, is titled \\"Het gouden ei\\" (The Golden Egg) and has been made into a Dutch movie \\"Spoorloos\\" (Untraceable) in 1988. This movie is sometimes even more disturbing that the original story, because the scenario, also written by Tim, is more elaborate and the characters seem to have obtained more depth. In 1993 an American remake \\"The Vanishing\\" was created, starring Jeff Bridges, Kiefer Sutherland, Nancy Travis and Sandra Bullock. But, believe me: you better skip this monster of a movie."},{"Title":"The Vanishing","review":"The book, The Vanishing, is a gripping, easy to read story about the formation of intense obsession and how it drives two men in their separate quests. Rex Hofman is a man who is deeply obsessed with trying to find out what happened to his girlfriend, who disappeared at a gas station during their vacation. This obsession is fueled by the intense need to know what happened to her, and it takes over his life, making it impossible for him to maintain relationships with other women. Raymond Lemorne, on the other hand, is a seemingly normal family man who wants to determine the extent of his evilness. When the obsessions of these men bring them together, the ending produced is unforgettable and truly disturbing. It is a unique ending for those who are tired of the predictability that is found in many suspense stories and it explores the limits of how far one will go to find the truth."},{"Title":"The Vanishing","review":"Krabbe wrote an amazing, unorthodox story. The book is one of the most horrifying I ever read, but at the same time it's a beautiful love story. A real pageturner and something to think about. One can really empathize in the main character's feelings. When he's about to make a deal with the 'devil', the reader feels the same dilemma: take the risk and find out the truth, or live in the agony of ignorance. But in fact there is no other choice than to turn to the next page."},{"Title":"The Vanishing","review":"Near Dijon, France, Rex Hofman and Saskia Ehlvest-his love interest-are heading to a hotel in Nuits-St. Georges in Burgundy; they are on vacation. After a brief spat while on the road, they pull into a gas station called TOTAL and make up. Saskia plans to drive the second leg of their trip, but before she does so, she needs to do a bathroom and drink break. Affectionally, she wants to buy a soda for herself and a beer for Rex, the latter being a researcher and journalist whose speciality seems to be directed more towards the sciences. While Saskia heads into the gas station, Rex waits in line at the pumps to tank up his car. When done, he parks the car and keeps himself entertained with some light exercise and whatnot. In that period, he is overcome by a sense of bliss at how lucky he is to have a woman like Saskia as his girlfriend, for she is definitely marriage material. However, as time passes, Saskia does not return to him, and he wonders where the heck she is. Searching frantically throughout the gas station, Saskia has totally vanished, and her whereabouts are unknown. This sends Rex on an eight-year odyssey that consumes him not only financially but mentally as well. He does a media blitzkrieg of a campaign which yields no clues; people tell him that she probably left and is simply living another life. He does not buy it, and so he embarks on a maddening journey that involves \\"witnesses\\" and psychics. Even his current girlfriend, Lieneke, who knows of Rex's heartbreaking past, cannot pull him away from his maddening desire to know what happened to his missing girlfriend, Saskia, for it is the not knowing that is killing him.Quietly lurking in the background is another man; his name Raymond Lemorne, a loving spouse and father of two adoring daughters. He is a popular chemistry teacher who lives in Autin, in the district of Saone-et-Loire. By all accounts, he leads a rather idillic life. He is respected, good at his job and has a demeanor that is affable and approachable. One day, a young girl was drowning, and he saved her before the eyes of his family. Due to that incident, he became a superhero who had accrued family laurels. However, something is simply not right-in-the-head with Raymond, for if he can be brave superhero, can he not also be a methodical, villainous monster? So a scheme is hatched and perfected upon repeatedly. He plans to do evil on an innocent young woman, preferably a mother. He hunts for the perfect prey, scouting various locations and acting out scenarios in which to trap his victim. As it happens, he too was at the TOTAL gas station and ultimately has the answers that Rex Hofman is desperately seeking. Witnessing the media campaign of the beleaguered Rex, Raymond confesses that he is that man that Rex is looking for, the one who can help him acquire the horrific truth. However, he will not give it to him willingly; he must go through the motions as Saskia did. Then he will have his truth. Ever so compliant, Rex agrees to do whatever is asked of him, and he follows to the end. He must drink a chloroformed laced coffee and go to Lemorne's secluded log cabin in the woods. All eventually gets revealed. The answer is disturbing, and it will leave readers shuddering.The Vanishing was a tightly woven novel with a very credible and unnerving plot that could have been ripped from current-day newspaper headlines. It is short, fast-paced and evocative of the dark side of warped human nature. The inspiration behind two good films of the same name, The Vanishing was a simple yet stellar read."},{"Title":"The Vanishing","review":"A terrifying tale. The moment at the end is described so vividly I felt for a moment I had suffered the same fate. A gem of psychological horror. The author also manages to portray the complexity of male/ female relationships with the same sophistication as Milan Kundera."},{"Title":"The Vanishing","review":"A man and his girlfriend stop for a break whilst driving to their holiday desination.

After 8 years he spends a fortune trying to get the story by taking out ads and this brings the man who knows what happens to Rex's girlfriend to his door. Does he really what to know what happened?"},{"Title":"The Vanishing","review":"In the original language (dutch), this short-story is titled Het Gouden Ei which means The Golden Egg. And this golden egg is just one out of many elements in the subtle symbolism of this story by Tim Krabb&eacute;.It is basicly a crime story, and even one with no great surprises. At least not concerning what happens in the story itself. Even the ending is of little surprise (this, however, does not make it less scary!). But the way in which it is all told is of pretty high level. It is a simple story, with a lot of subtle elements, told in an exciting manner, written in a simple language.All in all recommendable. Especially for impatient people."},{"Title":"The Vanishing","review":"I wanted to give this book five stars, or at the least four, I really did, but then I went away to college and took this class.......... &quot;The Vanishing&quot; is disturbing, no doubt about it. The ending is horrific and the fact that Lemorne is rewarded at the end of the novel for his deeds is just plain wrong...but still, there's something about this story that grabbed ahold of me... The think you need to watch the Dutch film as well as read this novel, (it's also written by Krabbe) because it wasn't until the final scene that what I truly liked about this novel was hammered home. This is a novel about love, and about two people who are reunited in death. Rex's obsession with Saskia can be viewed as damaging, but it can also be viewed as something of beauty, to want, no, to need something so much that you're willing to die for it (not that I recommend anyone going the same route of Rex). It's hard to recommend this book because it can have an affect on a person, which I think is an aspect of good writing. This book isn't perfect, far from it, but I do think it's worthwhile to read and that someone can pull something valuable out of it (just switch the ending so Lemorne gets eaten by a pool of hungry pirahna, I think)."},{"Title":"The Vanishing","review":"If you are thinking of buying this because you liked the movie so much...don't bother.

Spalding's world tour of professional baseball, the New York Giants, Chicago White Sox and other superstars undertook another incredible odyssey that touched down in the Philippines, Europe, Egypt and U.S. cities.Author James E. Elfers does a masterful job in reconstructing this forgotten diamond gem that lasted six months in 1913-1914 which found the players paving the way to the modern marketing of the game, along with trading yarns with millionaires like Thomas Lipton and being granted an audience with Pope Pius X. The pop culture fascination with athletic achievement is certainly not new.The list of stars could be an all-time team today - Tris Speaker, Buck Weaver, Sam Crawford - and included arguably the greatest all-around athlete ever, Jim Thorpe. Elfers also has excerpts from an interview he conducted with the last living witness of the trek - Ben Mall - who was 100 years old at the time of the meeting.This is a history that has been dusted off like home plate after the wintry months give way to spring, with the first batter smacking a long home run."},{"Title":"The Tour to End All Tours: The Story of Major League Baseball's 1913-1914 World Tour","review":"Author James Elfers provides a detailed account of the six-month World Tour of the New York Giants and Chicago White Sox from 1913-1914. A similar tour today would be impressive, but 95 years ago, it was simply amazing.Elfers descriptive narrative gives the reader a seat on the tour. From the little towns on the United States leg of the tour to Australia, the Philippines, Egypt and Europe, you get a taste of what it was like for the players. Elfers describes the weather, the games, the crowds, the ball fields, the receptions, the ships, the hotels and the off-the-field activities. And, he provides a dose of history for each stop.Some of the better-known players on the Tour included Jim Thorpe, Buck Weaver, Fred Merkle, Tris Speaker, Mike Donlin, Sam Crawford, Germany Schaefer, Larry Doyle and George Wiltse. Thorpe and a couple other players were on their honeymoons.I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in baseball in the Deadball Era or the Tour itself. This is an excellent addition to baseball history."},{"Title":"The Tour to End All Tours: The Story of Major League Baseball's 1913-1914 World Tour","review":"The US was looking for things to do to take their minds off of the hardships of the time. Baseball was the perfect vehicle to do that. It involved teams with a large number of players, that lasted 2 hours or more. It would also allow a large fan base to surround the field in a picnic atmosphere, to see the action.The author has conveyed different feelings as to what baseball was about in this time period of US history. To push our emerging sport out for the world to see was an incredible chance to elevate many things. First, that we loved to do things together for fun. Second, that the US was a strong and diverse country reaching out to other countries. It is amazing to think of the diversity of the audience this team played to.These players who took part in this must have known what they were portraying to the world, THE LOVE OF THE GAME!The author had to dig hard to research all of the information gathered from this time period.

This book is a collection of research papers (of the sort you'd find published in books on HCI or from conferences of the ACM SIGCHI committee) organized into chapters by some shared topic (i.e. human factors, hypertext, speed/language/audition). Each chapter is preceded by a summary of the papers contained therein along with often useful bibliographic citation of related works, all grounded in their utility toward the field of HCI by the editors.Nevertheless, as my title expresses, this book is even by the time I encountered it in graduate school (in 2003), relatively dated. As a supplement to recent publications on the ACM or IEEE digital libraries or through a process of professorial selection of relevant pieces it can nevertheless be an extremely useful textbook to a graduate-level course.

The pages are conveniently divided into 2 larger columns, one for the Judah, one for Israel. This method takes much of the confusion out of trying to figure out what is going on where and when, since the &quot;overlaps&quot; are shown side-by-side. I think such a harmony in essential to have available to the Christian community. I myself teach Sunday School and have found it indispensible. My only objection to this particular harmony is that Mr. Crockett has seen fit to rearrange the chronology in places (rather than just going straight through Samuel and Kings, incorporating Chronicles where it overlaps). His way of doing it has made it difficult for those without harmonies to follow what it going on."},{"Title":"Harmony of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles","review":"This harmony is similar to a harmony of the Gospels.

In 1897 it was a popular sensation outselling Dracula, which was published the same year.The characters are well drawn: Paul Lessingham, a budding cabinet minister with an ominous gap in his past; lovely Marjorie Linton, a witty New Woman caught between her Radical lover (Paul) and her Tory father; madcap young scientist Sydney Atherton who also adores Miss Linton and is meanwhile working on weapons of mass destruction for the glory of the British Empire; Robert Holt, down-and-out clerk who falls into the clutches of the Beetle.As for the Beetle, this amorphous, androgynous nightmare transmigrates at will between a barely human form and a sadistic Egyptian scarab. An accomplished mesmerist, the Beetle can make a slave of almost anyone (including the reader). Why is it hiding out in civilized London instead of pursuing its hideous prehistoric rituals back in Egypt? Paul Lessingham, to his horror, is the unwilling magnet drawing the vengeful Beetle ever closer.The plot offers a steady stream of dramas and crises peppered by exciting chases on foot, by cab and by rail. There are quite a few comic moments, despite the heavy nature of the threat to everyone's life and sanity. That, in fact, is one of the most remarkable aspects of the book. It's both a Kafkaesque plunge into paranoia and a Shakespearean comedy of errors, a confrontation with unsavory eroticism and a pure love story.I'd recommend the Broadview edition above all others because of its readable format and thought-provoking scholarly content.But don't read the introduction before the book. Save those insightful interpretations of The Beetle for dessert! Approach The Beetle without preconceptions and have your own visceral experience of the Uncanny, just as readers did in 1897."},{"Title":"The Beetle","review":"Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" and Richard Marsh's \\"The Beetle\\" were both published in 1897. Surprisingly, \\"The Beetle\\" outsold Stoker's novel three-fold in the first few years of their publication. So why has this novel faded into relative obscurity? Because it does not translate well to modern times. Where Stoker's novel still holds many chills for its reader, \\"The Beetle\\" is so dated with its blaring xenophobia and chauvinism that the things which are meant to scare us do little more than provide mild amusement.At this point you may be asking why, if I feel this way, did I give this novel four stars? The answer is simple: it is a wonderful piece for its time and, if viewed through a historic lens, one can see why it was so wildly successful. In many ways, one can compare it to \\"Dracula\\", what with its shifting narrators, tightly woven plot, and shape-changing antagonist. If you're into supernatural fiction, Victorian fiction, or some some combination thereof, this is a wonderful book. If you're looking for a terrifying read I doubt you will find this novel satisfactory."},{"Title":"The Beetle","review":"Richard Marsh's novel _The Beetle_ is the story of a British statesman, Paul Lessingham, who is haunted by his youthful indiscretions in Egypt. A shape-shifting figure follows him from Egypt, intent upon getting revenge on Lessingham. While the book has some interesting aspects, it lacks important plot elements. For example, (spoiler alert) the book builds up to a confrontation between the \\"good guys\\" (Lessingham and company) and the \\"bad guys\\" (the Beetle). Yet, that confrontation never occurs. The end of the book also leaves some loose ends.Despite the plot problems, and the archaic attitude toward race mentioned by other reviewers, the book has some fascinating aspects. The character of Sydney Atherton, a lovestruck mad scientist, is especially compelling. He narrates the second section of the novel; later, we read other characters' impressions of him. This dual view gives a fascinating portrait of Atherton's character.The novel also differs from most canonical Victorian fiction. It openly mentions nakedness more often than I've seen in any other novel from this time period. It also grapples with interesting questions of gender, especially the gender of the villainous Beetle.Overall, I'd say that the book has some compelling moments and characters, although it lacks a strong overall plot."},{"Title":"The Beetle","review":"The Beetle, a novel of the occult by Richard Marsh, was, at one time, outselling Bram Stoker's Dracula. Today, it is far less known, but still worth belonging in any collection of weird horror tales. The development is episodic, done from different character's viewpoints, much as Stoker's Dracula was, but the tale is much briefer. We are never given quite the 'in your face' explanation that Stoker had for his novel; instead, we are left with a mysterious being whose origin and nature are tantalizingly hinted at but never fully explained, which is just fine by me. The occasional Victorian sentiments about women and certain cultures must be taken with a grain of salt; after all, they are a product of their time All in all, a worthy read."},{"Title":"The Beetle","review":"The Beetle is reminiscent of other late 19th century adventure/mystery/preternatural suspense novels such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and The Hound of the Baskervilles. There's a bit too much xenophobia for modern tastes (similar to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom), but, that aside, it is an entertaining read (after the first fifty pages or so) for those with a late 19th century sensibility.

When I read the first part of this book, I didn't know whether to be freaked out/repulsed or intrigued. I couldn't tell if I liked the book so far or if I found it too weird to go on reading. But, of course since this was a book I had to read because my grade depended on it, I kept reading. Part 2 gave the story a new light and I found myself unable to put the book down. I wanted to figure out the mystery of the Beetle SO badly! What a great read it was. My only complaint is the ending...it seemed to end so abruptly and I would have liked to see some kind of battle or confrontation of the men and the Beetle.

The idea of a man turning himself into a beetle at will is too bizarre to fall into the \\"it could have once happened\\" category, while with \\"Dracula\\" every part of the world has some form of the vampire legend.The one place where \\"The Beetle\\" does better than \\"Dracula\\" is in the narration. Marsh limits his tale to three narrators whose stories overlap, where Stoker jumps back and forth between various letters and journals. Unfortunately, the characters are poorly drawn and prone to utter nonsense intended to be either witty or clever and come across as neither. And Marsh has no van Helsing to explain things. The closest he has is the detective at the end, who should have entered the picture sooner since he seems to be the only one with any sense.\\"The Beetle\\" isn't a bad book, but it's no classic either.

It's borderline academic.I bought this book some time ago at Half Price Books because of the title and cover art as much as anything...being a hard core car buff who grew up with the 50s cars. The promo info sounded interesting, too. What influences car design? More to do with looks than inside tech stuff. The fins of the 50s for instance.This is a well written book by an expert who tries to give the reader insight into this concept and does a great job, although some of what he says is a bit \\"deep\\" in a few spots, but nothing to ruin the read. I came with a communications and art background, as well as being a die-hard car buff, so that might have spurred me on to buy it and like it.Anyways, no matter your background, you can pick this book up cheap, so try it. I just bough two copies to replace the original I had which I gave to a friend for Christmas...only after finding out I could get more copies.This is one of few books I've ever had this kind of response to: went over to the house of the guy (another car buff) who recieved the book for Christmas. He brought out the book with markers sticking out of it and said, \\"What did you think of this passage?\\" He wanted to discuss the book and the author's thoughts and how it related to day's designs! Wow!An example of the neat stuff in the book is where he relates the supposedly true story of some famous car designer's remarks when seeing the Triumph TR7 for the first time: \\"God, tell me it isn't the same on the other side!\\"Author is a noted critic and curator for a major British museum and has authored several other books on design."},{"Title":"The Next Step to Greater Energy","review":"This is an incredible book for anyone who is addicted to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, sugar and even sex and loud music!

What a sad thought! And so untrue. I made my bestfriend after the age of 30, and I'll keep making new friends as long as I live. I think if you enjoy people, there will always be opportunities for more friends. I bought a copy of this gift book for my best friend because I love her so much, and I also love words and books. It is only because she is my best friend, that I am willing to give it up. This lovely, thought-provoking volume hallmarks the friendships that women experience. It enhances one of the values of being a woman beautifully: the closeness we feel to our women friends. Is there anything else like it? Being silly, listening, encouraging, empathazing, sharing thoughts that would abhor men. It makes you really glad to know that so many of us just love being inside the skin of a woman! This little gem shares quotes from unidentified women about their friends. Here is a sampling: &quot;The more we let our girlfriends know how much they are valued, the stronger our friendships grow.&quot; &quot;The bond that we forged so many years ago is now unbreakable.&quot; &quot;Every healthy, loving relationship between two people requires that both individuals be able to tolerate the differences between them.&quot; &quot;A true friendship is in trouble when you pick and choose what you reveal.&quot; &quot;All we may need is a friend to share her strength , and we can become clear-headed again.&quot; &quot;We share our vulnerabilities with each other and come away stronger.&quot; &quot;Regardless of culture or time or distance, women bond together through laughter, dares, and crazy plans.&quot; There, now that I've saved some of my favorite quotes, perhaps I can give this volume up to my friend, Cheryl."},{"Title":"A girlfriends gift: Reflections on the Extraordinary Bonds of Friendship","review":"My best friend of over half a century bought this book for me.

He sees that agent-causation requires an analysis of event-causation in terms of the powers of things as released or inhibited by circumstances, and of agents as beings that cannot be explained by physical science. He thinks that agents may be emergent beings whose existence depends on neural structures, but these agents have got to be more than epiphenomenally supervenient states; they have got to be a new kind of being, with causal powers of its own that physical science cannot fully explain.O'Connor is aware of modern-day alternatives to agent-causation, such as indeterminism and under-determinism. (Laura Ekstrom's recent _Free Will_ makes a good companion volume here.) He meets the common criticisms that agent causation results in an endless regress of acts of will, which he thinks rests on a misunderstanding of what agent causation is.O'Connor's style is clear and concise, and the book has the great virtue of being both thorough and short."},{"Title":"Smart Guide to Boosting Your Energy","review":"Anyone feeling, tired, dragged out, or stressed is sure to respond to this book's healing promise of regaining vitality with the right nutrition, exercise, and supplements."},{"Title":"Smart Guide to Boosting Your Energy","review":"Health expert Nancy Monson has created a zippy book chock full of practical ideas to boost your energy.

For example, Chiyo-ni was friends with prostitutes, and this was not considered unusual for a Buddhist nun; prostitutes were not shunned, for one thing, and both nuns and prostitutes had greater freedom than most of the women of Japan of that era.The poems are presented in sections for the four seasons, each one in both phonetic and script Japanese, with an English translation, identification of the kigo (the season word), and sometimes notes on Chiyo-ni's life at the time she wrote the poem, the mood being expressed, or cultural references with which a Westerner would not usually be familiar.The book is paperback but lovingly produced.

David Montgomery had to approach his genealogical research in the same way that I did when I started doing it in the 1970's: by letters and local records. His work is not scholarly, but it is incredibly comprehensive. His approach does something that frequently cannot be done using internet data--he was able to name children who were born and died between censuses. Also, he was able to include tales of pioneer struggles that were still fresh in the minds of the settlers.(2)THE PUBLICATION: This book was \\"created\\" using an OCR (optical character recognition) program. While it is well-bound and was shipped very quickly to me, I soon learned that the publication did not measure up to the original in two primary ways: (a) There are paragraphs and entire pages of gibberish that cannot be read, and these were not all caused by bad originals; (b) The Index is virtually worthless, as the page references are mostly wrong, and it does not follow the original.I would have preferred NOT to say anything uncomplimentary in a public forum, but the publisher left me no choice. I simply cannot find his contact information in the book or on the internet. I applaud the publisher's intention to produce a historic book economically, but surely SOME editing could be afforded. I would not be concerned about OCR spelling errors, but when entire pages turn out to be gibberish, they are nothing more than worthless sheets of paper.FORTUNATELY, the original book can be found on the internet. It is an awkward way to read a book, but the availability of the book on-line means one can find those original pages that are now gibberish in the \\"created\\" publication. One can use the original index to locate subjects in the book, but the page numbering will be different--sometimes by quite a bit.

Yet as William C. Davis notes, when the two sides met on July 21, 1861 it was the largest battle fought in North America up to that time. There, a Union army under the command of Irvin McDowell clashed with Confederate forces led by P. G. T. Beauregard and Joseph Johnston. At the end of the day the Union advance into northeastern Virginia had been halted, with the Confederate victory resulting in a rout of the Federal forces against them. Yet what many thought would be the climactic fight in the ongoing crisis over Southern secession soon proved to be merely one of many bloody battles to come. In this book, Davis provides a narrative of the fighting within the context of the campaign that led up to it, allowing readers to see the chain of events and decisions that led to the first major battle of the Civil War.What emerges is a saddening picture of eagerness and gaiety born of ignorance. Both sides had experienced a sudden influx of volunteers for military service in the aftermath of the surrender of Fort Sumter, with many hoping to see action before the war came to an end. Both sides were unprepared for what was to come, with the respective armies coping with the explosive growth and the disruption caused by fluctuations in command. Command of the Union forces (the temporarily named Army of Northern Virginia) rested with McDowell, a former West Point instructor whom the author judges favorably despite his defeat. By contrast, Davis is far more critical of McDowell's counterpart Beauregard, whom he portrays as a vainglorious figure besotted with a belief in his own military genius. Longing to go on the offensive, Beauregard's plans were disrupted by McDowell's refusal to do as Beauregard anticipated, and the early hours of the battle went well for the Union. It was the timely arrival of reinforcements as directed by Johnston which decided the battle for the Confederacy, with the green Federal troops ultimately routed in an embarrassing defeat.Davis recounts all of this in a highly readable narrative that does an admirable job of untangling the chaos of the battle. Though hampered by the poor quality of the maps provided, this problem is more than offset by his masterful use of anecdotes, which offer memorable moments amid the ebb and flow of the fighting that he dissects nicely for their broader significance. Reading this, it is easy to understand why, over three decades later, Davis's book has yet to be surpassed as the best book about the battle, one that should be the first source for anyone interested in reading about it."},{"Title":"Battle At Bull Run: A History of the First Major Campaign of the Civil War","review":"I had a fun time reading this book. The prose were smooth and ran like a novel. Professor Davis presents the battle from both sides, Confederate and Union, so one gets the feeling that he's been in both sides camps, acquainting himself with the central characters, (McDowell, Beauregard, Johnston, Shanks, and of course the Mighty Stonewall, to name a few) as well as the regiments and brigades, and both sides respective plans of strategy. The reader comes to realize how drastically different this first major battle of the Civil War was from those that followed. Civilians would come to watch with their picnic baskets as if it were a sporting event. And how annoying it must have been for the West Pointers to have to deal with undisciplined volunteers who would go berry picking on their way to battle. Again, how frustrating it must have been to have both sides wearing gray uniforms and blue uniforms and not knowing whether they were shooting at the enemy or their own side.The last chapter in the book sums up the fighting and presents a thoughtful analysis of the Battle at Bull Run. Professor Davis also acquaints the reader with the future careers of the officers who played a major part in this first major battle.I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Battle At Bull Run: A History of the First Major Campaign of the Civil War","review":"Thus setting up the first major battle of the War.

On the 21st of July 1861, 60,000 American soldiers from the North and South met along the banks of Bull Run. In the fighting that followed the Union forces lost 2,900 out of the 20,000 men engaged while the Confederates lost 2,000 out of about 17,000 engaged.The first half of the book describes the Union and Confederate forces as they muster their men into the first armies of the Civil War. It continues with an outline of the events' leading up to the battle and gives you a feeling for, and an understanding of, the main characters involved. Future heroes and leaders of the Civil War come to the fore, such men as \`Stonewall' Jackson, Jeb Stuart, A.P. Hill, Jubal Early and Joseph E. Johnston for the Confederacy and men like William T. Sherman, Ambrose Burnside and Irvin McDowell for the Union.The final chapters describe the fighting from Blackburn's Ford to the final rout of the Union Forces on the evening of the 21st. The author's description of the intense fighting is gripping and written in such a fluent style that it holds you to the narrative. Although the casualties for this engagement were not significant when compared to those bloody battles that followed you still feel for the individual soldiers who were caught up in this terrible War.This book is an enjoyable and easy to read story and is well presented by a number of photographs taken at the time of the battle or shortly after. The author has included 8 small, but easy to read maps that help you follow the outline of events during the battle. This book is recommended to any body who has a love for this period of history or to the general reader who likes a good story."},{"Title":"Battle At Bull Run: A History of the First Major Campaign of the Civil War","review":"Mr. Davis has over the years provided Civil War enthusiasts with many fine books dealing with most aspects of the war. He has written books on the politics of the era, biographies of some of the era's leading figures and is the case here, he has written battle histories. This book like the author's other offerings is clearly written and concise, easy to understand and read and most importantly, it is not dull. Many authors offer up books that are just full of good information but reading them is like reading the Biblical book of Leviticus. Heaven only knows just how many well intentioned people have attempted to read the whole Bible but have come to a dead halt upon reaching Leviticus. The same applies to history books which go into such mind numbing detail about every movement of every regiment and company that the reader finds themselves completely lost and frustrated. Davis, with his wonderfully chatty writing style avoids this problem while still giving the reader all of the pertinent details.Davis begins his story with Fort Sumter where the reader meets General P.G.T. Beauregard, the first major player in this story. Beauregard of course becomes the \\"hero of Sumter\\" and goes north to Virginia with a high reputation and an even bigger ego. Davis is not kind to the Creole general in this book and in fact may be just a little too harsh. As the story progresses the reader is also introduced to some of the people who will be major players throughout the war. This view of men like Jackson, Ewell, Early, Sherman, Stuart and Burnside will certainly help the reader understand events shaped by these men later in the war and each of these men are destined to play a major role over the next four years. Davis does an excellent job of hinting at the future of these men and also pointing out little habits or quirks that are going to become important as these men rise in rank and stature.As with any well-written book, Davis builds the suspense as her works his way toward the battle. Actually, more of this book deals with the preparations for the battle than with the battle itself. Beauregard, who had an excellent eye for building defenses chose his ground and fortified it well. If the Yankees had just done what he expected them to do the battle would have been over in a very short time. The much-maligned Irvin McDowell had put together an excellent battle plan and Davis offers a pretty rousing defense of McDowell in this book. Davis clearly shows that had McDowell had a little better support and a little better luck, things might have turned out much differently. Besides being completely new to this type of command, McDowell had to deal with a President who was playing politics with his army and a General in Chief who not only disliked McDowell but was also playing political games. Then there was General Daniel Tyler who almost single-handedly destroyed McDowell's plan in a bid for individual glory and also General Patterson who's sloth and caution allowed Joe Johnston to join Beauregard before Patterson even knew he was gone.Davis does a marvelous job of setting up this battle and then does an even better job of describing the action once it all begins. He has set the whole thing up so well in fact that the narrative of the battle needed very little explanation for everything made perfect sense because of the set up. This situation allowed for the story of the battle to flow about as smoothly in this book as in any book I have ever read.The only real fault I found in this book was the maps. The maps were good but they were a little small which required me to put on my specks and there were too few of them. There are also several typos that should have all been weeded out in this revised edition and the publishers need to correct this problem in any future editions. Still, this is an eminently readable and highly enjoyable account of the first major battle of the Civil War. Well researched, well written, and highly informative, what more could anyone ask?"},{"Title":"Battle At Bull Run: A History of the First Major Campaign of the Civil War","review":"The Battle of Bull Run is a lucid account of the early days of the war climaxing with, of course, the first major engagement at Bull Run.

I particularly enjoyed reading in the book's last chapter summarizing what happened to the battle's main participants after Bull Run.All in all, a good and recommended read as the definitive account of the war's first major battle."},{"Title":"Battle At Bull Run: A History of the First Major Campaign of the Civil War","review":"While many narratives concerning Civil War battles and campaigns become extremely lengthy, Davis does a good job of covering the major events from April 12 - July 21, 1861 in only 260 pages, while still maintaining enough personal analysis, movements and primary accounts to make the read entertaining.The maps are few and far between until the engagment, during which the maps are plentiful and troop movements are easy enough to follow. Thus it would be helpful for those who know less about the land (or haven't read about it in books covering other battles throughout Northern Virginia) to have maps identifying areas like Centreville and the Shenandoah.The author himself analyzes the activities and decisions of nearly every brigade commander on the field. He concludes that Paterson bears the brunt of the blame for the junction of Johnston and Beauregard's armies, while lack of experience and raw troops lead to the breakdown of McDowell's offensive against the Confederate left.All in all it's a very good book. Other books on the battle will go into stronger detail, but this is a good first book to read about the campaign."},{"Title":"Battle At Bull Run: A History of the First Major Campaign of the Civil War","review":"I would like to give this review 3.5 stars. The book is too well written for a 3, but it has some flaws that make me somewhat uncomfortable with the 4 I am giving it. Davis' book about New Market is a 5 star effort.Davis succeeds in most areas with Battle of Bull Run. He describes the campaign well, and he gives adequate background of most of the key participating officers. The maps are adequate. The battle itself and the aftermath are competently covered. Most importantly, Davis' writing style makes for comfortable reading. His retelling appears objective and balanced for the most part, and it appears that he tries to treat the participants fairly with the information at hand all these years later. Although he does relish in retelling a few romanticized episodes (particularly in the opening), he is quick to point out the theater in these.So where is the book lacking? Overall, it is a bit shorter and more concise than what I expected of such a momentous battle (this will be a positive for some readers, less so for the more detail oriented.) Unlike his New Market book, there is no Order of Battle, detailed listing of unit strengths, or casualties. The maps could be larger, and zoomed in to particular zones. Davis' writing in this work is not quite as clear as it was in the New Market work (or at least as I remember it.) There are several points where sentences are not adequately phrased to give the reader a full view of the subject, without paging back through the book to find the original event 40 pages earlier. Other problems are some minor but annoying factual discrepancies (usually generalities, that are too general) or things that leave one wondering what the rest of the story was.One of the frustrating little things is the front cover Brady photo (paperback) that is also found later in the book. The text mentions this photo being used in reporting the Federal dead on Matthews Hill. The caption of the photo does not tell us that this is now known(?) to have been a staged photo of livemen playing dead, it just says that it is \\"often erroneously\\" identified.It is a good book and I will recommend it, but it is not a truly great book, so I feel necessary to express some reservations with my recommendation."},{"Title":"Battle At Bull Run: A History of the First Major Campaign of the Civil War","review":"Author William C. Davis has assembled a great amount of information on the Battle of Bull Run and put it together and a concise and easy to read format. Davis investigates the early generalship of both armies coming to grips with a divided nation and how each side will defend itself. The birth of Union and Confederate high command struggles early to define their strategies. Davis brings such issues to life as the very &quot;green&quot; Union and Confederate armies clash in and around Manassas. I liked how Davis built the climax of the battle together and how he wrote about the various brigades and regiments formed or that were directed as the birth of the first major battle formed. During the fighting Davis points out key areas of fighting in the short terrain near Bull Run and how brigades held together or either fall apart. It was interesting to read about how Davis downplayed the more popular events of the battle such as the myths surrounding the naming of Stonewall Jackson, or how the Washington's social elite were chased while being overwhelmed by a retreating Union army. Davis focused on the battle at hand while his references back up commentary, or soldier accounts. For anyone looking to understand the first major battle of the Civil War, they owe it to themselves to read this book!"},{"Title":"Battle At Bull Run: A History of the First Major Campaign of the Civil War","review":"In July 1861, half-trained Union and Confederate armies met in a corps-sized battle in northern Virginia near a not especially significant stream called Bull Run. On the Confederate side of the stream were the Manassas Gap Railroad, the Manassas-Sudely Road and Manassas Junction. The Yankees, who often thought in terms of rivers, called the battle \\"Bull Run\\" (and later First Bull Run, because, alas, there would be a Second Bull Run) and the Rebs called it \\"First Manassas.\\"The battle, by whatever name, was unique in the Civil War in that no general on either side had ever exercised high command in combat. July 21, 1861 would amply demonstrate that careers devoted to theoretical studies of warfare and peacetime soldiering provided poor indicators of success in real combat.The Federal forces were commanded by Irvin McDowell, a 42 year-old Ohioan who was a brigadier general in the regular army. He had once been an instructor in tactics at West Point. (Among his students had been a certain lackluster cadet named Grant, who had excelled only in drawing and horsemanship.)Opposing McDowell were two generals who had combined their two armies just before the battle, even as McDowell advanced. Joseph E. Johnston was a full general in the Confederate service and (in his own strongly expressed opinion) the highest ranking officer to leave the US Army in order to join the Confederacy. The Confederate man-on-the-spot who actually chose the battlefield was Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard, then still a brigadier general. He would later become one of the eight men to hold the rank of full general in Confederate States Army. Beauregard had been appointed as Commandant of West Point in January 1861. He held the job for a total of five days before Louisiana, his native state, seceded.McDowell was the loser in this first major battle of the war and he has received a great deal of bad press ever since because of that. Author Davis, however, holds that he performed quite well on the run-up to the battle and on the day itself. I think he makes a pretty convincing case for McDowell, especially when one considers the subsequent spectacular collapses of such Union generals as Pope, Burnside, Hooker and Rosecrans, each of whom had vastly more combat experience than the untried McDowell.In fact, McDowell came within an ace of winning the day, despite slothful and wooly-headed subordinates and undisciplined citizen-soldiers. He got across the river barrier in short order and assailed the Confederates so strongly that they were forced to improvise on their battle plan and tactics throughout the day. In the end, it was the virtually fortuitous arrival of E. Kirby Smith's fresh Confederate brigade at exactly the right time and place on the unprotected right flank of the Union army, just as it was exhausted and pausing for a final breath before sending Johnston's and Beauregard's hard-pressed men reeling into defeat. The attack by a fresh Rebel force on the Union flank stopped the Federal offensive cold, leading to an orderly retreat that swiftly degenerated into a panicked rout.\\"Battle at Bull Run\\" is, as Civil War books go, a relatively short and concise account of the battle and its antecedents. Author Davis defends the reputation of McDowell and is probably justified in doing so. He launches an all-out assault on Beauregard that is, I think, rather less justified. He joins with the judgment of history in dismissing the Federal general in the Shenandoah Valley charged with the task of keeping Johnston from joining Beauregard, as an over- timid, military dunce. Davis' account of the battle itself is straightforward and seems to me to be perfectly lucid.Overall, this is a good book about First Bull Run. Its main strength is in setting out the complex battle narrative. The analyses of people and politics that precede the battle are workmanlike but not much more. There is an indefinable but pervasive air about the book that proclaims it to be lightweight in nature. Oh, it's sound enough and well enough written, but somewhere there is a better, weightier book to be found or perhaps to be written.To my mind, the weakest part of the book deals with the aftermath. It focuses almost entirely on the Union side. General Sherman, who was a colonel in command of a brigade at First Bull Run, wrote about that first battle after the war was concluded. Davis quotes him in a sort of general summing up: \\"Bull Run Battle was lost by us not from want of combination, strategy or tactics, but because our army was green as grass. Though a source of great disgrace it was no misfortune, for we then realized that organization & discipline were necessary.\\"This is good enough as far as it goes, but it ignores the Confederates and particularly a strategic and tactical decision they faced immediately after the battle. In 1954, the Australian army published a brief and wholly admirable analysis of Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Campaign of 1861-62 which starts off with an account of First Bull Run. Military analyses often have a noticeably different texture than those of the pure historians. It's after the battle that the soldiers take their different tack. Here's what the Aussies had to say:\\"Johnston and Beauregard were trained and experienced soldiers. They must have known that the untrained and thoroughly beaten Federal army would take some time to recover any semblance of cohesion, even if left unmolested. They must have known that an improvised brigade or so, filled with the intoxication of victory, could have chased it into Washington, or at the very least have occupied the heights commanding the Federal capital. But they saw too many difficulties, the disorganization of the army, the inexperience of the troops, the problem of supplies. But, while they took counsel of their fears, Jackson reorganized his brigade, packed three days' rations into it haversacks and impatiently awaited the order to advance--an order which never came.\\"Imagine it! Mighty Stonewall roaring like a lion before the gates of Washington while the Federal government and army quivered in terror before him. What strange new courses might history have followed after that?"},{"Title":"Battle At Bull Run: A History of the First Major Campaign of the Civil War","review":"This is the oldest book I have read on the campaign and battle of First Manassas/Bull Run but in no way did I find it to be outdated, or not relevant, for an understanding of what happened in July, 1861 in Northern Virginia.In my humble opinion, William C. Davis is a fine author with a lively style that I had no trouble reading or understanding. I will be looking for more books written by the author.The reader is given a good description of the situation in 1861 for both sides in the Virginia Theater of the Civil War, introduced to the principal characters for both sides (Lincoln, Scott, McDowell, and Patterson for the Union, Davis, Lee, Beauregard, and Johnston for the Confederacy), and made to understand why the battle took place where it happened. The author goes on to describe the campaign/battle and its aftermath in an entertaining narrative style. All the lesser characters in the story and the parts they played in the events described are layed out in a way that for me, gave them personalities. This made reading the book more enjoyable.Unfortunately, the book has no Theater of Operations, or Campaign map to help the reader undersand what was going on in the Shenandoah Valley, or how the armies got to the banks of Bull Run for the climactic battle on 21 July, 1861. No map is provided for the skirmish at Blackburn's Ford 18 July, 1861, so the reader has to learn about it through a combination of reading the description and looking at other maps that do show the area. The map showing the position of forces at dawn on 21 July is not bad, but like all the battle maps does not show the outlines of all the principal terrain features (Matthews Hill, Henry Hill, Chinn Ridge, etc.) that influenced the battle. Six maps show the unfolding situation at various times throughout the day. The maps only show infantry brigades for the most part, some regiments are shown, and Stuarts cavalry also, but no artillery batteries are Shown! (Not so good for following the action in a battle that in its most desperate stage centered around the back and forth capture and loss of two Union batteries on Henry Hill!) One map shows the Union rout and retreat from the battle. The quality and small number of maps are one of the two negatives I found in this book. (For more in depth descriptions of the combat I recommend \\"The First Battle of Manassas\\" by John Hennessy, and for better and more abundant maps \\"The Maps of First Bull Run\\" by Bradley M. Gottfried)The book did not have an Order of Battle for the armies and I always find this a negative for a Civil War Campaign/Battle history book, but for most readers it shouldnt be a problem. The book also has a good Bibliography for when it was released (1977). A big plus for this book is the 46 illustrations and photos of participants, combat units, and locations that readers learn about while reading the book. It always helps to have a face to go with a name when reading history, at least for me.The book goes into depth somewhat trying to figure out just what was said by Confederate General Bee about Thomas J. Jackson and his command on Henry Hill and the words meaning? (Compliment? Insult?) Interesting to see that there has always been some controversy surrounding Jackson's nickname since that day on Henry Hill among the participants, and in all the modern studies of the battle. Davis follows the traditional view that the biggest share of the blame for the Northern defeat can be laid at the feet of Union General Patterson and his failure in letting Joe Johnston and his Confederate Army of the Shenandoah give him the slip and unite with Beauregard's troops at Manassas. (Always found it interesting that Beauregard's army was the first one called the Army of the Potomac!)Loved the writing, found it to be a good description of the battle and campaign. The maps, not so good. But still a good read and source for information on the battle of First Manassas/Bull Run."},{"Title":"Lone Crazed Gunman? (Soft Cover) (Who was Lee Harvey Oswald, Why did Jack Ruby shoot him?, Are these unrelated questions?)","review":"Duffy provides nothing but the facts, taken from nothing less than the governments own records and documents. The result is clear, Oswald was not alone in life, or in the set up of the murder."},{"Title":"Lone Crazed Gunman? (Soft Cover) (Who was Lee Harvey Oswald, Why did Jack Ruby shoot him?, Are these unrelated questions?)","review":"When 52-year-old Jacob L. \\"Sparky\\" Rubenstein (more commonly known as Jack Ruby) stepped out of a group of policemen and reporters in a Dallas Police Department basement to shoot Presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald on November 24th, 1963, it sparked a whole new wave of \\"It Was A Conspiracy\\" talk with respect to the John F. Kennedy murder (which Oswald was charged with committing two days before he died at Ruby's hand).But when weighing all the evidence surrounding the actions of Jack Ruby during that November 1963 weekend when President Kennedy was assassinated, a clear pattern emerges -- and it doesn't add up to \\"conspiracy\\".Many conspiracy believers endorse the theory that has Ruby \\"rubbing out\\" Oswald at the behest of organized crime figures. But would a known blabbermouth like Jack Ruby have really been a wise choice for Oswald's killing (which was carried out on Live television all around the United States)? Who, then, is going to \\"rub out\\" the person who just eliminated LHO?Plus, there's the \\"timing\\" factor to consider when talking about any possible pre-arranged \\"hit\\" on Lee Oswald in the DPD basement. If Ruby woke up on Sunday morning with the intent of killing Oswald at 10:00 AM (which is a time that was later pushed back by the police), would Ruby have really NOT been in \\"position\\" to do the deed until approx. 11:20 AM (CST) that Sunday? (Could he have possibly known about the delays in transferring Oswald to the County Jail? Highly doubtful he could have known.)Also -- Would Ruby have really taken his dog with him to a pre-planned murder? (One of his pooches was found in his car after the murder of Oswald.) And would he have left that dog in his car under such circumstances? By all accounts he loved that dog greatly, even referring to \\"Sheba\\" as his \\"wife\\". He would never have taken that dog with him downtown if it was in Ruby's mind to kill Oswald at the police station that morning.And would Ruby have really taken the time to stop at the nearby Western Union office and send a $25 money order to one of his strippers (who worked at one of his Dallas nightclubs) just a mere four minutes before casually strolling into the DPD basement to encounter Lee Oswald? How can CTers possibly reconcile that pesky item?In my opinion, every single thing about Lee Oswald's murder by Jack Ruby spells a \\"last-minute\\" and \\"spur-of-the-moment\\" act of violence. And it also spells \\"deeply personal\\" on Ruby's part.It was known that Ruby was distraught and in tears much of that November weekend. The death of JFK hit him hard. And it's certainly true that the press was painting just one man as the killer of the President -- Lee Oswald. (And given the trail of evidence that the police had to follow, there was no other possible rational and reasonable conclusion to reach other than that.)So Ruby was probably thinking like most of America on that Sunday morning -- he thought this guy Oswald killed his beloved President. It's, therefore, fairly logical to assume that Ruby hated Oswald's guts that weekend. ........And Ruby was known to almost always carry a gun on him.....And Ruby was friendly with the DPD.....And Ruby liked to be \\"where the action is\\".....And Ruby could practically come and go at his own leisure within the DPD Headquarters and Precincts.....And Ruby always dressed rather conservatively (one policeman later stated: \\"I never saw Jack when he didn't have on a black suit\\"), meaning he could literally \\"blend in\\" with other similarly-dressed plainclothes policemen and reporters in the DPD basement that Sunday morning.....And at 11:21 AM on 11/24/63, Jack fired one shot from his revolver into the gut of Lee Harvey Oswald, resulting in Oswald's death 106 minutes later.All of this adds up to the actions of a second \\"Lone Nut\\" during that dark weekend back in 1963."},{"Title":"Crocheting Tablecloths and Placemats","review":"This book is FULL of elegant lace tablecloths and placemats.

Frazier has succeeded uncannily in getting inside Moore's skin, almost to the point of understanding him better than he understood himself. For the first time the many divergent facets of Moore's career come together in a coherent and gripping narrative. We see that though his enthusiasms, literary loyalties, and amorous propensities were as changeable as the clouds above Lake Carra, Moore was tenacious in a Quixotic quest for truth and freedom. His witty, indiscreet conversation, still so fresh in the pages of Hail and Farewell, Avowals, and Conversations in Ebury Street, was calculated to puncture many a pompous ego. A master of ridicule, he was repaid in kind. But a lifetime of struggle against British philistinism, Irish parochialism, and French cliquism cannot be written off as mere clowning. Moore often let himself down, yet his achievement as a whole deserves the epithet &quot;heroic.&quot; Had Irish Catholics and Nationalists, in particular, listened to his enlightened critique, they might have spared themselves a century of repression, mystification, and violence. Frazier illuminates Moore's sexuality (especially his relationships with Pearl Craigie and Lady Cunard) with Starr-like thoroughness. This serves to enhance our appreciation of his fiction: masterpieces such as Muslin, The Lake (1921 version), and In Single Strictness take on a new glow as we discover the erotic humus from which they spring, while the lesser or flawed works take on new interest as fragments of a great confession. Frazier has buried the George Moore of stale gossip and caricature and replaced it with a portrait as distinguished as Manet's on the front cover -- a portrait securely grounded in wide-ranging historical research."},{"Title":"Getting Through What You're Going Through","review":"This is an amazingly inspiring book that helped me get through a bad time and inspired me to go forward in my life to better myself through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Getting Through What You're Going Through","review":"Having recently been divorced and needing Christian influence to re-emerge in my life, God made this book available to me through my church.

The approach is is a nice alternative to standard texts and goes via valuation theory. McCarthy first deals with valuation theory of fields. Then he deals with extensions of valuated fields. These two chapters are straight forward. In the last chapter he defines structures he calls \\"Dedekind fields\\", this concept is based on valuations and is a generalization of the concept of an algebraic number field. He then proceeds by proving the unique factorization theorem on the ideals of the rings in these fields and gives an introduction to Galois extensions of these Dedekind fields (read: algebraic number fields).The book contains more than 200 exercises many of which are challenging.All in all a very nice book."},{"Title":"Algebraic extensions of fields (A Blaisdell book in pure and applied mathematics)","review":"The reviewer who gave this two stars sounds like he did not have sufficient preparation with the basics of abstract algebra.

But if you've taken an introduction to algebra class, and are now perhaps taking a following course in Galois theory - or if you're ready for higher level stuff like valuations on fields - this is a superb book for you. His conciseness is much like Rudin's in that you'll often find yourself asking, \\"How did this step work?\\", and you'll have to get out some paper and work it out, but that only enhances one's understanding of it.

The novel has a subtle, constant, building intensity such that it stayed in my head when I was away from it, and I actively anticipated resuming it as soon as possible. When I started it I thought it might be a sort of repackaged Sister Carrie, but it's not. Jennie Gerhardt is a distinctive novel, and just adds confirmation of the obvious--Dreiser can plot a big story and develop complex, emotionally affecting characters as well as anyone.

Kind of a Cinderella story, but where the Prince doesn't marry Cinderella. This was of course shocking stuff for a 1911 novel. And, because it describes how \\"proper\\" people thought in that bygone era, it makes us understand clearly why it was so shocking. Dreiser also does some philosophizing here and there in the book, stepping back and decrying the injustice of society, or inserting some general paragraphs regarding his thoughts on how puzzling life truly is. It is a compassionate, honorable, worthy book with a ponderous, thorough style to it, following the lives of the key characters through to the bitter end.

That is why passion is almost sad.&quot;&quot;So this little household drifted along quietly and dreamily indeed, but always with the undercurrent of feeling which ran so still because it was so deep.&quot;I admit to you, I have never been very interested by the sometimes dry prose offered in the writing of earlier time periods. But Dreiser seems to me a rare gem in the world of early 20th century fiction.However, the one reason I am writing a 4 star review is because of the ending of this novel. After several mini-climaxes, the book ends. --just like that. With a grim display of &quot;if only&quot;. And although most, if not all of us, identify with that theme, I felt like I MUST have read 366 pages for something other than that.However, I would still recommend it. It is a delicate work of art whose power and beauty cannot be denied."},{"Title":"Jennie Gerhardt (The Laurel Dreiser)","review":"It seems each time I finish one of Dresier's works I think it is my favorite. Such is the case with Jennie Gerhardt, at least until my next Dresier. This heart-wrenching saga takes the reader through Jennie's life from cleaning houses with her mother, bearing a child by a US Senator and living and loving a man beyond her society class. Lester (the man she loves after the Senator), for his part, is unwilling to marry Jennie and is cut-off from the family and it's millions for loving someone &quot;below&quot; his class in society. Jennie remains true to herself, following her heart and the dicates of a harsh scoiety. She makes amendes with her father and is the only child to nurture him through his final days and death. She takes her daughter away from Chicago and leaves Lester so he can reclaim his family fortune. Her daughter dies, leaving her alone but the strength of Jennie's character comes through when she adopts orphans, for if she isn't nurturing she isn't living. Dreiser drives home his theme of fate and how some can dictate it while others are a slave to it. But even this distinction isn't black and white. Lester seems not to care what fate has in store for him until he takes it into his onw hands and marries the society girl he arguably should have married before he hooked up with Jennie. Alas, Jennie never mastered her fate. She was punished for loving two men from the upper-crust of scoiety instead of taking the crusts that high-living classes would toss her."},{"Title":"Jennie Gerhardt (The Laurel Dreiser)","review":"This was the first novel I ever read by Theodore Dreiser. The reason why I selected it was because in the film, American Splendor, Harvey Pekar mentions the novel and he's shown finishing it in the film. I wanted to know and feel what Mr. Pekar felt. And I believe I did. The tragedy of Jennie Gerhardt's life resonated with me. I was anguished over Jenny's loneliness and the fact that Lester could never make up his mind to marry her. I cried. Dreiser's observation of turn of the century high society and their view of the poor as pariahs still seems relevant today. We still live in a time of social and financial inequality.Dreiser's writing style is definitely not modern. And his phrasing is not structured in the active voice. It's more long-winded. You need to enjoy his descriptions and his philosophical speculations that do make the novel more meaningful. You can't take the social critic out of Dreiser. If you can make time in your life to sit down and read this novel, you will come away having been moved by Dreiser's heartfelt portrayal of the human condition. May each and everyone one of you be as lucky to love as deeply as Jennie did."},{"Title":"Jennie Gerhardt (The Laurel Dreiser)","review":"This edition of Dreiser's JENNIE GERHARDT attempts to \\"correct\\" the text that appeared in 1911 when the book was first published. Back then the editors at Harper's agreed to publish the novel only if they could make substantial changes to the text, softening Dreiser's criticisms of organized religion and the rich, and diluting the \\"immoral\\" behavior of the main character. Dreiser reportedly didn't like the changes, fought to get some of them re-instated, but eventually had to yield since no other publisher would touch the book. Using preserved typescripts, this edition is closer to the one Dreiser submitted before cuts were made.Jennie Gerhardt has an out-of-wedlock child by Senator Brander, which she is able to keep secret from the wealthy socialite Lester Kane, whom she takes up with. He finds out about the child, however, and is unaffected by the news. He continues to live with her in a complicated arrangement, until Jennie finds out that Lester's father will basically disinherit him if he doesn't stop living with her and forces him to leave (echoes of WASHINGTON SQUARE by James and the subsequent movie version THE HEIRESS here). He marries Letty Gerald, a woman from his own social class, but is miserable. When he becomes ill and is alone, he summons Jennie and declares his true love for her.The novel is an interesting one. Lester is a pessimistic, cynical, atheistic man while Jennie is much simpler and has a mystical belief in the goodness of life. The \\"battleground\\" on which these opposing beliefs are fought over is made fascinating by Dreiser. Also Lester's struggle with his own wealthy class system, which he is never comfortable with and rebels against, is handled admirably and honestly by the author (it became a major theme in fiction by WW I). This was Dreiser's second novel after SISTER CARRIE; it's not as good as that first book, but it's a solid work of fiction nonetheless."},{"Title":"Jennie Gerhardt (The Laurel Dreiser)","review":"As usual, Dreiser's writing style just amazes me. Just like SISTER CARRIE, this book is about a woman searching for a place in life. You can't but help feel her pain of how her first love dies, only to find out she's pregnant, and she's not even married! Then concealing this child from her next lover, who she lives on. Just like always, a grand and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Jennie Gerhardt (The Laurel Dreiser)","review":"Most of us know the genius of Dreiser, the lyrical capabilities of this author is astonishing. He humanizes literature, the characters posess complex personalities and physical appearances. He takes the aesthetic beauty of the surreal and the honesty of harsh reality and combines these potent elements into a story of life, almost more believable than our own. This story follows Jennie Gerhardt, a young German girl living with her poor family in Ohio before the turn of the century. Honest but hard work puts her into the path of Senator Brander a benevolent mature man, but his ardent passions soon destroy Jennie, and her life is tainted with shame. She leaves her home, and life take her on many journeys, mostly unpleasant. This story chronicles how one mistake can change your life, and the domino effect takes place, constantly misplacing your life as you try to escape the past. I would also recommend &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; by Thomas Hardy"},{"Title":"Jennie Gerhardt (The Laurel Dreiser)","review":"Next to American Tragedy, I think this is TD's best. Not overly drawn out or sappy, the narrative of the story moves well. Infact much of the time I was reading it, I felt a tension, knowing full well what would happen to Jennie, but somehow hoping things would work out better for her. They don't, and TD brings us to this point by getting us into the characters' heads in a way where we can sympathize with all of them."},{"Title":"Jennie Gerhardt (The Laurel Dreiser)","review":"Early 20th century American realism provides an emotional glimpse into the life of an exceptionally ordinary woman and the true loves of her life in late 19th century Chicago."},{"Title":"Jennie Gerhardt (The Laurel Dreiser)","review":"I became so well acquainted with the characters and involved in their lives that I did not want to finish reading this novel.

Chapter 1 includes &quot;What research is&quot; and &quot;What research is not&quot; - a good start! Other chapters look at the tools of research, how to choose a problem, reviewing related literature, statistical techniques for looking at data and so on. A particularly useful section looks at common reasons for project bids to be rejected (Ch 6). There's plenty of good advice throughout the book.I found the computer prompts less useful. They covered things like email, newsgroups and the internet which I already use extensively. However, for a student just starting out they would be useful pointers.Since the book is not specific to any level or subject of research there are bound to be parts that are not relevant to the individual reader.

He evokes the GDR and its cumbersome terror lightly but powerfully in his account of a young woman enamored of her married lover, and her fate after they conceive a child.Hamilton's themes--in his other two German-based novels, in his Coyne thrillers, and in his autobiographical &quot;The Speckled People&quot; emerge here in their most concentrated fictional essence.The wish for comfort amidst desolation, and affection in a landscape of oppression, find expression truthfully and eloquently. Hunt down this book and read it slowly. Pass it on."},{"Title":"The reconstruction of religious thought in Islam","review":"This is a good and innovative book that will be of interest to most modern day educated muslims who are fed up with the dogmatic outlook of their religion. Non-muslims will not find it interesting because it is primarily written by a muslim for his fellow muslims. The main messages of the book are the following. First, this universe is dynamic and so is God. He is the Creator and is constantly busy in creation. Second, God has given man complete freedom of choice and man is not restricted by his destiny. Third, muslims have made a big mistake by discontinuing the evolution of Islamic law and by confining themselves to four major (Sunni) schools of law. Since the world is constantly changing, we need constant evolution of Islamic law to keep pace with the world. Modern democracy can go a long way in achieving this goal and the concept of 'caliphate' can be replaced by the concept of 'republic'. Fourth, mystic religious experience is not only possible but is the only way to find the Ultimate Reality.At times the author is lost in philosophical jargon and makes a simple point look very complicated. Most of the big talk in the book is based on mere theory (or whim). Nonetheless, the book offers some food for thought and courageously challenges the status quo. No wonder then that according to Wikipedia this book is banned in Saudi Arabia."},{"Title":"The reconstruction of religious thought in Islam","review":"Get any other edition at all of Iqbal's critically important work. This 2009 production from the ridiculously named \\"Dodo Press\\" suffers from terrible textual problems presumably resulting from 1) translation of one electronic text format to another and 2) no proofreading! For example, on the bottom of page 2, Qur'an is rendered \\"Qur'n\\" --presumably the source text had a diacritic character for the long a, but the text has been corrupted. Qur'n continues, page after page, and the problem gets worse as longer names of people, titles of books, and quoted passages come in from Arabic, Persian, and Urdu."},{"Title":"The reconstruction of religious thought in Islam","review":"Mohammed Iqbal was a brillant philosopher as well as famous poet. In this book, he lays out a strong case that religious thought in Islam has been in stagnation for some 500 years, and this does a disservice to the real and dynamic meaning to the Quran. Iqbal was writing at a time when he was trying to both (a) inspire fellow Muslims in India, circa 1930s) to rise to the occasion to defend their religious and political rights as an independent India was going to emerge, and (b) to promote pan-Islamic conscientiousness and cooperation- a type of League of Nations. While the text of the book is complex, he presents fascinating arguments and backs his assertions with numerous references and interpretations of the Quran as well as from noted Islamic and western scholars. Iqbal argues that the Quran offers Muslims an opportunity for a journey in person growth and spirituality which is unique and evolutionary, and yet unites the faithful in a deep spiritual communion with God. Although a demanding reading trek, the effort to study, rather than just try to read, this book, all said done, is very worthwhile."},{"Title":"The reconstruction of religious thought in Islam","review":"If you want to understand the Quran, its spirit, and it dimensions and want to know it at the highest possible level, you need not go any further than this. \\"The reconstruction of religious thought in Islam\\" is years ahead of its time, and after a few hundred years the world or humanity at large will be at a mental plain to understand it in it's totality, because it leads you to the glory and capacity of Islam not as a religion but as a social order, that is why the first sentence in the book claims, and i qoute \\"the Qur'an is a book which emphasizes 'deed' rather than 'idea'\\""},{"Title":"The reconstruction of religious thought in Islam","review":"This is the greatest book that I have read on Islamic philosophy. It reflects the depth of the authors deep insight into metaphysics. One might not agree with all what Iqbal has to say but one things for sure he difinitely teaches you how a modern muslim should think.

This is a captivating spy novel that features many characters but focuses on Felix Maldonado who is a low level Mexican bureaucrat. Maldonado is portrayed as a sort of everyman who suddenly finds himself thrust into bigger than life circumstances. On a day when the president of Mexico is making an appearance Maldonado, who was looking forward to the day suddenly finds himself being involved unvoluntarily into an assassination plot. He is declared dead and given a new identity, a sly bit of writting to create another faceless citizen of Mexico. From here the novel takes off into twists and turns to unravel the mystery and Maldonados and others role in the assassination attempt. The introduction of a diverse cast of characters with intriguing backgrounds adds to the mystery. The secret agents,the seductive women, the Mexican politicians and Maldonado's love for three different Jewish women all intertwine to create a story of infidelities and political Arab-Mexican intrigue. Fuentes is his usual self, posturing political convictions via his characters to create a a rich story that has multiple meanings beyond the spy story. The masquerade and unveiling of characters is brilliant. This is another in a long line of superb novels by Carlos Fuentes. The information written over twenty five years ago is as relevenat as the headlines coming out of the Middle East today. The tension of the Middle East and the seemingly hopeless better future clash in this novel like the current political situation. Catch this novel for a good spy mystery ride through the Third World."},{"Title":"THE HYDRA HEAD","review":"Hydra Head is a mystery story, an immersion into a corrupt political world, and an exploration of different kinds of attraction between man and woman. Surprisingly, Fuentes in the latter part of the book ties up all the loose ends of the complex mstery. However, neither the characters, nor their motivation as it relates to the Mexican oil reserves, are realistic. The characters probably are not meant to be entirely realistic, Fuentes is more interested in their impact on the reader, and I was OK with most of them, Felix's spymaster/friend being an exception. Still, I wish the strategic interest in the exact amount and location of the oil reserves made more sense; e.g. reserves do not help alleviate shorter term oil shortages, unless they are in a place like Saudi Arabia where production can be ramped up quickly. The motives for the attack on the President made less sense to me than would a simple desire for more power. Despite that, \\"Hydra Head\\" is an interesting, powerful novel."},{"Title":"Info-Preneuring: How to Make Millions in Your Information Business","review":"All i can say is the entire process from the ordering to the receiving of the product was amazing.

They are naturally attracted to the photos. In this book, each page has a large photograph of the 2 children you see on the cover--playing together, not playing together, upset with each other, etc. The pictures are worth a thousand words, and both my kids understand exactly what's happening and can relate to the feelings of the children in the book. Leave it to Mr. Rogers to teach without talking down to children. There's no plot or story line. It's a very simple book describing how friends play together, and how friends sometimes upset each other, and what they can do when a friend has made them sad or mad.

Just when Lilith is ready to take matters into her own hands, her dream lover moves in next door. Mitch (who has no recollection of his past life as Sebastian) is an investigative reporter with 2 kids. He does not believe in fortune-telling, magic or in Lilith.I liked the 2 main characters here very much. Mitch was a strong man who loves and protects his children. You have to admire that in a man. Lilith is lonely (who wouldn't be after 600 years) and longs for a family. She creates potions to music and gets herself into some interesting situations.

The heroine is a refreshing change of pace--not fabulously rich, not putting herself through school, not a single mom, etc.There are no holes in the plot, and the writing's solid, but the author does call for us to accept some implausibilities. (Gen spends 11 years in Hawaii and is still the way she is?) The ride is so much fun though, filled with good sex, Jack's amusing but sweet struggle with his insecurities, and Gen's presumably nonauthentic but hilarious and charming \\"hillbilly\\" idioms. The subplot is more serious and calm and less goofy.I noticed some complaints about southern stereotyping. Gen isn't supposed to be a generic southerner--she's from a grindingly poor and very rural place that happens to be in Tennessee, probably so Elvis's underwear could be tossed in the plotline. Also, some of Gen's acts stem from her being Gen, not Gen being a \\"hillbilly.\\" Anyhow, the \\"hillbilly-ness\\" is presumably exaggerated in this book for laughs and drama."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I don't like rating books with a 1 rating but it was a close decision with this one. This book was a waste of money and time and I only hope I can be convinced to read more VLT's books since this was my first.I hated all the euphemisms and how she made the female characters into such hicks. My family is originally from the south and even back in those days they didn't act or talk like these two women.I didn't like Gen or Jackson but did like the mother and Matt. One thing that bothered me about Annabelle though, was that she was 41 yrs. old but had thoughts like she was 80."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"...that's what Nerd In Shining Armor reads like. Both the primary love story, between Genevieve and Jack(son), and the subplot romance, between Genevieve's mom Annabelle and the recently divorced Matt Murphy, seem to be given nearly equal amounts of word time and, sad to say, I found myself liking the subplot far more than the primary. It just came out as a bit more mature than the erotic fantasy disguised as romance that is supposed to be the main selling point (Nerd winds up on supposedly deserted island with Hot Chick). One point that did not sit well with me was the rather unromantic way Genevieve and Jack get together. Having a woman offer the guy to 'practice' sex with her is something better suited for an adult movie than it is a romance novel. Do guys really want to fall in love with someone like that and raise a family with them? I don't think so and I hope others share my opinion. Come to think of it, Matt also gets some pity nooky tossed his way, from a waitress named Celeste, early in the book. Nerd in Shining Armor doesn't hold a very romantic opinion of man, or woman for that matter, now does it?"},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but they were dashed within the first few paragraphs of this book. This book was just too unbelievable. From the sordid past of a girl from The Hollows in Tennessee to the stuck on a desert island with the computer programmer who turns out to be hot, the storyline was a bit too much. I admit that I did some skipping of pages here and there in order to get to the end to see what happened. I just had to know. :)"},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Very good attempt for a first time romance writer. I fell in love with Jack ... although Gen bothered me at times. I love the fact that all women think they're going to be the ones to change a womanizing jerk. And why, WHY?, do women feel the need to try and sleep with their boss. Other than that it was very sweet. A lot of southern terms that I don't even think are actually used. They detracted from the book a bit because there were just so many of them, but other that, a very fun read."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Before you read this book you will want to know this is not your normal contemporary romance book. The whole \\"stranded on a island\\" was way to off the wall and then there is the way the author tries to be funny but just wasnt. I did not even laugh once and this was supposed to be a funny book. That being said I still did enjoy this book. It was not great but it was a worthwhile read. The silly way Gen the heroine talks in this novel was a little on the irritating side and I did skim through those parts but I found her a sweet character, and Jackson was portrayed as such a sweetheart. I felt him being so sweet and caring and having a great bod made him more attractive in this book that I never thought of him as nerdy.Everything about the book is so farfetched that it might irritate other readers but I did find it nice for a change. I did have one complaint in this book and that is the (sex). I was dissapointed that she led up nicely to it and then she fell flat, and after that nothing.

I gave this book two stars because some of it took me by surprise, but not much."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I enjoyed this book. I found it in a bin at the Salvation Army and thought I'd give it a shot. It didn't suck, and while I have gone on to read other books in the Nerd Series, Nerd In Shining Armor was nowhere near as good as I had hoped.I liked that the two main characters were stranded on an island, and Jackson was a well developed and likable hero. That being said, I never really liked Genevive and I hated the descriptions of her upbringing in Tennessee. It is obvious the author has never BEEN to Tennessee, and unless Genevive's family wasn't paying their electric bill, the great state of TN has had electricity for quite some time now, and when is the last time anyone has ever used the word \\"revenuer\\"?That is my largest complaint about the book; the author obviously didn't take the time to research and relied on stereotypes to describe Gen's background. Thompson's descriptions of the south were so over the top they actually pulled me out of the story."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I loved this book. It is a great romance written with a lot of humor. The female love intrest, Gen is a former hillbillie from Tennesee who can't quite forget her roots. The male love intrest, Jack is a computer nerd who becomes surprisingly attractive as he realizes that he in not as socially inept as he thinks. His confidence boost comes as he and Gen find themselves marooned on a deserted island off the coast of Hawaii. I like the fact that the main characters are so real. Some of the situations are a bit far fetched such as the character of their &quot;evil&quot; boss who was responsible for their being marooned but I think that this adds to the charm of this funny light-hearted romance. The side plot of Gen's hillbillie mom who leads the search for her and finds romance herself is just an added bonus. I would recomend this book to all romance readers and look forward to Vicki Lewis Thompson's next novel."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"A NERD IN SHINING ARMOR by Vicki Lewis ThompsonVicki Lewis Thompson writes a charming story of A NERD IN SHINING ARMOR. Poor Jackson has been in love with his fellow co-worker Genevieve for a long time. Unfortunately, he's a geeky computer nerd and she's one hot babe. She would never notice him in a lifetime, because he is simply not in her league.But good fortune comes his way. He is asked to go along on a business trip to the island of Maui with the big boss, Nick, along with Gen, who happens to be Nick's secretary. This would be an over night trip, as they all live and work on the island of Oahu and Jackson is to attend a meeting with a client while Nick and Gen tend to \\"business\\".Gen has been dreaming about Nick for ages. She knows about his famous reputation for \\"love \`em and leave \`em\\" on his frequent business trips. However, she feels that because of his deprived childhood, he is deeply misunderstood and is not really the cad everyone thinks he is. He's every woman's fantasy, and she is determined to marry him.Getting invited on this business trip has put her in seventh heaven, and she prepares for what could be the most exciting weekend of her life. (If she only knew!) Her mother warns her, however, that this may not be a good trip at all. Her instincts tell her to stay home. But Gen is determined to go and fulfill her fantasies. Unfortunately, she finds out that geeky Jackson is coming along, and she hopes that his usual tardiness will make him miss the plane ride over to Maui.What neither Jackson nor Gen knows is that Nick is up to no good. He's plotting to embezzle millions of dollars from the company and that this is his get-away scheme. Gen and Jackson are definitely not part of his plans.What happens next is an adventure they will never forget, as Jackson and Gen miraculously survive the plane crash and team up to find a way off the deserted island that they're stuck on. They also discover something else - EACH OTHER!A cute romance with a lot of humor, A NERD IN SHINING ARMOR is not the perfect book. There were a lot of extraneous paragraphs all over the place, and at one point it got to be rather irritating. Overall, I would like to give this book a 3.5 rating, but as Amazon only allows us to rate in full increments, I give this book a 4. I don't know if I would read any other book by Ms Thompson, but this book was a fun beach read and is recommended as such."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Pretty predictable, even from the title...but still good beach reading.

However, sometimes the author places this extreme emphasis on the fact that the guy is a nerd. We get it. Sometimes as she places said emphasis, she has the heroine acting as those \\"nerds\\" are of another species. What would a nerd do? I have to think like a nerd. This calls for nerd logic.

But I have to admit, I really liked it! Sure it was hokey at times. It's mind candy. It's not meant to be great literature. That's why Kelly Ripa picked it last year. I had so much fun reading it. I actually even laughed out loud (To quote Gen &quot;so hard I almost gave myself hiccups&quot;).The Hollow is satirical. Personally I think it's silly for someone to be offended by it. That's like a college student being offended by Animal House! It's a good fun read. That's what it's meant to be. I definitely agree with the reviewer from Florida."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I bought this book in hopes of a guilty pleasure.

(Mine, however, is an economist.) Unlike those who read it in mere days or hours, it took me 5 months, and for several reasons. First, I felt dumber after having read it, so it made sense to spread it out over a period of time. Secondly, there is utterly NO depth or complexity to the plot, so the chance of forgetting something important in the meantime was impossible. Most significantly, it bored me to death. It was predictable, the hillbillyness was contrived, the emotional range of the characters was about as wide as a twig. And throwing in a moralistic message of &quot;remember your roots&quot; amounted to a weak attempt at avoiding yet another flat, hopelessly dull character by giving her some psychological depth. The attempt failed.Granted, I have a bias against the sprouting genre of &quot;chic lit&quot; that assumes female readers want something as substance-less as &quot;women's magazines.&quot; Frankly, I find it insulting. But (sigh)if you want something mindless to cleanse your mental palate (of course, this may result in a lowered IQ, but the process has its merits - kind of like watching cartoons), then this book ought to do it. And there's a decent sex scene to boot. But don't expect Bridget Jones here (a heroine who transcends possible labels of &quot;chic lit&quot;). There is no wit, no depth, and absolutely NO surprises.Then again, it represents a lot of the fiction being produced and (why god why?) published."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"&quot;A Nerd In Shining Armor&quot; had all the makings to be a truly wonderful read, but sadly....it failed.

I have to say this is one of the worst books I've ever read. It reminded me of a porn movie:all sex, no story and it was completely predictable. Gen is the literary Barbie who has it all going for her except the man who's going to give her everything. Jack is a nerd in disguise who would go to the ends of the earth to give it to her. They're stuck on a deserted island together but neither of them plan to have sex. Why, b/c there are no condoms. Then miraculously Gen's suitcase is retreived and guess what's inside. That's right, you guessed and from there on you can predict the entire storyline. The references about the South weren't really an issue for me. I have always lived in the South and these references are extreme exaggerations. No one I know has ever used the words hollow, crick or vittles. We live in the Bible belt and everyone's father has a gun rack in their truck, but by God we're not afraid to lose our virginity at 13 for a free movie. I kept waiting for Gen to explain how she was biologically related to the young man she lost her virginity to, but I guess that part was edited. I can't say that I was offended, after all this is a work of fiction. Don't waste your money.

I couldn't stand the heroine. As much as I tried to, I can't like a young woman who is out for sex with any man who shows up. She lost her virginity when she was 15 to a kid who promised he'd take her to the movie. She plans to have sex with her boss who she knows takes a different secretary to his weekend meeting to have sex with her--the idea that she plans to marry him doesn't excuse her. It makes her sound even dumber.

I haven't read any of the other books in Kelly's \\"Reading with Ripa\\" book club but I figured that I should start with this one. Boy am I sorry I did. This book was SO AWFUL! Everything plot/ character development was forced, predictable and so completely unbelievable. There was no thrill at all. The characters were horribly written- C'mon! Are we really supposed to believe that she thought she was going to marry the smarmy Nick when she knows he has flings with all the secretaries in her office? Genevieve says she only sleeps with men who she thinks she will marry but she was ready to give herself to Jack when they crash landed even though she states she would never think of being in a relationship with him. Both the characters and the story are flimsy and this isn't worth wasting anytime reading.The quote on the cover by a \\"critic\\" reads:\\"...Stranded on a Dessert Island?

The first few chapters didn't seem all that promising, but things did pick up once Jackson and Gen got situated on the island. I never did warm up to Gen's character, but Jack made up for her tiresome personality. All in all, it was a good read - sort of reminded me of the movie 6 DAYS AND 7 NIGHTS.

Perhaps the book would have improved if she were to become SHARK BAIT!The only redeeming character was the nerd, although he was a little too wimpy for my taste.The synopsis had fantastic potential - but a hard lesson was learned: You cannot judge a book by its cover!THE AUTHOR DROPPED THE BALL!I'll be honest.

It was juvenile, almost painfully so, and the characters were complete idiots.

The heroine is at times condescending and unlikeable, and as another reviewer mentioned, the hero was too good for her.

Vicki Lewis Thompson captures human stereotypes with characters having a quick wit, a humanness about them, and absurd situations. Good comedy comes from exaggerations and this book uses that technique to hook us in from the first chapter.Genevieve Terrence is the perfect employee and a good daughter. She tracks her companies' invoices and has caught the eye of one of the companies' partners, Nick Brogan. Nick is notorious for taking a secretary on a business trip (for a nights worth of fun). When Nick asks Genevieve to go with him to Maui, she thinks that this is a good idea. Her mother, Annabelle, is worried about her little girl. She thinks Genevieve's idea about getting Nick to settle down is hogwash but then again, she didn't make the best choices either. Annabelle let two fast-talking handsome men seduce her. Each seduction led to a baby, Genevieve and her fourteen-year-old brother, Lincoln.Genevieve loves the sacrifices that her mother for herself and Lincoln. Annabelle received an unusual family inheritance and was able to move her kids away from the backwoods of Hollow, Tennessee. She thought Hawaii was pretty far and since her family won't fly, they wouldn't be coming for visits. Genevieve still lives at home and helps her mom out with her brother. The family has tried hard to integrate into the Hawaiian culture. This includes not talking with twangs or country phrases.The only problem with her seduction plan that Genevieve can see is a co-worker coming along. Jackson Farley has had a crush on Genevieve since the first day he started working in the company. He has been intimidated with her cool composure. It doesn't help that he has a minor medical condition that makes him appear goofy at times. Luckily, it's nothing serious and can be compensated for by a good tracking system. Jackson is glad that he will be on the trip to help \\"Gen\\" as she gets over her impending heartbreak.The trip turns into a huge adventure for the whole family. Nick is not really going to Maui and Gen and Jackson are thrust into a life and death situation. As we know from the movie \\"Speed\\" with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, intense situations makes for strong emotions. The same is true for Gen and Jackson. Jackson is transformed into \\"Jack\\" the assertive guy who is Gen's savior. Gen on the other hand reverts back to her twang and hillbilly ways. Annabelle and Lincoln hook up with Nick's partner (and Gen &amp; Jack's other boss), Matt Murphy. Matt rents a cruiser, while Lincoln channels his sister's presence; this quirky family captivates him.This is a story mostly about romance but with a dash of mystery to keep you on your toes."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Genevieve is after Nick Brogan she wants to sleep with him, her dream has come true she gets to go with Nick away to Maui on a business trip and she plans to sleep with him, Nick on the other hand has different plans for her but her, Jack Farley decided to tag along.

Hillbillies...hmmm...The hero was supposed to be a nerd, that I expected, but he was just plain dorky, feminine and weak. Not hero material. He whined and complained like a teenage boy at times and I wanted to strangle him, lol. Ther heroine was the true 'hero' of the story.Not that she was such a deep character herself. She patronized the hero to death and spoke to him as if she were above him. Frankly she irritated me to no end. They didn't belong together. It was far from the sexy stranded on a deserted island story I was expecting.I struggled through this one, or waded so to speak.In short, its about a nerd who gets stranded with his dream woman from work on an island in the South Pacific and finds out she is all the woman he ever dreamed she'd be and she finds out he is no nerd who works in the computer room at work, but a sexy and great guy she needs to catch.Fair warning, the book is taken halfway with her mother's romance and her boss's lives. Not much 'screen time' for the main characters.Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Vicki Lewis Thompson is not a newcomer to the romance genre, but her debut single title release, A NERD IN SHINING ARMOR, shines with a fresh, risky perspective that enthralled me. Her trademark humor and ultra-hot love scenes are the perfect foundation for this quirky, not-the-least-bit-average story.Genevieve Terrance thinks she has everything all figured out. A secretary at a software firm, Gen is convinced that her boss, Nick Brogan, is the man for her--sexy, sophisticated and charming. He's just the type of man Gen wants, particularly since she's worked pretty hard to shed her hillbilly upbringing. She's certain that once she gets him into bed, she'll be able to show him the true love he's been missing in his life.Too bad Nick has other plans...and too bad Gen can't see the nerd in shining armor that is her co-worker, Jackson Farley...until they're stranded together on an island and engaging in one hot affair.To contrast this incendiary storyline, Thompson introduces a secondary plot regarding Jackson's boss and Genevieve's mother. The sweet, emotional depth of this secondary story provides just the right balance to the hot and heavy goings-on between Jack and Gen. Add to the mix Gen's outrageous younger brother, her hilarious hillbilly past, and a tense suspense plot, and you've got a book that has everything a reader could want.I just ordered the novella collection, INVITATIONS TO SEDUCTION, that Thompson has out next month with Carly Phillips and Janelle Denison. Then I'll be going back to my keeper shelf to re-read a few of the outstanding books she's written to date (particularly Harlequin Blaze's NOTORIOUS and Temptation's LOVERBOY.)

Lots of very very bad plot holes/cop outs that I won't mention here since other reviewers have done so. I thought Nick showing up at the very same island was bad. The Pacific Ocean is pretty big y'know and a plane does travel pretty fast. But then they got home and he got free .. and came after them again. I felt like I was reading the same scenes again .. grab victim from behind, put your gun against their temple, repeat.And the heroine, Genevieve .. there is nothing to like. I hated the references to the Hollow, every couple of sentences. I'm not from the South and I found it degrading and stereotypical as well. She's escaped the Hollow for over 10 years now, for one .. but I guess it's debatable on what an impact that had. She's either completely dumb or totally naive. The first guy she slept with was when she was 13/15 and only because she wanted to watch a FREE MOVIE! That sets the tone for the rest of her life. She's going on this trip knowing what her boss Nick is going to be up to, but says that she can 'change' him .. once she sleeps with him for one night. She decided to jump Jack(son) on the island because she pities him for being a nerd, and wants to show him some moves.And I liked Jackson in the beginning, but Jack .. now that's a different story. In the beginning, there's a line where it explains why he loves/lusts for Gen .. something about her having something special below the surface. Could someone tell me what it ended up being? They just liked/lusted after each other for very superficial reasons, yuck ... she only likes him after she's seen him looking hunky, for one.Did not even bother with the subplot of the (other) boss and her mom .. and her bro Lincoln. There are other much better books out there, so don't waste your time or money on this."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"What a waste of time and energy. It took me forever to get through this book and I'm not ever finished with it. I don't think I'll ever finish it. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I can't believe I wasted money on this! Save your money people..... I recommend you get yourself a cup of latte instead!"},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I got this book solely because of the title. I started reading it and I thought it was kind of cute. The writing is pretty good, and overall the book flows well.My biggest problem is that the entire book has no guts - everything is a copout. Instead of making the hot girl fall for a true nerd, the &quot;nerd&quot; turns out to be just like in the movies, a total babe with his glasses and shirt off. Just like in the movies how the &quot;nerd&quot; girl wears glasses, a ponytail and overalls - the minute she lets her hair down she's hot. When in reality, she's hot with the glasses and ponytail! Complete copout on the writer's part. And the &quot;nerd,&quot; Jack, doesn't dress bad because he's a nerd, he dresses bad cause he is colorblind. Another copout. I would have preferred to see the sophiscated hot women fall for a true nerd. But maybe that's just me? :)The storyline is a little farfetched, but I don't mind too much. I think it's a little unbelievable that Nick and Gen/Jack end up on the same island (especially since he jumped out of the plane WAY before they crashlanded!), and that Nick escapes the hospital so easily. Anything for confrontation I guess! I thought the romance between Gen and Jack was really cute, especially the insecurities they had about each other. It was fun to read about their adventures on the island, especially their &quot;romance&quot; scenes.Overall, the book wasn't bad. I expected better, but I wasn't completely disappointed. :)"},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"When her family sold Elvis's boxes, they created a new life for themselves far from their Tennessee roots in Hawaii. Now Genevieve Terrence's carefully cultivated tones and polished exterior reveal little of her past until she suddenly abandoned by her betraying boss and left to go down in the plain with nerd Jackson \\"Jack\\" Farley. Fortunately, too many hours of late night gaming and simulations provide Jack with a useful skill and he manages to ditch the plane close enough to land for he and Genevieve to survive. Alone on a deserted island, Jackson and Genevieve hope to avoid their dangerous boss and await rescue.Of course, with a hero like Jack to save their lives in the plane, and then again to tow her to safety when her strength drains completely away, Genevieve suddenly looks at him with new eyes. Then again, a missing contact might have something to do with her second look too, but there's no denying hormone. Although they are alone in an island paradise where they are free to explore their erotic fantasies, they also lack food, shelter, and rescue. Worse, when they are rescued Jack may simply abandon Genevieve for the latest programming challenge.Author Vicki Lewis Thompson pens her first single title in NERD IN SHINING ARMOR, a rollicking read fans won't want to miss. With her characteristic flair, Thompson weaves humor, love and the unexpected in this exciting summer read. Nick is the perfect nerd hero with his computer compulsions and private work out area. Genevieve and her family add an unexpected eclectic flavor with psychic gifts and hair dye. While the hillbilly humor may weigh a bit heavy, the remarkably fun tale still satisfies. A deftly creative tale, NERD IN SHINING ARMOR comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"In Hawaii, secretary Genevieve Terrence takes a business trip with her womanizing boss Nick Brogan as the pilot.

Readers will admire the charming prime duet as they struggle to survive and fall in love. A delightfully eccentric support cast adds humor, mystical ingredients, and plenty of fun to the mix. Though the final suspense adds nothing but unnecessary pages, Vicki Lewis Thompson provides a winning tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Being a lover of funny and/or tongue-in-cheek stories, I was extremely excited when I first read the synopsis of this book. But in the end, it was a struggle for me to read all the way through. Although readers expect stereotyped characters in romance novels, these characters were, in a word, ridiculous. Genevieve's talk of the &quot;hollow&quot; and barefootin' around Tennessee was simply annoying and, as a Southerner, insulting. And why couldn't Jack have been your everyday nerdy, but sweet, guy, instead of a guy who wears purple pants and worships flight simulators? This book was too enamored of its schtick, when it could have told a very sweet and funny story if the characters were a bit more believable. I was also hoping for a little more witty banter/foreplay between Jack and Genevieve, but their immediate copulation upon arriving on the island ruined my romantic notions. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, but I was hoping for an engaging, humorous read. Instead, I ended up with characters I didn't want to root for and dialogue that tried way too hard to be funny."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Let me just say that this is one of the most funny books that i have ever read!

This book immediately caught my attention in the bookstore, it sounded funny, sexy, and very entertaining. Unfortunately this turned out to be the worst romance I have ever read. If I could have given it no stars I would have. All of the characters were extremely unlikable, especially the main character Genevieve. The \\"hillbilly speak\\" was ridiculous. The side story about Genevieve's mother took up way too much time, especially since it was so boring. The story just dragged on and on. Before reading \\"Nerd in Shining Armor\\" I had never stopped reading a book before I finished it, even if it was a bad book. Well, I can't say that anymore. Even before the first chapter had ended I had to force myself to continue reading, and then I couldn't even bring myself to finish the book. It was that horrible. Personally, I will never try another book by Vicki Lewis Thompson no matter how amazing the back cover may sound. Please save your money and buy any other book."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Genevieve Terrence has decided on her future husband--Nick Brogan. Nick has a few bad habits, like inviting secretaries to overnight meetings and seducing them, but she knows he had a tough childhood and is certain she can save him. Until Nick invites Genevieve on one of his trips and strands her on a desert island with no one but genius nerd Jackson (Jack) Farley to keep her company Together the two try to find some way to stay alive and Genevieve starts to think that Jack looks better than she's ever noticed before. Of course he still is a nerd and he's still the kind of guy who would get involved in a software project and forget his girlfriend's birthday, but that just means they don't have a future, not that they can't have a present.Author Vicki Lewis Thompson writes a funny and sexy story of cast-aways with six condoms and big ideas. The characters are way over the top--Genevieve's Tennessee hick-talk is not exactly believable, but then again, nothing in this story is meant to be believable--the story of Elvis's underwear should set any reader straight on that right away. Instead, Thompson delivers a pure fantasy of a self-dressed Cinderella, and a prince of a guy who desperately needs fashion advice but who looks completely wonderful in the nude.It may not be great literature, but NERD IN SHINING ARMOR is a charming reminder to look closely at the frogs you kiss--and to make sure that the nerd you reject isn't really a prince of a guy."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Thompson really wrote with a lot of insight for her readers.

I just could NOT put it down! I wanted to know what was going to happen next. I also liked how Vicki Lewis Thompson would go from one story in the book to the other and of course, always to leave you wanting to know what was going to happen with the previous!Absolutely a fun book for the summer! Especially after a trip to Maui,Hawaii this summer. Fortunately for me, mine was paradise!Just a point to make- as to those who said this book was tiresome or had no morals..just think of how tired you would be if you were Gen or Jack. Sometimes I think we get too judgemental about a FICTIONAL story/ characters in the book.Also, Gen learned NOT to be embarrassed of where she came from (she was the one from Tennessee, not Jack). She found that her past had helped her survive on the deserted island.I don't think ... would survive a few hours after crash landing a plane, let alone almost a full day."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I read it in 1 day could not put it down! Great love scenes, some humor and good storyline.Great summer read!"},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but after finishing it, I was left with a blah taste in my mouth. So many little mistakes and irritating gaffes soon added up to the feeling toward the end that I couldn't wait to finish the dumb book and start something a little less tacky.1) Both main characters are supposed to be nearsighted, and yet the heroine uses the nerd's glasses to start a fire. that only works with FARSIGHTED glasses.2) We are cheated out of the big rescue scene off the island, which should have been the climax of the book, what with the bad guy being tied up and the nerd emerging a hero and all. Big disappointment.3) The cover shows Gen in a purple dress, although in the book she is wearing a striped sun dress or a swim suit (or nothing!) while on the island. and the glasses weren't black rimmed but wire-rimmed.Everytime I looked at the cover this bothered me, how the illustrator couldn't even read the book closely enough to get these key points.4) The bad guy pretty much got away with stealing the money, robbing me of the fairy-tale ending I was hoping for regarding Gen's mother and her boss Matt. That whole story line fizzled out at the end, and we never do get to find out what happens...not even in the epilogue.5) The bad guy's accomplices get away with lying to Matt and Gen's mom and brother about anybody being on the island. And we never find out WHY they won't rescue them when they find out that Nick, the bad guy, isn't there to be picked up. I don't think they even get questioned or caught.6) Gen's brother Lincoln is a freak with red, white, and blue hair. We are supposed to like him because of this. The book never gets into Lincoln's head about why he chooses to look like this. Lincoln is supposed to have ESP, yet he is clueless about how everybody else in the book thinks he looks like an idiot.I could go on and on about the problems in this book, but suffice it to say that they are major, and interfere with the whole plot. I was rooting for the nerd, but after landing the plane in the water, the only qualities that are useful to him are muscles from working out and a huge sex drive. He turns from a nerd into a jerk."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I wanted to like Nerd in Shining Armor. I really did. After all, I'm a nerd, and its nice to see one of us get some time in the spotlight at least once and a while....But this book's humor fell flat and seemed forced at least to this reader, and I disliked the 'hillbilly' humor which I felt was quite corny, and at times embarrassing bad. The heroines says things like: \\"Tarnation Jackson, you're slower than a coon dog with a full belly!\\" I don't know... I really cringed. It just wasn't even remotely funny and seemed quite hard for me to believe that a modern heroine would speak like that.Also, I felt the writing especially at the beginning needed some improvement. The writer tells us things and doesn't SHOW us. Do we really need the silly tale about Elvis's underwear, and the whole Beverly Hillbilly thing about coming to Hawaii? Couldn't that have been edited out, in favor of dropping us into some form of juicy office scene illustrating the situation for the characters?What I DID feel the author did well was when she wrote things from the male perspective, in particular Jackson's point of view. These sections and insights into the hero's character were actually really good, and I wish were expanded in favor of dropping some scenes with the secondary romantic couple (a redundant romance involving her mother). Jackson needed more 'air time' and the secondary cast needed a little less.Overall, this author's brand of humor just did NOT appeal to me. I found myself skipping over parts to get to the end to find out what happened... This might appeal to people who can overlook modern people saying things like \\"Tarnation, moonshine, etc.\\" For me, it left me feeling let down."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Genevieve Terrence is really a hillbilly at heart. Her mother moved her and her brother to Hawaii to give them a better life than what they could have gotten in the hills and hollows of Tennessee. Genevieve and her mother have both tried hard to bury their roots. Genevieve works as a secretary for a software firm. She's heard all the rumors about her boss Nick and his \\"business trips\\" to Maui but she knows that if he ever takes her, she'll be the woman to settle him down. When Nick finally asks Genevieve to accompany him to Maui, she jumps at the chance.Jackson Farley is a genius at writing software, but he is a total social misfit. He's color blind so his clothes often don't match and he gets so wrapped up in writing his software that he forgets everything, and everyone, else. Jackson fell in love with Genevieve the moment he saw her. She's always been kind to him and they've developed a nice friendship. When Jackson is asked to accompany Genevieve and Nick on the trip to Maui, he thinks maybe he can protect Genevieve from Nick.During the flight, Nick proves to be a real jerk and ends up bailing out of the plane with the only parachute. This is a real problem because he's the pilot. Jackson end up putting all his hours playing with his computer flight simulator to use and crash lands the plane in water off the coast of a deserted island. Jack (a man that can crash land a plane safely should be called Jack instead of Jackson) and Genevieve swim to shore where they set about working to survive the night. Genevieve puts all the skills she learned growing up in Tennessee to use and does a lot towards saving them. Jack turns out to be a hunk under all his nerd clothes and to be very chivalrous. He is what a romantic hero should be.Ms. Thompson writes with a lot of humor. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I've read several of Vicki Lewis Thompson's books and I've enjoyed all of them, but I've never hated a book more than I hated this one.The heroine of the book (now 26) moved to Hawaii at the age of 15 from the backwoods of Tennessee. From the first page to the last page, there were continual references to her life in Tennessee--relatives that run around barefooted and making moonshine, no electricity, it being common place for girls to lose their virginity at the age of 12/13.I've never lived in TN, but I am from the south and VLT's depiction of southern people outraged me. It was stereotypical and extremely insulting. I can assure you that there are in fact people in the south who manage to hang on to their virginity beyond the ripe old age of 12, they do own shoes, and I've never known anyone who made moonshine or who didn't have electricity.In addition to the fact that I found the book insulting, I hated the heroine. She was superficial and just plain stupid. The last chapter of the book she finally grew a brain and was somewhat likable, but that's a long time for the reader to have to wait. The hero would have been likable if it weren't for the fact that I spent the entire book wondering what in the hell he wanted with this woman. He deserved better!Numerous times the actions of the characters were just ridiculous. One example: they were stranded on a deserted island with no water, no food, and no idea rather or not they were going to be rescued, but they did have a gun. When a boat showed up and the occupants of the book refused to take them to the mainland, they just allowed the boat to drive away and leave them there. Any person with half a brain would have used the gun and forced the people to take them to the mainland.Prior to reading this book VLT was an \`automatic buy' for me, but never again will this southern girl spend another dime on a VLT book. I gave the book a rating of one star, but only because I wasn't allowed to give it zero stars."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Vicki Lewis Thompson's Nerd in Shining Armor is sheer, unadulterated fun. Light and lighthearted, the novel is the perfect beach read. It's a great romance with a compelling plot that will keep you reading. No new ground is broker here, but, so what? The novel is still a lot of fun. The novel concerns Genevieve Terrence, a young secretary with a huge crush on her boss, Nick. Nick takes her and Jack Farley, one of the computer nerds at work, on an overnight business trip. The trip winds up being not all it should be and Jack and Gen wind up stranded on a remote desert island, and...well, what do you think happens?

Have fun."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Jackson \\"Jack\\" Farley has lusted over Genevive Terrence for months... actually since the first time he saw her at the company they both work. She's a secretary and he's a programer and lives immerse in his computer and his own virtual reality.Genevive is beautiful and sophisticated and is everything Jack wants. Unfurtunately for Jack, Genevive thinks that Nick (her boss) is the man of her dreams. So when Nick finally asks her to go with him to a \\"meeting trip\\" to Maui she is more than willing to go... with a good amount of condoms for a day! However, and too bad for Genevive and Nick's plans, Jack is also sent in this trip to fix a program for a company in Maui. Little did they knew that Nick had other plans of his own, so Jack and Genevive end up stranded in an island far from Maui. No one knows they are there. They have no food, water, but they DO have a very nice host (a shark that comes out everytime they hit the water). Soon Jack discovers that Genevive is not as sophisticated as he thought, but instead of being turned off by this new image of his goddess, he's even more attracted (talk about prince charming!) And Genevive discovers that this nerd is a knight in shining armor, more than willing to do anything it takes to keep her safe (God, I need one of this!).The story is well paced, funny, heart warming and very real. It is not \\"Oh my god! I'm in love\\" after 5 minutes of being in the island together. Their attraction grows and you can see, easily, why she falls in love with him, and why she fears this. But even if he didnt have enough self confidence to go after her before, after everything that happens between them in the island, he gains some self confidence and is willing to gain her and prove her that what they have is AT LEAST worth a shot.One of the things I really loved about the book, is that despite the fact that she's a hottie, she has brains and manners and even more, she's not fussy about things and is very nice to Jack even before they got stranded. In short she's as nice as they get. And Jack is not the typical alpha male (thank god for that), but he puts his foot down when he has to. He's too cute for his own good. He has brains, manners, chivalry, sweetness and firmness.... and a body to drool over!I really did enjoy this book and I highly recomend it.I just wish I could get a Jack for myself!!!!"},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I cannot believe I spent money on this book! It was HORRIBLE! I was expecting something funny and breezy. It was so bogged down in its own farce that it was more Penthouse Forum than romance. I have no idea how or why love was mentioned in this book.Genevieve believes she can get her sleazy womanizing boss, Nick, into bed (which isn't hard for anyone BUT Genevieve) and entice him into marriage. Problem is, the boss wants to kill her instead.Jackson, the color-blind computer nerd, tags along for the ride and is inadvertantly caught up in Nick's plot to crash the plane, kill Genevieve and fake his own death. So Jackson, geek-extraordinaire, miraculously lands the plane (based on flight simulator gaming experience, if you can believe that), hauls Genevieve to shore and saves her pink luggage from sharks.Wait...it gets worse! Genevieve figures she's got nothing better to do so she'll throw the poor schlub a lesson in carnal pleasures (and believe me, she's got a long background of experience). So she finds out that Mr. Geek isn't so bad in the sack. (Please note: his feet were getting 2nd degree burns during the act. Do you know any man who's going to ignore that?) So, they spend a few days (2?) enjoying themselves that way. Were they deserted on an island, or on vacation?Meanwhile, Genevieve's backwoods mom and psychic brother are leading Nick's partner to Genevieve through \\"feelings\\". Puh-lease!I don't know how some books get into print. This book was so unbelievable, so non-sensical, so far-fetched that every page brought a new groan."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Like a few other reviewers I too had great expectations for this book. I am not very experienced in the romance genre, so I felt this book would be a breath of fresh air. Well not so fresh as, stinky. This book was a huge let down. I will spare you all of a synopsis, since there is one just above. Instead I will talk about the characters and \\"plot\\". The characters were one dimensional and there were too many of them. I usually skipped the part with her mother and her half-wit brother. The hill-billie talk was more than I could take. I wonder if the author has ever even had a conversation with someone from the backwoods? I have ties to Oklahoma and Tennessee, and I have had my fare share of hearing silly backwoods sayings. But I have never heard any use of the word \\"tarnation\\".I was hoping for a description of the island they were staying on. I dredged through half of the book, nothing. I have been to Hawaii and the landscape is nothing to leave out!! I was utterly disappointed. It was very predictable. I could see alot of the things coming for miles, and the ending? PLEASE!I also love Kelly Ripa. I didn't know it was one of her chosen books until after I had started. In someway I have lost some respect for her. I actually could feel my intelligence seeping out the farther I got into the book. I read the book requirements for Kelly's book club and the books are to be an easy read with no heavy message, well she pegged this one right. It fits perfectly with those requirements.Given, I didn't read the book word for word. But I couldn't. The dialogue was stagnant, which i just skimmed through. And the action scenes were laughable and not believable."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I must admit I'm not much of a romance reader, but I can appreciate a nicely written \\"beach read\\". Unfortunately, I found nothing nice about this book.There's no real character development, and much of what is done doesn't paint a very empathetic picture.From the beginning we're supposed to be excited for Gen's big opportunity with the boss-man after just a few short pages. We know nothing about him except that he's good-looking, wealthy, and a womanizer. Not much to have you rooting for him / them.We'll skip over the implausibility of Nick taking 2 possible witnesses along on his D.B. Cooper adventure, the hocus-pocus of Annabelle & Lincoln's \\"psychic\\" powers, and the atrocious attempt to throw in a little \\"hillbilly-ese\\". (Honestly, those alone are reason enough to warn future readers to run away.)But, let's delve further into the book (not head first, way too shallow for that...)We have two central characters, Gen and Jack, neither of which is all that likeable.Gen is a sex-starved, superficial, egotistical, condescending, hillbilly whose years of shame over her roots are supposedly overcome in just a few short hours.Jackson / Jack is a hapless, love-struck puppy who puts up with Gen's bad behavior because he's so enamoured with her. For the life of me I couldn't figure out what he saw in her. We are to assume a nerd is smart - shouldn't he be smart enough to demand a woman treat him with respect?So, despite her poor opinion of him, Gen is pawing at Jack within mere hours of her stranding. But before she does, she must smugly assume that she is a master at lovemaking and the poor nerd must be wholly and completely inexperienced. Because really, who on this Earth would deign to be with a man who isn't fresh off the pages of GQ? Oh wait, now I remember: intelligent women who care more about being with a good man that treats them well than about being with the prettiest man around.I tried hard to like this book and I tried equally hard to put it down. But, unfortunately, once I start something I must finish it, so I was stuck with Gen and Jack and Nick and Annabelle and Matt and Lincoln till the bitter end. Curiously, the only characters I actually identified with were Matt and Lincoln, but they were mere afterthoughts.I understand this was the author's first attempt to move beyond Harlequin-type romances. Perhaps she was daunted by the empty pages at hand, perhaps she thought the extra pages would allow for multiple sub-plot development, perhaps she got side-tracked with all the various characters with their various gimmicks, perhaps she was struck by Grisham-itis and found she had 5 pages to wrap up a 300 page novel. Who knows? All is know is that it didn't work."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I loved the hero of this novel. He was great, sexy, funny, and much much more.

Jackson (Jack) has only \\"been\\" with two women, he is color blind so his clothes don't match, and it sounds like he has attention deficit disorder. I thought he was absolutely GREAT! He was sweet and brilliant and very real. This is a character so well rounded that I wanted to meet him.The sad part of this book is Gen who is a ninny. She wants to sleep with her boss, always a stupid idea, even though he has proven he is a womanizer she thinks she will be the one to change him. Aack! This is beyond dumb and since she is 26 years old she should know better by now. She is shallow in her treatment of Jack for half of the book. One of the main bits of character development is that when she is stressed she has a southern twang from the \\"hollow\\" in Tennessee where they didn't have electricity and were moonshiners. O-okay. This was completely unbelievable and her phrases and references were also unbelievable and stupid. Unfortunately, most of the book is from her perspective so there are tons of these hick phrases (I happen to know hicks and like hicks and they DON'T speak this way). This is grating to say the least.There is also a sub-plot involving her mother which I was bored and unimpressed with. She used many of the same unbelievable phrases as her daughter and she treated Matt, a good guy, pretty shabbily. Like mother, like daughter, only mom is WAY more stupid, but at least she knows it.I really wanted to like this book, but I cannot. It would have been only two stars except for Jack being such a great hero. I found myself skimming through much of this and I didn't feel as if I missed anything by doing so."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Generieve Terrence's scheme to jump in the sack with her GQ-hunk of a boss Nick Brogan when she accompanies him on a trip to Maui turns nightmarishly awry. The twist comes when Nick is an psychotic embezzler who concocts a plan to crash the plane along with geeky programmer Jack Farley and her secretary and parachute his way out. The full-length debut by Harlequin veteran Vicki Lewis Thompson is at once a heart-thumping revenge of the nerds which chucks stereotypes to the bin. It is boisterous fun and sass as readers soak themselves in the sunny chemistry between Jack and Gen and fan themselves under the heat of their sizzling passion. Jack charms with sincerity as the leading alpha-male who saves the day while Gen regains her former feisty self as a triumphant survivor in poverty-stricken Tennessee. And no less compelling is the secondary romance between Gen's mother Annabelle and Matt - the acting executive at Gen's company. Ms. Thompson's characters are immensely amicable, complete with tart parlance and wits to make this a riotous trip of love and fun."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I bought this book in paperback five years ago and enjoyed it immensely. When I saw it on kindle I just had to re-buy it, since my original copy had gotten lost some time ago. I read it through a second time, and even though I knew what was going to happen. The story line was just as fun, entertaining, and scintillating as it was the first time I read it."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"Yes! Nerds win out! Finally! Finally! I am a nerd and a geek, and I love it when they become the sexy hero of a story. From when I was a wee lass so many years ago (ok, not so many) I fell in love with Nerds. Don't get me wrong I love the jocks too, but when I get a jock that just happens to know his way around a computer, or one who knows his superhero...Bam! My knees are jello. It all started with a certain Mia Thermopolis falling for a certain Michael in The Princess Diaries. And then Vicki Lewis Thompson comes out with an entire series. I love it. And better yet I love Jackson. I love how the island brings out the manly in him. I love when he sits back and thinks \\"A man named Jack would do that\\" or \\"That's right take notice of my manly charisma,\\" Oh Jackson. You make me smile. Even when you are determined to be so manly that you end up dropping the girl you like when you are trying to bring her to safety. Gen and Jack are awesome. They are both considerate of each other, but Jen doesn't believe that Jack/Jackson will change. She believes that when they get rescued (oh yeah, they are marooned on an Island together...how Hot?) Jack will go back to being so wrapped up in his work that he will forget her. How friggin sad. I really enjoyed this book I was happy to see that Thompson focused less on the adult content and more on the story line. On top of it all there were actually two romances going on Gen and Jack, and Gen's mom and her boss Matt. Add in a slightly psychic brother and you have the story. Now, the double romance actually threw me off a little. I was really eager to get back to Gen and Jack sometimes but had to read through the other romance for quite some pages, not to mention not spending so much time on the romance of one set of characters took away from the development a little bit.Good:Gen: She sure knows how to motivate a man when she needs to, and her backwoods girl status helps get them out of many many jamsJack/Jackson: A Nerd who happens to think best when he is working out, so, logically, he works out... a lot. YEAH! He lands a plane and saves their lives, and he always seems to be there when Gen really needs him. I love this guy. Oh, and did I mention he was like six feet six or something? Sexy.Bad:I would have lost the romance between Gen's mom and her boss and focused on the development on Gen and Jack more. Although her mom did really deserve a good guy so I wasn't too upset about it.Overall (Writing style, story line, and general):Overall the writing was really well done. I was actually shocked because Thompson's novels usually focus on the adult-content but this time there was a real focus on the characters and their relationship's and character development. I found I appreciated this book more than some of her other novels. I think I will be reading the best of this series.View more of my review and others at my blog: [...]"},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I've been hearing little things about this book here and there, so when I saw it at Wal-Mart today, I grabbed it up. I thought that since it had been picked by one of the tv shows for its book read that Nerd might be a cut above the usual romance book.Alas, IMHO, no. It is a very usual romance book with cardboard characters and manipulated plots and unlikely dialogue, with a slightly clever twist---a nerd hero--- and a great title.

Jackson Farley finds himself the third wheel on a plane trip to Maui when his boss Nick Brogan takes one of the firm's secretaries, Genevieve Terrence, for a meeting and an overnight stay. At least, that's what the plan was. But apparently Nick had other ideas, and suddenly Jackson finds himself trying to land a plane in the ocean near a tiny island. Meanwhile, Genevieve's mother, Annabelle, is convinced something has gone wrong and enlists Nick's business partner Matt Murphy to search for her daughter by sea. Jackson manages to be Genevieve's Nerd in Shining Armour when they are wrecked on the island. Plenty of humour, some intrigue and quite a bit of hot sex. If it moved just a bit faster it would be perfect."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I was looking for something silly to read and ran across the 2nd book in this series, so I decided to give it a try. I won't say I was disappointed because it really was mostly what I was looking for, but I think the author tried too hard with the characters. I didn't find any of them all that likable. Even nerds have self-esteem, ya know. And Gen was... well, a bitch... with her \\"I'll teach you\\" stuff. There were some sex scenes, which I wasn't really expecting, but they weren't anything to write home about and felt a little out of place with the rest of the book. I think those could have been toned down or glazed over. I think the author is usually a romance writer that tried her hand at something different. Having said that, it held my interest enough that I'll give the 2nd book a read at some point this year."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I'm an occasional romance reader, and I enjoyed this cute, sometimes silly, romp. The dialog was a bit contrived at times, but I found myself liking Jack and Gen and cheering them on."},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I liked this. A lot. Nerd In Shining Armor was my first Nerd book and I thought it was a lot of fun. I'll be honest and confess that I barely read the parts with Genevieve's mother and Matt. I was too impatient to get back to Jack and Gen, and even after having read only half a book, I still loved it and was very satisfied.Even though I know Gen's accent and hillbilly ways was just a fluffy bit of schtik, I still enjoyed it. It just got funnier and funnier, though I'll admit, sometimes it was laid on a little thick. Jack was hilarious and I liked that despite how desperate he was for Gen, he wasn't a pushover. I also thought his cluelessness about the great outdoors was hysterical and the continued bit about the shark was really funny.The plot involving Nick wasn't very interesting, though I could have cared less. Once Jack and Genevieve were marooned on that island, I was enjoying every minute. The moment Gen spotted her suitcase and I remembered what was in them, I hooted and cheered. That nerd was finally going to get some!! The sex they had was really hot and the pirate and innocent maiden fantasy that both of them played out was also really amusing. After I read this book, I began eyeing all the nerds in my office and also started secretly measuring their thumbs....I highly recommend Nerd In Shining Armor as a funny read. It may not be great literature but it was a most enjoyable way to pass the time. Even though I didn't read the secondary plot with Genevieve's mom and Matt, I saw the handwriting on the wall with those two so I was happy for them. I just couldn't tear myself away from Jack and Gen long enough to indulge in their story. I'll admit that Gen's refusal to see their relationship surviving once they were rescued was very silly and marred my enjoyment of the book, but oh well. I loved it anyway. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Nerd in Shining Armor (The Nerd Series)","review":"I really loved this book!

The \\"Nerd in Shining Armor,\\" had me laughing aloud at its refreshingly different cast of characters and unusual dilemmas.The story was so unique. A family moves from Tennessee, where they were a step up from hillbillies, using the money they acquired from the sale of a pair of boxers once owned by Elvis Presley, and now are living in paradise but still not quite fitting in. Our heroine, Genevieve, tries to shed her past and become a cosmopolitan secretary who is thrilled when her Cary Grant look-alike boss asks her to fly to Maui for the weekend. Although he often takes the new office girls on such \\"business\\" trips, she thinks she's going to be different and seduce her boss with wedding bells in her future. Even the presence of the office computer nerd, Jackson, doesn't dampen her enthusiasm.It's not that she hates Jackson, it's that his hair is often un-kept, glasses smudged and although she's tried to give him fashion hints, he still looked like \\"her cousin Harley after a three-day toot, decked out in sweet potato-orange plaid shirt and pants the color of rotten eggplant.\\" It's colorful language like that that is generously scattered throughout her dialogue that had me hooting! She describes Jackson as a computer god, who needs a girlfriend if for no other reason than to pick out his clothing. I just love this author's wit! And, although her omniscient mother, Annabelle, fears that something terrible will happen if she flies, Gen throws caution to the wind and packs the only luggage she has, a memento of her flight from Tennessee, a hard-sided pink suitcase bought at the Salvation Army.When the boss turns mad man and jumps from the plane, the computer nerd, who's only flown on computer simulators, steps up for his first rescue and flies the plane to save our beauties' life! He manages a crash landing in the water. Jack, who has as big a crush on Gen as she had on her former boss, is endearing with the sweet way he encourages Gen to swim to the far off island. Although she comments that for \\"a nerd he swims like an Olympic athlete,\\" he promises not to leave her behind in the shark infested waters and that no harm will come to her. Can you imagine someone as hot looking as Jennifer Anniston with someone like Bill Gates on steroids? At this point, that's all I could imagine. When they finally reach the island with only the clothes on their back and a supply of guava fruit, it looks like their luck has run out.It's the little things that kept me smiling throughout the entire adventure, like Gen losing her contacts, but discovering Jack's glasses are the same prescription so they share the glasses. When her Salvation Army pink plastic suitcase washes ashore with survival supplies of a change of underwear, some \\"Power Bars\\" that Annabelle snuck in, an electric curling iron and what every couple needs when stranded on a secluded island, six condoms, you know the fun is only beginning.I've read many books that have two people crash land on deserted islands and have to survive on their wits, but never have I read one so comical. It's the Beverly Hillbillies meets Robinson Crusoe, when our sophisticated secretary reveals a suspicious southern drawl when stressed and survival skills from her days home in \\"the hallow\\", and our computer nerd looks great without clothes and really cleans up nicely in salt water, that is just the beginning of the sharp and sassy romance from long time author Vicki Lewis Thompson.You have to read this one! You won't be disappointed and it will make you wonder if that computer nerd down the hallway from you at work can really be your \\"Nerd in Shining Armor!\\" I can't wait for the next Nerd-like story from this clever author, \\"The Nerd Who Loved Me\\"."},{"Title":"Baldur's Gate : Tales of the Sword Coast Official Strategies & Secrets (Strategies and Secrets)","review":"If you own Baulders Gate already you know the style of the game: quests, dungeons, etc. Tales of The Sword Coast was designed to be a chalanging add on. Even people who had little trouble in the original game may have trouble with the expansion pack.TOSC is mainly about dungeon crawling; and that is where this book comes in handy. In some levels, there can about 50 traps. This strategy guide includes maps for each dungeon, and tells you exactly where each trap is, what it does, and percentage skill your thief needs to both detect and disarm each trap.

There are ideas for planning the storage ideas for closet space or shelving systems and instructions on how to make a laundry bag in a basket or a shower curtain pocket thing.

But in this edition, there is no chapter title on each page, so it's a little difficult to track the chapters."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (Norton Critical Edition)","review":"There is at least one author who may remind you of Stephen Leacock, namely Garrison Keillor of Lake Wobegon fame, but Leacock should be recognized as the ultimate master of quaint, bucolic humor. Leacock, who died in 1944, became arguably the most prominent Canadian humorist of his day (and probably of all time). What is ironic about that claim is that Leacock worked for most of his life as a professor of economics. We do not usually equate economics with humor, preferring to think of that profession as one of bow ties and supply and demand charts. Throw that presumption out the window and pick up a copy of \\"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town,\\" Leacock's best known work available through the New Canadian Library series.For me, one of the funniest sections of the book was the introduction written by Leacock, where he gives you some background about himself and his profession. This short piece of writing quickly gives you an idea of the type of humor you will find in the actual sketches: a very sly, very quiet and clever type of humor that often takes a while to sink in. Leacock does not rely on rim shot jokes or manic posturing in his writings. Instead, he creates the fictional Canadian town of Mariposa and populates it with small town archetypes that are wonders to behold.All of the characters are hilarious in their own way: Mr. Smith, the proprietor of the local hotel and bar, full of schemes to earn money while trying to get his liquor license back. Then there is Jefferson Thorpe, the barber involved in financial schemes that may put him on the level of the Morgans and the Rockefellers. The Reverend Mr. Drone presides over the local Church of England in Mariposa, a man who reads Greek as easy as can be but laments his lack of knowledge about logarithms and balancing the financial books of the church. Peter Pupkin, the teller at the local bank, has a secret he wants no one to know about, but which eventually comes out while he is courting the daughter of the town judge. All of these characters, and several others, interact throughout the sketches.Leacock has the ability to turn a story, to make it take a crazy, unexpected twist even when you are looking for such a maneuver. That he accomplishes this in stories that rarely run longer than twenty pages is certainly a sign of great talent. By the time you reach the end of the book, you know these people as though you lived in the town yourself, and you know what makes them tick.Despite all of the crazy antics in Mariposa, Leacock never lets the reader lose sight of the fact that these are basically good people living good lives. There seems to be a lot of feeling for the citizens of Mariposa on the part of Leacock, which comes to a head in the final sketch in the collection, \\"L'Envoi. The Train to Mariposa,\\" where he recounts traveling back to the town after being away for years, with all of the attendant emotions that brings as recognizable landmarks come into view and the traveler realizes that his little town is the same as when he left it years before.I suspect there is a historical importance to \\"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town.\\" These writings first appeared in 1912, a time when many people living in the bigger Canadian cities still remembered life in a small town. In addition to the humorous aspects of the book, the author includes many descriptive passages concerning the atmosphere and layout of Mariposa, something instantly recognizable to anyone who grew up in such a place. Nostalgia for the simpler life of the small town probably played a significant role in the book's success.I look forward to reading more Stephen Leacock. While much of the humor in the book is not belly laugh funny, it does provide one with a deep satisfaction of reading clever humor from an author who knows how to tickle the funny bone. You do not need to be Canadian to enjoy this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Perhaps the finest comment about Stephen Leacock in the last half century is that &quot;he is aWill Rogers for the 90's.&quot;Rogers, of course, is one of the most beloved of American humorists -- he was killed in1935 when his plane crashed near Point Barrow, Alaska. Leacock died on March 28, 1944.Like Rogers, he had been Canada's favorite humorist for decades.Sunshine Sketches is about Orillia, Ontario, Canada, where Leacock had his summer homeon Brewery Bay (he once wrote, &quot;I have known that name, the old Brewery Bay, to makepeople feel thirsty by correspondence as far away as Nevada.&quot;) His home is now maintainedas a historic site by the town of Orillia. I lived there for almost 30 years, and the people of Orillia are still much the same as Leacock portrayed them in 1912.These stories about various personalities in town were printed in the local newspaper in the1910 - 1912 era, before being compiled into this book which established Leacock's literaryfame. The people portrayed really lived, though some are composites; the events are of akindly humorist looking at the foibles of small town life. Once they came out in book formand soared to national popularity, everyone in town figured the rest of the country waslaughing at them because of Leacock's book and he was royally hated in Orillia to the endof his life.Gradually, and this took decades, Orillians came to recognize that genius had walkedamongst them for several decades. (It's hard to recognize genius when your own ego is soinflated.) Orillia now awards the annual &quot;Leacock Medal for Humor&quot; -- Canada's top literaryprize for the best book of humour for the preceding year.Leacock died when I was six, but I did know his son, who still lived in town. I deliveredpapers to the editor of the &quot;Newspacket,&quot; Leacock's name for the Orillia Packet and Times(where I worked) and the rival Newsletter. The Packet had the same editor in the 1940's aswhen Leacock wrote about him in 1910.But the book is more than Orillia; it is a wonderfully kind and humorous description of life inmany small towns. The American artist Norman Rockwell painted the same kinds of scenes;it is the type of idyllic urban life so many of us keep longing to find again in our hecticurban world.Leacock realized the book was universal in its description of small towns, and in the prefacehe wrote &quot;Mariposa is not a real town. On the contrary, it is about seventy or eighty ofthem. You may find them all the way from Lake Superior to the sea, with the same squarestreets and the same maple trees and the same churches and hotels, and everywhere thesunshine of the land of hope.&quot;True enough, which gives this book continuing appeal nearly a century after it was written.All great writing is about topics you know, and as a longtime resident Leacock knew Orilliawell. As for Leacock himself, he wrote, &quot;I was born at Swanmoor, Hants., England, on Dec.30, 1869. I am not aware that there was any particular conjunction of the planets at thetime, but should think it extremely likely.&quot;He says of his education, &quot;I survived until I took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in1903. The meaning of this degree is that the recipient of instruction is examined for the lasttime in his life, and is pronounced completely full. After this, no new ideas can be impartedto him.&quot;In reviewing Charles Dickens' works in 1934, Leacock wrote what could well be his ownepitaph: &quot;Transitory popularity is not proof of genius. But permanent popularity is.&quot; The facthis writings are still current illustrates the nature of his writing.In contrast to the sometimes sardonic humor of modern times, Sunshine Sketches reflectsLeacock's idea that &quot;the essence of humor is human kindness.&quot; Or, in the same vein, &quot;Humormay be defined as the kindly contemplation of the incongruities of life, and the artisticexpression thereof.&quot;Granted, this book is not what he recognized to have widespread appeal to modern readers.In his own words, &quot;There are only two subjects that appeal nowadays to the general public,murder and sex; and, for people of culture, sex-murder.&quot; Yet, anyone reading this willremember scenes from it for much longer than anything from a murder mystery.In today's world, where newspapers almost daily track Prime Minister Tony Blair's dash tothe political right, Leacock wrote, &quot;Socialism won't work except in Heaven where they don'tneed it and in Hell where they already have it.&quot;He described his own home as follows, &quot;I have a large country house -- a sort of farmwhich I carry on as a hobby . . . . Ten years ago the deficit on my farm was about ahundred dollars; but by well-designed capital expenditure and by greater attention todetails, I have got it into the thousands.&quot; Sounds familiar to today's farm policies ?It's what I mean by this being a timeless work.Leacock himself noted, when talking about good literature, &quot;Personally, I would sooner havewritten 'Alice in Wonderland' than the whole of the 'Encyclopedia Britannica'.&quot; This is his'Alice' and it well deserves to be favorably compared to Lewis Carroll's work.By all measures, it is still the finest Canadian book ever written."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (Norton Critical Edition)","review":"no hype. i couldn't stop laughing as i was reading this. and i mean laughing out loud. in a cafe. with everyone staring at me. but i didn't care. and i couldn't help it if i did. it's just too hilarious."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (Norton Critical Edition)","review":"This 1912 work uses sketches about the residents of a small Ontario lake town.

Sunshine Sketches easily exceeded such expectations. I was amazed with what skill Stephen Leacock could satirize the yokels & penny-ante frauds of his small, fictitious town, Mariposa - & yet, not generate a backlash, a reader's resentment that here was another cheap-shot artist (i.e., Jon Stewart of the Daily Show), shooting fish in a barrel.How could someone who had to make ends meet studying & teaching the principles of economics - a subject that will almost inevitably ruin any writer's creativity & wit - manage to write such wonderful comedy?A warning to those who haven't read SSLT yet - up until the chapter, \\"The Ministrations of The Rev. Mr. Drone,\\" it's smooth sailing - all low-key fun without the author touching upon the dark side of life's frustrations & tribulations.Rural Dean Drone of the \\"Church of England Church\\" then becomes the focus of the narrative, & it wasn't long before I was apprehensive that this was it - this suddenly gloomy, dour & pessimistic man's story has hijacked the book. \\"How long will this depressing drivel continue?!\\"Not for long. The detour was necessary in order to induce a sense of depression, so to speak, in order for the later renaissance of laughter to have a truer, better foundation. So if you start feeling as if you've unwillingly stumbled into F. Scott Fitzgerald's foreshadowing of eventual, gruesome tragedy, relax. Leacock knew what he was doing. All along."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (Norton Critical Edition)","review":"Leacock wrote in the introduction that Mariposa represented seventy or eighty different towns throughout Canada. The residents were composite characters of people he knew. Leacock did a great job of making the town seem alive. I wished I were there for the picnics, the cruises on the lake and the poker games. The plots of vignettes were good. The writing was too cute sometimes. His classical references were over my public school education at times. The characters were drawn fairly well. What the author did very well was the throw away descriptions of the characters. He would almost insult the characters he was describing in such endearing terms that I immediately felt drawn to the character.Leacock was amazing talent. The book wasn't deep, but it was a fun, enjoyable ride down memory lane."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (Norton Critical Edition)","review":"This is funnier when I think back on it than when I was actually reading it. Even thought it was written long ago, there are recognizable characters. And it is public domain so you have nothing to lose."},{"Title":"STATISTICAL SHAPE ANALYSIS","review":"This book provides a fairly enjoyable and detailed account on statistical analysis of shapes, particularly on landmark data and shape-related statistical distributions. Kendall's shape space is covered, as well as Bookstein's. Then a chapter on Procrustes methods which are important for defining translation-rotation invariant distances on landmark data sets. The chapter on statistical models for two-dimensional data should be very original for accounts of this area from two original researchers. Tangent Space Inference talks about comparing two sets of data and transformation between shapes. Shape in Images Discusses important applications in image analysis and is very useful for people who're interested in image analysis. Additional Topics talks about interesting problems in the horizon, such as distance-based methods, unlabeled points, landmark-free approaches. In all, I think this is a good introduction book on statistical shape analysis. It is interesting to compare it with D. Kendall, H. Le, et al's bookShape and Shape Theory (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)which is published a little later and covers more updated theoretical developments. While Kendall at al is written for mathematicians, Dryden and Mardia is clearly targeted to statisticians and professional workers. Another interesting book is the latest book by Grenander and MillerPattern Theory: From Representation to Inference (Oxford Studies in Modern European Culture)which talks about a very different, but much more modern and complicated mathematical framework for pattern theory."},{"Title":"STATISTICAL SHAPE ANALYSIS","review":"Statistical Shape AnalysisI think that is the best book about shape analysis because it is very clear. The main results and equations are given in the text. In addition to that, there are a lot of information about how to use the tools. The reader can use the Ian's R functions of the program shapes.R. The R functions can be used to run the majority of the methods of the book. If you do not know nothing about shape analysis, you should buy this book. If you know quite a lot about shape analysis, you also should buy it. You never will regret!"},{"Title":"STATISTICAL SHAPE ANALYSIS","review":"This book is not a good introductory text. The book mainly demonstrates the math behind the shape analysis and does not discuss the statistical programs used. A lot of technical language is used in the descriptions of certain techniques. However, the book is a must have for those that are interested in doing research in geometric morphometrics."},{"Title":"Nightwatch (Code Red (Harlequin))","review":"It hasn't taken me this long to finish a book since my age hit double digits, and all because watching paint dry would have been more interesting. The most exciting part of the whole book was the first chapter because there was a big storm and a busy night in the ER. Dr. Rachel Browne is on duty and delivers the baby of a young woman who wanders into the ER. The baby is tiny and has many health concerns, and the mother dies. She just happened to have been the estranged stepdaughter of ER chief Guy Giroux. Guy, who has been Rachel's boss for some time, goes to question her about his stepdaughter's death, and the two doctors are immediately attracted. We endure the requisite \\"we can't date I'm your boss\\" objection before the real issue lumbers in: Rachel is afraid to feel. Yup, that's a new one-not. And clumsily executed. There may be someone somewhere who cares about the angst suffered by two overworked doctors whose work always precluded their social lives until one day love drifted through the cracks, but I doubt it. The story limped along on the premise that our doctors were searching for the man responsible for the young woman's death, but all the truly interesting things were happening somewhere else, and our heroes found out about it later. Guy was too busy quitting his job so he could adopt his stepdaughter's unhealthy baby, and Rachel was too busy tiptoeing around her wittle feewings and trying to decide if dating Guy would be more fun than having no social life at all. Finally she got over it and took Guy up on his offer of a relationship so we could put this story to sleep, a condition it perpetually put me in. This is not the same Courage Bay where Jackie and Casey rescued a baby in a car accident and I couldn't put the book down, and I miss it."},{"Title":"Nightwatch (Code Red (Harlequin))","review":"I like this series as a whole. The nurse reactions of the main female character, were very well described. Makes me proud all over again to be an R.N. The interactions with the cop, both professionally and personally helped me to like them very much."},{"Title":"Britannica atlas","review":"Of particularly stunning value in the Ency Brit Atlas is the 'Index of Cities' at the back. Every city in the world (even many under 1,000 population) are described in terms of latitude and longitude (as well as population and page rendered). The lat long is of particular value in laying out navigational courses and in the use of simple point to point GPS...no international cards or upgrades needed. Be certain to ask if the particular EBA has the lat/long as part of the index. Once you get the right one, you'll never let it go."},{"Title":"Abandonment","review":"\\"Abandonment,\\" be Kate Atkinson, is a play that switches back and forth in time to tell two connected stories. The opening pages of the book note that the play was first performed at the Traverse Theater in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 2000; also noted is the fact that the author lives in Edinburgh.The play opens with Elizabeth, a contemporary woman who works as a historian and lives in a converted Victorian mansion. The people in her life include her sister Kitty, a reporter; her widowed mother Ina; her best friend Susie, a lesbian who wants to have a baby with her partner; and Callum, a New Age-y fellow who's doing work on the house. These characters deal with both their current relationships as well as with issues from the past that continue to haunt them. Their story alternates with that of a troubled family that occupied the house in the 19th century.I really didn't know what to expect when I started reading this play, but by the end I really loved it. It's a full-bodied blend of tragedy and comedy; the two stories are effectively linked. Although the story is at times a bit soap opera-ish, ultimately the play as a whole is quite moving and very satisfying.Some of the play's themes include romantic love, sex, societal pressure, sisterhood, infidelity, and women's desire for motherhood. The dialogue is strong, and the characters really came to life for me as I read the play. I think this would be a good book both for classes in contemporary drama and women's studies; I also recommend it for independent reading."},{"Title":"Abandonment","review":"Just a quick note -- not so much a review -- I purchased this because I'd been thinking of auditioning for a local production and wanted to have a copy of the script prior to the auditions. After reading the play, I found it to be a tad predictable, but definitely theater-worthy. I will be auditioning for the show next month. Thanks again for always over-delivering on time, breadth of content and value."},{"Title":"Emergency Spanish (Hippocrene Emergency Phrasebooks)","review":"This item is helpful but only if you have a need as stated--Emergency. For the price it is what you pay for but it was not what I needed.

Mohammed Ali, Sammy Davis,Jr., and Cecil Moore. Each man represented a different way of responding to the racism around him. Easy and straight-forward, Early's discussion of the"},{"Title":"Never in doubt: Critical essays on American books, 1972-1985","review":"Peter Prescott, winner of the George Polk Award for criticism and reviewer for Newsweek is never in doubt -- and never dull --about his opinions concerning contemporary books. Whether you agree with him or not, you will certainly enjoy this round- up of essays about books and authors.Prescott rides herd on classical writers as well as popular ones. He cracks his literary whip of laconic wit on a wide and unusual range of subjects and authors.Readers will never accuse this critic of unimaginative prose. He is articulate and wise, graceful and elegant, even irritating. However, his opinions are built on a solid foundation of literary knowledge and he cuts to the core when he perceives deficiencies in an author's reasoning.Don't look for run-of-the mill, running-off-at-the mouth, pseudo-intellectual posturing in these essays. It's not there. Look for style, intellect and humor. And delightful reading."},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"This was one of those books that you just wander across in the library...I'd never heard of him before. . . Atticus Kodiak is a very well-developed, well-rounded character and the plot (even if you don't agree with the politics) is attention getting. I've since read his two sequels and would highly recommend them. There needs to be some additonal development of the peripheral characters (which begins to take place in books 2 and 3) to make the whole world more exciting. Rucka's certainly an author to keep an eye out for!"},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"Enjoyed this novel quite a bit, the field of professional bodyguards hasn't been overworked like other detective fiction. I did find the ending annoying. Not to be specific, but this highly-efficient team of bodyguards who are more or less certain an attack is about to be made, simply overlook a threat from an obvious individual. Seemed highly unlikely. I hope future books aren't quite so melancholy, and I'd like to see the rest of Atticus's team fleshed out a bit. Well worth your time."},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"Thanks once again to AMAZON recommendations for pushing me to KEEPER. It is in the mystery/detective/thriller genre. Greg Rucka does a very nice job setting up this new character Atticus Kodiak, now there is a name to remember, and another series of books to read. KEEPER is book one of several Kodiak stories. Kodiak is a body guard, not a detective, but think of the book in that detective vain. The story is exciting and moves quickly and the characters are crisp and keep you interest. Bridgett Logan, a detective love interest, Natalie Trent, another bodyguard, Scott Fowler, a Federal agent not in a book to be hard to deal with, refreshing. Looking forward to FINDER, next in the series. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, in the genre."},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"An absolutely riveting tale from beginning to end. The book centers on a professional bodyguard who has been hired to protect a doctor who works at an abortion clinic. The doctor has been receiving serious death threats from an extremist organization.At first I was afraid I would be personally disturbed by the subject matter, but that concern faded as the book went on. Rucka has a knack for making you feel like you're in the center of the action, and the reader is just as surprised as the characters in the novel when things happen.It's been a long time since I read a book that was almost impossible for me to put down. I found myself trying to sneak in a few pages before going to work on some days. I plan to continue reading this series, definitely."},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"I am usually extremely picky about the fiction I read, as I am often disappointed by derivative works that just lack any kind of emotional bite.Not true here.I came across this series by chance and it looked interesting, so I purchased this, the first in the series. Two days later I finished it and immediately ordered the rest. This is great stuff! The characters are highly believable (and likeable). Mr. Rucka does not pander to petty preaching (as the plot revolves around a controversial issue), but rather paints a vivid and disturbing picture of the often brutal reality that surrounds his topic.This is one of my favorite books and I can't wait to read more from this author!"},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"At first I did not know what to think of this book. After reading a couple of chapters I realized that the characters are very believable. The author has created very human (complete with flaws and emotional hangups) characters that seem like your actually reading about a real person. After reading this one I've gone out and read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"You may have heard of Greg Rucka through comics. You may have read and enjoyed Detective Comics, Queen and Country, Whiteout, or Elecktra.It's time to put the comics away, and read his Atticus Kodiak series.These books are the best I've read in a long time. You hate and love the characters as if they were real people. Because he writes them as real people. Reading these books are almost like reading non-fiction. It has been years since I've been so engrossed with a series. I am dreading finishing the last one, because I know that will be it until he writes a new one.What are you waiting for? Order them.You'll thank me for it."},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"Well written book involving a controversial topic.

He's not a stiff moral guy like Spenser, but he's also not a killing machine like James Bond or Jack Reacher. He's a hard man, a genuine tough guy, but killing people bothers him, especially when it's not in self-defense, or out of anger. Keeper is a very good novel, and it presents a disturbing portrait of how strongly abortion is felt within out country. I really think it's a good book, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"It's not bad for a new writer's first book if his writing was through the help of a very good editor. But the hero, Atticus Kodiak, is somewhat stupid and not qualified enough for a security-protection team leader and/or boss. Nor his six feet height at 190 pounds, wearing glasses looked quite intimidating in the least even by the reader's viewpoint. If Katie was killed by the assassin across the street, her own home needed not to be dusted with toner stains all around; If Barry only stuck his hand out of Rubin's window and then shot by a sniper with supersonic high impact bullet, his body should be kicked back by the bullet into the room instead of falling out to the metal grate and then hit the landing; Bridgett and Atticus looked even more unprofessional when they contaminated the crime scene of Crowell's apartment.And most of all, none of the characters in this book was attractive enough; Bridgett and Atticus might even look a bit repulsive and disgusting to the readers. The whole story was kind of an"},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"Phenomenal for a first time novel writer!"},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"I did not enjoy this book, the story line, or the major characters because of the political heavyhandedness of the author. The major character of the book is an abortionist, whom the author portrays as a heroine. The author is obviously a liberal, and strongly pro-abortion, and felt the need to use this genre to advance his views on the subject. Regardless of your political views, I believe that most people would find the use of this genre to be inappropriate to advance those views.
