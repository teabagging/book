I have been haunted by the themes and images of this film ever since I first saw it over 15 years ago. The greatness of this true horror classic is wonderfully defended by Ms.Billson with a style that not only makes for easy reading but allows the film's fans to once again relive the heart pounding brilliance of Mr.Carpenter's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Thing (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"As a devoted fan of John Carpenter's The THING, I was thrilled to come across Anne Billson's definitive tome about Carpenter's greatest film. Here Ms. Billson eloquently defends what she deems a horror classic. Describing the film scene by scene and injecting a lot of personal theory, Anne Billson has lovingly penned a tribute to the best monster movie of the last 30 years. A must for any fan of John Carpenter and horror films. Only Paul M. Sammon's wonderful Future Noir comes close to equalling the excellence of Billson's book."},{"Title":"The Thing (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"Bilson is obviously a fan of the film. This isn't one of the more in-depth or scholarly analyses in the BFI series, but it does make a good companion piece to the film (and to the 1952 \\"The Thing From Another World\\" film version of the short story - \\"Who Goes There?\\" - that Carpenter's 1982 film is based on).In a nutshell, Bilson asserts that the film critics who panned the film upon its initial release completely missed the boat and the point. This film was original in so many underappreciated ways, and it remains to this day a standard-bearer.The author explores the idea that the titular Thing may as well be, for all intents and purpose, female. That, and that Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster were both very brave and correct to dodge conventional Hollywood wisdom by casting the film with all-male and mostly lesser-known actors, and that the timing of the making of the film thankfully preceeded the political-correctness period that now practically mandates a Rainbow Coalition of skin colors. Clearly, Carpenter was focused solely on the story, and kept all other interferences at bay.One of my favorite assertions that Bilson makes, and I am certainly in agreement with her, is that if the AFI list of Greatest Film Quotes of All Time allowed for profanity, \\"The Thing\\" would be well-represented!This isn't the most thought-provoking BFI entry, but it is affectionately written, for sure, without being kissy-kissy.I still love this book series, however. I always ask for a BFI book for my birthday. Next BFI books up for me: \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", \\"Crash\\", and \\"The Thin Red Line\\".Stay tuned."},{"Title":"The Thing (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"The BFI sometimes pick the wrong writer to cover certain films for their Film Classic series. Anne Billson is one of the better writers. She doesn't confuse the reader and covers the film from start to finish. The only draw back is that it does sometimes seem that she is just recounting the story, using her own words to add tension, but she does make up with some interesting commentary."},{"Title":"The Thing (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"This film really captures the horror of the story Who Goes There by John W. Campbell Jr. He was the editor of Astounding Science Fiction in the 40s when I was in High schol and I read him and the other great authors largely unknown to present day fans. The first attempt to put the story on celluloid called The Thing was a hugh disappointment to us Sci Fi buffs as it had little to do with the plot other than the location on the polar cap. I was relieved to see that the remake captured the overwhelming ominous dread of the printed word that was new to us in our teens. This same alien horror was again used in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, now going into it's third remake I am told.

They all have every feature you could possibly expect of a Luxury Hotel. These hotels offer a lot more than simply a place to put ones head down for the night.The book is of large format, profusely illustrated with color photographs and printed using a very high quality printing process on very good paper.

True, there are many historical points and notes which root the story in actual history, but these only help to show the richness of the history and help to express the story's fine details. I could not put this novel down, and I have gained a seemingly firsthand knowledge of the tragedies and glories of the crusades. I recommend this book to all interested in the crusades as well as those wanting to learn more of military camp life and history without the trials of textbooks."},{"Title":"A Booke of Days: A Journal of the Crusade","review":"This is based on excellent research, using primary documents from a participant of the Crusade that aimed to conquer the Holy Lands for the Christians. It describes the actual behavior of the crusaders, including the various knightly orders, such as the Johanniters, Templars, Teutonic Knights, and others. This is not a novel, but a first-hand account based on the diary of one of the knights, the Baron de Lunel from the Provence. Strangely enough, there is the word &quot;novel&quot; added to the cover. Inexplicably so! Why? The author took many years to translate from Old Provencial and had expert help in the process. But the book nowhere reads like an academic treaties. The diary is full of suspense and unfortunately (but historically quite correct) gore. This is a MUST read for anyone who wants to know the true nature of the Crusades and the actual behavior of the knights. Incidentally, the title of the book, A BOOK OF DAYS, reads about as insipidly and unpromisingly ! as it can possibly get. Where was the editor's mind when he/she chose that wording? I think Rivelle's effort and the book's merits deserve a far more attractive and alluring title."},{"Title":"A Booke of Days: A Journal of the Crusade","review":"Contrary to the beliefs of my fellow reviewer of Rivelle's A Booke of Days, this is not an actual journal translation. It is a work of historical fiction with a clever preface designed to set up the reader. It seems to have worked. Nevertheless, it is an excellent book, and it probably conveys more truth about the Crusades than any actual participant could have managed. It is a wonderful ironic-age version of the quest, decked out with beautiful parti-colored loose ends. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Booke of Days: A Journal of the Crusade","review":"the book is great!very good really!Ni!of course i had some doubts if the book was true..(eustace part) butanyway...i really thought it was true..this means just one thing...that his research and work are brilliant!Ni!(could also mean I'm a little idiot to believe in that..)its a very good story and i recomend anyone to read it!So be it!-Foge co, que te fazem baro!-Para onde, se me fazem Visconde?"},{"Title":"A Booke of Days: A Journal of the Crusade","review":"I'm reading this book now, i'm when Roger is crossing the Taurus to Jerusalem, and i make to myself the same question that, surely, makes a lot of people: Is this HI/story truth? or just a simple novell of a brilliant man like Stephen? cause, i been reading &quot;Cabayo de Troya&quot;, from J.J.

The integral tables are extensive and quite helpful; I agree that this is a must-have for physics majors. It's a pity this book is no longer in print, but it is still worth taking the trouble to buy a used copy.FYI, my professor recommended both theCRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulaeand Dwight's Tables of Integrals, but said that if we only bought one or the other then the CRC would be preferable.[UPDATE] Fast forward another four years or so, and I am still finding this little book extremely useful. It has most of the \\"main\\" integrals, and by that I mean the ones that don't evaluate to special functions like the Error Function or the Exponential Integral. Yes, you will need to know how to use u-substitution and exponential and trig identities to get the integral into a form that's in the book. But even the latest edition (7th) of the massive Table of Integrals, Series, and Products by Gradshteyn and Ryzhik requires you to do this, and then you must search through over 1000 pages of integrals to find the form that you need. There was only one time I faced an integral that could only be found in that thing; for most of the rest I was able to use the pocket-sized book by Dwight.If this book were still in print, I would not hesitate to recommend it. As it stands, it looks like prices for this book are about twice that of the CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae. Dwight's has the benefit of being a smaller size and easier to stuff in the backpack every day, but there really aren't any integrals in there that the CRC doesn't have. It's a tough call."},{"Title":"Hollywood Hex: An Illustrated History of Cursed Movies (Creation Cinema Collection)","review":"Hollywood Hex is fascinating reading and gives especially indepth analyses of events surrounding The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, and Twilight Zone\\" The Movie. The Exorcist chapters describe in detail all the strange deaths and other incidents which occurred during and after filming. Not to mention the unprecedented audience reaction which is now legend (fainting, vomiting, insanity, etc.) The only conclusion is that something is happening beyond coincidence, the question is is it a \\"curse\\" or is it the power of suggestion. This section also gives very insightful analysis into the film's theme and it's relation to the audience and human frailty. What's really troubling is the fact that in the end it's only a movie, but that fact is lost on so many in the audience, and unfortunately some in the cast and crew. Also of interest is the across the board condemnation of the film from Christians (you would think they would consider the film pro-Christian propaganda, but NOOOOO.)Rosemary's Baby also has it's own \\"hex\\". Obviously the relation to the Manson murders, but also some deaths of cast and crew, and of course John Lennon at the Dakota entrance (where the film was set).But the most disturbing chapter is Twilight Zone: The Movie which gives details of the negligence that killed Vic Morrow and 2 child actors. And all for a poor rip-off of a TV series.When you read this book, you'll know show biz is dangerous biz. Onset accidents, wacko members of the public who threaten actors (whether or not they play the bad guy roles), drug ODs, crime victims, suicide. Finally any movie that seems more than just a movie should be attributed to the talent of the cast and crew...any other conclusion is irrational."},{"Title":"Hollywood Hex: An Illustrated History of Cursed Movies (Creation Cinema Collection)","review":"A superficial treatment of the subject that appears to have been slapped together.

Intelligent, delightful, and quite simply, unsurpassable. Whether you like movies or just like to read, this book is recommended to everyone!"},{"Title":"Hollywood Hex: An Illustrated History of Cursed Movies (Creation Cinema Collection)","review":"Though this book will never be used in any film studies class, I would wager it will have a readership far beyond that of any film studies books.The reason for this is because, well, this book is fun.In an informative but not salacious way this book takes you inside the most scarey movies of recent Hollywood history to examine whether they were hexed.In this way, we journey inside Rosemary's Baby to see how this truly disturbing film effected people both on and off the set. Though the essayists connection of Rosemary's Baby with the Manson murders is tenuous, it was still creepy to consider the similarities of the plight of the mythical Rosemary with that of Sharon Tate (wife of Rosemary director Roman Polanski) whose pregnancy was tragically interrupted.Then we go inside the Exorcist, a film that like Rosemary's Baby had a disturbing effect both on its viewers and its cast and crew.Hollywood Hex really hits its stride with movies of the 80s where the running tragedy that was the story Poltergeist 1, 2 and 3 leads naturally into the even greater tragedy of the making of Twilight Zone. In Twilight Zone, production cost cutting and sloppiness litterally cost the lives of Vic Morrow and two Vietnamese children essentially for nothing.Though much of this book is fun reading, I would suggest that readers purchasing this book treat it as a grazing book. Go to the chapter(s) or subject(s) you find most interesting and then read on to the rest rather than reading them in the order they're actually presented.Oh...and one final note: though this book writes of gruesome happenings, the photos are very tame so it's one where you wouldn't need to leave it around for younger readers to see and be adversely effected by."},{"Title":"Clinical Problem Solving in Prosthodontics, 1e","review":"On first impression, this book seems a little lightweight. However having read the book, I discovered there was very good reason for this. Some books tend to over complicate and spend too much time on the simple issues, that should be considered basic knowledge. This book is simple and straight to the point. There is very little unnecessary material, whilst the rest is concise and easy to understand.It covers a wide range of subjects from Bleaching (of vital and non vital teeth), to partial denture design to crowns and bridges. One of the highlights of the book is the chapter on Failed Crown and Bridges, a subject not covered as well in other dental books. Individual chapters on Replacing Canines, and Upper Incisors were also useful.The text is well accompanied by a variety of illustrations, all relevant to what is being discussed. At the end of each chapter is a short and useful summary of the learning objectives.Overall I found the book to be an outstanding source of information, which was simple to understand and easy to find what you were looking for. I would strongly recommend this book for students as it is an excellent companion to your studies.Anand MistryLondon"},{"Title":"The Advanced Man: Finally Revealed, Secrets to Safely Achieving Natural Penis Enlargement, Having Multiple Male Orgasms and Guaranteed Ways to Make ...

Having said that, this book is a 'thought trigger' that will generate a lot of ideas and stimulate the reader to question their prejudices about IT and costs. I like to think of myself as an &quot;outside the box&quot; thinker, and this book stimulated that even more.I especially like the way this book presents cost of ownership from a more holistic view than the traditional IT view, presenting a way of understanding that impact on the business should be factored into the equation, all the while applying &quot;Occam's Raxor&quot;.I am hoping Drew's &quot;home boss&quot; (as he refers to in the book) keeps him writing and on track so that he will write his next book soon.

The authors devote an equal amount of pages on exteriors as well as interiors, and even have a chapter called \\"texture\\", which was fascinating.If you are looking for a traditional decorating book, this may not be for you, but if you love color, Mexican folk art and kitsch, you can't go wrong with any of the books by these Witynski and Carr."},{"Title":"Mexican Details","review":"I have just bought a house in Mexico, and find this book most inspirational for my remodelling work and for any future building!

The book is set in South Africa during a period that seems to span the end of the apartheid regime and focuses exclusively on the lives (and deaths) of poor South African Blacks in rural villages and urban shanty towns near what I suspect is Durban. Fans of Marquez will feel very much at home here in a world of \\"magical realism\\", yet while Mda may have been influenced by novels like 100 YEARS OF SOLITUDE he has a voice that is uniquely his own, and one that I sense is profoundly rooted in Africa. Mda's \\"hero\\" is a self-declared Professional Mourner, who ekes out an existence at the edge of society. Some aspects of his life are almost grotesque in form, and the deaths that surround him are often truly horrifying, yet somehow I found this a profoundly optimistic and human book. In spite of the worst that the world can throw at him the Professional Mourner is able to transcend mere existence & by the end I was shamelessly rooting for him. I should add that I used this book in a course on the Turn of the Century, and one of my toughest-case students, whom I had failed to excite with anything else, came into my office today saying \\"I just LOVE Mda\\" You will too,"},{"Title":"Ways of Dying: A Novel","review":"I am an avid reader of African literature, both fiction and non-fiction (especially memoirs). I am always searching for contemporary non-white writers (the white writers are good, but it is not unreasonable to want other perspectives), so I was happy to learn about Zakes Mda from a recent New York Times book review column, and I ordered his two books immediately.'Ways of Dying' is not about post-apartheid South Africa, though the blurb suggests that. I estimate it to be set in the late 1980s, shortly before the end of the old regime was drawing near.It's a short book, but it's well written, and paints a vivid picture of life in South Africa. And yes, the 'black perspective' is different, and very interesting, and most welcome."},{"Title":"Ways of Dying: A Novel","review":"I loved this book; and I cannot tell why. For me it was one of those disturbing reads that I could not put down. The imagery is pointed; the themes uniquely universal. I say uniquely because this story grows out of its setting, but is imaginable in Durban, Gaza, Burma, or Sarajevo (of the last century)."},{"Title":"Ways of Dying: A Novel","review":"Recently i had the pleasure of reading material from one of South Africa's most celebrated black authors, Zakes Mda. An Oxford University Press published book titled \\"Ways of Dying\\", this is a South African fiction selection. Being a fiction, it is wtitten in a very creative manner that i could hardly associate with any of the books i had read before.This is a story of love written with expectation of one's imagination to take over. The wording, grouping, style and context of this book make it so. It is mainly based on two characters and the way they live their lives. Toloki is a man consumed with the profession of mourning the dead whilst his love Noria has lost immensely through life, still has the ability to show Toloki how to live.There are various different characters in this novel, which make it as interesting. Even with their differences, they jell well together making the story line easily readable and understandably creative enough to follow. The vast lines go from Toloki who grew up as the ugliest boy in the village and people taking no note of him to the same character turning into a man who is widely respected for his chosen profession in the city outskirts where it was the only place he found recognition. In the village where he grew up Toloki had a friend who had the identity he wanted. Her name was Noria. Toloki hated and loved her with the same heart. Noria was everyone's favorite in the villafe; she had her mother's beauty and brought all the boys and towns' man attention and had the most amazing laugh that made all the village people happy whenever they heard it. When she was sad, everyone was too.The writing style used in this book is that which is very easy to follow. There are no bombastic (big) words used nor are there times where you could lose the story. Every word flows into a paragraph that combines to others that make this a brilliantly written story.One of the other things that make this an interesting read is the humor infused.This is a brilliant written book that everyone with a sense of adventure and imagination will enjoy."},{"Title":"Ways of Dying: A Novel","review":"Beautifully written. Story recalls memories of South Africa. Even though the most terrible things happen throughout the book the author makes it's tone light and somewhat ironical.The &quot;theme&quot; is death and ways that people die, thought the story is about two people from the same village, things that happened in their lives and how the meet again and go on from there.The optimism of the main character is painful yet not unrealistic.I enjoyed recognising the typical South Africna expressions and the atmospere."},{"Title":"Ways of Dying: A Novel","review":"I read this book many years ago. I think I just picked it up one day- cannot remember why- and it was surely a surprise. The opening page drew me in completely and immediately. After this, the story wrapped itself around me- as I was transported- Mda is a very poetic writer- and his pacing is perfect in this book. His characters are full and real- and human.It is at once heartbreaking and heartwarming.I also very much enjoyed the socio-cultural atmosphere Mda was able to evoke without being heavy handed. Moreover- I very much enjoyed that the city in which Toloki resides is not identified by name (fictional or otherwise) this had my extra senses on alert for more geographical information- and really involved me in the movement of the story.The dignity and positivity that exists at all in this book seems to come natural for Mda despite situations- and the use of magical realism in this book was also subtle and perfectly attuned to the development of the plot and characters.I later heard Mda Speak on two occasions- and wow. He is wittier and more intelligent than I even imagined.Apparently this was his first novel- having grown accustomed to writing plays. Well done.I was also impressed by the fact that Mda was able to evoke the feelings, auras, scents, and rythym of life in a SOuth Africa he had had to exile for a number of years.I have read two other Mda Books- each one different- but with some similar Mda-isms. I enjoyed these as well- but this one is still my favorite so far.It is interesting how this novel captures a slice of life in South Africa that spans two generations and sheds some light on a sort of cultural context that is enlightening.I saw the 'Sequel' on a bookshelf and was somewhat disappointed to see it- but I bought it anyway because I actually really love the character and the way Mda Writes- I have not yet read it- just the back:-)"},{"Title":"Ways of Dying: A Novel","review":"What a great, somewhat abstract, work of fiction. All that you need to know about the plot is that it follows a man that takes it upon himself to serve as a professional mourner. He cries at funerals for a living! Its a brilliant idea, as harrowing as it is hilarious. The cover explains the novel perfectly. Full of colorful personalities and satirical undertones. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Ways of Dying: A Novel","review":"This book is simply great, it was a lot more than i had expected...i recomend it very much to anyone who is looking for an intersting piece that explores what the end of of one of the darkest times in south africa"},{"Title":"Ways of Dying: A Novel","review":"Like all recent South African fiction I have read, this one is full of horrible violence. But it is a love story, and much more optimistic than Coetzee or Brink."},{"Title":"Ways of Dying: A Novel","review":"Don't know what to think about this novel. I was little afraid because few weeks ago I've read Mda's \\"The Wale Caller\\" which I really didn't like. However this is much better novel.The idea of professional mourner is quite original one, few surrealistic drops were quite interesting, background scene was .... Of course very cruel almost apocalyptic however I'm not sure how convincing was it. Indeed, there are few remarks about colour of the skin but there is no clear racist hatred while brutality is part of everyday life. Death as well with numerous ways of dying just like there are numerous ways of living.Brutality can bee seen on every corner is something that was not quite convincing for me. And not only brutality of the society towards the poor but brutality between them as well. Brutality between neighbors, brutality of parents toward their children, etc.Set the man in flame just because that's how you're joking, or put a tire on kid's neck, pour it with petrol and burned it or put the child into the chains, use it to beg the money and forgot to give him the food until he dies and dogs eat him was just a little to much to ask from the reader to believe.But all in all it's interesting novel about life during transitional years in South Africa where in spite of horrifying reality the characters are profoundly optimistic."},{"Title":"The Breast Cancer Survival Manual: A Step-By-Step Guide for the Woman With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer","review":"Dr. Link has written exactly what his title promises: a manual that will educate women on how to survive a diagnosis of breast cancer. He teaches us how to pick a team of specialists, how to make adjuvant therapy choices, management of side effects, diet. etc. Dr. Link is a practicing internist and oncologist, founder of the Breast Center in Long Beach, California, and also director of the Pacific Coast Breast Center in Torrance, California.The author treats women with breast cancer, rather than having survived the disease himself, so the \`Survival Manual' is a less personalized account than, say, \\"The Breast Cancer Companion\\" by Kathy Latour. It is written with one degree of separation, and teaches rather than consoles.For example, he writes, \\"I think it is helpful to understand the mechanism of hair loss with these drugs so you realize its true temporary quality,\\" rather than, \\"When our hair starts to fall out, it is yet another violation of our bodies and one that most women felt was much more visible and hard to conceal than the loss of a breast.\\" (quoted from \\"The Breast Cancer Companion\\" by Kathy Latour.)Dr. Link's writing style is very much exemplified by his introductory quotation: \\"Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood---Marie Curie.\\"This is a very direct, honest book that can help women with newly-diagnosed breast cancer, \\"understand their situation and develop a plan to optimize a cure.\\" It contains questions at the end of each chapter (called \`checkpoints') that women should ask themselves during each stage of diagnosis and treatment, e.g. \\"Who is in charge of my surveillance after the end of treatment?\\" at the end of the chapter entitled, \\"Fear of Recurrence.\\"There is a good list of further breast cancer resources at book's end, including an Internet site with Dr. Link's continuing updates to this manual (breastlinkcare)."},{"Title":"The Breast Cancer Survival Manual: A Step-By-Step Guide for the Woman With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer","review":"Some people may be daunted by the size and detail of Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, the current bible on breast cancer, and want instead a quick, clear, handy-dandy smaller guide to the issues. This may well be the book for them. John Link is an oncologist at the Memorial Care Breast Centers at Long Beach Memorial and there's a touch of boosterism for his clinic, but that's OK. I'm more bothered by the fact that he deals in authoritative pronouncements without a single reference to the underlying research. These things aside, there's a lot to like. A better explanation of your pathologist's report than I found in Love, an excellent chapter on Diet, Exercise, Herbs and Vitamins, and the only explanation I've encountered so far as to why chemo makes your hair fall out. A warning, which also applies to Love's book: those tumors depicted in the chapter on staging (p. 46) are not drawn to scale - they're tinier. But there is an earlier figure on p.23 that shows the true size of a &quot;1 centimeter&quot; tumor. Remember too, this book is for beginning breast cancer; it has relatively little to say about recurrences and metastases.Will appeal to: most patients and family supporters, either those with little patience for protracted reading, or those who just want to hear a second voice."},{"Title":"The Breast Cancer Survival Manual: A Step-By-Step Guide for the Woman With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer","review":"I bought this book recently after my girlfriend was diagnosed with breast cancer. THE BREAST CANCER SURVIVAL MANUAL is informative and easy to read. I feel empowered understanding the disease as well as the options my friend has with the up-to-date method of treatment.I highly recommend this book to anyone, including friends or family members of those who have just been diagnosed with breast cancer. It also should be the first book to read for anyone who wants to be informed about breast cancer and the current treatment."},{"Title":"The Breast Cancer Survival Manual: A Step-By-Step Guide for the Woman With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer","review":"A breast cancer diagnosis puts a woman's life into a free-fall. Dr. Link explains how to take charge of a situation over which you feel you have no control. He has offered a concise, up-to-date compilation of information necessary for a pro-active role in breast cancer treatment. He lets women know in understandable language that there are options available and helps sort throught the facts in order to make intelligent, informed decisions.I discovered Dr. Link's book AFTER I had been diagnosed and had already received a second opinion on my own. He helped me sort throught the maze of chemotherapy treatments, and gave me the confidence I needed to make the right choices for me. I was so impressed with his book that I have donated copies to our local hospital to be given to women at the time of initial diagnosis.If you are facing this nightmare of a journey, take this book with you..."},{"Title":"The Breast Cancer Survival Manual: A Step-By-Step Guide for the Woman With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer","review":"The information in this book gave me the knowledge to understand what was before me; my options, new procedures, and the long term outlook. It enabled me to question my doctors and understand what they were proposing. Specific info on new techniques (sentinel node biopsy) led me to question my doctor about it and ultimately seek it out for myself. Having read Susan Loves book ( which is also excellent) I would have to say that Dr. Links book is a better starting place for information and understanding. It is written in a manner and style that is easy to read, understand, and use as a catalyst in planning what to do after you get the diagnosis. Dr. Link also gives you the information necessary to understand the pathology/biopsy reports. In short, Dr. Link gives women the power to be in control and take charge of their treatment options."},{"Title":"The Breast Cancer Survival Manual: A Step-By-Step Guide for the Woman With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer","review":"This small book packs a lot of punch. No other books go into as much detail on how chemotherapy medicines work, or why medicines are combined the way they are. This book is meant to empower women through the tough decisions, and throughout the entire treatment cycle. Not much time is wasted on outdated statistics or information, and the book recognizes the limits of printed paper and recommends worthwhile websites.The chapters on side effects, menopause, and nutrition are especially cogent. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Breast Cancer Survival Manual: A Step-By-Step Guide for the Woman With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer","review":"I read this book the week before my biopsy and found it surprisingly reassuring. It is a comprehensive, easy-to-read overview of breast cancer and its treatments, covering everything you need to know as a newly-diagnosed breast cancer patient. It is a good first read for people who don't feel ready to go into the level of detail and complexity of Susan Love's book, but need to understand the cancer they are facing ASAP. The style is very practical, with checkpoints at the end of each chapter to help frame questions for your doctors. It quickly made me feel more in control so I could begin to think about next steps, as well as understand the lingo and the goal of different treatments."},{"Title":"The Breast Cancer Survival Manual: A Step-By-Step Guide for the Woman With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer","review":"After getting them for my mom, I highly recommend this book and his other one (\\"Take Charge of Your Breast Cancer\\"). There's quite a bit of overlap, but I wouldn't want to be without either one.I wish we had read this book before we rushed into surgery. It discusses some situations in which chemo is done BEFORE the surgery, with the advantage that you can see whether the chemo is working or not by how much the tumor shrinks. Often less radical surgery is then necessary. Too late now...Also recommended for many helpful tips and a warm tone (but it's about a year less up to date than this book): \\"Just Get Me Through This\\". A great overview and starting place before the books by Dr. Link."},{"Title":"The Breast Cancer Survival Manual: A Step-By-Step Guide for the Woman With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer","review":"When I was diagnosed, I knew this was the book I needed from these words in the opening paragraph of the inroduction: &quot;...we ask women to become immediately educated and make critical decisions ...at a time of immense crisis... [They]need a direct, informative, honest approach to the choices they are asked to make...&quot;With this book as an information guide, I was able to understand the options and protocol particular to my diagnosis. This is a must read for every newly diagnosed patient and those who support her."},{"Title":"The Breast Cancer Survival Manual: A Step-By-Step Guide for the Woman With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer","review":"As a personal trainer and post-rehabilitation specialist I have worked with many breast cancer patients. This book is an easy to understand, comprehensive compilation of information that patients and their families NEED to know. Particularly refreshing were the sections on seeking additional diagnosis opinions and participating fully in your treatment plans. Too often the patient is left out of the loop and ends of a &quot;victim&quot; of their treatment. The author explains what you should and shouldn't be included in, and why.I found this a quick and simple read. Perfect for the spouse, parents or children of the patient. I read it in an afternoon and then referred back to it as needed. I bought it for a client and am now recommending it to all my breast cancer clients.

The first advice it gives was a breath of fresh air in the middle of a maelstrom. It simply said \\"you have time.\\" It also gives great advice on second opinions. Besides this first advice the book is filled with general information written in easy to understand english. Some of the info applies some of it doesn't, everyones cancer is different. I greatly recomend this book to all those of us faced with this challenge. It provides you with the information doctors usually don't take the time to give you.

Dr. Link's approach is from a place of genuine respect and regard, and he knows exactly what survivors need to know right away. Reading this book really helped me make the best treatment decisions for myself, with the best information available.

If, like me, you have a shelf in your bookcase where you keep those few books you can read again and again for the sheer pleasure of their words and images, books that can inspire you to write more cleanly and clearly, I think you will conclude that Cold Oceans belongs on that shelf.

In the process, he casually dismissed his children, the woman he loved, and he endangered himself and others.

I do find the writing to be good, and the stories inherently interesting, but I am struck by the casual way in which the author avoids the reality of his life (two marriages, 3 children) and the reality of the dangers he faced (near death situations on several occaisions). The book reminds of Krakauer's Into the Wild, about the young man who went off unprepared into the winter of Alaska to find himself, only to die of starvation within a few miles of help. The author is indeed candid about his missteps and near misses, and about the unsolicited but essential assistance that is given to him by bemused observers with more knowledge and experience. The book also brings up the issue of freedom and responsibility. How much freedom can one person claim for himself after bringing 3 children into the world yet still indulge himself in the life of an explorer, without accumulating negative karma. Perhaps these issues are better addressed in the last third of the book. So far, it has the ring of 60' child who never grew up."},{"Title":"Cold Oceans: Adventures in Kayak, Rowboat, and Dogsled (Isis Large Print Nonfiction)","review":"Cold Oceans has a lot of potential but the author reveals too much of himself.

I highly recommend it as utterly spellbinding to its surprising conclusion. A teenage Polish jew, Martin Gray, and his family are among the first imprisoned in the the infamous Warsaw ghetto. As conditions deteriorate he creates a successful smuggling ring. When the Nazis begin shipping the ghetto jews to the Treblinka death camp Martin and his family hold out before being captured and shipped to Treblinka. Separated from his doomed mother and brothers, Martin becomes a camp worker, witnesses the horror, and escapes. In the surrounding villages Martin's attempts to warn Jews are rejected as unbelievable. He escapes multiple arrests, joins the partisans, but ultimately returns to the Warsaw ghetto when he learns of the uprising. There he finds that his father had escaped while being shipped to Treblinka and is now one of the leaders of the uprising. Martin becomes a fighter and arms smuggler until the end is near, his father is killed, and he escapes the ghetto. He joins the Russian Army, his language skills get him a position with the NKVD, and then an officer's rank, accompanying the assault units into Berlin. After the defeat of the Nazis, Martin ditches his uniform and escapes to the West as a displaced person. He makes his way to New York to live with his grandmother and make a new life. You would think that this was the end of Martin's tale but it is not. Obsessed with making a fortune and establishing a new family he begins by selling door-to-door before moving into other occupations, working his way up in a Catskill hotel to a management position, and then discovering an opportunity importing art and china from Europe. He successfully amasses a sufficient fortune to consider retiring at age 35. At this point he meets and marries a beautiful model named Dina. The tale continues but I will not reveal the conclusion other than to saying that it is equally astounding.The above summary is only superficial. There is simply too many events and incidents to describe: arrests, escapes, beatings, recoveries, betrayals, lovers, deceivers, samaritans. Most of the tale rings true if you consider the accuracy of the locations and major events described. What does not ring true is the sheer number of incidents allegedly experienced and survived by our author and his consistently heroic conduct through all. I think this is the reason some reviewers call his account fraudulent, without offering specifics. Nonetheless this is a highly fascinating and entertaining tale worth reading, if even with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"For Those I Loved","review":"This book is in my top 10 books i have ever read and i have read about 120 books in the past 12 years.

Alas, it is too real and too tragic to afford us any escape from the awful reality of the Holocaust. Martin was only thirteen when Warsaw fell to the Germans in 1939. He retells how he and his close-knit family survived almost to the end. Then there came the deportations and the death camps. Martin arrives in Treblika with his mother and a young woman he has recently befriended. He was one of the very few survivors of that camp, escaping with bearly his life. Such a tale is worth one book - but the story is far from over. Martin survives to fight the Germans and then emigrates to New York where he finds that the &quot;butchers&quot; of the world are not confined to Europe.

However the reader must be careful not to take his word too seriously. While obviously some parts are true (e.g. born in Poland, Mother died, etc) many other parts are pure fiction, as verified by established Holocaust historians. Also Mr Gray brushes over the more unsavory chapters of his life. His membership of the grotesquely evil NKVD is glossed over and not described in any detail (the reader will recall the NKVD were responsible for carrying out the Bolshevik genocide against up to 100 million East Europeans and was composed largely of Russian Jews). Also, Mr Grays mention of the, now known to be, fictional Treblinka Concentration Camp also detracts somewhat from the books veracity. Mr Gray also ran a shady antique furniture business for many years, resulting in him being charged for fraud.The book is an entertaining read but to call it non fiction is a long stretch of the imagination."},{"Title":"For Those I Loved","review":"Martin Gray could have written a novel based on the horrific events.

Once again, we find the &quot;most touching remembrances of the Holocaust&quot; to be fiction."},{"Title":"For Those I Loved","review":"Martin Gray (real name Martin Grayweski, according to the Parisian newspaper \\"Le Monde\\") had this novel ghost-written for him by French historian-journalist Max Gallo. In the novel, Gray claims to have been interned in a concentration camp, Treblinka.It is a very touching account. There is one small problem, though: as facts would have it, and by his own reported admission, Mr. Gray never set foot in this camp in his life. The account is to a large extent a figment of the ghost-writer's imagination, with entire chapters being no more than creative writing. English journalist (and steadfast exterminationist) Gitta Sereny unmasked this fraud in the \\"Sunday Times\\" many years ago, and accused Mr. Gallo personally. In the \\"New Statesman\\", on 2 Nov. 1979, she terrible long-term consequences\\".When the film based on this novel was about to be released, the French magazine \\"Le Figaro\\", in an article by Brigitte Friang (\\"Parlez, monsieur le Porte-parole\\", 9 Nov. 1983), and the newspaper \\"Le Monde\\", in an article by Jean-Marc Theolleyre (\\"A Novel and the Fog\\", 27-28 Nov. 1983) repeated the grave accusations which were made in the British press against him at the time of publication of the book.French author Serge Thion, in his account titled \\"Une allumette sur coolly that he \\"needed\\" a long chapter on Treblinka because the book required something strong for pulling in readers\\". She adds that after having told Martin Gray point-blank that he had never been in Treblinka, she double admission.Martin Gray and Max Gallo are neither the first nor the only ones to concoct a Treblinka out of their nightmares. This camp lends itself to the wildest of accounts because according to reports it was shut down, abandoned and destroyed quite some time before war's end [Treblinka opening date: there was nothing left to see.That Gray and Gallo might exploit this virgin territory to concoct profit-oriented nightmares is one thing, and it is strictly their own concern. That they should do so by cynically slandering the Ukrainian people, and planting a blood libel upon their heads as is done in this book, should be to the outrage of every moral and right-thinking person.This is a book written without even a most elementary sense of decency or shame, exploiting the aversion to brutality and sympathy for the underdog that is naturally possessed in abundance by all good people. It is commercially-motivated rubbish in every sense of the word; an example of the psychotic holocaustomaniacal hallucinations that increasingly litter our landscape nowadays"},{"Title":"For Those I Loved","review":"I read this book when I was in high school and it made me feel very sorry for the Jewish people. But now that I have grown some I have found that there is always more than one side to every story and the Holocaust is no exception. I read this article today about Wilkomirski's book &quot;Fragments&quot; in the Detroit News and I am very disappointed. I have this strange feeling that much of what I have read in the Holocaust genre is fiction written for sympathy or just propaganda. I'm not a &quot;holocaust denier&quot; or &quot;revisionist&quot; I am just someone who likes to hear both sides of a story before passing judgement. I'm interested now in finding a book written by someone who was on the other side of the fence during the Holocaust.This book had some lessons to be learned in it but not about the Holocaust or Nazism."},{"Title":"For Those I Loved","review":"As Blake Eskin reported in his book on Binjamin Wilkomirski/Bruno Doesseker,A Life in Pieces, Gray's book first appeared in France in 1971, where it sold 250,000 copies. It was then translated into 18 languages, becoming what Eskin called \\"an international sensation.\\"However, as Eskin reports, before the book was published in English, the London Sunday Times ran an investigative report questioning its veracity. Gray had apparently minted money after the war by making European period furniture and selling it overseas as antique. Readers inferred that he had also manufactured his tale about being in Treblinka.That seemed to jibe with the facts: Inmates of the death factory launched hundreds of escape attempts, but usually ended dead. From 1942 to September 1943, whenTreblinkawas finally shuttered, 870,000 Jewish people were murdered there.The final attempt was planned for August 2, 1943, when the remaining prisoners became convinced that the camp would soon be liquidated. They smuggled arms to their barracks from the armory. Upon their discovery, they began shooting SS men and set the buildings on fire. Of 750 prisoners who attempted the final escape, only 70 survived to liberation.But, as Eskin reported, none of the survivors contacted by the London Sunday Times remembered Gray. The elaborate train station he described seeing on his reputed September 1942 arrival at Treblinka was actually constructed several months afterwards. \\"It was impossible to see the things Gray said he saw in Treblinka in the autumn of 1942,\\" one Treblinka survivor told The Times.Although Gray threatened to sue the Times, reiterating his claim to have been in Treblinka, according to Eskin, he never actually filed a complaint. Subsequently, as Eskin reported, Warsaw uprising survivors interviewed by The New Statesman similarly questioned Gray's \\"recollections.\\"Gray's French publisher, Editions Robert Laffont, refused to research the allegations, and the U.S. and U.K. publishers also published their editions--and, later, in paperback, which was followed by a film. Only the German publisher halted the presses pending its own research results.Unfortunately, Holocaust deniers widely herald this book as \\"proof\\" that first-person Holocaust accounts can't be trusted. If false, the story's author did a major disservice to millions of Holocaust victims--and the tens of thousands of survivors whose testimonies were unquestionably true and valid.--Alyssa A.

It is one man's triumph over extreme tragedy and sorrow during the Holocaust and within the horrors of the Warsaw ghetto and Treblinka.

I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"For Those I Loved","review":"My words can not come close to explaining how you will feel after reading this book. I have read hundreds of eye-witness accounts of the holocaust, yet this book touched me more deeply than any other. Few survivors survived as this man, and few survived so much. During the terrible years of war most dealt with tremendous horrors. Yet this one man lived through nearly all the horrors I had read about, running from one to the other as he fought to remain alive for 'those he loved.' His story does not end with the end of the war. You will be stunned as you read of the miracles he accomplished, and the horrors he continued to be confronted with. After finishing this book I immediately leant it to all who would read it, even sending it home with a friend living in the Dominican Republic. For several years now I have continued to think about this book. Finally I can stand it no longer, I must search out and find it so that I may keep it in my library always.

After ten years of silence, it took again its feather of \\"bomb disposal expert\\". At 83 years, Martin Gray keeps the flame.I L survived the camp of Treblinka and the crushing of the ghetto of Warsaw. Its family was massacred. It entered as a winner to Berlin with the Red Army before leaving to make fortune in the United States. In France, a fire of forest later carried his wife and her four children. But the tragedies were not right of Martin Gray. Installed in Brussels close to the station of Uccle-Stall, the author D ' \\"In the name of all mine\\" radiates. At 83 years, this father of five children is not only a one guard of the memory: he continues to believe in a world righter.Why to have chosen to install you in Brussels?I arrived here there are approximately three years and half. Previously, I lived a long time in France, in the countryside. To spend the last years of my life, I was in the search of a place of culture, of a city. But Paris is too large for me. And then, my wife is Belgian... I like all here: culture, kitchen, people. These people who make the charm of Brussels. Sympas, smiling, in spite of time... Brussels is also a European city, where I can find friends of various nationalities. I am there at home. I also wrote there my last book, which is very significant for me.How did you come from there to the writing to express what you lived?I wrote twelve books in my life. I received prices, distinctions, I was translated in 25 languages, but I do not regard myself as a writer. I am initially a witness. I do not write, I shout. It is a duty. As if all those which you liked required you to speak. A manner of making them live again. When the words are not that words, when they come by far, of the tripe, they have an unsuspected capacity. By words, one sent million people to death. Me, the words saved me. The capacity of the words, it is also in the 800.000 letters which I have received for 30 years. It is thanks to my readers that I kept the desire.Why this ten years silence before the publication D ' \\"In the name of all the men\\" (1)?I said it, I am not a writer by profession. But I felt the need of it, without needing to be touched by a new tragedy. It was enough for me to hear \\"Dead with the Jews\\" or \\"Salts Arab\\". My daughter told me to have seen in a station a young attacked Jew, insulted, wounded. Knowing that, I cannot keep silent myself. I knew cruelty, it killed mine. But, attention, all can start again. And not only anti-semitism. Iraqis, Palestinians, all those which suffer are the Jews of today. My role is to alert. I am 83 years old. In 5 or 10 years, I will not be there any more. I cannot admit that the world does not learn anything of our experiments.You are defined as a bomb disposal expert...We are with a dangerous crossroads. Not only where the sister countries tear, but also with the doors of our cities where trail doped teenagers, desperate. In my last book, I include the history of Can and Abel. It is an interior combat. I returned to Berlin on April 27, the day of my anniversary, most beautiful of my life. I had the hatred of the German. I could have massacred, to become Can, but I remained a small Abel. Because I remembered the words of my father: \\"the life is crowned\\". Our children will live in a world righter, more human, I am convinced by it.Which place occupies the culture in your life?I am music lover. It is thanks to the music that I survived in the camps. When I was without hope, I repeated works of the large type-setters. That alleviated me.

We didn't read it, and it was only mentioned in passing. The theme of the course was autobiography & truth and we spent a great deal of time discussing what our expectations of authors were in terms of telling the truth.Martin Gray's book is particularly problematic because it is extremely inspiring. It tells the story of survival and heroism in the face of the Holocaust and sends a strong affirmative message about the ability of victims to take their destiny into their own hands. Very strong, and very moving.Unfortunately, it appears that there are troubling doubts about the accuracy of Gray's book. We know that he lived in the Warsaw Ghetto. We know that he lost his parents. That something terrible happened to him, nobody questions. However, some of his accounts of Treblinka appear to be impossible. He supposedly saw things at times that they did not yet exist. His role in N.K.V.D. is not mentioned. He also (more understandably) elides the fact that he took some serious \\"short cuts\\" (wording from the introduction) in setting up his antique business.The thing is that as you read the book, there is something very implausible about the feel of the text. He does so much, accomplishes so much, and without the ordinary pacing of ordinary life that seems normal even in the most heroic of men. It is clearly so important to Gray to show that there were Jewish heroes during the Holocaust that it seems possible that he would be willing to stretch the truth in order to make his point.We will never know how much of For Those I Loved is truth. And that, it seems to me, is too bad. The crazy folks over at the revisionist extreme right have seized on the inaccuracies in Gray's book, and use them to attack other unimpeachable memoirs and accounts of the Holocaust. No matter how noble his mission was in the beginning, it is time for somebody to set the record straight. I personally suspect that the truth would be found to outweigh the lies, but then I generally have high hopes for people. Gray's passion and the strength of his life speaks to his essential sincerity.For Those I Loved was ghost written by Max Gallo."},{"Title":"For Those I Loved","review":"This book is absolutely phenomenal in its detailed recollection of the Nazi atrocities both witnessed and experienced by Martin Gray.

But this book is about way more than that; it's unlike anything I've ever read before. Martin Gray was just 15 years old when the Nazis invaded his homeland, Poland, in 1939. What he tells us in this book is a very personal story of the hope, courage, and strength it took for him to persevere and survive. I've read the Amazon reviews posted here by several non-believers who accuse Martin Gray of being a fraud, and I find myself disgusted that they would attempt to discredit him this way with no significant evidence to support their claims.To be honest, I wasn't keen on reading a Holocaust memoir. I assumed the book would be filled with images of brutal and horrific crimes we all know the Nazis committed against their brothers, sisters and children. But I recently heard a radio interview with Martin Gray on NPR, and something about this interview compelled me to order this book and read his story. And what I read was so much more than yet another book about the basest forms of life committing atrocities against humanity. I read an inspiring story about hope, courage and love. My life was altered by reading this book. I wish I had read it twenty years ago so I might have learned earlier the things this book reveals: the true meaning of hope; what integrity and courage look like up close; how, with determination, we humans can accomplish almost anything.

They are obviously written by Holocaust deniers and individuals who will not accept the fact of the brutality and rabid hatred of many Eastern European's in assisting the Germans. Several years ago I read the book and had the honor to make the acquaintence of Martin Gray. I have been to his home several times to interview him. As a historian of the holocaust I fully researched his account and have talked at length with Martin about his many experiences. Not only are ALL his facts accurate but his personal ans unambiqious rendition can only lead one to the unmistakenable conclusion that he did personally suffer through those terrible times. His book is touching and horrifying and permits the readers to comprehend the vile and vicious treamtent of the Jews by the Poles, Ukraiains and Germans alike. These historical facts are well known.As for Martin's involvemnt in the &quot;KGB&quot;, he was never in the KGB as there was no KGB in WWII. It was called the NKVD. His work for them involved finding Nazis in hiding and collaborators in Eastern Europe. He left to America because he realized the NKVD would soon turn into a State supported police orgainzation.Martin is a decent and honest man who suffered horribly.. He lost his entire family in Treblinka and had the courage to tell the world about it. His book should be read by anyone interested in this topic and anyone who wants to learn how one can build a new life despite experiencing such horror.

Needless to say, I got much more than I bargained for.This story is about Martin Gray and the utterly incredible life he lived and endured. He escapes from the clutches of death so many times that you lose count, his will to survive and the cleverness he employs to that end is amazing, and the schemes he conjures to bring food into the ghetto or escape from the death camps or to make his fortune are phenomenal.With a life story like his, it'd almost be hard to write a non-engaging book. For myself, I read about 350 pages in around 3 days; it was just that riveting. But the writing style is powerful, too. Most of the book is written in the first-person and interspersed with dialogue; it's basically a window into Martin's inner thoughts.Most people know the horrors of the Holocaust but actually reading a first-hand account of them, and the subsequent thought process Martin had to try to make sense of it all was so powerful.Why read this book? I'll be honest, a large part of me wasn't enthused about absorbing the lowest depths of humanity through a Holocaust memoir. But the curiosity of how this man lived to write this memoir in the first place and how he dealt with it all propelled me forward. Martin writes so viscerally that I feel I've come away with a deeper understanding of the range of the human experience, how our emotions respond to the world around us, and how one man lives his life.Strange as it may sound, being Jewish myself, I feel like I have a piece of Martin inside of me now. Sadly, all he had at the end of this book was a story to tell and a cause to pursue; nearly everything else in his life had been taken from him. It makes me feel good that I have aided his quest, read his story, suffered with him, and can now tell others about the life he endured."},{"Title":"For Those I Loved","review":"I have read this book several times; it is one of the most powerful accounts of a Holocaust experience that I have ever read.

It has ben passed on to numerous friends and relatives who were also very moved by Martin Gray's struggle and survival. He is an honorable man that suffered horribly and had the strength and character to tell us about his life during WWII under the Nazis.I was disheartened to read the reviews by the &quot;revisionists&quot; who claim this book is fiction. I studied in France for several years and correspond with many collegues there. When I read these revisionist accounts I contacted my former professor and friends in France to research their claims. The archives of the periodicals &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Le Figaro&quot; were reviewed. The claims made by these revisionists are simply false and misleading. Yes, Martin Gray was in the NKVD. His his sole responsiblity was to hunt Nazi's hiding in Eastern Europe that escaped the Russian Army's occupation. He was even assigned to trail Martin Bormann without success. He was never involved in any other manner in this organization.Gitta Sereny, the author responsible for disclosing the truth about Albert Speer, never confronted or commented about Martin Gray. There is no credible record of her comments. This and the other allegations are simply false and the work of uninformed and uneducated revisionists.My friends in France have only the greatest admiration for Martin Gray and praise him for his forthright and honest portyal of his experiences. A six hour movie, starring Michael York, was made of his life and shown in France and England.This book will be difficult to find, but I strongly urge anyone who has one to lend it to a friend to read. If you do not have one, try the library or make an effort to locate it.

Mr Gray's story is the most increadible story I have ever read . My children will read this book. I will ALWAYS remember the people that were forever lost at that horrible time in history. From the first day that I read this book, I have thought of Martin's family and have never forgotten them. Not for even a day. If you have not read this book, I urge you to.

Without explanation, the image of this man's face will flit through my mind and I will pause and send him good wishes. I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the Holocaust OR in the triumph of the human spirit. We all have our crosses to bear, but Martin Gray's will to survive is nothing less than remarkable. Besides, it's a beautifully written and heartfelt book. I long for further information about this man's life. If ANYONE knows any other details of his life -- is he alive? Dead? What happened to him after the publishing of his book? Did he ever reconstruct his life after losing his entire family, yet a second time? Please do write to me at [...]and let me know.

The book is very good and can keep the reader's attention. If anyone makes negative comments about too many books about surviving the Holocaust then they have not read the book For Those I Loved. In the book I liked how Martin Gray chose to tell his story, but still manage to not seem to desire pity from the readers. He only seemed to have the desire to tell others his story and the hardships he went through. For Those I Loved is a book that shows the inhumanity of war and the fate of life. It is a very good book and in my opinion can help to inspire people to keep trying, no matter what may come their way.

I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a light and refreshing read!!!"},{"Title":"Sky Girl","review":"Rosemary Griggs, Sky Girl (Fence Books, 2003)Sky Girl is a very difficult book. Not necessarily because of its subject matter (though the book's stated subject matter, the examination of the lives of stewardesses in a post-9/11 society, would probably be difficult for some people), but because of the way that subject matter is presented. Whether some of these poems are poetry at all would be subject to very vigorous debate, no doubt, especially the one-line, one-sentence \\"poems\\" which read more like things jotted on a notepad during a phone conversation.\\"I saw her one time after that. I said that's a nice dress on you, your arms don't look that fat in it.\\"(--\\"She's not pretty but she has an accent\\")Yes, that's the whole thing.So the difficulty comes in piecing all this together. Like a double-sided jigsaw puzzle that's nothing but one shade of blue, some of the pieces do fit together in obvious ways (the whole September 11 thing, for example), but others (like, for example, the piece above) don't seem to fit in with the overall picture, even when turned upside-down and rotated in every way possible. Eventually, you're probably going to give up and go onto another puzzle. (Just make sure it's not all one shade of, say, yellow.)There are some good things here, but not enough to give it a recommendation. **"},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"Many of us fall into the trap of thinking that our relationship to the land must be one of either two choices: either we ruthlessly exploit it, with no regard for any but short term use, or we refuse to &quot;meddle&quot; in it at all, letting nature do what it will. _Second Nature_ explores the third alternative, that of working with nature respectfully to produce something that we intend. Believing that our relationship with nature can not be broken down into simple nature versus culture arguments, Pollan explores the overlapping of nature and culture. To that end, he discusses Americans' historical and contemporary ideas of what makes a garden a garden and attitudes toward gardening and wilderness. There is wonderful, thought-provoking commentary on the tyranny of the American lawn, the sexuality of roses, class conflict in the garden, privacy, trees, weeds, and what it means to have a green thumb. Pollan's stories of his own adventures in the garden are interesting and often amusing. His writing is thoughtful and his insight frequently unexpected, as when, in the chapter &quot; 'Made Wild by Pompous Catalogs' &quot;, he points out that garden catalogues are selling not merely seed but their ideas about gardens. Pollan is also highly readable. It is hard not to like an author who says things like &quot;...the Victorian middle class simply couldn't deal with the rose's sexuality&quot; or &quot;...there is a free lunch and its name is photosynthesis&quot;. _Second Nature_ is well worth reading"},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"I read this book for a college course, &quot;Religion, Ethics, and the Environment.&quot; Most of the books were (as the course title suggests) very heavy texts...yawn. However, when assignments from Pollan's book came up, I would laugh out loud while reading. My classmates &amp; I would discuss the book at any given opportunity, and the bookstore sold twice as many copies as there were students in the class, because we recommended it to everyone. How many philosophy books can you say that about?Pollan makes his philosophical points with vivid stories from his childhood on Long Island and his adult experiences in his garden. His garden-centered view of nature provides an excellent counterpoint to most environmental philosophy, which has been written from a preservationist's point of view."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I grew up in a family which gardens, and have my own garden today. I also grew up in an agrarian family, and went on to get a master's in cultural anthropology - all that to say, I suppose I am well-suited to enjoy Pollan's perspectives.I don't agree with everything he wrote, but I do agree with most of it. And the book is very well-written, very entertaining, and it really makes the reader pause to consider choices made in their own life.So much of the information about gardening is \\"how-to\\", and this book delves into the philosophy, the motivations, the rationales, and the environmental impacts of gardening .... It's written on a higher level, and as worthwhile for readers as the \\"how to\\" books, too.I highly recommned this book - for those who enjoy gardening, and also for those who are concerned about the environment. Pollan will be a good read for both.I absolutely disagree with the previous reviewer who disparaged Pollan's take on the environmental movement as a whole. Perhaps that person is so deeply enmeshed in environmental causes that he can't see the big picture- but for me, the big picture looks much more as Pollan describes it, than not."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"This was probably the first book I read that dealt with relations to nature on a practical and philosophical level. I'm not sure if Pollan counts as a philosopher, but the views he presents are very accessible and bring a lot into question.I've heard his writing described as piecey, which surprised me. I will agree that the seperation of the chapters into seasons didn't really seem to fit, but ignoring the headers fixed that problem. Overall it was an enjoyable and informative read. There's a very strong sense of humor that runs through the whole book and many good points are made.Anyone interested in gardening would love this book, and I think that anyone interested in environmental issues or ethics would too. It's a good place to start off if you've ever wondered about societal attitudes to the land but wavered on learning more by the writing style of people like Emerson or Singer.I was so pleased reading this book that I bought Pollan's A Botany of Desire, as well, and though the check-out girl gave me a funny look because of the title, it was well worth it."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"SECOND NATURE by Michael Pollen is a collection of esays that are not always well-connected or well-written. Mr. Pollen has won awards for his essays and some of them are quite good, however, the book is uneven. I think many of the readers who provided glowing reviews must have concentrated on the front half of the book which is autobiographical and hysterically funny.NATURE contains several distinct sections Pollan calls &quot;Spring-Summer-Fall-Winter&quot; but his essays do not &quot;follow&quot; the gardening year. For example, &quot;Fall&quot;, the third section of the book is about the destruction of Cathedral Pines, a nature preserve owned and managed by the Nature Conservancy in Connecticut. Mr. Pollan thinks the local town folk (he is one) should have decided &quot;what to do&quot; in the aftermath of the storm which toppled the old pine trees that had inhabited the Cathedral Pines since the days of the American Revolution. Pollan would have done better to call this section &quot;Why I think I understand Mother Nature better than the Nature Conservancy.&quot; And, maybe he does, but his essay is angry, and his anger affects his argument. After reading his essay, I am not persuaded the Nature Conservancy failed since Pollan fails to provide their side of the argument which might have been quite reasonable.The best part of Pollan's book contains his autobiographical essays about life with his father who refused to mow the lawn much to the consternation of his upscale neighbors; life with his maternal grandfather who made mega-bucks as a professional gardener and green grocer; and Pollan's own attempts to take up gardening as an avocation. Anyone who has ever gardened will enjoy these sections because as all good gardeners know, most folks learn through trial and error. Mr. Pollen says there are few &quot;Green Thumbs&quot; i.e. Green thumbs exist, but they are rare.The book is laced with historical factoids--an eclectic assortment of information Mr. Pollan gleaned from many articles and books by garden/nature and other writers including James Frazier, Thoreau, Emerson, Alexander Pope, Henry Mitchell, Eleanor Perenyi, Allen Lacey, Elizabeth Lawrence, and Katherine White who wrote garden essays for the New Yorker magazine. Mr. Pollen is advertised on the jacket of his book as an &quot;Executive Editor&quot; of Harper's magazine, and as I read his book, I formed an image of him snipping bits and pieces from the various articles and books he edited over time and sticking them together, i.e. a cut and paste job. Mr. Pollan's book needed a better editor, and I haven't read such an entertaining, provocative and frustrating book in a long time."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"This is a favorite that I've returned to at least twice. Pollan engages with his skill in writing, but also his interesting thoughts on the mundane that make them seem intriguing. Essays are easy to read in any order, yet are connected. Much more than a garden book, will inspire not just planting and pruning, but thinking. Worth the read, regardless of whether you have dirty fingernails or green thumb."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"I had to read this for a college course. I didn't know what to expect, but half way into the book I was enraptured. Literally. Pollan is a very adept writer, and he has a lot of depth to what he writes. He piles metaphor on top of symbolizm on top of metaphor. If you don't pick up on everything, that's alright because the book is simply enjoyable. His anecdotes about life and gardening are the icing on this book, and I'd recommend it simply for that pleasure. But there is substance here. Pollan is making a statement about the relationship between culture and nature. He writes about how we, as a species, as a culture, try to seperate what we live in (culture, cities, whatever) from what we live near (nature, the environment, wildness). He says that that is more detrimental than any polution or destruction we could possibly do to our earth. We, as a culture, need to learn to live not simply &quot;in&quot; nature, but &quot;with nature.&quot; In response to the chapter on Cathedral Pines, he uses that to illustrate how the Conservationists, the people who owned the land, were trying to save this little &quot;virgin&quot; land. This little area in this New England community that was untouched by humanity. It was destroyed by nature (in the form of a tornado) and they, as a community, should let nature do with the forest as it wanted. Nature knows best. What Pollan says is that that forest wasn't untouched by man. Man had inhabited the area for over two hundred years (not including Native Americans - which no one ever does) and the trees they were saving WERE affected by civiliztion. That forest, as the community knew and loved it, was destroyed by nature. The community could've possibly planted knew trees, cleaned out the old dead ones, and made everything back the way it was. The Conservationists didn't want that because &quot;nature knows best.&quot; But it depends on how you look at it. In a way (and I'm not going to further in depth, because it's all in the book) the forest WAS a garden, it was created, changed by mankind. There was nothing truely &quot;nautral&quot; about it. Therefore, why couldn't they, as a community, make the decision on what to do with it? If the tornado ripped through the town and destroyed houses, people would rebuild. It's that simply. No one would throw up their hands and say, &quot;Well, nature knows best!&quot; But when it comes to Cathedral Pines, they left the fallen trees there to rot, cleared a wide swath around the forest to protect the community from possible fire, and called it a &quot;preserve.&quot; This benefited no one, and time will tell what course nature will take. Maybe the fire that will burn the brush and dead wood will be too strong and damage the soil. The forest wouldn't grow back, and instead of a beautiful forest you'd have a field of brush and &quot;weeds.&quot; Sure, nature took its course, but it's not as important as one may think.This is long winded, and you may not understand it all, but if you read the book and pay more attention to what Pollan says, and less on how he says it (how well it's written and how entertaining it is), you'll pick up on the philosophical stuff. You'll pick up on the meaning. And I suggest that you do, you'll rethink a lot of the thoughts you may have on the environment and on culture."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"Pollans description of what is a green thumb and the sysiphean art of mowing reminded me how therapeutic gardening can be and why it cures depression. Thank you Michael for making me look at my roses in a totally different way. You will love this book if you tend to think in pictures and love the art and hard work of gardening."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"I don't intend to question Pollan's ability as a writer, nor do I care to check up on his interpretation of the history of hybrid roses or British garden design, but as a gardener who entered this endeavor from the ecologist/naturalist end of the spectrum, I found plenty of bones to pick with him.A previous reviewer mentions Pollan's rant about The Nature Conservancy, which -- much to his chagrin -- declined to harvest, clean-up, or replant the trasured Cathedral Pines after they were damaged by a tornado. Pollan is clearly very comfortable with his position about how gardens fit along the spectrum between wilderness and human culture, but too often he relies on straw-men and oversimplified truisms to represent the views of those with whom he disagrees.Examples abound, but some that galled me the most were his conclusions that: (1) the American environmental movement is too hung up about preserving Wilderness to care about the other 90+% of our lands (absurd! ever hear of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts? the Endangered Species Act?); and (2) the moral and scientific bankruptcy of this philosophy has led to the 'degradation' of Yellowstone National Park, as exemplified by the forest fires of the late 1980's (or could this just be an example of the renewing power natural process, without the hand of human 'gardeners'?).I accept that Pollan is a journalist and a (fine) writer, not a scientist, but a little more effort to gain an deeper understanding of both the science and the philosophies of those whose view differ from his would have been greatly appreciated.Of course, it is Pollan's book, and a popular non-fiction, not an academic treatise, so some hand-waving to help justify his mostly-sensible views is his prerogative. I appreciated the humor and passion of Pollan's writing, and I am sure I would greatly enjoy a walk down his garden path."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"SECOND NATURE is not your normal gardening book. There aren't a lot of \\"how to\\" instructions here for planting, nurturing and harvesting. There are, however, innumerable more important things here.Pollan takes his reader on a journey of discovery, asking cogent questions about man's relationship to nature, about the proper way to conserve wilderness, about the social strata of contemporary seed catalogs, about the best way to design a garden to achieve our spiritual goals (although his way of expressing it isn't nearly as hokey-sounding as my wording), about the sexual metaphors of roses, about the quasi-religious movement of composting, and about the historical evolution in the way we have looked at trees.His writing is often humorous as well as something most of us can relate to in our own experiences. In his early battles with garden-eating rodents, his ill-considered attempt to napalm a woodchuck makes for absolutely hilarious reading, and the story of his father's rebellion against the neighbors' edict that he mow his lawn is exhilarating. Throughout much of the book, we do, however, come to learn a serious lesson. The realistic gardener does not attempt to subdue nature nor to surrender to it, but to work with nature as a part of it, to be realistic in determining what can and cannot be accomplished, and to influence rather than conquer (especially since conquering is not really possible after all).For both the neophyte and the experienced gardener, SECOND NATURE is probably more important and useful than a \\"how to\\" book for it will reveal the overarching philosophy that drives the gardener's actions. For the suburbanite whose gardening is pretty much limited to manicuring his portion of The Great American Lawn and planting a few decorative shrubs here and there, it is utterly indispensable for it will reveal the shallow artificiality of such kowtowing to social \\"propriety.\\"Pollan's lessons are painless. He never preaches. He never rants. He never proselytizes. His writing is both humorous and instructive. It unveils historical trends in man's relationship toward gardens, wildlands, and lawns that most readers, with our limited visions of life in the 17th and 18th centuries, never suspected. Most importantly, the reader finishes his book with a genuinely new appreciation of man's place in nature, with an understanding that it is okay to make his mark upon nature (because he is part of it), and with the knowledge of how to make that mark positive, non-destructive, and productive.I heartedly recommend SECOND NATRURE to everyone who has ever planted a garden (productively or otherwise), who has ever thought about planting a garden, who has ever mowed a lawn, who has ever wondered about the best methods of protecting wilderness areas, who has ever written a letter in support of or opposition to environmental activists, or who, though city-bound and surrounded by asphalt, has ever wondered about man's proper place on the earth. SECOND NATURE has, if not universal, then at least very widespread appeal to all sorts of readers."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"Pollan is a joy to read.

It is about Pollan's perceptions of nature and landscape, through the gateway of his garden. He does only enough research to flesh out his musings with historical fact and literary reference - and he is very selective. He leans heavily on Thoreau, and neglects wider scholarship. His essays bog down in pedantic and turgid language (he abuses at least one 5-syllable word per essay). The writing is much like Bill Bryson's, about whom, I'm also kinda lukewarm. I didn't love it, although there are good bits - the story of his first rose plantings was interesting, and inspired me to drop a few snobby old roses in the sod."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"One of my favorite all-time books.

But his point of view is all humanist and as such is part of the same old agenda as even the worse earth-raping capitalists. Indeed, his later books and essays advocate killing animals, \\"getting over\\" the \\"idea\\" of wilderness, and not bothering to preserve nature but rather to just give up and let humans overrun everything. He is a good marketer, has a huge ego, and he tells humans (especially us Hummer-loving Americans) what we want to hear, but people like him are part of the erudite, seemingly sensitive propagandists (such as Bill McKibben) who do not love earth as much as they love humans, thus missing the fact that humans are embarked on a massive earth-killing mission that combines capitalism, ecocide and ultimately suicide."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"This book looks at our suburban landscaping and introduces the reader to alternatives to the highly regimented foundationplantings and obligatory specimen tree."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"Great story!

I prefer audiobooks and have found his reader, Scott Brick, to be brilliant in those more recent efforts. However, he has chosen to read this book himself and he starts out well enough but eventually he becomes more monotoned and seemingly disinterested in the subject matter (which he had apparently written more than a decade before his audio recording).

Just about anyone who read him then, is my guess. Pollan shows in this gem of a book what a terrific and layered writer he is.For all the fantastic writing, the book, however, is uneven. Many of the chapters were published as magazine articles before the book came out, and it shows. The organization of the book by seasons is forced and the individual chapters in each section don't always belong. Pollan makes a good effort of tying it all together with memories of his grandfather's garden (and the characters of the grandfather and his garden in the beginning narrative are worth the price of admission), but in the end the individual narratives don't hold together as well as later Pollan books manage to do.But don't let this stop you. Push through some of the more boring chapters (or skip them altogether, since the one advantage of the choppy nature of the book is that each chapter stands alone well), and you'll be rewarded with the absolute perfection of others. My favorite, the chapter about seed catalogs, is at once observational journalism, literary criticism, and writing master class.If you came to this book the same way I did (which is to say, after reading Pollan's more recent work, including his magnum opus \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\"), I think you'll find enjoyment in seeing his earlier achievement as a writer, a science journalist, and a modern environmentalist. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"I loved his previously written books, but this one felt forced.

For instance, the chapter on roses explains how human intervention and selective breeding brought about a huge difference between the technicolor tear-dropped buds we see for sale at the grocery store and the rounder and simpler flowers that Shakespeare and his contemporaries wrote about.Throughout the book Pollan makes the case for uniting culture and nature in the garden rather than pitting them against each other as Thoreau (the naturist) did in his writings or suburban landscaping (very culture-centered) implies today. It is an interesting argument worth considering, but by the fourth part when I found it repeated for the umpteenth time without anything new to add I quit reading the book."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"I read this book after stumbling across, and very much enjoying, the Botany of Desire by the same author.

It is written in the spirit of earth that author obviously is in love with. The book is divided into four seasons: spring summer,fall and winter. Each of the seasons has it's own unique characteristic that follows ancient tradition of preparing soil, sowing,cultivating, weeding, harvesting and winter nothingness.However if reader looks for practical advises, he or she will not find it here. It is a wonderfull read for all the nature lovers."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"This is simply a wonderful book. As a gardener, I often recognized myself in the author's reflections, although I'd not taken the time to articulate many of his thoughtful meanderings around his gardening experiences. And what a thoughtful trip it is and how much FUN it often is! In the Weeds section, when one of his final thoughts, directed at Thoreau, in Walden Pond, who couldn't bear to eliminate weeds and wild critters from his bean patch: is &quot;Fine. Starve.&quot; I laughed out loud. Highly readable bits of history on our attitudes toward trees, use of the land and ornamental gardening both enlighten and amuse. I can't wait to tak this book to my master gardener group to share it with my friends. This would have been a PERFECT gift for me if one of my family had seen it before I did."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"This beautifully written book is a must for any garden lover. Michael Pollan's thought's on gardening are educated, witty and poignant. I enjoyed every word!"},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"I read Pollans &quot;A Place of My Own&quot; and couldn't wait to read his first book &quot;Second Nature&quot;. His writing captivates me and I hope he writes many more stories about anything. He's a wonderful teacher, story teller, yarn spinner and his inquisitive nature struck a strong cord. All my friends and relatives will get to enjoy it as a gift from me. Thanks Michael for a great read"},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"My first exposure to Michael Pollan's writing was an article in the New York Times Magazine. I loved his writing style and his point of view. He made me think about the environment in ways that were totally new to me. I love those \\"aha\\" moments. Those \\"why didn't I think of that?\\" moments. And then my outlook on life and the world around me is subtly altered.So it was with great anticipation that I oopened my copy of \\"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education\\". Michael Pollan on gardening. It doesn't get much better than that, right? Well, um, actually it does. I was expecting a completely new perspective on gardening. What I got was just another memoir of a beginning gardener. Admittedly, he does tell much more entertaining stories than most garden memoirists. No one who reads this book will ever forget his monumental battles with a woodchuck culminating in an attempt at incineration that very nearly incinerated the garden. Hilarious, but still quite ordinary. Can you think of a single garden memoir that doesn't contain a battle with a woodchuck? Just as Hollywood screenwriters use a predictable formula for their storylines, garden memoirists all stick to the same, tired outline: How I started gardening. How I made all the newbie mistakes my first year. How I tried to correct them. How I learned the \\"right\\" way to garden.Disappointed, I soldiered on until Chapter 10 when I finally had the hoped for \\"why didn't I think of that?\\" moment. The story of the restoration of a woodland area in his town that had been destroyed by a tornado morphs into a discussion of restoration vs replacement vs allowing Nature to take its course and all of the consequences, intended and unintended, that could happen for each option. Now this is a book that I would like to read. The question of what time period a restoration should mimic is particularly intriguing. Colonial, after changes made by European settlers? Pre-Columbian? Taking into account the fact that the indigenous population also had a significant impact on the local ecology, should the area be restored to the state it was before the Native Americans arrived? These are questions that have never occurred to me when thinking about our altered landscape.Ideally, I would have liked to see the \\"memoir\\" part of the book excised and this topic expanded. Where else in the US or even the world has this issue been addressed? What decisions were made and why? Was global warming taken into account? What provisions were made for non-native plant and animal introductions?And then the book reverts right back to the standard memoir. The last two chapters are the obligatory catalog survey and \\"What my garden looks like now\\". Yawn.I'm looking forward to reading more of Michael Pollan's books and his unique perspective. Even if it is only one or two chapters that grab me, they will be well worth it."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"This book is by far the best written non-fiction book. Michael Pollan turns the most mundane topic into gold. I am overjoyed by the knowledge and effortless chic he demonstrates in his writing.I have also read his other books. Sorry, but none of them comes close to this one. Michael Pollan elates me in this book but disappoints in all the others, with the newer ones getting worse, although, \\"The Omnivour's Dilemma\\" is worth reading, too."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"I had high expectations, after reading his other books. But while this book works hard at being \\"deep\\", it doesn't look like Pollan has any real depth in the area of gardening. The book is not giving me any insights into gardening, but I am getting insights into Mr. Pollan, and it's sadly not enjoyable.In Omnivore's Dilemna, in the section describing the pig meal, there's some of the this same quality that bothers me so much in this book. It's a smug, self-congratulatory tone, while he doesn't appear to be even concious of all the things he's doing, nor seeing any contraditions. And in both that section of Omnivore's Dilemna, and in several of the essays in this book, the conclusions he draws are flawed, since he's not observing his own actions as thoughfully as he observes the rest of the world.I suppose the writing is nice, though."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"What a great book. Not only did I discover several new garden supply stores, but I also was awakened to the oddity of the all encompassing front yards of grass throughout the US and how that came to be and how hard it is to break away from the tyranny to conform to it.Pollan discusses the conflict between having a garden and allowing the weeds and creatures to live their lives and how we actually act as weeds ourselves in changing the landscape around us.\\"Native grasses proved poor forage for European livestock, which at first did not fare well in America. Yet colonists noted that after a few years the grasses-and in turn the health of the livestock-seemed to improve. What had happened, according to Crosby, is that Old World livestock had overgrazed the native grasses. Because these species were unaccustomed to such heavy grazing, they had trouble regenerating themselves. This left them vulnerable to the onslaught of European weed grasses which, having co-evolved with the goat and sheep and cow, are better equipped to withstand the grazing pressure of these animals. The European grasses soon conquered American meadows, thereby providing European livestock with their preferred forage once again. Today most of the native grasses have vanished.\\"My eyes glazed over reading the last chapter on garden design, but I found the rest of the book fascinating and thought provoking.\\"The ladybug is not smart, but she knows one thing exceedingly well:how to catch forty or fifty aphids every day without hurting anybody else. If you think of evolution as a three-and-a half-billion-year-long laboratory experiment, and the gene pool as the store of information accumulated during the course of that experiment, you begin to appreciate that nature has far more extensive knowledge about her operations than we do. The trick is to put her knowledge to our purpose in the garden.\\""},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"I am a gardener. I have to start with this statement, because I relate so very well to Pollan in this regard that I am not able to step outside myself and make a guess if it's a book for every homeowner or more for those who are interested in gardening. If you have even a passing interest in horticulture, landscaping, or possibly american history/philosophy I would highly recommend this book. It felt so good to read about someone else's journey through idealism to pragmatism in their own yard, as so much of it reflects my own experiences. There are oodles of quotes and thoughts from other garden writers, many of which I plan to follow up on and read as well. I learned a lot from Second Nature and enjoyed every minute of it."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"As has been the case with all of Michael Pollan's books that I have read, he informs with humor and narrative that at times makes me laugh out loud. My all time favorite, however, is Omnivore's Dilemma. I have changed the way I shop in our local market since reading it. This also is a MUST read."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"Michael Pollan's writing is full of metaphors. This book about nature as a human construct was enjoyable to read. I found some parts frustrating because I like the romantic idea of nature even if it is just a human construct. But overall I would recommend this book for a quick read."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"Nothing about gardening like I had expected. It was more about his like gardening in different places where he lived"},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"Excellent and honorable. He speaks from experience and from the heart. In his writing, the balance imbued between a heavy hand in the garden versus the idealism eco minded folks carry with them is much appreciated. Kudos."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"I'm not a gardener, so why did I pick up this book? Only because it's a Michael Pollan book and I'm a fanboy of his. At first the book was boring, I mean I just not a gardener. Yet as the book went on I found it more and more interesting. As a someone working on getting his \\"Bachelor of Science in Environmental Policy and Management\\" I found the environmental stuff very interesting. By the end of the book I wanted to go out and get my hands dirty. I wanted to plain not only a vegetable garden but also one for my own aesthetic enjoyment."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"I've just started gardening and a friend gave me this book. I'm a fan of some of Pollan's later books and thoroughly enjoyed this. It's a one part personal memoir, two parts philosophical musings about nature, and a smidge of good gardening advice thrown in to boot. I'd like to see it updated a bit since times (and organic gardening) have changed somewhat- but regardless, it stands up excellently and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"The author sure did his research! I was learning a new concept every page. It's amazing how involved and enriched the flora culture is. I loved the theories on lawn grass, I was right there with him thinking the same things every day in the not so distant past when I watered, cared for and cut my grass. Overall excellent book, I recommend this to anyone even remotely interested in planting, gardening or who even likes flowers. I think I found my mother's day gift!"},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"Michael Pollan is a pleasure to read. His perspective is reasonable and timely. It was interesting to read about his experiences and choices in the garden."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"I have read most of Michael Pollans books. I think 'The Omnivores Dilemma' is a five-star plus book that should be mandatory reading for everyone who eats, and 'In Defense of Food' is almost as good.In this book, Michael talks about his efforts at gardening, both vegetables and ornamental plants. However, this book disappoints. It is too vague, with few concrete examples to back up his assertions. It seems that Michael is a better writer about other peoples efforts at producing food than he is on his own efforts."},{"Title":"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education (First Edition)","review":"Originally purchased this book for a college course on Outdoor Ethics. I never did end up reading it, but I'm looking to start a garden next year and this really help me get fired up about gardening. The book helped me to get a prospective about my place in nature and how I want to go about gardening. Loved it."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Early Church","review":"This book offers an overview of Early Christianity from the apostolic times to the fourth ecumenical Council (Chalcedon, 451). It does not have a literary, easy-to-read style, as some other woorks (Paul Johnson and Henry Chadwick came to mind),I admit, but its text is deep enough for an introduction. The first divisions, heresies, schisms and the imperial functions the Church progressively assumed are described in a concise but very clear way.Nevertheless, the reader must have in mind that this is an academic work, not a book for the general reader. It is not heavy, full of references (on the contrary, the text is very clear, and most the references are only to primary sources), but its style may seem rather dry. Anyway, it's an excellent source for all those interested on Early Christianity who intends to start a serious study."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Early Church","review":"This book seems to be so deep that you cant swim. I found it very hard to get into a flow with. The literature seems to jump around too vastly and uses unnecessary complicated words to get simple messages across.

Two young women decide to drive from Albania to Paris.

The pace builds, things happen, there's sort of a climax. That being said, this is a Plot Full o' Holes. The more I've thought about it since finishing it the less sense it makes. People's actions don't line up with motivations, loose ends abound. I mean, it REALLY doesn't make any sense. Can't explain why without giving spoilers, but it's not a head-scratching \\"I don't get it\\". Furthermore, the primary plot element--which becomes the big reveal at the end-- is the most tired and cliche device I can think of for a \\"psychological thriller.\\" I spotted it less than halfway through... I did read to the finish, but really just to see if that was actually what it was. And yes, it was. And no, it made no sense.Whatever it lacks in plotting (a LOT), it makes up for in sex and violence. This is NC-17 stuff, and it comes perilously close to becoming the harcore porn that figures heavily in the story. Tastes differ, but for me a bad taste lingered.This isn't the worst, or most laughably incompetent, book I've run across ('Vector' by Robin Cook wins that prize), so I give it two stars, but trust me... save your money and your time and find something with a little more internal consistency."},{"Title":"The Disappearance of Lyndsey Barratt","review":"First let me say that Mr. Wilson is a very competent wordsmith... that is, no particular paragraph or bit of dialogue made me groan. His pacing is good, the excitement builds well, etc. But this plot has more holes that Albert Hall (I'm dating myself, I know).

I'm no prude, but the graphic scenes with which the book is liberally stocked skirt very close to becoming the hardcore pornography that figures prominently in the plot.I rate it three stars because it held my interest long enough to finish it, but it was largely to see whether the hoary old chestnut I spotted in the middle turned out to be the actual ending, and yes.

A ridiculous ending that doesn't match up with *ANYTHING* the author wrote in the rest of the book. I very much wish I could go into the reasons *why* it fell apart, but unfortunately to do so would spoil the book for others.

Ali desperately pursues an old flame, Richard, not fully understanding his infatuation and slowly crawling away from his insecurities as he chases. Ali's changing friendships flavor the atmosphere, too.

What livens up the story is the multicultural cast of characters, and the increased family tensions brought into play.If you're gay, have survived your 20s, and have been fortunate enough to find a partner, you may grow weary of the main character's whining about boyfriend trouble. You might be interested, though, in the perspective of a gay Muslim Indian (by way of Kenya).I'd recommend this as a quick summer or weekend read.A couple of notes:[1] There is a glossary in the back of foreign words and phrases.[2] The dust cover notes that Dhalla is working on a screen adaptation of the book.

Hence, opening the covers of ODE TO LATA (and discovering that this was indeed the 10th anniversary edition! With the added charm of a never before printed short story placed at the book's end) held great expectations. Not surprisingly all expectations were met and indeed a growing respect of the gifts of this East Indian lad from Kenya transplanted to Los Angeles. This is an important voice in literature and not only in that special field of gay literature, but more appropriately in the international realm of authors whose ability to shape language into monuments of understanding and celebration of differences - of cultures, of gender variations, of capturing the essence of the world as we live in it today - supersede national background and instead provide a matrix for us all to learn about the unity of mankind.Briefly, this novel deals with a man named Ali who was born in Kenya, the son of an abusive father and a doting mother, whose childhood was colored by the songs and lights of Bollywood movies, dressing in outrageous garb and participating in activities that indicated quite early that he preferred men to women. The bits and pieces of his existence in Kenya are scattered throughout the book, raising their heads when further elucidation calls memories forth. Ali \`escapes' to America where he becomes a banker by day and a West Hollywood club addict by night. He has friends, both fellow East Indian men and others, but Ali's penchant for attracting lovers who do not have the same monogamous needs as Ali leads him through affairs that rip at his soul: Richard, Nelson, Bill consume his passion for a time until he discovers their need for absence. There are moments of betrayal even as a best friend usurps the bed of a current lover, but Ali's needs are never exhausted. His ties to his genetic background are focused in a visit from his beloved Mummy who finally accepts Ali's choice of life style. Dhalla takes us very realistically through the seedier aspects of night life, the ebullient passion of this affairs, the agonies of love lost /found/lost and facing the vast emptiness of life alone - at times even without friends. He invites us into the psyche of a handsome young Indian who not infrequently feels unattractive, unloved, misunderstood, and betrayed. Yet through it all we, the reader, deeply care about this beauty of a character.The \`gift', aside from the ability to tell a story that never lets the reader pause, that Ghalib Shiraz Dhalla has that places him in that echelon of brilliant writers is his majestic poetry that flows simply from the manner in which he places words on the page. A brief example: \`The years have nothing to do with aging. It is the heart that governs that process. It etches out its infliction upon your face like a sketcher dribbling carelessly on unsoiled paper, leaving irrevocable histories of the wars and wounds endured.' And that is too brief an example, but walk through his descriptions of West Hollywood at gloaming when the landscape alters with the loss of sun to become the grotesquely lighted stage for the evening and night's grand theater of lust, or enter the bedrooms and witness in words the extravagances of physical encounters. And when he interjects words and phrases from his native tongue the atmosphere fills with the sent of incense and cumin.But the only true way to appreciate this book (and his others) is to read them, alone or out loud with friends - that is when they become choral and operatic, or in a few pages plangent and longing for centricity. Ghalib Shiraz Dhalla is one amazing writer. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, February 13"},{"Title":"Ode to Lata","review":"This first novel is not only a powerful drama but also very informative - I didn't know that there was an East Indian community living in postcolonial Kenya. This story tells you a lot about Indian culture, and what it is like to grow up in a city like Mombassa. We are constantly peppered with images from Ali's childhood, and we really get a sense of the innocence and traditionalistic life that existed there particularly after the British left. Dhalla's work is almost like stream of consciousness - we are constantly blasted with Ali's thoughts and feelings as he battles to come to terms with his failed relationships with Richard, Nelson and Bill. What saves this novel from being an over-the-top melodrama is the way Dhalla presents his different themes: coming to terms with one's cultural inheritance, family relationships, HIV/AIDS, coming out, casual sex, racism within minority groups, and loyalty and betrayal in friendships. And he brings the Los Angles/Hollywood gay scene to life in a way that hasn't been done since John Rechy: the drugs, drinking, the nightclubs, the body fascism, and the plasticity of much of the scene are presented in vivid and spot-on detail.The story adeptly moves backwards and forwards in time from Ali's childhood in Kenya where we learn about his traditional Indian childhood, his relationships with boys, and his overbearing and overprotective mother, or \\"Mummy\\" as he calls her, to the present, where Ali cruises Santa Monica Boulevard on the weekends, searching for true love and his \\"ideal\\" man. Ali is such a complex, conflicted and multi-faceted character. Torn between the traditional East Indian culture of Kenya - where men are expected to marry and father children, and gay men are often closeted - to the modern, urban sophisticated world of Los Angeles, where gay sex is available for the taking, and life is dictated by the Santa Monica nightclubs, saunas and sex clubs. Ali is looking for love in an environment that he thinks is harsh and impersonal, and the final scene in the Hollywood sex club where he realizes that he can't go on living like this will leave you breathless. Yes - the sex in this novel is powerful, raw, and piercing, but never gratuitous. In fact, Dhalla has infused his story with a powerful, all embracing eroticism.This is also a story of Los Angeles, and how a single gay man from an immigrant community copes in a big, modern city. How does Ali reconcile the needs of his mother, and the powerful ties of his cultural heritage with the needs of his friends, lovers, and life in modern Los Angeles? This is the thematic core of the book and Ali's journey throughout, and I think that at the end of the novel he has come along way in figuring out how he's going to do this. There is no doubt that Ghalib Dhalla is an enormously talented writer, and he's given us an insight into a little publicized part of the gay community. I just hope that we will be able to experience more of Dhalla's work in the years to come.Michael"},{"Title":"Ode to Lata","review":"Splendid work! Ghalib has taken us through a struggling child's soul trying to make his culture accept his identity, at the same time fighting wars with a family he left in Mombasa, Kenya that demands of their only grandson and child to meet the ordinary and \\"normal\\" requirements of giving them an heir. The entire book is of a homosexual's struggle to live as \\"normal\\" as he knows how, at the same time trying to get over his obsession of his lover. All the time, Ali has a wonderful circle of friends in LA who do not leave his side through all his painful struggles with love and obsession. Added to that is great humor. I could not keep the book down. I laughed and cried with Ali! I can't wait for the Two Krishnas to hit the book store. A must read for everyone. Very well written, Ghalib!"},{"Title":"Ode to Lata","review":"Ode to LataGreat attempt for a first novel. I read this book from a different perspective than I presume most reader will do, because I am from the same town in Kenya and I belong to the same community. Because I grew up in the same environment and seemed like I had a parallel life to Ali I could relate to the circumstances the author is trying to portray. Otherwise, if someone is not form that background (Indian from East Africa) it would be difficult to understand the culture and thinking that drives the Indian community he is talking about.I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I probably know the author even thou I think he is a few years younger than I am, but several incidences like the suicide of a Shenaaz in Mombassa and his friend Salman In LA seems like I know these characters because they are based on actually people I used or still know. I cried and I felt sorry and I could relate to Ali's feeling, the relationship he has with his mother, the insecurity to assimilate into the GAY culture, his alienation from the community and his return to it.What I didn't get out of this reading his strength in building the characters, I didn't feel connected to them or feel the lonely agony that most of them were going through. It is difficult to classify this novel as good literature or compare him to his ideal M G Vassanji, (a Canadian Indian writer from East Africa, from the same community) who writes about the Indian Ismaili community in East Africa, USA & Canada.It's an easy book to read and follow, Ghalib has a way with words that he twists into poetry the flow of the book is well connected. I wish he had spend more time writing about Kenya and had less of the sexual encounter that seems like Ali was having day in and day our and concentrated more on what Ali was really feeling and what he was suffering. Well I agree again that I could see much of my life parade in this book expect the visits to the bathhouses.A good read and I would recommend to anyone who is trying to understand minority assimilation into the gay America.Thanks Ghalib for touching my soul and telling the world that has been suppress within me for many years. I look forward to the movie and hope its full of songs by Lata."},{"Title":"Ode to Lata","review":"Dhalla's finely honed writing skills almost but not quite manage to mask the fact that his story is basically a whiny, insubstantial roman a clef that eventually grates. Maybe finding true love in Los Angeles is really this difficult, but it seems that the choices made by Dhalla's protagonist Ali are not especially wise. Street hustlers usually are not good husband material, a fact of gay life that cannot have been unknown to Ali, given his sexual and social history. Neither are promiscuous party boys, another object of Ali's misguided affections. No wonder he is miserable.Unfortunately, there is no relief for lovelorn Ali, whose unhappiness is the result of his own failings, not the fault of his suitors. This sort of gay self-loathing and failure to connect is a very old, very hackneyed plot.The book does have something to offer, however, in terms of seeing gay life from the perspective of the gay Asian and South Asian subculture, which is its only redeeming point."},{"Title":"Ode to Lata","review":"I read Ode to Lata in one night. It made me laugh and cry and even angry at times. This book is a powerful exploration of the joys and agonies of love and doesn't try to sugarcoat any of it. Reading it made me feel like I had been granted permission to somebody's innermost thoughts and feelings. What stands out most about this novel is that even the main character, Ali, is not some heroic, positive embodiment of all that is good. Like the other characters, Ali is multi-layered and possesses, like the rest of us, the good and the bad in his personality. He is human so we can relate to him. Ghalib Dhalla's writing is so poetic at times, even the darkest passages in the book take on a musical quality to them and leave you amazed. I only wish it had spent a little more time in Ali's homeland of Kenya where Dhalla is at his best but I still enjoyed all the places it takes you to, including some very disturbing ones. Good books should leave you with some kind of a lasting feeling just like good movies. Ode to Lata is such a book."},{"Title":"Ode to Lata","review":"I cannot remember when I've read a first novel any better than this one. The writer has a great flair for words and writes beautiful, evocative prose. He has created a unique protagonist in Ali, an East Indian who grew up in Kenya and has recently moved to Los Angeles. He works in a bank during the day and spends many of his nights looking for Mr. Right or obsessing because he cannot find him. There is a bit of Ali in a lot of us. While much of the action takes place in the gay bars, sex clubs and baths of Los Angeles, the territory sounds familiar and has a universal ring to it. Besides having to deal with his own inner demons of self-worth, Ali must contend with a visit from his Indian mother upset about his &quot;life style&quot; and the fact that since he is an only child, she will never have grandchildren. (Only a saint or fool would let his mother visit for three months.) When Ali's mother isn't trying emotional blackmail on him, she's watching American television. Two of her favorite programs are &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; and Jerry Springer. Mr. Dhalla discusses with honesty the problems of race and color in his own East Indian community as well as other communities. As is too often the case, those with lighter skin get treated better. Ari must face his own racism when he meets and falls for Nelson who is black. And the hustler Billy hates black people as well. (Does all this sound too familiar?)If you are looking for a politically correct gay novel where the protagonist meets and &quot;marries&quot; a gay accountant, proceeds to buy a house with him, complete with a fence and a dog, this novel isn't for you. If you want to read about a character who in all his failings is as real as people you know, some of whom you care about, then this one's for you. In the first lines of this novel, Ali says that there are only two things worth living for: passion and truth. He says he has experienced a lot of passion but the truth eludes him. Mr. Dhalla has written a novel full of both passion and truth."},{"Title":"Ode to Lata","review":"I have been waiting for this novel since I read the excerpt published in \\"Contours of the Heart\\" and I finally bought my copy yesterday. What makes this novel so good is that is is born of candor -- Dhalla (assuming that the novel is autobiographical) is frank and honest. He does not need to do more that that to move the viewer emotionally (this is not to say that being frank and honest isn't hard). Ali is a flawed and tormented character, very human and un-heroic. The leading man's doomed quest for love and lust could be my own story, which is why it is so moving for me.The novel reaches a culmination when the leading man's Mom leaves for Kenya after her visit. I feel the novel of 285 pages should have ended at this point. Subsequent discussions (worth 100 pages) of the leading man's frustrations with desi queers, and a doomed affair with the hustler Bill are dead wood (although the racy description of public sex is memorable). Amusing Kutchi abuses are sprinkled throughout -- bhosrina, kutri, chodu. On the whole, a charming work."},{"Title":"The Spirit-filled Life Bible Discovery Series B21-fearless Faith","review":"Every person... new believer or older, can truly benefit from working on their faith.

Bighorn sheep were rare enough in the Tetons in the late 1960s that park rangers asked us to report back if we encountered them. We saw no evidence of sheep. Thirty five years later my son observes bighorn sheep above him in in a narrow couloir in upper Targhee Canyon, slightly below the pass with Death Canyon. Casually mentioning this sighting to a Teton ranger, he learns that bighorn sheep are now frequently observed.Bighorn sheep are returning to their native North American habitats. The all-time low of 9,000 bighorn sheep in 1960 has been replaced today by an impressive number of 70,000 sheep. Excessive hunting was partly responsible for their decline, but the primary cause had been disease from domestic sheep. Hunting today is well managed; disease can still completely eliminate a small herd.Mountain Monarchs: Bighorn Sheep is an attractive, soft cover, glossy publication by NorthWord Wildlife Series. Beautiful photography is found on nearly every page.The author, Bert Gildart, targets a general audience that shares his enthusiasm for native wildlife. At some points I found his explanations, like the food pyramid, to be too basic. Overall his style remains interesting, especially his personal observations of sheep behavior. He is careful to attribute his facts to specific wildlife biologists and naturalists.Mountain Monarchs: Bighorn Sheep is a good introduction to a remarkable animal. I particularly liked the section on the adaptation of the bighorn sheep to its harsh environment and the descriptions of the incredible battles between males for dominance. I now understand more about interpreting the shape and detailed appearance of the magnificently curved horns of the bighorn sheep. The appendix contains an updated population census for the varieties of wild sheep by state and province."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"It was the first book I read from that author and it certainly will be the last. The plot is almost non-existant, the dialogues are unbelivable specially the ones involving the little girl, no children speaks or thinks like that and, above all, there is the romance, what is it with american female mystery authors? They seem to be unable to write a real thriller, they always have to add these sirupy romances.

Just to think this book had been nestled on my bookshelf for years, as it was a selection in a book club long ago. Shame on me, but it is kind of like finding a lost treasure. There is so much to say about this book as its loaded with suspense, intrigue, strong characters that you will grow to love, bad guys you want to see dead, twists, romance, thrills, but most of all its one you simply can't get away from. Just when you think you can put it down it grabs hold and makes you read on. What a thrill ride from start to finish. If your looking for one of those books you cherish, one that you will remember for a long time, and even one you might pick up again just to read over and enjoy again, well this is the book for you.

I loved the characters, especially Emma, the little girl who is rescued by Ramsey. I was hooked from page one and couldn't put it down. I also love when Coulter uses characters from her other books -- Dillon and Sherlock Savich from The Maze appear in this one, which was a real treat. Great suspense and awesome ending."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I could not be labeled as a &quot;Fan&quot; of Catherine Coulter's after reading this book. It was too different from the rest of her books. Too based around the child. Ms. Coulter, I believe, is an adult romance writer. My preference is for the novel to be centered on the two adults and their romance, not a 'perfect' little girl. I was disappointed that Ms. Coulter would write this and I actually feel sorry for anyone who spends their money on The Target. I honestly believe that they would be better off reading the Bride Series or Legacy Series or perhaps The Cove and The Maze. I am not thrilled that I spent money on this book. I think it is a shame that Ms. Coulter lowered her normally wonderful standards. I must say though, this is the first of her books that has disappointed me."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"This is the first novel I have read by Coulter and look forward to reading some more of hers. If some say this is not one of her best, then the &quot;Cove&quot; and &quot;Maze&quot; must be great. (Those are next on my list.) I thought the plot and characters to be real. I do agree, however, that the resiliance of Emma after all the trama she went through is pretty hard to swallow. No child could be that well adjusted.

He is at a cabin of a friend high in the mountains of Colorado where one morning he finds a little girl who has been seriously abused and battered. He takes her in and takes care of her. But, at the same time he learns about himself and healing.Her mother finds them and eventually she and Ramsey work together to try and figure out why the girl was kidnapped and work through their issues together.Savich and Sherlock do make an appearance with Sherlock being pregnant and having an interesting version of morning sickness.There were some far fetched things that happen in the plot, such as not taking the girl to a hospital and not taking her to get help for a while, as well as them suddenly taking off and traveling together. But overall it was good story with a bunch of twists and turns that kept it interesting."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I just finished the hardback version of this novel (and because it is the only Catherine Coulter book that I have ever read) I thought I would check out what she has going on Amazon. Admitted, I cannot compare it to her other \\"better\\" works, but I must say that I found this book to be very touching. I'm actually very surprised at some of the reviews that I have read of this book.I won't rewrite a synopsis as this has already been done below but I do have several issues in support of this book to point out to other readers.There is a tad of the unbelievable in the fact that Ramsey didn't immediately take the child that he found to a hospital; but that is a sign of our too cynical hearts. The reason that it is unbelievable is because most people would be afraid of the consequences of being blamed for molesting her themselves and would therefore have immediately turned her over to the nearest \\"authorities\\", felt sorry for her and been done with it. But that is not the nature of the \\"hero\\" of this story.What makes this understandable is the fact that Ramsey is a federal judge who knows very well the system that Emma would be going into once he turned her over. As a federal judge he IS one of the \\"authority figures\\" and immediately takes responsibility of a child whose situation has touched his heart. He feels that he is more capable of being sensitive to her situation and caring for her than would male complete strangers in some podunk town in the Rockies. [I don't know about any of you readers - but have you ever had to deal with sheriffs in small rural towns on sensitive sexual issues of rape involving children? Guarantied that most of the people involved would be men, and loud, and insensitive to the fear they inspire in the child just by being men. Just imagine how much more trauma could be caused by this to a child.]Now, you may then bring up the point that as a federal judge he would know about things like destroying bodily evidence from the child when he bathed her, etc. instead of taking her directly to a medical facility. Remember another thing, they were in a very rural, very isolated location with no phone and Ramsey Hunt was in seclusion over what he claimed was the paparazzi chasing him after having to kill some drug dealers in his courtroom. But in reality he is having nightmares, etc. of guilt over having taken a life and doesn't feel good about being considered a hero because he lost it to his anger and killed someone. He was also having feelings of impotence over the fact that because the system was so overcrowded criminals would walk free in too short of a time period anyway. Emma's situation was one he had control over. He felt that he could do a better job than the local authorities who would hurt her feelings and didn't want to turn over the responsibility of her too quickly.As for the comments about him being almost as sickly obsessed with Emma as the pedophile - again I must point to too cynical hearts. Have any of you ever been exposed to a truly caring male? Not a homosexual with feminine tendencies but a heterosexual man with a caring soft heart? I feel sorry for our society if you haven't. I have. I was raised by one. I was married to one. I have uncles and cousins who are just as family oriented and nurturing - who take on half the care of the kids especially if their wife is pregnant again. Who would be just as outraged to their souls by what happened to that child as Ramsey Hunt's character is. Who may be just as deadly and want to take care of it on their own. (my late husband was a professional martial artist)Especially if it's a male Cancerian and Ramsey Hunt's character reads like a male cancerian. A male cancerian would be capable of taking a look at a poor, beautiful, abused baby and adopting her. He'd want to be her father and take her in, want to care for her, \\"mother\\" her in a male fashion, feel responsible and think that no one would be able to do the job as well as he would himself. He'd take over her life and would then extend that love to her mother. (I remember a male friend telling me once that the way some men find their mates is that they see a beautiful child and then want to meet its mother because the woman who produced such beauty had to \\"fine\\" herself.)So he never says \\"I love you\\" to Molly but he does admit, as far as he is capable, that he more than likes her. He comes to appreciate her qualities as a unique person and begins to picture them as a family. He shows her how he feels in his actions towards Emma and Molly. He takes them in and takes them over and nurtures them and lets himself be mothered by the women in his life at the same time. It's typical cancerian.As for Molly, she comes to appreciate him and his strength and his love for her daughter. He's a handsome, caring, successful, strong, man who will care for her and protect her without patronizing or smothering her. What sane woman would pass that up? She doesn't need money she's rich. What she needed he provided. It's a formula for successful marriage more enduring than the raw \\"passion\\" of most romance novels. It's a love story of a family who comes together and of love that grows between them after they have come to appreciate one another, their strengths, and their weaknesses.I found this book to be very touching. It left me with a bittersweet smile on my face for them as a new family and for the road that Emma would have to travel in life in order to be whole again. The mystery surrounding who was really behind the plots, them on the run, and the chase for the child molester, etc. was pretty good and kept the pages turning. Other commentators were right - it wasn't the most suspenseful book that I've read but it was a very good read. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Any other comments I make would be spoilers - and I hate spoilers. So I will leave you with a strong recommendation for this book as I really enjoyed it. The male character is not the typical stubborn, brooding Alpha man but caring and sensitive while still being strong and decisive. I will definitely be looking into more of Catherine Coulter's books. Ciao."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"This book is a little different from Ms. Coulter's usual type of story. It involves the kidnap and brutal attack of a young child, but it was beautifully handled by the author. This story lacked the usual romance, but I guess I must come to grips with the fact that sometimes people marry for reasons besides love. The plotting is top-drawer and the characters are very likeable if not overly realistic. The suspense is intense, and that's what pleases me.Besides, Ms. Coulter is one of the few writers who know the difference between \\"stanch\\" and \\"staunch.\\""},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"This is my favorite type of romance thriller. I like the masculine yet sensitive men( no pun intended). I like the suspense and the way the main characters seem to grow in some depth by the end of the book. I also like the way the author deals with a very serious issue such as sexual abuse of children and shows that there is hope for those unfortunate children who have been victims. I think that ths book was not necessaily completely believable as far as the judge not taking the little girl for medical help right away, but if he had done so the story could not have progressed to the mother and he meeting and forming the tight unit that they became.Then again I don't read these kind of books if I'm looking for a reality check. I only recently started reading Catherine Coulter books. On the whole I must say I like them a lot. The contemporary ones are my favorites; they describe the type of man a woman wants in real life but never truly finds."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"As others have explained, a federal judge hiding out in the woods for some privacy finds a severly abused girl. For eight (count 'em, 8) days - until her mother comes blazing into the book - he nutures her and cares for her himself, without notifying the authorities, without taking her to the hospital, and apparently without any consideration of the fact that somewhere she has a family going crazy with worry. Of course, during this time, he tends her wounds, washing away any physical evidence that she would be carrying of her attacker. This guy is a judge??? Then, when her mother enters the picture, she *thanks* him for keeping her daugher with him. That's the worst kind of hideous fiction that I can imagine. I generally like Catherine Coulter, but I could not even go on with this book after the first 50 pages or so: The beginning bordered on &quot;fantasy&quot; not &quot;fiction.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"After reading The Cove and The Maze, I was anticipating The Target to have Coulter's signature style. There didn't seem to be enough history or depth to each character in this book like her previous books with Lacey Sherlock, James Quinlan and how can we forget Dillon Savich. Judge Ramsey Hunt could have been the hero readers would have &quot;swooned&quot; over, unfortunately there were times when his actions were just too hard to believe! How can a JUDGE discover a child that was physically abused and not go to the authorities? Realizing the child cannot speak was a spark for the beginning of a flame, but that was quenched too early in the book. Coulter tried to incorporate Sherlock and Savich into the cast, but it seemed that by adding them in was an attempt to keep you reading so you wouldn't just put the book down. The plot tried to thicken with &quot;Who could have done it?&quot; unfortunately it came up with TOO many people to point the finger at. There is a GREAT story to read in the pages of The Target, too bad in never manifested itself completely."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I enjoy reading books and watching movies because they take me away from my normal existence, and have the imagination to accept when an author will stretch reality. Unfortunatly, Catherine Coulter took reality and stretched it way past the breaking point. Her description of a six year old girl made me wonder if she has ever met a child, or used Shirley Temple and a six year old Jesus Christ as her model. I got so tired of hearing about her perfection I wanted to pull her braid (mentioned approx. 1,000 times) right out of her head. The Judge and Molly were totally unbelivible. I kept imagineing myself in the same position as the Judge, finding an unconsious six year old girl, sexually abused, unconsious in the forest. Sure, I'll take her and hold her for about a week!"},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I always finish a book once I start but this one was painful. Judge Ramsey was so unbelieveably sickeningly sweet that he made my stomach turn. The child, Emma, was smarter than the adults and the mother, Molly was completely inconsistent. Emma did not behave nor speak like a six year old. It made me wonder about the children the author has been around? What child speaks this way? Molly and Ramsey's love affair? Totally unbelievable and undeveloped...again PUKE! This was my first Coulter novel and I am not sure I want to try another. Reading this one was pure torture for me!"},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"This book was not written very well but the writing seemed sloppy. The plot was strong but the characters weak. I would have liked to see more of Dillon and Savich, who popped up every once in a while, but they were unnecessary to the plot. I think she should have included them better. The Maze was much better but they all can't be winners. This book was a slight disappointment but all in all it still is a pretty good read. I always enjoy a good suspense novel with a little spatter of romance!"},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I, like others here, feel compelled to finish any book I begin, but this is one that makes me seriously rethink that comittment. Others have duly noted the multitude of flaws in the plot, but what really got to me was the insipid dialogue. NO ONE TALKS LIKE THIS! Virtually every time a character opens his or her mouth, what comes out sounds like something that would earn a generous D in a high school creative writing class. I guess I should have been alerted by the &quot;Dear Readers&quot; note on the back cover of the paperback edition. I know this was probably written by someone working for the Publisher, but didn't Coulter have to sign off on something over her signature? When an author tells me her book &quot;will keep me on the edge of my seat,&quot; and promises to I'm not smart enough to solve her &quot;surprise&quot; ending, I should know well enough to keep my wallet in my pocket.

This book, with its unbelievable characters,unrealistic dialogue,poor plot development, and just plain poor writing, was a bestseller? It's frightening, when you think about it. I have definitely overestimated the intelligence of the American reading public.What a sad commentary that such a book can become a bestseller."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio book version of The Target -- which is probably why I finished it. The book did have its good points-- parts WERE entertaining. But overall, I must admit, I got a little sick of the little girl. I mean, when have you ever met a child so perfect--polite all of the time, unselfish all of time, etc.? But to be fair, I must admit, I typically don't like to read about kids. If you do, her &quot;sweetness&quot; might not bother you. Also, I thought the romance between the two adults developed faster than I found believable. Despite those two problems, the book wasn't that bad. I guess if you're a C. Coulter fan, you might like it. But the bottom line is: Would I recommend it to a friend? Sorry, but I'd have to say No."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"While I have read many of Ms. Coulter's books, this one was definitely a stinker. I can't believe anyone who is a discerning reader will find this book well done. Quite frankly, this book did not even strike me as having been written by this author, but rather by someone who wished they could write. It was amateurish in its dialogue, silly in its plot and character development, and just a plain waste of time. I ended up skimming over so much of it, and I was still able to figure out the entire plot by just briefly scanning over every 2-3 pages. I know not every book is a bestseller, but the publisher certainly was trying to pull something over on its readers with this one.

However, Ramsey tires of his sudden notoriety and ultimately retreats to a small town in the Rockies. His hope for rest and relaxation ends when he finds a beat-up, bloody, and sexually abused little girl lying in a meadow. Ramsey takes the unconscious lass back to his cabin where he cleans up her wounds. When the girl awakens she is mute, but instinctively knows that she is safe with Ramsey.A few days later, Emma's mother arrives. She believes Ramsey is a kidnapper and plans to kill him. Miraculously, Emma regains her voice, informing her mother that he is her savior and friend. Molly, observes the bond between her daughter and the judge, and confides in him. The trio retreat to the estate of her father,a criminal kingpin, for protection. However, even there, Emma remains in danger from a sexual maniac who plans to reclaim her for his own perverse pleasures.THE TARGET is romantic suspense the way it is supposed to be written. The book is a taut and chilling ride that never allows the reader to fully relax because around the bend of the next page is more unexpected action. Reading Catherine Coulter's novels is like viewing the artistic works of one of the masters: both are emotional experiences.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I'm in book club hell. A new member picked this monstrosity for her first selection, and now we're stuck suffering through it. (Our rule is that no author is banned from the list until we've read two of the author's books and a minimum 75% majority votes the author out. Which will be no problem with Coulter.) If I had the power to strap our new member down and force her to read GOOD writing so that she could see just how horrible \\"The Target\\" is, I would.Where to begin?The plot is preposterous. The characters are not only cartoonish, they're not even a little bit likable. Federal judge with a murderous, hair-trigger temper who doesn't mind breaking laws and collaborating with the boss of a huge crime ring. Mother of an sexually abused six-year-old who doesn't bother to take her kid to a doctor (can we say NEGLECT?) and spends shockingly little time helping the child cope with what happened. (Gee, I can't WAIT for those two to end up in bed and then falling in love -- I have a feeling that's Coulter's M.O.) A pair of FBI agents who are so inconsistently drawn, they might each have multiple personality disorder.And get this, not only are they all incredibly rich, they're all clairvoyant (just by looking at a trashed house, they know exactly who did the crime, even though the proposed perpetrators have nothing to do with the owner of the house). And they all apparently have superhuman strength and superhuman ability to heal (2\\" deep bullet wound to the leg one minute, running on it the next -- and the character says that 2\\" wound is \\"not bad\\").Coulter shows an utter lack of understanding of:1. What abused children suffer and their recovery process2. How the FBI operates3. How kidnapping cases are handled4. Medical care for bullet wounds (a little antibiotic cream, gauze and adhesive tape? Yeah, that'll work.)5. Organized crime6. How six-year-olds talk7. How ANYbody talks (\\"He will sanction a kill.\\" REALLY?)8. How to deliver back stories (one minute, a character says she spent 3 months out of the year with her dad. On the next PAGE, the same character says her mother wisely moved her to Italy so she could grow up without her father's influence. Um...what about that three months out of the year?)9. How crime scenes are handled by the police10. Travel time from Colorado to California11. I could go on and on, but you get the point.Another thing - Coulter apparently has some deep-seated psychological problems regarding sex. I understand that most, if not all of her books include rape and sexual abuse. In \\"The Target,\\" we're treated to disgusting details of sexual assault of a child. It's not fit to read in something that is supposed to be \\"entertainment.\\" If Coulter thinks that's entertaining, she needs to be locked up in a psych ward herself.Stay far, far away from this book.Oh, no. I just realized we're going to have to read ANOTHER Coulter book to get her banned from the list. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I love all of her books.

I have all the F.B.I. series books and everyone is teriffic."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"Let me start off by saying that the ratings on this book says something. I've seen items where the five stars and four stars well outweigh the lower rankings. On controversial books, the sign of it being effective is a lot of five stars and a lot of one stars, with little in between. While I'm in the largest group (I'm #22 of the five stars), the smallest group (the two stars) has a respectable number.What does this mean? If you are one who relies on reviews to decide whether to get this book, read ALL the reviews. Don't base your decision on just mine unless you happen to be a fan of my reviews and consistently trust my opinion.This is the third Catherine Coulter FBI thriller I've read. It is not Pullitzer prize writing, but it keeps my interest. I like the characters in her books, though for some reason I picture the leading men (Judge Ramsey Hunt here, James Quinlan from \\"The Cove\\", and Miles Kettering from \\"Blindside\\") as all looking the same, and I just realized I see them all looking like Barry Van Dyke (Dick's son) from Diagnosis Murder.This book is more disturbing than the other two I read because of its child molestation story-line. Also, one thing I'll give away is that the molester is a former priest. This is the first Coulter novel I read that does not have a protestant minister as one of the bad guys -- this time it's a former Catholic minister. (I wonder if Coulter has any books where a minister is a good guy, or at least, where none of the villains are connected with Christianity.) Maybe the preachers she knows are all child molesters and child kidnappers and murderers, but most real preachers are nothing like that.Also, this book does have some erotica which I skimmed over, and which is not necessary. Also, there is some cussing which I never consider a positive, though I'll add that it is not pervasive in this book.One thing that cracks me up is the long distance mob battle between Mason Lord and Rule Shaker. With names like that, I wonder if Coulter read Dick Tracy comics or watched James Bond movies for research.In her plot description, she promised a twist at the end that even the best mystery solvers would not expect. I don't consider myself great at solving mysteries, but I successfully guessed what that twist was. Maybe I would have been surprised if she didn't warn me of the twist.This is not a perfect book. Many have pointed out the illogical way the judge acts in the situation, though if he did what he was supposed to there wouldn't have been a story. Having completed a novel, I noticed that Coulter is not always consistent with the point of view. But if you want to entertain yourself, this would work.One other note. The other two books I've read in the series (and I'll add Hemlock Bay, which I started and decided to read later, maybe) had two different stories going on (\\"Blindside\\" had a third little situation unrelated to the other two); this one focuses on the main story.I will conclude by saying that I do like the way the book ends."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"The first part of the book is thrilling and page turning. The way Judge Ramsey found Emma. The way Molly found Judge Ramsey. Everything will keep you in the book. But the last hundred pages or so she really misses the plot. You'd ask yourself where's the plot? You'll read about a propousal, Ireland, a wedding, and many more stories that shouldn't been there. And as nigh all of her books, the end is a fairy tale that nobody'll believe. There are better books than this one."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"This is the first Catherince Coulter novel I've read in a few years and I was really disappointed. There's a decent story in here...it's just 3/4 drafts from being finished. A lot of the dialogue felt awkward and unnatural to the point of taking me completely out of the story. Some pages really seemed amateurish.Many of the characters' actions seemed completely illogical especially given that some of them are supposed to be highly educated and experienced law officials. The bad dialogue and strangeness of their actions really kept me from getting interested in the characters. I also noticed one big inconsistancy that should have been caught in basic editing.This really felt like the work of a first time author instead of one with many novels under her belt. If it had been the first Catherine Coulter novel I'd read I really doubt I'd have read another. I'd reccomend skipping this one and reading &quot;The Sherbrooke Bride&quot; which I'm going to reread and hopefully remind myself why I liked this author."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"This story was all right.I didn't find it gripping as I do some other romantic suspense books that I've read.I was able to figure out who was behind the kidnappings etc about a third of the way through the book but wasn't sure as to why. I found the romance between Ramsey and Molly a little bit forced towards the end of the book.Not enough chemistry and build up between them.Also most as if the romance was an after thought.I think the storyline was good but could have been put together better.I'll try one of her novels again because all authors write books that aren't always at their best."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I actually finished reading this book, although I had put it down for over a week.

Many of the characters are just not believable and the conversations tend to be flat--no pizazz.Coultur seems to have fallen into the same trap other writers have--get a few great novels going (Maze,Cove) and the editors stop doing their job as they figure the book will sell anyway.Get another editor Catherine and please stop making referencesabout body parts, i.e. &quot;down to their toes.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I'm a big fan of Ms. Coulter, so I looked forward to reading this book. It was a very interesting read and definitely kept my attention. I loved the relationship between the heroe and the little girl and found their ability to work as a team and trust one another interesting. The eventual, father child relationship was the evolvement of a friendship formed out of tragedy which becomes something very precious. That being said, I think the wonderfully evolving relationship of our protaganist and the child was very well developed, but it seems that it was at the expense of developing the relationship between the heroe and the child's mother. I don't quite believe (based on the way the relationship between them is developed)that this is a real love match. By the end of the book, although it was clear that they were in love, the relationship was never fully developed enough for me to reach that conclusion on my own. The other problem I had with the book were the number of subplots. It did become a little confusing and the tie-ins at the end were not always plausible. I did enjoy the well placed humour between the two and would definitely recommend the book to others. While it's not as good as Ms. Coulter's best books, it's still a Coulter book, which makes it pretty darn good."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I have enjoyed ms. coulter's contemporary works in the past, but this one sounded as if some of her helpers wrote the book. The dialogue was amateurish, the plot poorly paced, and skimming every other right-handed page more than allowed the reader to figure out what was taking place."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I have read the comments from a lot of readers and I have to agree with the ones that disliked this book. This is the first time that I have read something by this author, and believe me it will be the last. The characters were unbelievable, ever changing, etc. There just seemed to be too much focus on dumb things, for example the girl's braid, I don't know how many times it was mentioned, give me a break! I kept on going just because the author promised that you would not be able to guess who was the bad guy. Turns that I did, about halfway throughout the book. I could not believe the end! Did she get bored too?"},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"This was a frustrating book to read! It started with a good basic story line, and a likeable main character (Judge Hunt). The dialogue was strong and moved the story along - BUT the characters and happenings were trite, stereotyped, and totally unbelievable! Judge Hunt discovers an brutally injured child unconscious in a forest, obviously beaten and sexually molested...and he does NOT rush her to qualified medical help. This is a BIG leap to try to believe - which of us would consider ourselves qualified to treat a small child in this shape? After several days (of dodging the &quot;bad guys&quot;), he is accosted by the child's mother (Molly), who believes he is the kidnapper. Now, not only has she found her child single-handedly in this random location, she turns out to be the ex-wife of a famous rock star, as well as the daughter of a big-time Crime Lord! Lo, and behold, as this threesome tries to outwit the bad guys and figure out &quot;whodunit&quot; (I ended up not knowing, and not caring by the finish) they have some far flung adventures (from Las Vegas to Ireland). Savich and Sherlock (from Coulter's previous novel) flit in and out, contributing little other than to exchange witty repartee with the Judge. As the net tightens, another huge leap is required to believe that Judge Hunter (previously extolled as a paragon of virtue) suddenly tolerates (welcomes?) a relationship with Molly's father, the Crime Lord! Help! The book is loaded with undeveloped characters popping in and out, and dangling story lines that you wished were developed! And finally, the story is saddled with an unsavory, unbelievable villain. Yet through it all, it was impossible not to wish it was more believable - the touch of magic often found in Coulter's books was just under the surface, ready to pop out. I read it to the end, still wanting to like it more than I did!"},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"Just call me gulible. I read other reviews that termed the plot unbelieveable and simplistic. But I read this book. I found it believeable. And I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"Most of Catherine Coulter's stories are good. Not The Target. This one starts off with the main character, a judge, deciding to secretly keep and care for a kidnapped child he found in the woods. He can't stand the idea of anyone else trying to care for her - including her parents. His reasoning is frightening, to the point that I wished he would have been arrested for his illegal acts, including kidnapping and washing down a rape victim. Sorry, Catherine. This one was really off Target."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I loved this book!!! This is a book that you can read over and over and never get tired of it! It was sooooo good!

Definitely a great read!"},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I thought, a judge finds a sexually abused girl in the woods and calls no one? I must be missing something. So I read on. It got no better. This was such a poorly conceived book, I couldn't make it past the halfway point of the story."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I have read several of the reviews and everyone has their own thoughts but I liked the book but not as much as The Maze. I think I liked the humor and romance between Sherlock and Savage more than the characters in The Target. One Reviewer talked about Ramsey being obsessed with Emma and even said he touched her too much and etc. I didn't see that. He saw her at the worse time right after she had been beaten and abused by this horrible person. I thought he handled it well, gaining her trust and protecting her. If police and therapists had been brought into it at the beginning, she would probably have been more terrified. Ramsey and Molly did seek professional help later. I thought the author's idea for Ramsey was a sensitive caring man and he was devastated by the ordeal of Emma. He indeed did love her and was protective of this little girl who had been wonded physically and mentally. I think Ramsey did love Molly but the author leaves you thinking he marries her just to get Emma, but still think he was in love with her and she him. I have noticed in Catherine Coulter books, she seldom has the romantic characters say \\"I love you\\". I kept looking for it in \\"The Maze\\" and believe I saw it once from Sherlock. The characters have other ways of dipicting they love the other person but kept wondering why they doen't just say it. Interesting! If I had a problem with the book was a Federal Judge being able to accept the Crime Lord's way of killing and getting away with it. I'm sure that is the way of real life but I had a hard time dealing with that. However, I found the book a \\"Thriller\\" and kept my attention from the beginning to the end."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"This is third of the FBI Series with Savich and Sherlock. It's really about Ramsey Hunt a Judge from San Francisco that finds a little girl (Emma) in the Rockies in Colorado. He takes care of the injured girl and becomes very attached to her. After Molly the mother shows up, she and Ramsey join forces to keep Emma safe. It is a very exciting thriller that you won't put down until you have read it completely."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"This book kept my interest from the first page thru to the end. The characters are very human and easily identified with. Their courage is beyond-the-call. At no point did the story drag. It shows you how people can come to care for and love children not of their own blood. The story is intriguing and moves along at a nice pace. I am looking forward to reading additional Catherine Coulter novels. I love her style."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"Great read! The hero is handsome, of course, and the little girl is delightful and brave. You will be happy for them when the child is reunited with her mom and you'll cheer for them with each victory they achieve. Follow them back and forth across the U.S. and abroad as they try to get away from the bad guys."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"This book was well above average in suspense twists and turns.

The plot was unrealistic in so many areas, but I might have been able to suspend disbelief if the dialogue would have been better. Six year old children, even advanced child proteges, simply do not converse like Emma, especially after the trauma she endured in this novel."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"You don't need to read this series in order; however, after I read TailSpin, I went back and started at the beginning. The Target was a great read."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"This is a great book! Both exciting, suspenseful, and emotional. The mystery of the kidnapping, subsequent escape, and ensuing chase of the six-year-old Emma, along with her mother Molly and Judge Ramsey Hunt, doesn't disappoint. The building romance between Molly and Ramsey nicely compliments the focus of the plot, and the interactions between Ramsey and Emma are wonderful to read. Emma herself is priceless, and Molly and Ramsey are both appealing, intriguing and complex characters, who compliment both the plot and each other. As the plot continues and all three characters come together, they form interconnected relationships that will have you rooting for them both as separate characters and as a unit. This is definitely not one to be missed! This book has a bit of everything: suspense, excitement, meaningful relationships (both of the romantic and non-romantic variety), not to mention the continuation of the Sherlock/Savich story! Readers will delight in the story, rage against the bad guys, and never stop rooting for Emma, Ramsey, and Molly!For more on these characters (specifically Ramsey, Molly and Emma), see Coulter's 16th FBI thriller:Backfire, which is set five years after the Target, and involves some old faces (including Ramsey, Molly, and Emma) as well as some new ones in Coulter's latest FBI suspense."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I actually stopped reading this book, when I realized this little girl had really been molested, and I could not make it unhappen. My reaction was: &quot;I why would Ms. C put her through that&quot;? Then I started reading again. Why? I realized I was reacting like these were real people. The actions of the people continued to anger and baffle me. In the real world, people do things for idiotic reasons and things get out of hand. Going well beyond the comprehensible. I was slightly disappointed at the lack of romance, but felt anything more &quot;grand passionish&quot; would have been absurb for such tramatized people. After all Ramsey's first love was that sweet mute little girl(I felt his tenderness and treatment were so PERFECT)."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"This book is truly unbelievable. None of the characters are even remotely realistic. A federal judge who finds a child in the woods, beaten and sexually abused, and DOESN'T involve the feds or even the cops? In fact, he &quot;kidnaps&quot; the girl himself. A six year old child who is smarter than an adult? Some of the responses this child made to questions or situations that arose made me shake my head and wonder if Catherine Coulter could possibly have any children of her own. How about a mom who singlehandedly rescues the child and confronts the &quot;kidnapper&quot; all alone? How about a rock singer father who just happens to stop existing as soon as the story needs him to? How about a maternal grandfather who....I could go on and on, but it's not worth it. In fact, this book was so ridiculous I didn't finish the last chapter. A total waste of money and time."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I listened to this book during a long road trip. I loved it! In fact, I started it about 3 hours into my return trip (12-14 hour drive). I wasn't done with it by the time I returned. For the next three days I found myself driving around so I could finish my book. I was surprised to see that it got such bad reviews by the reading public. I like books where I am a bit uncertain how the characters will react to new situations and where I am equally as uncertain about what is going to happen next. Although some of the events themselves were predictable, how they came about was not. I like that. I encourage those who decided against this book to consider listening to it on their next road trip. I listened to the unabridge version. The only drawback was that the book was recorded on all tracks individually (you had to listen to each side twice but switching the speakers to either right or left depending on where you were in the book). As far as a child acting like an adult. When something like that happens to you at that age, unless you live the rest your life scared of every person and every thing you have no choice but to grow up fast when it comes to coping with a horrific incidents such as being raped and abuse when you were child. It's inevitable that the newfound maturity will spill out into other aspects of the child's life. I think the author handled it well by not explaining the process of how Emma coped but by setting up the environment in which her healing took place,just letting the healing happen and manifesting those changes in Emma's actions and conversations throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"GOOD PART ABOUT THE BOOK:It was interesting, good plot and it went on a fast pace.BAD PART ABOUT THE BOOK:There was no suspense. Coulter laid down the story in a straight-forward way and it didn't let you think and worry what's going to happen. The character's dialogue is too blunt and there's no secrecy in the book and one thing I really hated was how the characters had to state their feelings instead of the reader &quot;feel&quot; what the characters felt. Another thing was that the dialogue was really blunt and everything just came out of the mouths of the character. If they were feeling a certain way, they would just say it and I don't think that, that would have made a good suspense because it's like popping the balloon before it has even been blown.I really hope that Coulter could improve her writing style because although her ideas are really interesting, Coulter doesn't do the ideas justice with her straight forwardness."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"Remember Dillion and, his new wife, Sherlock?

The famous &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; ended up living up to his reputation even there though. While cutting logs he hears something out of the ordinary and finds six year old, Emma, unconscience in the woods. It was obvious she had been beaten and sexually abused. It took his almost a week to gain her trust. Emma did not speak a word until her mother, Molly Santera, came through the door with gun in hand to save her daughter.Emma had been kidnapped near her backyard when Molly had taken her eyes off Emma for less than five seconds to snap a photo. However, the ransom did not come until after she had Emma back. Her ex-husband was over seas giving a concert tour and could care less. Molly's father was all, but called, The Godfather. Everyone had to put their differences aside and their heads together to keep Ramsey, Molly, and Emma alive until the leader of the conspiracy was caught.***Highly recommended as a thriller with many curves.***"},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I haven't read the two preceding books, but I sincerely hope that they are better than this one. I'd like to think that a federal judge would have better sense than to keep an obviously raped 6 year old in the woods for a week \\"until she learns to trust him.\\" Meanwhile, her poor mother is searching town after town with no indication from him that she is even alive. I feel very doubtful that said mother, on discovery of the man with her suddenly verbal child, would say to him, \\"I would have done the same thing in your shoes.\\" Even knowing that he wasn't the original kidnapper, I'm pretty sure I would have sent my daughter out of the room and shot him anyway.No thanks to Ramsey, the kid hasn't died from internal injuries, and now that the mother (who is far, far more clever than every incompetent law enforcement agent in Colorado) followed the only solid lead that the police \\"blew off\\" and is back with her daughter, I think I'll leave them to go on the run without me.Lazy writing -- it wouldn't have been hard to create a situation where Ramsey and the child together made sense."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"The story took a turn for the worse after Molly showed up. It was just a little unbelievable (and slightly creepy) that the man was so hung up on this little girl and basically he wants to marry, not because he's in love with the mother, but because he wants to be the child's father."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I am just getting acquainted with Catherine Coulter's FBI Series and I am not dissappointed. I couldn't put this book down for a minute. Never a dull moment. If you get the chance listen to the audiobook unabridged version & read while listening and you will enjoy it even more.

While Savich and Sherlock didn't have a major presence in this installment, the main characters more than adequately filled that space.The relationship between Ramsey and the child he discovers is touching and it was written in a way that had you experiencing its development rather naturally. The suspense surrounding her story unfolded at the right pace and I couldn't put the book down.This story stands on its own but I appreciated having read the previous two. No matter where you come into this series, Target is a must read."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I am a huge Coulter fan and have read everything that she has written. But, I found this book deeply disturbing. A child is raped and then rescued by a federal judge who is as obsessed with her as the rapist. He marries the mother, as she knows (never telling her \\"I love you\\"), to have legal rights to her daughter. He takes care of the daughter, washing her, braiding her hair, always holding her, always hugging her,etc. never letting her out of his sight. His behavior is almost pedophilic. There is something very wrong in this unhealthy behavior. I am surprised at Cathreine Coulter. Also, Savich and Sherlock, her two star FBI agents from the series, barely make an appearance in the book and it could have been written entirely without them. It seemed as though she included them just so that the publishers would sell it."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"I seem to be one of the few that enjoyed The Target. Finally, someone can write about child abduction and molestation without it being so real and disturbing. The subject is touched on non-graphically and is the core of the story.

Not Coulter's best but not as bad as other reviewers claim it is!"},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"Catherine Coulter is a decent writer, so even though I dislike a heavy presence of children in my novels, I could still finish the tapes. But I wouldn't have bought it if I had known that this little girl was in almost EVERY sentence. I don't know much about kids, but I have never seen anything close to this one.

Sometimes I wasn't even sure who was speaking or what they were talking about. The storyline started out good but got lost in unbelievable situations. The characters were likeable but lacked depth and history. I was very sorry I spent 18.00 on this book and will read several critical reviews before I buy another contemporary suspense novel by Coulter. The Cove and The Maze were much better. She should stick to historical romance-she's much better at it."},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"This book was a wonderful suspence story. And the tenderhearted judge is the kind of man I dream of meeting.. one with character and understanding and intelligence. Ramsey refuses to let evil win, no matter the cost to him. His protection and care of a little girl that was in desparate need was heartwarming. This book was more suspence than romance, but it had heart and feeling. I have read hundreds of romance novels, and I find that I like the ones that veer from the normal. It keeps me interested. Ramsey, Molly and Emma are now my friends for life. I'll read this book over and over. I bought the hardback addition, then gave it to a friend after I had read it, and I bought it again in paperback. Guess I liked it pretty well huh?"},{"Title":"The Target (FBI SERIES)","review":"It has been several years since I read this in hardcover edition but I have always thought it was one of Coulter's best. I'll admit it is not as suspenseful as The Maze but then what book is.

The date is January 10, 1929 and in Brussels the intrepid young reporter for &quot;Le Petit Vingti&egrave;me&quot; Tintin and his dog Milou board a train for Moscow. There Tintin spends his time denouncing the methods of the Communist Party and then avoiding attempts by the Soviet secret police to silence him for his views. By the time Tintin makes it back home word of his exploits has arrived ahead of him and he is greeted as a hero.Today &quot;Tintin au Pays des Soviets&quot; constitutes something of a false start for Herg&eacute;'s series. The seven volume collection of the Three-in-One series of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin,&quot; which is probably the most common way for today's readers to get a hold of the Tintin stories, begins with the third adventures, &quot;Tintin Au America.&quot; Both this story and &quot;Tintin Au Congo&quot; are left out of the &quot;official&quot; canon, the former because of the suspect ideology and the latter because of the implicit racism. What emerges in the other eighteen Tintin tales is more pure storytelling that takes place in a created world that bears only an allegorical relationship to the real world. Besides, Tintin does not even have his trademark tuft of hair at this point.Consequently, Tintin fans who track down the first couple of adventures will need to take both tales with a grain of salt. Whereas the other stories tend to stand on their own, the first two are clearly dated. &quot;Tintin au Pays des Soviets&quot; especially requires commentary or annotation that reveals exactly what was going on in the Soviet Union in the late 1920s that Herg&eacute; and the left found necessary to attack, even in a comic book adventure. I know that Herg&eacute; was working for &quot;Le Petit Vingti&egrave;me,&quot; an anti-Communist church-run newspaper, but I also know that he also apologized for this book later in life because he had never actually visited the Soviet Union and had based his story on one book, which was apparently written for propaganda purposes.Consequently, it is fairly safe to say that this particular Tintin adventure is really not intended for children until they are old enough to understand the politics of the time in which it was written. It might be ironic that you should read the first couple of Tintin adventures after you have read the other eighteen, but that is probably the best way to proceed."},{"Title":"Tintin au pays des Soviets (Fac-simil, 1930) (French Edition)","review":"Amazing how, in 1929, a comic book could reveal more truth about Bolshevik Russia, than all the hypocritical and cruel academics of the world could.While the Western fellow travelers of the Soviet tyranny, where presenting the Soviet Union, as a utopian brave new world, Herge reveled the true hell on earth that it was (and that all Marxist-Leninist regimes have been since), through this amazing adventure, and the true villainy of the Communists and their Western backers.Who knows how the immoral leftist academics are deceiving us today.Moral clarity and simplicity is needed more than ever today, as the Judeo-Christian world, and our great Western civilization , is threatened by evil forces today, in new guises, and much of the intellectual and media establishment turns it around and condemns those who are fighting to sustain freedom while sanitizes devils.And anyway , it is a great Tinitn adventure , vital to everyone's Tintin collection."},{"Title":"Bamboo","review":"Beautifully written!

And the challenges of the odyssey Paul Stein faces kept me rooting for his success. I was captured by the romantic idealism of this odyssey and recommend it as an exotic get-away!"},{"Title":"Bamboo","review":"Set within the verdant Philippine Islands, Bamboo's narrative weaves a compelling tale of choices made and paths chosen at life's critical crossroads.Protagonist Paul Stein, a sailor stationed at Subic Bay in 1963, falls in love with Maria, a bar girl from one of the many sordid establishments that cling for survival on the outskirts of American military bases. When he marries her without U.S. Navy sanction, he is court-martialed and thrust on an uncertain jungle path and entwined in the violence of Marcos regime politics, desperate communist terrorism, and racial tension.He and Maria are buffeted by the outside world and their own divergent needs. They are of different worlds, and the path they follow soon forks. Crossroads come. Critical decisions are made. Soon, Paul learns that to survive he must be as Bamboo, resilient, strong, able to bend before the typhoon's onslaught. The opening pages set within the darkness of military prison foreshadow that this book will not be a casual read. Author David Namerow's characterizations are deserving of deeper reflection. While few may ever be in the same situation as Paul and Maria Stein, their characterizations and the choices they must face will resonate with any reader.The country itself is as much a character in Bamboo as the sensitively portrayed key players. The Philippines cannot readily be defined as a single nation. The region is more a confluence of many different peoples, thousands of islands sprawled across the seas, innumerable dialects and disparate customs all leading to political and social fragmentation. Bamboo takes us into this world, sensuous and dangerous, allowing just a glimpse of its bewildering and explosive dynamics. Within this context and the current reality of today's turbulent tensions in the steaming Philippine Islands, Bamboo is a tale that is both timely and evocative. Namerow's reverence and sensitivity for the Filipino people and their swiftly vanishing symbiosis with their native jungle islands is influenced surely by his own experiences as an American expatriate living in the Philippine Islands for 14 years. His deep knowledge and experience in that paradoxical and paradisiacal land enables him to warmly create a setting that compels a visceral response on the part of the reader.Bamboo is much more than a book of island turmoil, passion and adventure. It is a tale that will resonate deeply as each of us comes upon our own crossroads on a path that can be as circuitous and perilsome as a mired jungle."},{"Title":"Bamboo","review":"Simply brilliant!!!

Wow. What a wild ride. I will have to check out other works by this author."},{"Title":"Bamboo","review":"I read this book (June 2011) in a hotel on Subic Bay while entrenched in a rainstorm. For anyone who has ever (or has never) been to Subic or the Philippines, this is a must read. Totally real, this book brought back many memories of life in the Philippines. He has masterfully described a period in U.S. Navy history that those who have experienced, never forget. The story was very intriguing and I could easily experience the sights and smells of Olongapo."},{"Title":"Bamboo","review":"A tasty treat for those interested in stuff off the beaten path. If you're tired of the usual narrative boiler plate, head for the luxuriant settings of Paul Stein's odyssey. Where's Namerow's next?"},{"Title":"Bamboo","review":"David Namerow has penned a memorable work which sticks in the mind like a dart in a bullseye. It is a poignant novel about Paul Stein, a young man destined to face the realities of a world he fell into without having at his disposal all of the cultural equipment necessary to comfortably negotiate a traditional adjustment. Without compromising the plot details, let it be said that the narrative moves quickly, the characters are etched with consummate skill, and the quality of the prose rivals (in more than one passage) the best Hemmingway ever wrote. Paul's interaction with Ellie, the Atea, is an absolutely brilliant portrait of the mind of a truly \\"noble savage.\\" Beyond this , the novel encompasses unforgettable accounts of passion and revenge which can only be appreciated by reading them in Mr. Namerow's inimatible style.This is a book worth reading, not only for its literary merit, but for its capacity to touch the universal spirit of all people who strive to dig into life with the hope of salvaging its treasures. Paul Stein is not perfect, and those he embraces in the novel reflect the consequences of their compatibility with his character in ways which sometimes prove to have dire consequences in their own lives.BAMBOO is a book which will delight anyone interested in multicultural literature. Within the scope of its 282 pages,the author achieves a saga of near epic proportions filled with action, intrigue, and romance. More importantly, this is a work which needs to be read because of the quality of its craft. David Namerow demonstrates, in this book, an unusual facility in capturing the Phillipino mentality in terms congenial to those who otherwise might overlook its import. BAMBOO is a work that offers a \\"multicultural bridge\\" worthy of repeated traverse to anyone interested in understanding elements which unify a grasp of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Bamboo","review":"I could not put BAMBOO down.

There is a mistake here or there, but that's the way it is with any book. Anotheradvantage is that in the Tregelles translation, you get 2 scholars for the price of 1. Tregellesfrequently puts in notes that further clarify the meaning.Also, Gesenius was not a friend of Christianity & his entries often show his bias, as withpassages in the Hebrew that are prophecies of Christ. For examples, see Strong numbers 433,1288, 3068, 5959. Tregelles leaves the Gensenius entries intact, but corrects him in the [...]comments. One of his usual lines is \\"the authority of the New Testament decides the matter\\".I think this is helpful for a \\"beginner\\" in the faith. One drawback to this lexicon is theGenenius entries don't exactly coincide with the Strong's system, so in the back pages some ofthe words are out of order.

Even though some of its information is proven out of date, due to new discoveries and further study of ancient Semitic languages (and I speak specifically of the misunderstanding of the Pi'el verb family and the incorrect rules of verb subordination, which ALL beginning Hebrew grammars are VERY wrong about!), this is still a necessary text. THe amount of information is positively vast and accurate oveall.The same can be said of the lexicon, for which one reviewer gave 1 star because it did not have more recent Ugaritic information. Such lack regarding Ugaritic in no way diminishes the need for this reference.Simply put, the lexicon is still amazing, and amazingly accurate and vast in its information, and no Hebrew scholar, of lay or degreed status, would use only one reference.For instance, I use Genesius, Wilson, and Waltke & O'Connor, Vine, L. (the yellow dictionary), Richter, Allen Smith, Geoffrey Morrison, Strong's, to name a few, and four Hebrew traditions not to mention those underlying the LXX and the DSS. And as up-to-date as W & O's Syntax text is, it comes up just a little short in it's final understanding of verb subordination. We need these works, even with their occasional shortcomings. Just understand their place in the history of Hebrew study and work around it.Buy this if you can find one."},{"Title":"Gesenius' Hebrew and Chaldee lexicon to the Old Testament scriptures","review":"This edition of Gesenius' lexicon is utterly out of date. It is a straight reprint of the 1847 edition, written before the decipherment of Babylonian and Assyrian and before the vast amount of work that went into comparative linguistics in the second half on the nineteenth century. Gesenius still has a place, but only in the later, much improved edition of Brown, Driver and Briggs (BDB) published half a century later byOxford University Pressand now also available in a cheaper if flimsier edition byHendrickson Publishers, or in the later German editions. The Hendrickson edition is useful if you use Strong's Concordance as the numbers have been inserted into the slightly expanded margins. The Oxford edition, however, has been corrected more recently and should be slightly more accurate.For academic use, however, the latest edition of Koehler and Baumgartner's five-volumeThe Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament (HALOT)is the standard reference (there is a much cheaper two-volumeStudy Edition). But the best lexicon to start with is probably Holladay'sA Concise Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testamentwhich is based on the first edition of Koehler and Baumgartner, and which is both affordable and usable.The biggest immediate difference between BDB and HALOT (or Holladay) is that BDB is in n root order, which makes it a much more difficult for beginners to find words but which allows a more experienced reader to see how words are related to one another."},{"Title":"Gesenius' Hebrew and Chaldee lexicon to the Old Testament scriptures","review":"Why a lexicon? &quot;In the beginning was the WORD.&quot; Word usage is enormously helpful to Biblical understanding.

Surveying the mound of cups in the trashcan near her desk she realized that if she subsituted a travel mug for her styrofoam cup she would save the landfill 72 hundred styrofoam cups over a twenty year period! She realized that simple changes can make a big difference. If we all make small changes we can make a tremendous impact.The Urbanska's cover money, time, work, child rearing, community and more. They make suggestions to enrich your life and simplify. For transportation for example they recommend choosing ways to travel that do not involve air transportation because though only .5 percent of the total distance people travel each year is done by air, planes take up 5 percent of transportation energy. They recommend carpooling, observing the speed limit, checking the air pressure in your tires to promote fuel efficiency and other simple changes to help our environment and our life.Though I agreed with many of the authors suggestions a few I felt were off base. For example they recommend you limit yourself to one credit card. If you can't manage your credit perhaps you should only have one or none for that matter. But most people need more than one to establish a good credit rating. If you only have one card you will not get the best rates for a mortgage as one card does not show you can handle credit. In addition, its good to have more than one card so you have a back up. When we traveled to Mexico, our credit company would not approve a charge we made for a once in a lifetime swim with the dolphins because of possible fraud. We were unable to contact them to get the charge approved. Fortunately we had another card to use. When we were in New Orleans and my purse was snatched one card was left in the room and good thing because the other card had to be canceled due to its theft. What would we have paid for the room with? But as I mentioned earlier the main reason for more than one card is to establish good credit and get the best possible rates.The Urbanskis also urge you to buy used goods like clothing. They suggest doing this because once you have purchased an item it decreases in value by 20%. Let me say that regardless of depreciation if I find a wonderful outfit that looks and feels good and is within my budget, its worth every cent. I would rather have one fine quality garment from Nordstroms or Neimans purchased to fit me and look good on me than a ton of thrift shop items. (And I am not referring to the upscale thrifts with the slightly worn clothing) I am referring to the thrifts where Frank Urbanski buys jeans that dont stay zipped in order to save a buck (ok ok he didnt realize they didnt stay zipped). Buy less but buy the best.Ditto on the avoid status purchases. Though some status purchases are just plain silly. There is often a reason why a product has status. Because its quality and well made. The Urbanskis question why someone would buy a status item giving Coach as an example. Well I will tell you why. I bought a black leather Coach pocket book for around $160. It was a beautiful black soft leather. It looked good. It felt good. I toted that pocketbook around for 13 years! Thats about $12 per year or $1 a month. My sister bought several pocketbooks each year! Why because they fell apart or stopped looking fashionable. But she refused to pay for a good one. She spent way more than I did and the bag on her arm didnt look anywhere near as good.Bottomline buy cheap and weep. When my husband and I married we decided to buy the best we could afford and if we couldnt we did without. We have used that rule ever since. As a result the things we have last years and look wonderful and we enjoy them!So I do think the Urbanskis miss the mark on certain things. But the concept of doing more with less and making small changes is a powerful one that should be heard. So kudos to the Urbanskis for sharing their thoughts and Wanda I would give you my old Coach so you could avoid buying a new pocketbook but I sold it at a yard sale. The lady bought it because she said \\"It was a Coach and they are known for their fine quality!\\"Lee Mellott"},{"Title":"Nothing's Too Small to Make a Difference","review":"Another very good book from this couple, who abandoned hectic city life to run their family's apple orchard in the mountains.They discovered the joys of living on less, living closer to the earth, doing good for the environment, etc.In addition to the usual simplifying tips, this book discusses their 6 year old son, and how they are imparting the simple way of life to him - in spite of the materialism that surrounds his impressionable brain."},{"Title":"Everything I Know About Monsters : A Collection of Made-up Facts, Educated Guesses, and Silly Pictures about Creatures of Creepiness","review":"Even though Tom Lichtenheld tells the reader on the first page of this book, in no uncertain terms, that there really are no such things as monsters... &quot;No monsters, ever, nowhere, nohow&quot;, he also makes it clear that &quot;monsters DO exist in our imaginations.&quot; And since he's considered an expert storyteller with an oversized, vivid imagination, he's done us the honor of writing the quintessential book using made-up facts and best guesses about monsters.

And that's a very good thing. There is much to like in this collection that Cadigan has cobbled together. It gathers the pivotal authors of the genre and shows off just how diverse the stories can be. No, not every cyberpunk narrative takes place in a gritty urban setting with characters in black pvc and technology that looks like it fell off a stealth bomber. Here are a few of the highlights:Alfred Bester, \\"Fondly Farenheit\\"--an android and a dialogue between ego and superego? You make the call. A prototype for the genre that would be cyberpunk.Philip K. Dick, \\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\\"--are memories as good as the real thing? This is a great entry by the legendary man of ideas that has none of the action movie tropes of its film version, Total Recall. Sorry Bernard, no Michael Ironside.Rudy Rucker, \\"57th Franz Kafka\\"--a new take on The Metamorphosis. Disturbing and inscrutable, but did you expect anything else from Rucker?William Gibson, \\"Burning Chrome\\"--fine work by the Master, a story of a cyberspace double-cross. Gibson could probably make a tuna salad recipe sound like science fiction.Greg Bear, \\"Blood Music\\"--could be one of the more realistic of the collection. The time for this kind of nano-enhancement is upon us.Lewis Shriner, \\"Till Human Voices Wake Us\\"--for me, this entry strays rather far afield from cyberpunk and enters the realm of biotech. But that's okay, it adds to the diversity of the collection.John Shirley, \\"Freezone\\"--not much of a plot here, just Shirley taking us on a punky meandering through a dystopic future. And I loved it.William Gibson and Michael Swanwick, \\"Dogfight\\"--twisty.Bruce Sterling, \\"Green Days in Brunei\\"--probably my favorite and the most satisfying of the pieces. Strong and endearing characters. A world not too far removed from our own. A nice tale for illustrating the rise of the \\"developing world.\\"If I have any overall criticism of the stories, it has to do with style. Except for Gibson and Sterling, none of these writers compose with any thought to description. They just lay everything out there, violating that cardinal rule of literary writing, \\"show, don't tell.\\" As I've grown sick of that phrase, I'm actually kind of ok with the so-called \\"transgression.\\" But then I read the work of Gibson and his descriptions and phrasing absolutely blow me away, making the other stories look like amateur hour. Character development is another issue. Except for Bruce Sterling, the authors spend maybe a page on it. With protagonists so thin, it's difficult to cultivate much of an attachment to them, so you better hope the scientific principle that is being explored keeps you hanging on.Oh and why Neal Stephenson wasn't included is beyond me. Maybe he's never written in the short form before. I don't know.All in all, Ultimate Cyberpunk makes for fine reading. Plus, you get an 11-page insert of a \\"lost\\" comic book version of William Gibson's classic, Neuromancer. I've heard there is a film adaptation on the horizon. Let's hope not. The book is amazing but I just don't think it translates well to other media if this comic is any indication."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Cyberpunk","review":"I'm not sure why Pat Cadigan decided to edit yet another short story collection of cyberpunk and proto-cyberpunk. It certainly doesn't quite live up to the excellent literary quality found in the definitive collection \\"Mirrorshades\\" edited by Bruce Sterling or in William Gibson's \\"Burning Chrome\\" (Cadigan's collection reprints two stories from that volume, most notably the title story itself.). Nor does it try to explain exactly what the cyberpunk movement is or the origins behind it (For that, you should start with Larry McCaffrey's excellent edited volume of essays and short fiction, \\"Storming the Reality Studio\\".). But to her credit, she offers excellent fiction from the usual suspects, most notably Gibson, Sterling, Shirley and of course, herself. Notably absent is excellent short fiction from the likes of James Patrick Kelly, Neal Stephenson, Tom Maddox, or excerpts from the late George Alec Effinger's last notable body of work, a cyberpunk saga set in a politically resurgent Islamic Middle East. If you're interested in seeing some familiar examples of short cyberpunk fiction, then buy Cadigan's book. Otherwise, you're better off sticking with Sterling's anthologies and of course, Gibson's \\"Burning Chrome\\"."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Cyberpunk","review":"I thought about titling this review \\"Nothing New Here,\\" but soon realized that I'd spend too much time defending the word choice. Of course there's nothing new in the book, it's an anthology. What I mean is that there is nothing to be gained from this book that cannot be gained from mirrorshades or any other Cyberpunk fiction collections that were released during the height of the movement in the mid to late 1980s.My original review of the book mysteriously vanished. Here it is, resubmitted in hopes that it will remain this time.-----------Pat Cadigan has developed a respectably lengthy body of work in the science fiction genre. She gained fame through her association with the Cyberpunk literary Movement of the 1980s and early 1990s. Despite her obvious involvement, she writes in her introduction to The Ultimate Cyberpunk that she is simply an \\"end-user\\" of the genre. This statement does little other than to nullify her authoritative claim in regard to selecting pieces for the anthology. Another curious observation she makes is that she feels that those who were in the \\"tribe\\" of the Cyberpunk Movement (hereafter CM) were of the same generation. Alfred Bester and Cordwainer Smith, whose stories Cadigan selected to appear at the front of the anthology, wrote the vast majority of their work years before the CM was even a vision. In fact, Smith died in 1966, during the height of the \\"hard SF\\" era of Heinlein, Asimov and Niven. Cadigan even explains that Bester was a source of inspiration for the 1960s Science Fiction New Wave, which explicitly disables him from being a part of the CM, especially when he, like James Tiptree, Jr. (also included in the anthology) died in 1987, when the CM was at its zenith. I suppose it isn't so far fetched to include Philip K. Dick who was arguably the most important and best known science fiction author, outside of Frank Herbert and Arthur C. Clarke. He was responsible for Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982), after all. But Dick died in 1982, never knowing what was to come in his wake. Furthermore, if Rudy Rucker was truly a member of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling and John Shirley's generation, why, then has he been referred to as a Grandfather of Cyberpunk, not unlike Dick?Cadigan perhaps anticipates remarks such as mine, creating an artificial group of defendants, who claim that \\"Cyberpunk itself is hardly anything new (Cadigan x).\\" It is here that she justifies her inclusion of Bester and Smith and the other previous era's authors. While this might satisfy some critics, it does not provide a strong enough reason for me. If she wanted to create an anthology of the stories leading up to and directly or indirectly causing the CM, then she should have done that. If she wanted to create a history of the CM, something which, 10 years removed from the end of the literary aspect, she could have done quite easily, she should have done so. She ought not to have tried to do both. She even makes mention of the fact that \\"there is no point in reprinting most of Mirrorshades,\\" though she reprints both of John Shirley's and Lewis Shiner's pieces.One selection she makes that I do agree with is Greg Bear's \\"Blood Music\\". I felt that the story showcased Bear's Cyberpunk leanings much better than \\"Petra\\" did, which was included in Mirrorshades. Sadly, none of the late George Alec Effinger's work makes it into the anthology. Of all the Cyberpunk and Cyberpunk era science fiction I have read, nothing speaks clearer to the aims of the movement as clearly and loudly as Effinger's Marid Audran trilogy. Sadly, Effinger never gained critical or peer acclaim, and some of the most well read science fiction fans wear a puzzled face at the mention of his name.As with every CM anthology published to date, this book expectantly falls in line with the blatant fanaticism over the work of William Gibson. While Burning Chrome is a decent story, and one of the few actual pieces of Cyberpunk stuff in the collection, I was confused as to why only the second part of the Neuromancer graphic novel was published. The publisher, ibooks, could have probably secured the rights to publishing the other pieces. Instead, they leave those unfamiliar with Gibson's lackluster flagship title scratching their temples, and irritate the veteran fans of the genre by splintering the story.The ibooks publishing house has made a living out of playing upon the nostalgia-storing areas of the brain, hiring second string authors to finish up manuscripts written by the masters, or to create stories based upon the universes of the science fiction grandmasters. The Ultimate Cyberpunk is no exception. It fails as both a documentation of a literary movement, and as a standard anthology, as the stories are too far apart in their publication dates to have any sense of unification.There isn't any point in repackaging Mirrorshades, That's undeniably true. Unfortunately, that's exactly what Cadigan tried to do here tried to do, riding the coattails of the Internet and technology boom, while simultaneously creating one more outlet for her own stories and those of her pals, Sterling and Gibson."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Cyberpunk","review":"Pat Cadigan has developed a respectably lengthy body of work in the science fiction genre.

This statement does little other than to nullify her authoritative claim in regard to selecting pieces for the anthology. Another curious observation she makes is that she feels that those who were in the \\"tribe\\" of the Cyberpunk Movement (hereafter CM) were of the same generation. Alfred Bester and Cordwainer Smith, whose stories Cadigan selected to appear at the front of the anthology, wrote the vast majority of their work years before the CM was even a vision. In fact, Smith died in 1966, during the height of the \\"hard SF\\" era of Heinlein, Asimov and Niven. Cadigan even explains that Bester was a source of inspiration for the 1960s Science Fiction New Wave, which explicitly disables him from being a part of the CM, especially when he, like James Tiptree, Jr. (also included in the anthology) died in 1987, when the CM was at its zenith. I suppose it isn't so far fetched to include Philip K. Dick who was arguably the most important and best known science fiction author, outside of Frank Herbert and Arthur C. Clarke. He was responsible for Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982), after all. But Dick died in 1982, never knowing what was to come in his wake. Furthermore, if Rudy Rucker was truly a member of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling and John Shirley's generation, why, then has he been referred to as a Grandfather of Cyberpunk, not unlike Dick?Cadigan perhaps anticipates remarks such as mine, creating an artificial group of defendants, who claim that \\"Cyberpunk itself is hardly anything new (Cadigan x).\\" It is here that she justifies her inclusion of Bester and Smith and the other previous era's authors. While this might satisfy some critics, it does not provide a strong enough reason for me. If she wanted to create an anthology of the stories leading up to and directly or indirectly causing the CM, then she should have done that. If she wanted to create a history of the CM, something which, 10 years removed from the end of the literary aspect, she could have done quite easily, she should have done so. She ought not to have tried to do both. She even makes mention of the fact that \\"there is no point in reprinting most of Mirrorshades,\\" though she reprints both of John Shirley's and Lewis Shiner's pieces.One selection she makes that I do agree with is Greg Bear's \\"Blood Music\\". I felt that the story showcased Bear's Cyberpunk leanings much better than \\"Petra\\" did, which was included in Mirrorshades. Sadly, none of the late George Alec Effinger's work makes it into the anthology. Of all the Cyberpunk and Cyberpunk era science fiction I have read, nothing speaks clearer to the aims of the movement as clearly and loudly as Effinger's Marid Audran trilogy. Sadly, Effinger never gained critical or peer acclaim, and some of the most well read science fiction fans wear a puzzled face at the mention of his name.The ibooks publishing house has made a living out of playing upon the nostalgia-storing areas of the brain, hiring second string authors to finish up manuscripts written by the masters, or to create stories based upon the universes of the science fiction grandmasters. The Ultimate Cyberpunk is no exception. It fails as both a documentation of a literary movement, and as a standard anthology, as the stories are too far apart in their publication dates to have any sense of unification.There isn't any point in repackaging Mirrorshades, That's undeniably true. Unfortunately, that's exactly what Cadigan tried to do here tried to do, riding the coattails of the Internet and technology boom, while simultaneously creating one more outlet for her own stories and those of her pals, Sterling and Gibson."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Cyberpunk","review":"not only does the book give you 16 pages of color, but you get William Gibson, Neal Stephenson and Alfred Bester for the price of admission."},{"Title":"The Quotable Dad","review":"I received this book yesterday as a Father's Day present. It is both brief and profound, with quotations from a wide range of leaders and writers on fatherhood from Jimmy Carter and Bill Cosby to John Wayne and William Carlos Williams.I would strongly recommend it as a Father's Day gift in the future. I would also recommend it to men on the verge of becoming fathers, men who have just become fathers, and fathers in need of some inspiration.The quotations also serve as a guide to contemporary books and authorities on fatherhood, such as Marcus Jacob Goldman's The Joy of Fatherhood, Peter Carey's The Granta Book of the Family,Kevin Osborn's The Complete Idiot's Guide to Fatherhood, Annie Pigeon's Dad's Little Instruction Book, John L. Hart's Becoming A Father, Peter Mayle's How to Be a Pregnant Father, William Plummer's Wishing My Father Well, Paul Riser's Couplehood, Bill Cosby's Fatherhood, and H. Jackson Browne's A Father's Book of Wisdom.The book has eight chapters, focusing on becoming a father, being a better father, fathers and daughters, fathers and sons, a father's wisdom,the difficulty of fatherhood, appreciating one's father, and grandfatherhood.All the quotations in the book are at at least stimulating and provocative, and many are vital and profound.Five of my favorites are as follows:\\"A baby is God's opinion that life should go on,\\" Carl Sandburg\\"I hope when you grow up you will dedicate your life to working out plans to make people happy instead of making them miserable, as war does today,\\" Joseph P. Kennedy to 8 year old Edward M. Kennedy\\"Children need models rather than critics, \\" Joseph Joubert\\"I watched a small man with thick calluses on both hands work fifteen and sixteen hours a day. I saw him once literally bleed from the bottom of his feet, a man who came here uneducated, alone, unable to speak the language, who taught me all I needed to know about faith and hard work by the eloquence of his example,\\" Mario Cuomo\\"The lone father is not a strong father. Fathering is a difficult and perilous journey and is done well with the help of other men,\\" John L. HartThe time it takes to get through the book is short, and it is time well spent. The Quotable Dad is an excellent source of inspiration and insight for fathers old and new, and for future fathers galore."},{"Title":"The Porcupine","review":"I discovered this book accidentally, just because I love Barnes' way of writing. I had no idea what it was about, no idea if it were good or bad, truthful or not. I'm from Bulgaria, the country so well depicted in this book, and I'd never imagined that a foreigner could've observed and captured so well the difficulties and sufferings that were endured during the changes. The book is quite objective and gives you a realistic view of our capital, our people, our lives. If you want to know anything about Bulgaria, this is where you should start."},{"Title":"The Porcupine","review":"You've heard about the economic and political difficulties faced by people in Eastern Europe following the great collapse. You've seen some of the people on the evening news. How often have you thought that being in the midst of it for a week would be a much more profound experience than a &quot;City Slickers&quot; vacation.Julian Barnes' book, &quot;The Porcupine&quot; is your chance to have that adventure. Go far beyond a tourist excursion into the heart of the experience."},{"Title":"The Porcupine","review":"If theatre, politics, philosophy are an interest then this short novel will appeal to you. Trials can be fascinating theatre and the purpose of political show trials is partly to provide some relief or satisfaction for the suffering public out for revenge. Mr Barnes is outstanding at getting inside the heads of the protagonists, and some of the funniest moments are the monologues of the accused Petkanov. But he also provides witty asides into fashion, folklore, and history. A great read."},{"Title":"The Porcupine","review":"The elaborately choreographed show trials of Stalin are as well known, as they are infamous. There are few examples in History when one, malformed creature, both mentally and physically, could rule as a dictator for so long, and without challenge. Even Kirov cannot be considered more than a potential challenge, as the murdered do not compete. The number, who rules a Country that they were not born to, narrows the numbers further. Hitler did come from Austria, but in any measure of terror, killing, and longevity, he is not even close to Stalin.In, \\"The Porcupine\\", by Julian Barnes, it is the tyrant that is on trial, not Stalin, for the country of this Dictator's origin is never mentioned. Much historical detail is used, and the quandary the Prosecution faces would have been the same if Stalin had ever been tried. Some of the circumstances that span from the beginning to the end of the book, in a manner of speaking, can be witnessed today. What was \\"The Evil Empire\\" when viewed from here, is a way of governed life that would still be welcomed back by large portions of not just Russia, but members of the former union as well. Life may not have been ideal, but if \\"the two words\\" have not made them better, why not go back?Who charges the dictator, who can sit in judgement when those passing a verdict were a part of the machine themselves? Who is qualified to prosecute, what can the charges be, and what is the punishment to entail? Crimes Against Humanity as tried in Nuremberg, placed the defendants before those that had defeated them. The crimes were appalling, but even bringing that trial to the point of beginning was anything but certain, and certainly not with precedent.Mr. Barnes pens a great Counter Factual bit of \\"what if?\\" History. That it has not happened as described does not detract from the fascination the idea provokes. The issue seems easy in theory, the outcome preordained. But wishing and wanting don't just make it so, or does it?"},{"Title":"The Porcupine","review":"Given that this small book's author is Julian Barnes, you would expect it to be beautifully written, perceptive, knowledgeable, very readable and sometimes quite amusing, and above all very very clever. It's all of that, but it is still a small book, and if I am supposed to assess it as a genuine novel and not just as a slightly overgrown article for, say, Punch or the New Yorker I am not prepared to give it a higher rating when the author makes things as easy for himself as Barnes does here.Barnes's much-lauded Flaubert's Parrot struck me in much the same way. Both books consist largely of ready-made material. Nothing wrong with that per se, I suppose, and I would not mind if I thought that this work amounted to anything I could, with a straight face, call a historical novel, but I can't. What the narrative here does is to weave a bit of embroidery round the story of Todor Zhivkov, the long-time dictator of Bulgaria in its communist days, and his 1987 downfall in the tsunami of perestroika unleashed by Gorbachev, which of course undermined all the satellite regimes and finally spelled the end of the mighty Soviet Union itself. The scenario is a make-believe trial of the thinly disguised Zhivkov, seen partly through his eyes but more from the perspective of the imaginary (I suppose) prosecutor. One thing that is very accomplished in the way it is handled is Barnes's ability to make both of these figures genuine human characters and at the same time mouthpieces for ideologies. Even \`ideologies' does not convey the whole truth: this is a study in mentalities, in the mindsets that find their expression in the ideological convictions. These can be generalised of course, indeed they have to be, but in the last resort the holder of any idea is an individual distinct from every other individual. Not every novelist could convey this sense of layers within layers inside human personalities, but not every novelist is as clever as Julian Barnes.At my own level of comprehension it reads very convincingly, but of course like everyone brought up in the democratic west I carry with me a picture of such regimes influenced by my own side's official version. I shall not go so far as to join with the critics who find it all realistic because I lack the depth of background to make such a judgment and I sincerely hope that they do not, otherwise they should not make any claim of this kind. The detail is beautiful - the communist lingo through which language served not as a vehicle for thought but as a substitute for thought, the conflicting motivations of the prosecutor, the discovery (if it needs discovery) that all truth and virtue is not on one side rather than the other, above all the totally impenetrable and sclerotic faith possessed by the ex-dictator, a thing impervious to reason but still able to use language and argument as a powerful weapon. It all held my attention to the last of its few pages - with the exception of three or four pages of blatant padding.The former dictator uses, or abuses, a lot of the court's time with an interminable recitation of awards, decorations and whatnot that he has been invested with by the nations of the world. This is skim-reading material if ever I saw skim-reading material. If you like Paradise Lost you may recall the objection raised by T S Eliot to a roll-call of place-names in book XI...Cambalu seat of Cathaian CanAnd Samarkand by Oxus Temir's throne... [etc]Eliot accuses poor old Milton of not taking things seriously enough and just indulging himself. I think that is far too strict. The passage in question is only 20 lines or so, whereas Barnes churns out something like 4 pages of his ridiculous decorations, and I feel he is taking his readers for mugs. It made me think hard about how I ought to rate this book, after everything it has going for it. It is just a bit too facile in just too many ways, so three stars will do."},{"Title":"The Porcupine","review":"An Eastern European dictator apprehended after fall of his regime debates with a former member of his regime who has become chief prosecutor in the new one. There is much here reminescent of 'Darkness at Noon' but that book had the advantage of being written while the debate was still alive, the tyrants of Communism still in control in Eastern Europe. Here we have the confrontation largely as one of ideas with neither personality having real attractiveness. There is a stale abstract feel to the book and it is probably one of Barnes' least successful experiments. It just does not feel like there is much here to feel about, certainly not the lead characters."},{"Title":"The Porcupine","review":"When men become very old, they often become aggressively stupid and silly. However, just before this period appears, some men become confidently silly - like \\"the porcupine\\" in this text - Stoyo Petkanov. Julian Barnes text, \\"The Porcupine\\" is about an encounter, lasting for about 50 days, between Prosecutor General (PG) Peter Solinsky, and the former President of a former USSR state, Stoyo Petkanov. The PG prosecuting the President in Ciminal Law Case Number 1. The two men share a common history, but played different parts in it: \\"trying to claim some bond between them, giving him advice like this\\" (p. 135). There are two question raised in the text, I think. The fist is whether the encounter between the two men will transfer some of the (monster p. 135) characteristics of the old former President over to the younger Prosecutor General. Or more precisely, if the President's confidence is a vehicle for a transfer. The second question is if making decisions are better than indecision: \\"to work, and then act\\" is better than: \\"Comrades, I have been rereading...\\" (p. 131), the former strategy with results and abuse of power, the latter strategy with - we don't really know (\\"there is no ... sausage in the shop\\" p. 105) - but no abuse of power. (President George W. Bush autobiography was named \\"Decision Points\\" a nice title, no implications.)For the first question the answer may be that there was some transfer? \\"... it hardly seemed tactful to accept any visible favor from the new government while charging its predecessor with massive abuse of privilege. Maria (the PG's wife) found this argument absurd. The Prosecutor General should not live in a law professor's dingy three-room mouse hole...\\" (p.7, 128). The sentence: \\"I sentence you\\" (p. 136), may also be meaningful, but I don't know. For the second question, I am not sure we learn much: \\"Freedom. Freedom not to be serious.\\" (p. 105, p. 133), but that may not have been the intention either.There are two aspect of the text that I wonder about: the vocabulary for swearing used here and the obituary like long lists that Stoyo Petkanov is making to rehabilitate himself. i) Does Russians swear as the English do? (e.g., relevant sentence on p. 133). I would think their swearing would be different, but there exist not yet any: \\"Grand book about swearing in 99 cultures,\\" so I don't know. Ii) I can see the purpose of the former president listing all his credentials, including Orders and obituary-like assessments from other leaders, like Jimmy Carter: \\"The Presidents influence in the international arena as leader is outstanding...\\" (p. 122- 125, orders, p. 116-122). However, with so many pages used to make the list, I would think there is more English irony in it than I grasp. Listing obituaries as support for grandness is probably the ultimate silliness of old men. Maybe to show this was one of the intentions with this text.I read the book with interest, for verbal enjoyment of sentences and structures, and for understanding something about the forces that created and destroyed the USSR. I am not sure I learned very much more than how English irony can be applied to a story of how an old man turned from confidently silly to aggressively silly. That is, stories of old men that never made mistakes.Citations: \\"The events began to blur like bicycles spokes.\\"(p. 21), \\"Could a nation lose its capacity for skepticism, for useful doubt? What if the muscle of contradiction simply atrophied from lack of exercise? (p. 27)"},{"Title":"The Porcupine","review":"You come upon pure evil between book covers as rarely as in real life. This is one such case. In this novel, the writer presents the proposition that the the true villains of the Liberation of 1989 were the dissidents, the true heroes the communists. That's right--Havel and Walensa are fiends, Ceaucescu, Andropov, and the rest giants. Imagine a serious literary figure publishing a book praising Hitler in say, 1950, and you've got the picture.

The Book of Revalation suddenly becomes important to our lives again.Swedenborg claims that the entire Book is a spiritual vision that John had while on the Isle of Patmos. This vision was of the fall and end of the First Christian Church which occured at the time of the Last Judgement and the institution of the New Christian Church by God. (Swedenborg asserts that the Last Judgement was a spiritual judgement or reordering and has already taken place.)The Book of Revalation teaches through correspondences of the dangers of the Doctrine of Faith Alone, how that Doctrine ultimately destroyed the First Christian Church, and how critical the union of Faith and Charity is in our spiritual development.Apocalypse Revealed (two volumes) was followed by Apocalypse Explained (six volumes) which is the full work on this subject.

The radio show left out the love story and some other detials for sake of time, the book is wonderful with these elements intact. It also has the benefit of really going into detail about the mining industry. The writing is not spare nor is it florid, but Innes gets you involved with the details, not so much to bog you down and bore you, but to give you insight and reason into why the people in the story do what they do. Very nice read. Could easily see this as a movie."},{"Title":"The Killer Mine","review":"Hammond Innes was a good, but not great, writer of adventure stories. The best of his novels (Killer Mine, Atlantic Fury, Golden Soak) are 4-star works--his other novels range from about 2 to 3 1/2 stars. His bestnovels, and some of his slightly lesser works, immerse you in a largelyunfamiliar world of some kind--a bit like mixing a travel narrative with an adventure story. Many of his works involve a man on the run from somewhere, and most also involve a conveniently young, unmarried, attractive female, but there aren't any sex scenes. It can get a bit formulaic at times, which prevents a full 5-star rating.Killer Mine--set in about 1947--centers on an English Army deserter, returning (illegally) to England, and having to work using his mining skills in a shady smuggling operation on the coast of Cornwall. There are fine descriptions of this old tin mine--without this the book would rate about 2 stars and would be quite forgettable. The mine is near the famous old Botallack Mine, and Botallack is used for the basis here--as the hero--Jim Pryce--has to work in a gallery that like a similar gallery in Botallack extends out half a mile under the ocean.This book aroused an interest in me 40 years ago about Cornish mining, and that interest has been with me ever since--and when a novel can arouse such an interest, that's a good thing."},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"The critics focus on Lawrence's lifelong sexual themes and his colonial-era views on race, but the best part of this book, and the reason it's still important, is that it contains Lawrence's prescription for modern metaphysical ills -- a return to religion, not Christianity but a sort of new paganism which draws at its core on ideas from gnosticism and eastern mysticism. Lawrence thinks that Quetzalcoatl would embody this new paganism in Mexico, but he has Ramon suggest to Kate that, if she returns to Ireland, she should encourage the Irish to similarly reinvent the Celtic gods on the gnostic model. Ramon thinks every culture should revert to its old gods -- which he thinks are all expressions of the same, universal God -- because different \\"races,\\" or to use more modern, politically correct terminology, different cultures understand the idea of \\"god\\" through their own unique experience, history and ways of thinking. Regardless of any other shortcomings, this is a fascinating, thoughtful approach, artfully presented.I liked Lawrence's Quetzalcoatl hymns quite a bit, and thought they added immensely to the above-identified theme. They reminded me a great deal of some the Nag Hammadi manuscripts -- gnostic Christian teachings discovered in Egypt in the 1940s, and famously described by Elaine Pagels in The Gnostic Gospels. What's most amazing is the depth and scope of Lawrence's gnostic philosophy without having had access to those ancient Egyptian texts, which were not discovered until after the writer's death.Those viewing this book through a purely feminist lens will dislike it; those who espouse identity politics will find themselves conflicted. But for anyone interested in a great writer's \\"practical\\" solution to the great spiritual dilemmas of the modern era, or who simply enjoys reading 400 pages of top-shelf prose, \\"The Plumed Serpent\\" is worth the time investment."},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"One gets the impression that D.H. Lawrence's visit to Mexico in the 1920's was quite difficult; Mexico was rocked by political and social violence and even extremes of climate. Yet somehow, Lawrence has successfully managed to transform his experiences into a novel alive and vital. His characters are early 20th century spiritual seekers in a country that still has not been completely deadened by what Lawrence sees as the century's materialistic malaise. His spiritual ideas are much more profound than what can be found in most modern New Age manuals, and imbedded as they are in a realistic fiction, much more entertaining."},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"This is one of those books that once you take the time to get familiar with, it will pull you along at a slow and sometimes painful pace. The honest and direct sensuality of the people, Kate's confusion between the love of life and the distaste for the common man, the marraige of religions, and the stuggle to become true men and women do offer the reader a wonderfly detailed story. I recommend this to anyone who feels they need a mental vacation for the social triviality of the modern day world. It is a book to help regain perspective."},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"I must agree with the other reviewers that this book has some wonderful writing. There are passages of description that simply dazzle. The scene in which heroine Kate first sees the gathering of the Men of Quetzalcoatl, where the beats of the drums seem to draw the soul from the earth, is absolutely mesmerizing.Yet for every memorable scene there are pages and pages of wild romanticizing about native values, obscenely outdated musings about race, and odd sentiments about marriage and women. Unlike &quot;Women in Love,&quot; this book doesn't present love in a very good light. Kate is seen as a woman torn between her need to be herself and her need to be subsumed by a man. And the answer is unclear at the end. I found her to be a sympathetic character despite her annoying quirks (if she hates Mexico so much, why doesn't she just leave?) and I felt the ending didn't show her growing or changing. I also felt that the other main characters (Ramon and Cipriano) became almost brutal by the book's end, and this development was not resolved in any satisfactory way.I have to admit being profoundly disappointed by the ending, and by the bizarre theorizing about the soul of the &quot;dark races.&quot; But, I had to keep remembering that this book was a product of the early twentieth century. And the writing is what still makes it masterful."},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"In the area of the poetic use and the beauty of the English language, this book is well-written and certainly worthy of one's time taken in reading it. The language and the imagery invoked is breath-taking. In the area of subject matter, it is rather unique. An Irish woman journeys to Mexico just after the Mexican Revolution and becomes involved with two men who have taken it upon themselves to return Mexico to the religion of Quetzalcoatl and Huitzilopochtli. She joins them to become the First Woman of Malintzi and wife of the First Man of Huitzilopochtli. However, in the area of social language, the book is a product of its time. The Mexican people -- and all &quot;dark&quot; people -- are the objects of particularly malignant language, which I found objectionable. As an historian, I can place the book in its proper perspective, however, and recommend it as a good read."},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"Myths may not have any credibility or even feasibility, but the truth is that every new one accrues its followers. \\"Do it ... And then you will know,\\" from Cipriano's argument with Kate, could be seen as an attempt to convince the reader as well that myths are real and normal people believe in them, even the myth of Quetzalcoatl. This long-ago Aztec religion, revived for modern Mexico, ends up a contagious energy force that hits the country at the perfect time, spreading quickly and eroding the traditional Catholic foothold.Lawrence has gone to great lengths to make the details of Ramon's religion convincing and thorough. The creative language of Ramon's speeches and hymns comes across as realistic, and alluring enough to draw its early followers from the community. Ramon feels that his country is dead, or dying, and that it needs a religion that will bring rebirth or revival to his people. Ramon's wavering respect for the Catholic Church combines with his desire for a \\"living\\" Mexico and leads him to bring back Quetzalcoatl, an ancient Aztec god. His religion gains quick favor with the people because of its contiguity with the fundamentals of Catholicism. Ramon tells the people that God has called Jesus and the Virgin Mary back to heaven and has told Quetzalcoatl, his new identity, to restore peace to the Mexican people. His use of religious terms (the Cross, Paradise, Morning Star, Saviour, Will of God, etc.) helps verify his claim and earn him a place in the societal construct. This Biblical language referencing the resurrection of Christ, \\"... when I am new man? I will roll away the stone,\\" accomplishes the same effect as the Catholic terminology. This use of Biblical language culminates in Kate's response to Ramon's question \\"It is good, isn't it, Mistress?\\" with her answer \\"It is very good,\\" which uses the language of the Genesis Creation story.It is difficult to tell if Lawrence is using this novel as a praise or reprimanding of new myths. One can sense a satirical undercurrent of regret that humankind is so often ready to embrace new ideas like Ramon's. It is doubtful that Lawrence is speaking only about the country of Mexico. This uncertainty surfaces most often through the character of Kate as she wrestles with her English heritage and curiosity of Mexican culture. She wavers between giving herself over completely to Ramon's religion, and when she does finally give in, Lawrence leaves the reader with the feeling that she's made the wrong choice.Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"D.H. is not at his best here, in &quot;white man's burden&quot; early 20th century Mexico. Kate, Irish girl stranded in central Mexico makes the best of things and develops theories about the &quot;dark races&quot; and their &quot;passions&quot; and why they can't seem to get their priorities in order. Masterful Aztec serpent carvings are described as having the appearance of &quot;coils of excrement&quot;. Young native girls stare out of their window like &quot;an animal in a cave&quot;, and go &quot;slap, slap, slap&quot; with their tortillas. Mexicans don't know how to keep themselves warm...they shiver like lizards on a bed of corn husks during the high-altitude nights. On occasion, though, they display creativity and masculine &quot;power&quot;. They dress in crisp whites and do dances and go through elaborate, New Age chants, including memorable quotes such as &quot;I am the stone of life&quot;, &quot;on to the nakedest star&quot;, before retiring to the pool of &quot;refreshing death&quot;. The nonsense ending where the &quot;Plumed Serpent&quot; enthusiasts usurp the Mexican government, instead of being riddled with bullets like every other insurgent Mexican reform group in the 20th century, strains the reader's patience and goodwill.

Lawrence two stars, in this case I must. The Plumed Serpent is no Son's and Lovers. This late Lawrence book is filled with long-winded, pretentious and repetitive passages of ersatz Aztec religious claptrap and equally ill-conceived mysticism about the savage Mexican Indian as a race. Couple these with a sort of proto-fascism, and one has a pretty nasty book. Lawrence's take on gender relations in this world of neo-Aztec revival is equally unattractive. At the same time, there are the descriptive passages of great lyric beauty that are pure Lawrence and some earnest wrestling with questions of individualism versus the commonality of humankind. I didn't like the book, but I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"I've read nearly all of Lawrence's novels; Plumed Serpent is rather different than the others. The language, syntax, and phrasing in PS is not so definitively the authorial voice of a cultured Englishman.

The language is very Americanized here, even though none of the characters are USA-Americans, while DHL makes much of Mexico being American -- as in \\"the American continent\\" -- and not European.DHL clearly was wary, perhaps even frightened, of Mexicans and what he repeatedly refers to, ominously, as their \\"black, center-less eyes.\\" For DHL this meant it was impossible to know what the Mexicans were thinking, or feeling, if they were (or weren't) in fact doing either. I doubt that this novel, were it new, would be published today: it would be pronounced racist and Feminists would deem it misogynistic, as the strong, independent female protagonist seems really just need to be sexually overpowered by dark, native men. (One might want to recall that a close American friend of DHL and Freda, the white female artist Mabel Dodge, who gave Freda a ranch near Taos, New Mexico, married a local New Mexican native American Indian--Red Indian, in the words of DHL.) When the book was originally published, the controversy was about it being Fascist. It is most certainly anti-Catholic. This being DHL, male skin is well in evidence, of course, in this case brown rather than pale white.There is a fair amount of Mexican native-Indian-gods-worshiping DHL poetry, if you like that sort of thing; if not, it is easy to skip over; it's man-cave kind of mumbo jumbo, though beautiful too. I presume (and intend to investigate) the scenes of native Mexican Indians stripping Catholic churches and burning the \\"idols\\" from within are fact-based. Another unusual thing: there is real shoot-'em-up (or slit their throats) violence here, though not much nor presented squeamishly.On the whole: something unexpected and unlikely from DHL...but quite readable too, a page-turner, as it were."},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"I must say that I couldn't finish this book, because I found reading it so unpleasant. I generally love the classics and have a high tolerance for slow, plodding books, but I found this one painful.I understand that we should allow Lawrence a different standard for his portrayals of Mexico and \\"natives\\" since he was writing before our contemporary multicultural awareness. Nevertheless, I would expect insightfulness in his portrayal, whereas I found a simplistic racism. Had I finished the book, perhaps I would have found that he had more to say than what I have gleaned so far- that Mexico and Mexicans are evil, reptilian, and hopeless. That message was so repetitive that I had to give up on the book in order to save myself from the dark mood of the whole reading experience."},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"Kate, an Irish woman visiting Mexico, is in a continuous state of war with herself: whether to maintain her independence from men in the modern, European society to which she was familiar or to submerge her very soul to Cipriano, a Native American general bent upon revolution in Mexico. Cipriano would call it \\"uniting\\" their souls. Kate, having a gentle, womanly spirit, views Mexicans as \\"dark men\\" steeped in violence, revolution and death. She is sickened by this attitude--as she was by the bull fight presented early in the book--having lost a husband who was dedicated to fighting for Ireland's freedom from Britain. In fact, _The Plumed Serpent_ concerns the battle of women against men and the ambivalent feelings (including sexual) of one for the other. Kate is equally attracted to and repelled by the Mexican culture. Dona Carlota, the wife of Ramon who is a close friend of Cipriano, like Kate is an opponent of Ramon's revolutionary fervor. Both Ramon and Cipriano yearn to replace \\"the Gringo\\" Jesus Christ's hold on the Church with the Aztec God Quetzalcoatl. There is a harrowing and incendiary scene in the book concerning just this issue.The book contains a number of references to sexuality, both male (Cipriano and Ramon are often shown at least partially naked) and female (Kate's expression of her sexuality as an indication of her independence, whereas Cripriano often sees her as a vessel for his manhood). I only wish that Lawrence had not dwelt so much in the novel on hymns written by Ramon as a paeon to Quetzalcoatl. This often bogged the book down in pseudo-Aztec myth-making and took away from what was otherwise a well-written and meaningful book."},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"Lawrence was the first of the angry men who came to dominate English letters after WWII, only Lawrence was ahead of them by nearly fifty years. It is instructive if not enlightening to read Lawrence here in \\"The Plumed Serpent\\" and elsewhere, for example in \\"Kangaroo,\\" on the subject of the 'masses,' the people, and on democracy. Lawrence who was of working class stock created a reactionary persona who saw himself as an artistic aristocrat who looked down on nearly everyone. The opening scene at the bull ring is a masterpiece of writing. In it, Lawrence weaves his Irish heroine's visceral reaction to the cruelty of bull fighting into her observations of the Mexican people. Her conclusion, and I think Lawrence's, was that the bull's deserve our sympathy, while the people can rot. He was a great hater of the masses, as expressed in \\"Kangaroo,\\" his survey of the new emerging democracy down under. He was, as he said, afraid of the ant hill, the grinding down of human life to the multitude and its needs. In so many ways he was prophetic, anticipating many of the arguments and observations of the Frankfurt School members, such as Adorno, who came to America and were appalled. This is a great novel in the sense that it fully expresses Lawrence's view of the world. It displays his uniquely expressive prose and contains brilliantly observed details of the Mexican landscape."},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"Lawrence is much like Faulkner in the sense that his prose seems to spew out in gorgeous, confused, confussing, sometimes brilliant, sometimes horrid chunks. Lawrence's technique doesn't flow so much as it purges, and combined with the baroque possibilities of Mexico, it produces a massive and challenging novel that lunges from one extreme to another. I'm still not sure if Lawrence's conception of Kate Leslie was too complex for me to grasp or simply convoluted. The novel begins abruptly and ends in even greater uncertainty... But in between, it is a great book to keep on your nightstand for a month or two."},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"At times lyrically intoxicating, yet mostly just a flawed, rambling novel that gets painfully tedious towards the end, this is definitely one book by Lawrence that you can safely skip. It unfortunately isn't just bad writing - it's also a poor reflection of Mexican society. It makes you wonder how much time Lawrence actually spent in Mexico before he wrote the book. His depiction is stereotypical throughout, and often borders on racism. He seems to have skimmed the surface of Mexican culture, but he hasn't gone much deeper than that."},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"Mandatory reading for anyone who regards himself as 'politically correct'. Outside of this context, the book doesn't carry much force. Endless observations on Mexico that don't seem too distant from Lawrence's own views; just tweaked enough to fit into his main character's head. A well written first chapter - at the bullfight - disintegrates as we step outside the lives of the characters who show the potential for greater developement and move into a fanatasy realm embodied by one lady's midlife crisis and whether she can reconcile anything that makes up her past. Largely, the book is very linear and won't require much reflection on past pages from the reader as things plummet towards orgiastic."},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"One of the most boring books you'd ever read. The language is as rich as it'll ever get, but it used to narrte the muse of someone tethering on the verge of insanity. I've battled through 150 odd pages of the book and can't understand the premise. The ruthless (upto 5 times on every page) use of the word \\"naked\\" & \\"ruddy\\" gets irritating. I fail to understand as to why would the author think that people from Mexico are evil and are pulling the earth beings down. A dark & useless book. Stay away!!!"},{"Title":"The Plumed Serpent","review":"I didn't make it very far through this one - cynical in its tone and rather ignorant in it's portrayal of the characters in Mexico. If you want to learn about latin american consciousness or life, pick up a book by a respected latin author, not this joker. I found it disturbing, but not because of some profound events in the storyline, but rather because of the mental condition of the author, whom I found rather perverse."},{"Title":"Nomonhan: Japanese-Soviet tactical combat, 1939 (Leavenworth papers)","review":"While the reproduction on sale on Amazon is dated 2005, the book was originally published in 1981, so it predates Coox's \\"Nomonhan\\" (1985). Glantz (When Titans Clashed, page 324)calls Drea's book \\"the best short study on Khalkin-Gol...Alvin D. Coox, \\"Nomonhan: Japan Against Russia\\" is an exhaustive study, but is told almost entirely from the Japanese perspective.\\"Note that its fairly pricey for a slim paperback."},{"Title":"Nomonhan: Japanese-Soviet tactical combat, 1939 (Leavenworth papers)","review":"Do not buy this edition of this book -- hunt up a copy of the original university reprint, or of the original US GPO edition. This is essentially a low-quality xerox copy, poorly glued into a flimsy paper binding that will not survive normal handling. It appears that some of the original illustrations printed as blank. Other photographs are nearly black, and still others improperly scanned, showing an irritating moir&eacute; pattern. Most of the maps are legible (some have illegible contour line elevations, making the terrain a chore to understand). Most of the text is legible, but any text that was in a shaded box in the original didn't survive the poor xerox job, and the notes are illegible.The story the book tells, of the hard fight of the IJA's 2/28 infantry, is a good one, well set in the historical firmament. One appreciates what allowed Zhukov to beat the Japanese, as well as the stoic character and courage of the Japanese soldier that made him such a hard opponent for the USA to fight. (Indeed, the book notes that the 2/28 would go down fighting on Guadalcanal within a few years).Bottom line: good book, bad edition. Don't buy it. I hate to give negative reviews but this half-hearted Print-On-Demand job deserves no better. They're not even trying to make a usable product, let alone a quality one."},{"Title":"Nomonhan: Japanese-Soviet tactical combat, 1939 (Leavenworth papers)","review":"I picked up a copy of the original at Ft. Knox in the late eighties and was glad to replace the old worn and stained, stapled-together Army edition with this reprint. I remain deeply impressed with the level of detail - it's written as a unit account in the manner of an S.L.A. Marshall book. I notice some complaints about the quality of the reprint and I think the reviews of some other edition migrated here. My copy (cover shows infantry attacking tank)has absolutely crisp typesetting throughout. However, the publisher warns that the images reproduced in the book are scanned photocopies, with some degradation. This is a good book that needed reviving. I'm glad it's back."},{"Title":"Nomonhan: Japanese-Soviet tactical combat, 1939 (Leavenworth papers)","review":"This material provides a great deal of information concerning Japanese and Russian Tactics at Nohoman 1939. The truly interesting aspect of this report is the fact that there were no Field Manuals for the Senior Soviet or Japanese Commanders on the use of Mechanized Force, and that the success or failure in the deployment of these units was contingent upon each Commanders personal estimate , initiative , perspective and discretion as well as Military Fortitude of each Commander during the course of the fighting.The significance of this information highlights and details Russian Tactics and use of Mechanized and Rifle elements and in what strengths that are not available in any other Published Historical sources or Archival Soviet Studies of Authors such as David Glantz.This reprint illustrates the ability of Russian Mechanized Forces and their tactical structure and combat deployments with maps and Soviet Mechanized/Motorized/ Tank and Rifle Division Structure establishment of 1938-39.Japanese accounts and establishments are also included in detail down to platoon level."},{"Title":"Nomonhan: Japanese-Soviet tactical combat, 1939 (Leavenworth papers)","review":"I'll make this as brief as possible. First I'll comment on the content, then on the product itself.Drea's work has my admiration even at this stage of his career. Some necessary historical background begins this 100 page volume, along with a view into the geography and Japanese Army organization, ethos & weapons. An overview of the battle follows this, and then the monograph concentrates on the day to day tactical operational experience of one middle sized IJA unit throughout the conflict: the 2/28th Infantry. This is where Drea has put his emphasis, and this is the heart of the volume. Since the book is a monograph, and because Drea had deliberately set out to focus on the IJA and one unit within that Army, there is not much else within the book. If you're interested in the entire Nomonhan conflict then this isn't your meat. If you're into the IJA and its characteristics, operations, and much else connected with that entity then you're in for a treat.The product has several limitations. First, it's a reprint. There are visible flaws in the text layout, and in the reproduction of pictorial information (maps, photographs, and diagrams). This is a mid level downcheck on the reproduction - but not on the original. Too bad that the reproducer didn't have higher standards in their publication process for those who prefer the hardcopy to the electronic. One would have expected more from this University.Another factor for you to consider is that Drea did his monograph for the Combat Studies Institute (US Army Command & General Staff College) at Ft. Leavenworth Kansas in 1981. That tells you just what was Drea's focus, and that the input and insight into the Soviet side of the equation was sketchy, and cloudy at best. The monograph wasn't for the general historical researcher/reader, it was for the US Army."},{"Title":"The Malcontents","review":"The cover says that this is the \\"Best bitter, cynical, and satirical writing in the world.\\" That such is the case is highly questionable, but let's not quibble about that. I already own much of this material so I was a bit let down about that.If you have a decent library of the classics you may well find yourself in my position. Voltaire's Candide; Machiavelli's The Prince; Pope's The Rape of the Lock; Wilde's Picture of Dorian Gray. They are all sitting on a shelf in my library. What I do not have is Jane Austen's obscure Lady Susan which was not even published until more than 50 years after her death.I would also note that the selections do not contain any explanatory notes. Many older works use terms and references unknown to the contemporary general reader. If you read Pope's Rape of the Lock in the Norton Anthology of Poetry you will find approximately 75 notes that help the reader understand the classical or eighteenth century references. In \\"The Malcontents\\" you get no aids to understanding.I realize that there may be a certain intellectual snobbery in saying that these works should all be on your bookshelf. I don't think that they need be there, but if you don't already own them, do you want to own them? This book contains a wide smattering of literature from Aristophanes' play The Birds, written around 400BC, to essays by Mark Twain, to short stories by Saki. Whole novels and plays are presented, bulking up the book and limiting the possible variety that could be found in an almost 1100 page volume of satire and cynicism. Indeed only 19 authors are represented.I really don't think this is a collection that would appeal to the average reader. On the credit page it should be noted that most of this material was taken from Dover editions. As you may know Dover Publications sells very inexpensive copies of the classics. You could get most of the works in this expensive book by purchasing Dover reprints of each of these works for a couple of bucks a piece. And the little Dover books can be easily held when reading in bed, while this compilation can barely be lifted at all."},{"Title":"The Malcontents","review":"I bought this book sight unseen, knowing neither what was in it, nor having any reviews to go on. But then, the fact that it's a Joe Queenan compilation of funny writing was all I needed to know. How could I go wrong ?The choices in this book undeniably live up to the claim of being the best bitter, cynical and satirical writing in the world. But they will already be well familiar to anyone who seeks out this genre.The first item presented is \\"The Birds\\" by Aristophanes. A great play, but I have it already. Then there's a short satire by Juvenal. Then \\"The Prince\\", by Machiavelli, is presented whole. I already have \\"The Prince\\". It's one of the first books I ever bought. Then there are short excerpts from \\"Gargantua and Pantagruel\\" and \\"Don Quixote\\". I already have these books in complete editions. Then there's \\"Volpone\\" by Ben Jonson. Then there's Moliere's \\"Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme\\". Then there's Jonahtan Swift's \\"A Modest Proposal\\", which I have read many times by now. Then there's Alexander Pope's \\"The Rape Of The Lock\\". Then there's \\"Candide\\", by Voltaire, which I have already. Then there's an excerpt from \\"Justine\\", by de Sade. Then there's \\"Lady Susan\\", by Jane Austen, which I have already. Then there's \\"The Nose\\", by Nikolai Googol.Then there are some lesser-known Mark Twain pieces, which I don't have. That's good, because I already have \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" and \\"Puddnhead Wilson\\". This is the only author for which Queenan is doing what I think he should, by compiling shorter and uncollected works with which someone might not already be familiar.Then there are some pieces by Ambrose Bierce, which I have already, in that fairly-priced Dover edition. Then there's \\"The Picture Of Dorian Gray\\", by Oscar Wilde. Then there's \\"Mrs. Warren's Profession\\", by George Bernard Shaw. Then there are some Saki stories. Finally, there are some pieces by Flann O'Brien.So for the cost and space of a fat 1200 page book, I only get about 600 pages of stuff I don't have already. If you've never bought any funny books before, this volume might be a good one to start with. But, if you own literature, it's likely that you have most of these works already."},{"Title":"The Malcontents","review":"For starters, I can't fault that there is indeed a vast amount of excellent literature in this book, including full editions of some shorter novels. While some of it is familiar, there's a good amount of obscure or hard-to-find inclusions.On the other hand...there was almost too much familiar ground. I skipped over probably close to half of it for having already read it. While authors such as Voltaire and Wilde are almost necessary inclusions for a book with this title, why include their best-known books rather than throwing the spotlight onto some of their more obscure works? (Though I admit Jane Austen was certainly served well in that department.) Also, 20th-century authors are shamefully neglected (where on earth was James Thurber, who I personally would consider one of the best if not the best satirist of his time?).Still, despite the uneven selection, this is overall not a bad collection, though I would use it more as a jumping-off point to authors."},{"Title":"The Malcontents","review":"The Malcontents is intended as a definitive anthology of the greatest satirical writing the world has ever seen. Yet right from the start, it becomes apparent that the book has one major flaw.It's not big enough.That might seem like an odd observation to make about a book that is 1048 pages in length and covers a span of twenty-four centuries worth of writing (Nineteen writers covered in all, going all the way back to Aristophanes). Yet by trying to shoehorn loads of classic satire in (most often in its full incarnations) Joe Queenan may lead readers to believe that there has been no great satire written after the 60s. And that would be a grace disservice to the likes of Philip Roth, Veronica Geng, Fran Lebowitz, Kurt Vonnegut, David Sedaris and so on.Even counting the period covered, there's still a lot of great stuff missing. We don't see anything from HL Mencken or James Thurber or SJ Perelman or Roald Dahl. So I propose that Mr. Queenan either compile a second volume or get someone else to do so (If you happen to read this Joe, feel free to e-mail about that compiler position).Putting these obvious objections aside, one must admit that what is included in this anthology is great. We get satirical classics from writers ranging from Voltaire (&quot;Candide&quot;) to Jonathan Swift (&quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;) to Irish humorist Flann O'Brien (&quot;Selections From The Irish Times). The works cover the gambit from full-length novels (Oscar Wilde's immortal &quot;The Picture Of Dorian Grey&quot;) to plays (George Bernard Shaw's &quot;Mrs. Warren's Profession&quot;) to short stories and essays (The seven Mark Twain pieces). There is even a poem thrown in for good measure Alexander Pope's &quot;The Rape Of The Lock&quot;).Most literary connoisseurs will doubtlessly be familiar with much of the material contained here. Yet some of it will come as a surprise. Having been familiar with Jane Austen mainly from high school English classes, I was shocked to discover her early acerbic satirical side. A very worthwhile discover however. And having read &quot;Don Quixote&quot; a long time ago, I was pleased to find that Queenan was right when he observed in the introduction that the writer, beneath his gentle and bittersweet satire, had a sharp disappointment with the world around him. For the record, the only writing Queenan (himself a malcontent) actually does in this anthology is the introduction and the brief bio of each author that precedes a piece.All of the writing contained in The Malcontents would fall into the category of classic. All classic, all good, even if some of it is overly familiar (Twain's classic &quot;The Literary Offenses Of Fennimore Cooper&quot; for instance). So I can recommend the book to all fans of classic satire, as well as those looking to get a crash course in how to write great satire.Consider the following from the introduction: &quot;Other writers were chosen because they were masters of getting up people's noses. Rabelias was always in trouble with the church. Moliere was always in trouble with the church. Voltaire was always in trouble with the church. The Marquis De Sade was always in trouble with everybody... Sooner or later we come to believe we are fighting on the same side, that the miscreants he torments and the abuses he denounces are miscreants we want to see tormented and abuses we want to see denounced.&quot;Today, we still see many of the same abuses going on and the same miscreants getting elected to public office and of course the ever-stifling Puritanism that seems to have been cropping up. So we need to keep the malcontents we do have. As long as idiots rule, malcontents will drool. And we're all the better for it (the latter not the former). Don't miss this terrific book! Another recommended Amazon quick-pick is THE LOSERS CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"The Malcontents","review":"This thick collection of satire and cynicism is worth having for the selections alone, which range from short stories by Saki of two or three pages, to long exerpts from much longer works like the Rape of the Lock. But the introductions to each piece, and the general introduction to the book itself, are a real treat. You might collect many of these works on your own with alot of effort, but missing out on Queenan's comments would be a terrible shame. Buy this, browse, and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Unhinged World of Glen Baxter: Collected Works (Collected Works (Pomegranate))","review":"Besides his delightfully cheeky artwork, Glen Baxter's captions can't help but make you laugh.

A combination of parody and satire, some of them are only a short distance above the level of nonsense. At times, it takes a careful reading to get to that point.As the cartoons and text demonstrate, Baxter is indeed a bit unhinged, but in the entertaining sort of way.

Portions of the book will make you gasp, as you read that some believed that only virgins could pick the tea leaves, since non-virgins would destroy the leaves by merely touching the leaves!Chatterjee's writing evokes the images of what it is like for these women who worked and continue to work on the tea plantations. Her research was extensive in the field. The book is historical, political, and analytical. It isn't written for a lay audience, but I'm sure that most would enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"8 Minutes in the Morning for Extra-Easy Weight Loss: Guaranteed to shed 2 pounds a week (No equipment required, No calories counting, No deprivation)","review":"It's a helpful handbook for weight loss.

I've lost 13 pounds, a couple each week! It's slow and steady, but in a healthy manner. I think I'm more likely to keep it off this way! An even better incentive...I feel better!"},{"Title":"8 Minutes in the Morning for Extra-Easy Weight Loss: Guaranteed to shed 2 pounds a week (No equipment required, No calories counting, No deprivation)","review":"I'm very active during the summer, cycling & walking up to 3 hours a day. In the winter, I'm a complete couch potato and a night owl. I put off exercise if I don't do it early, and I like to sleep as late as possible. I wanted something ultra easy and quick, so I picked up this book. The first half talks about accepting your body, learning to not eat emotionally and to cultivate supportive friends instead of turning toward food. His diet plan is essentially eating three meals that consist of 1/2 veggies, 1/4 lean protein and 1/2 complex carbs, plus two snacks and healthy oil. The second part of the book focuses on the exercises: each day two moves are done for one minute a piece (four times each), preceded by warm-up marching/walking and followed by three stretches.His eating plan is sensible, but for me it's not realistic to have half a plate of veggies at every meal; I need a bit more flexibility, especially since I eat on the go a lot. I also don't follow his advice for writing a \\"future me\\" essay or getting seven weight loss support buddies. That's a little too intense for my lifestyle. I'm a part of Weight Watchers, so I feel I get plenty of support from that, plus their eating plan works well for me.What I really like are the exercises. Jorge has a visualization exercise before the physical ones, which are very enjoyable. They help get me in a positive frame of mind and have reawakened my motivation (I've been on a weight loss mission for nearly a year, and sometimes you lose that fire.) I was pretty skeptical, since it didn't really feel like I was doing much exertion. (\\"Rosafile\\" mentioned the ease of the Lift Hold...total sense. Luckily, I have a very heavy writing desk I use for that move!) However, I'm about a week into it and I can really feel my muscles becoming awake. The more I feel that way, the more active I become (taking more stairs, etc.) because I'd forgotten how good it feels to have your muscles alive and working. I haven't noticed a change in the way I look, but...I've lost four pounds! Totally cool, especially since I did not change my eating. (I'm not eating Twinkies, though! Fruits, light bread, veggies and soy meat are my staples.) I also like that I have a bit of \\"me\\" time in the morning to chill out, relax and get fit.The annoying part is that Jorge spend a lot of time doing cross promotion of his website, his flax oil, etc. I checked out his site, and it's mostly videos of him on TV shows. His \\"Success Stories\\" page (I looooove a good success story) is disappointing: it's just a link to his Flickr page of him with his celebrity friends. Boring! I'll take a teacher or a truck driver who lost 50 lbs. any day over pics of him and Barbara Walters. Also, in the book, the same two pictures of him are on almost every other page. If it has to be him all the time, at least change it up like an Oprah cover!I bought this book for the exercises, and that's what I like the most about it. If you are doing any sort of training, this book is probably too simple. However, it's a great way for busy people and couch potatoes to tone their muscles and get more fit."},{"Title":"8 Minutes in the Morning for Extra-Easy Weight Loss: Guaranteed to shed 2 pounds a week (No equipment required, No calories counting, No deprivation)","review":"This is NOT a serious physical conditioning book.

The average size of the American woman is a size 12 not a size 2. Jorge Cruise is a fitness coach and hailed as America's #1 weight-loss specialist. He says, -Cardiovascular exercise (aerobics) and dieting are out. And strength training is in.-The focus of this book is to aid the reader in losing 2lbs a week without the use of dumbbells or equipment but by using your own body weight (wall, chair, table, or book) as resistance. By using Jorge's 28 day plan he claims it will help readers to learn to accept themselves and their body no matter what their size; replace emotional eating with a smarter method that allows them to experience the ultimate sense of support and comfort without food; consistently lose up to 2lbs a week; and transform their life and feel fulfilled, whole and happy. This is a tall order for 253 glossy pages.To do this and before you start the physical 28 day plan you must complete all exercises in sections one and two. These aren't physical exercises but a series of quizzes, affirmations and journaling. The journaling, introspection and affirmations continue once you start the 28 day plan as well.Each day before the exercises there is a visualization to work through. This is followed by two strength training exercises in the a.m. It's actually about twelve minutes and not eight as you have to do a two minute warm up before and two minute cool down after. This routine is done Monday - Saturday with Sunday off. The exercises work twelve core body parts: Chest & Back, Shoulders & Abdominals, Triceps & Biceps, Hamstrings & Quadriceps, Calves & Butt, and Inner & Outer Thighs. They are easy enough to do and if you haven't worked your muscles in a while you'll definitely feel it.There is a small nutrition section which goes over some basic aspects of nutrition. The best and simplest idea is his -Cruise Down Plate- is just a way of dividing up your 9\\" plate as a visual cue to portion size.There are also quite a few before and after shot with kudos on Jorge's plan. The silky pages are nice to touch but hard to read because of the glare. There are tiny spots to journal but you'd need a separate journal to write anything of value.One of the biggest things that bugged me about this book was that it implies if you fail you don't accept or respect your body or yourself. A lot of nonsense filler like -In chapter one you will read about...- and -in Chapter 8 you will read about...- is annoying.Will you lose weight if you stay on this plan? Maybe. You have to develop and follow a daily routine. Will you keep it off? You know the answer to that one. It is affordable but I recommend you check it out of the library and use the money to invest in a yoga or other activity video. Reviewed by M. E.

I think that must have happened to me as I walked by this book on the store shelf....I'll start with what I hated about this book.* Jorge Cruise's Cruise Down Plate (R). This consists of the following: \\"Mentally divide the plate in half. Fill the upper half with vegetables. Then again mentally split the bottom half of the plate into two equal parts. Fill the left side with a high-protein food and the right side with a carbohydrate food. Finally, add 1 teaspoon of fat.... If you ... eat everything on your plate - and you're still hungry - you may dish yourself up another plate of vegetables.... And that's really all you need to know to use my Cruise Down Plate (R) to achieve weight-loss success.\\" Well, no, it's really not. You have to read another 14 pages to get to the bottom of it, which actually turns out to be just another low-calorie diet. The plate gimmick barely enters into it. YAWN.* \\"Visit www.JorgeCruise.com....\\" I was perplexed to find that there is apparently NO content on this website that doesn't require you to pay $3 a week. The one exception I found was a link to My Virtual Body, which is free. One section of the book tells you to go to www.JorgeCruise.com/localclubs to see a list of weight-loss clubs meeting in your area. Unfortunately, nothing exists at that web address. At another part of the book, Jorge encourages you to \\"share your story\\" and invites you to weekly online meetings by joining the \\"online club\\" at www.JorgeCruise.com. He doesn't mention there's a fee for this extra support. The most irritating one yet was \\"You can even go to www.JorgeCruise.com/music to hear selections from my personal picks of the most inspiring and moving music.\\" What actually happens when you go to this URL is you find a \\"Welcome to a JorgeCruise.com Active Link!\\" page with a \\"Click here\\" link. When you click on the link, it takes you to www.JorgeCruise.com/shopping/videos.php. Yes, it's an online store for Jorge's $39.95 VHS tape, or one of his audio kits and books, \\"Jorge's favorite\\" exercise tools, and some nutritional supplements. No music whatsoever. While we're on the website, let me point out what the FAQ says about the books:\\"Can I use Jorge's 8 minute books in combination with this online plan? Although the books are excellent resources of information -- the plan presented here online is Jorge's NEWEST and might not follow the book's exercise or eating plan exactly. In order to avoid confusion, follow the online plan 100%. NOTE: We are updating all of Jorge's books to match all new materials offered here online.\\" So now that I've purchased the book (which includes online support as part of its weight-loss plan), it's already obsolete? What was it, just an expensive advertisement for the website? Infuriating.* Jorge's smiling face. I was getting tired of seeing it before I was halfway through the book. Every few pages there's a little sidebar with a Jorge quote, topped by a 2-inch-square photo of the man. By the end, I had difficulty resisting the urge to take up a black Magic Marker and eradicate every one of them. Whose idea WAS that?* The exercises. Come on - soup can bicep curls and tricep kickbacks? What, have I been lying on the couch doing no heavier lifting than a can of beer for the past few years? I have 15-month-old twins, each of whom weighs about 25 lb. I carry them around ALL the TIME. Lifting one-pound soup cans for strength training is ludicrous. And how about the \\"lift hold\\" - sit in front of a table, put your palms under the tabletop and push up on the underside of the table as hard as you can. Well, I don't own a solid marble table, so if I tried this I'd have the table flipped over off its feet before any real benefits accrued to my strength. If you're 70 years old or just have not lifted anything heavier than your purse for the past several years - and I'm not knocking you if that's the case - these exercises might be useful. For me, they're laughable. And I'm not THAT strong.There's more, but those are the major points.So what made me give this book 2 stars? Strictly this: It's packed with all kinds of motivational tools. This is something I'd never seen to this extent in a weight-loss book, and I think they might actually help me (with the glaring exception of his online support \\"club,\\" as I refuse to shell out the bucks for it). There are journaling tips, lists of empowering books, weight-loss websites, motivational magazines, etc. So I think I might actually be able to adapt some of it for myself. It might even be worth what I paid for it, if I can get past my annoyance with the rest of it...."},{"Title":"8 Minutes in the Morning for Extra-Easy Weight Loss: Guaranteed to shed 2 pounds a week (No equipment required, No calories counting, No deprivation)","review":"1-The eating plan: simple and easy to follow.

Selected poems of Robert Browning, (Riverside college classics)","review":"This is the opening of one of Browning's most well- known poems \\"Rabbi Ben Ezra\\"Grow old along with me!The best is yet to be,The last of life, for which the first was made:Our times are in His handWho saith ' A whole I planned,Youth shows but half; trust God: see all,nor be afraid!'Browning is a poet of the inner life.His dramatic monologues are in the words of F.B. Pinion the editor of the Collins Edition of ' Dramatis Personae' centered on ' the thought- processes and mental outlook of his characters than in dramatic action\\" Thepoems are rich in consideration of the moral and religious problems of his time. Lovers of poetry and students of human relationships can certainly be enriched by the reading of these poems."},{"Title":"... Selected poems of Robert Browning, (Riverside college classics)","review":"Born (as was Charles Dickens) in 1812; died (as did Gerard Manley Hopkins) in 1889, Robert Browning (part Romantic, part Victorian, and certainly part Modern) remains one of the most influential yet controversial literary giants of the 19th Century. Controversial? Henry James called him \\"a poet without a lyre.\\" Oscar Wilde acknowledged that Browning had a lyre but that its strings were broken, famously remarking, \\"He used poetry as a medium for writing in prose.\\" Yet both men admired him as a consummate creator of character, even rivaling Shakespeare. These evaluations notwithstanding, those of us who vaguely remember Browning from high school as the quintessential composer of blank-verse dramatic monologues, will perhaps be surprised and delighted at the range of rhythmic -- and rhyming -- patterns the poems in this collection show. Indeed, in a market fairly saturated with wonderful Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Robert Browning offerings, it was savvy of acclaimed British actor Greg Wagland to concentrate here on shorter, lyrical poems that I, as a casual Browning fan, was unfamiliar with.But how, with the aforementioned embarrassment of riches, does one choose one Robert Browning audiobook? If, as publisher-critic Michael Schmidt has written, \\"we read [poetry] with our ears,\\" I would rephrase this by saying that if we're lucky, we also hear it with our eyes. But I'm not lucky; unlike prose, I MUST HEAR poetry spoken (performed?) out loud, and the nature of (especially) this particular poet's oeuvre is such that he demands to be heard in dramatically polished recordings such as this one by Wagland -- the new kid on the Browning block. (At Audible you can also compare veteran voice actors David Timson and Patience Tomlinson's superb collaborationThe Great Poets: Robert Browning, with James Mason's iconic portrayals of disturbed priests and uxoricidal husbandsThe Poetry of Browning; you can purchase 3 to 15-minute readings by Cathy Dobson, or at the other extreme Frederick Davidson's 5-hour (!) monotone marathon (Robert Browning: Selected Poems). Obviously narrators differ in vocal tone and timbre, as well as interpretive approach. For these reasons alone you and I may prefer different readers. On a theoretical continuum from straight-up reading to the over-wrought ACTING so preciously satirized by Jon Lovitz's \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketches, Greg Wagland lands in the golden middle: not quite understated; pensive but not subdued. That said, unlike say Davidson (who always sounds like Davidson), Wagland's tone varies as it should depending upon the poem, and his interpretations are always moving and dead on.The poems on this audiobook, listed in ORDER, are: 1. The Bishop Orders his Tomb at Saint Praxed's Church 2. The Lost Leader 3. Love Among the Ruins. 4. Up at a Villa, Down in the City 5. A Woman's Last Word 6. A Toccata of Galuppi's 7. Love in a Life. 8. Life in a Love. 10. Two in the Campagna 11. Dubiety 12. Apparent Failure 13. Prospice 14. Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister 15. A Grammarian's Funeral 16. Pictor Ignatius 17.

Unlike the majority of other \\"self help\\" literature I had seen up to that point, this book didn't paint a dreary picture of spending year after year, wallowing in my own navel, forever progressing towards \\"health\\" without actually attaining it; as is often the case, especially in the 12 Step programs.The Guide is a no-bulls**t manual for approaching psychological and emotional disturbances and bad habits, hitting them \\"at the base of the flame\\" as it were, and providing the reader with a solid roadmap to navigating out of even extreme emotional and psychological problems.Nothing replaces a solid therapist, but where many therapists try and sell you on the idea that you're going to have to spend a lifetime on the couch, the Guide emphasizes PROGRESS over all else, insisting that we are CREATORS of our own thought processes and our own paradigms, instead of PRISONERS of the damage done to use by past harms, childhood, et al.Now, if you're perfectly comfortable being addicted to \\"self help\\" and enjoy shelling out thousands every year just to sit in a therapist's office, traveling endlessly down past roads without actually moving a single inch into your future, then you won't want this book.But if you are SICK of yourself, or how you act, or how you think, or how you feel, and you want to know how to make some BIG changes and make them LAST, I think there has not been a better text written on the subject, both in terms of practical application and in terms of being time-tested and true. This is not a \\"fad\\" or a \\"cult\\" fix. This is bald, often brazen \\"slap you upside the head\\" wisdom which cuts through the touchy-feely jargon and endless murk, so that you can start feeling AND acting better, right now, and make REAL CHANGES in yourself, for now and for the future.Want to know more?

This book is even better than,The Road Less Traveled, 25th Anniversary Edition : A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth, in my opinion. Take this passage from page 99: \\"Adults often act in an immature, childish manner. One of the essences of their humanity is fallibility. Consequently, they find it exceptionally easy to do sloppy, wishfulfilling thinking. And thereby often get what they don't want. But the fact that you may easily behave childishly doesn't mean that you must. You can teach yourself to practice mature, reflective thinking. If you do, you will hardly be completely level headed or happy. But you can train yourself to rarely feel desperately miserable or depressed.

I also think it is one of the best.REBT is built on the idea that our thoughts cause our emotions and influence our behaviors. Ellis believed that people can change their emotions as well as their behaviors by disputing their irrational thoughts with facts and reason.In this book he goes through what he believes are the top 10 irrational ideas that cause most people to experience unpleasant emotions needlessly.Ellis is not known for being a great writer, but in this book he pulls it together. The tone is direct as well as clear, free of psychobabble, and you never doubt that you are being addressed by one of the great psychological minds of the 20th century.Dr. Ellis views evolved substantially over the decades and many editions of this book. To get a modern view of the concepts that Dr. Ellis considered to be the most important I would recommend starting the book at chapter 20, going to the end and then starting from the beginning.Beware, there are multiple editions of this book. To get the latest edition with the most content make sure you have the 3rd 1975 (august) edition. For some reason some book sites list this publishing year as 1997.

And it started to make sense.I have been in therapy from time to time and I did gain some skills from group therapy years ago, but nothing has ever been as helpful as this book. As some of the more thorough reviewers here have noted, it explains very clearly how to deal with your emotions and, if not as well-written as some newer books, it is still highly readable and easy to get through.

Identified, questioned, examined, uprooted and replaced with more realistic -- and functional -- notions, they can become the foundation for a belief and appraisal system by which anyone can cope with pretty much any curve ball life pitches at them.However radical, as well as grandiosely expressed some of his ideas may seem; Basco, Beck, Seligman, Wessler, Young and all who have ridden on his coattails owe a debt to Albert... not to mention the millions whose lives have been saved and/or greatly improved by disovering for themselves how things really -are-... as opposed to what they -think- they are.There are a lot of Ellis-authored books available, but having read several of them (as well as many of Aaron Beck's), it seems to me that this one stands out as the seminal piece for professional and lay readers alike.

The authors believe that self-analysis, no matter how limited it is, can be useful, and that human emotions and feelings do not magically exist in their own right. Rather, they stem directly from ideas, thoughts, attitudes, or beliefs that can usually be radically changed by modifying the thinking processes that create them.They explain how rational analysis helps you to search out and forcefully attack the root of emotional problems and do it successfully, without the necessity of years of long, drawn-out psychoanalysis.Here in straightforward language, without the use of technical terms or professional jargon, you will learn how to recognize neurotic behavior ... overcome the influence of the past ... erase dire fears of failure ... conquer anxiety ... acquire self-discipline ... overcome inertia and become creatively absorbed in the world around you.This book will give you a lucid explanation of a sound new approach to psychotherapy - its meaning, its application and its potential in our irrational world of today.--- excerpts from book's end page"},{"Title":"A guide to rational living,","review":"This book has helped me make major changes in my life.

Written for the general public, but frequently used by practitioners, it describes all aspects of Ellis' theory and how to apply the theory to specific problems.This book includes chapters on:How Far Can You Go With Self-therapy? (chapter 1)Thinking Your Way Out of Emotional Disturbance (chapter 5)Overcoming the Influences of the Past (chapter 7)Tackling Your Dire Need for Approval (chapter 10)Reducing Your Dire Fears of Failure (chapter 11)Conquering Anxiety and Panic (chapter 15)Research Evidence to Support the Principles and Practice of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (chapter 22)This book is a moderate read, and is written for the person who wants to learn more about REBT, and who is willing to invest some time and effort in learning. Therefore, this book would not be for the person who wants a quick, easy read. Also, when buying this book, make sure that you get the third edition. Ellis has continued to revise his theory since originally publishing this book in 1961, and has made subtle changes along the way.Overall, I prefer Ellis' writing style to most other authors. He is clear, leaving few unanswered questions. He describes his theory in a way that makes sense.

The Authors purport to explain Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy and how it can be used to improve your life. Basically, we take a small upset, and through unhelpful (irrational) beliefs make it seem a catastrophe: ie. A student fails an exam and instead of saying, \\"This is disappointing and I'm upset about it,\\" instead says, \\"I'm a complete FAILURE in life!\\"While they do a good job of explaining in exhaustive detail the concept that we often take small upsets and exaggerate their meaning through our beliefs into great upsets, they do not present any clear program or exercises to change this behavior. In short, a self-help book this ain't. I was looking for something to better help me deal with depression, and the frustrations and upsets of life, but after reading this book felt I got nothing out of it, and am returning it. I really wanted to like this book, but:- The writing style is sometimes difficult to understand, and often seems smug, condescending, and harsh toward the patients described.- Nothing in the book tells you 'What to Do' to cure your unhappiness, even the chapters which seem to promise exactly that deliver nothing.- There are no exercises or writing assignments, it seems the authors expect you will get better from simply reading, or rather, don't expect it.- The entire first chapter is devoted to telling you that without a therapist you will never see major improvements. While this may be true (due to our own blindspots) the book devotes itself to explaining REBT without even trying to offer any help or advice on using the techniques.In short, while I now understand some of REBT and feel a trained REBT therapist could be of use, I don't feel this book offers anything of value in changing our moods and behaviors, except the understanding that we often make things worse than they are through exaggerating beliefs. I will now try instead the highly recommended:The Feeling Good Handbook,Mind Over Mood: Change How You Feel by Changing the Way You Think, andFeeling Good: The New Mood Therapy Revised and Updated."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living,","review":"Step One: getting past your ego defenses at least enough to see that your problem is you.

His book \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" isn't new, but it's still one of the best guides for anyone ready for \\"Step Three\\". This isn't a clinical treatise abounding with \\"shrink-speak\\", but something more akin to a very erudite grandfatherly talk ... a conversation that contains a lot more common sense than nebulous theory, with wisdom that you'll find immediately useful.

Although I am not depressed and don't consider myself to have &quot;a problem&quot;, I learned a great deal from this book. I have redefined a lot of &quot;musts&quot;, &quot;oughts&quot; and &quot;shoulds&quot; that I had created for myself. I really like the part where the authors recommend the readers to focus on the enjoyment of doing things rather than focus on being good at them. Especially defeating is to work at something in order to become better than others.Another great point is trying to direct less negative energy towards what other people do and how they choose to act. In a democracy, they may do as they please, and is it really worth the time and effort to try and make them change? Or even worse, just upset yourself about it, without even considering to influence them to change? There is a woman in my yoga class that always irritated me by commenting on everything we did in class and sometimes brought things to eat into the exercise room. Instead of directing energy towards her behavior and on how she was influencing the effects of my training in a negative way, I should have been minding my own business and not let myself be bothered.

He emphasizes his point that we largely create our own emotions by thinking in certain ways. He also says other people and situations work only as a trigger, but they do not cause emotions in us. He explains logically and carefully how we can change our thoughts and as a result change how we feel about ourselves, other people and situations. I love this book. So I bought some more of his books, and his same technique is used in all the books I have read. He is very consistent with himself, clear, and is a good writer. Using his REBT technique is not something easy. Making any significant and constructive change in life cannot be done overnight, but only with persistent practice and effort. I recommend this book to anyone. Yes, absolutely any one of us will be able to benefit from this book somehow. For me, this book gave me a chance to grow up further.

I know it may be hard to believe that a book can improve your life but the ideas in this book did just that. If you're not familiar with REBT,you will be after reading this book. It is a simple technique that you can apply to anything that is bothering you about yourself or your life. It's helps you to work on your thoughts. And no, it's not easy, it takes work, but it is possible. I have bought this book several times always to give it away to someone else.

It is rooted in Irrational belief #2, as referred to in this guide -- the idea that you have to be totally competent and achieving. Constantly believing this led me to perceive that nothing I was ever doing was enough, and also led me to compare myself with everyone to see who had achieved more. Overall, I would feel great when I fared better than someone but would become unnerved when I was worse off. This book helped me to see how destructive and unproductive this is. The authors go as far as calling people with this sort of irrational belief &quot;disturbed.&quot; I didn't like that much until I realized that it is essentially true -- there is no benefit or reason to hold such distorted ideas. Now that I am aware of where my &quot;disturbed&quot; thoughts are stemming from, I can put an end to them by dispelling my irrational belief.

No longer would we have to settle for self-help pablum like \\"The Power of Positive Thinking\\", because now we had a piercing book for the masses that explained both clearly and thoroughly three things that no popular work had ever told us before. First, we don't just \\"get\\" upset, we \\"do\\" upset. Or, in other words, we make ourselves emotionally disturbed. Second, the authors plainly explain how we make ourselves upset. We create our own emotional disturbances mainly through our irrational (aka, unhealthy, self-defeating) thinking. And third, Ellis and Harper give us many effective techniques to combat these thinking patterns. The techniques suggested are divided into cognitive, emotive and behavioral categories, although in fact there is significant overlap for the simple reason, as the authors point out, that we don't just think or feel or behave in a vacuum. Rather, we are thinking/feeling/behaving beings, and this interplay, luckily enough, offers us many ways to a \\"profound philosophic change\\", which is the goal of this work.

One of Bill Gate's all-time favorite books."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living,","review":"The field of psychology is in disarray. What began in the late nineteenth-century as an exploration into the dynamics of the mind (i.e., psyche) and human behavior has been torn asunder by the variant \\"schools\\" of psycho-dynamics. After years of psychoanalysis, more people found \\"relief\\" in Wayne Dyer's \\"Your Erogenous Zones\\" than benefitted from twenty years of Freudian or Jungian psychoanalysis. With the advent of TCAs and SSRIs, even more people found relief in a little pill than in two centuries of talk therapy. What we know or don't know about psychiatry and psychology is more baffling now than ever will. For whatever it is worth, the human psyche is more evasive than tangible, and I'm not sure more damage than good has been done under its various mentors.I have come to believe that three aspects of human behavior are unquestionable: (1) What we learned as children plays a more significant role in human dynamics than we'll ever know; (2) no matter what era one lives in, there's always a degree of alienation, anger, and angst; and (3) that certain chemical imbalances in the brain play an important, if not vital, role in how we adapt to life in general, and to change in particular. Treatment of neurosis and affective disorders usually requires that we adapt better than we have, and \\"traditional\\" psychoanalysis has been found seriously wanting. That having been said, I want to evaluate two books outside that domain and within the domain of \\"self help\\" that appear to be of enormous benefit. They are: (i) Albert Ellis' and Robert Harper's \\"A Guide to Rational Living, and (ii) Elliot Cohen's \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\"Both books are in the domain of Cognitive, or Rational-Emotive, Behavioral Therapy. The more I've studied the historical, intellectual, and hermeneutic influences from the Hellenistic Period, the more I am convinced that the cognitive \\"therapy of desire\\" and the cognitive \\"treatment of upheavals of thought\\" play a significant role in how we adapt to our daily lives than anything approaching Freud or Jung will ever do. Simply by changing our attitudes, reactions, and plights against our most basic emotions, the more we are adept at, and adapt to, leading more successful, healthy, and balanced lives. Both \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" and \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" are in this latter venue. Both books are invaluable in teaching the reader how to overcome obstacles in one's life in a way that is both realistic and therapeutic.The first misconception to get over is that the passions (i.e., emotions) are somehow separate and distinct from our ratiocinative faculties of the mind. Both cognitive and evolutionary psychology have demonstrated, without argument, that the two function occur within the same mental framework (cf., Daniel Goleman's \\"Emotional Intelligence,\\" which locates all emotions in the amygdala). The second misconception to overcome is that emotions, qua emotions, are generally unhealthy, e.g., the Stoics. Take one example: The fright/flight response is an evolutionary response to fear that all of us animals, including human ones, have for self-preservation. This emotion, like many others, are key to our survival. As Martha Nussbaum argues cogently, even love and compassion are survival-oriented emotions (see her \\"Upheavals of Thought.\\").Most debilitating emotions arise because we have not taught ourselves how to think/emote rationally. Both books argue and attempt to treat this. The difference between the two is that \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" is less adept at how to change our rational control over our emotions, while \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" explicates the process in considerable detail. Either book is better than nothing, but clearly the later gives explicit directions on how to overcome irrational thinking. Aristotle (yes, him) distinguished between theoretical and practical reasoning over two millennia ago, and his assessment has not been devalued over time. In practical reasoning - the reasoning that determines how we act either ethically or emotionally, one begins with a universal premise, then supplying a particular premise, and then coming up with a conclusion or action. For example: \\"Do good, avoid evil\\" is a universal premise; than add the particular premise: \\"If I am good to John, he'll be good to me.\\" In this case the universal premise is probably correct, but the particular premise is fallacious. Just because I love John does not mean he'll love me. When John fails to be good to you, the usual response is something like, \\"he hates me,\\" \\"because he hates me, I am no good,\\" \\"you idiot, I did my best, and you didn't reciprocate,\\" etc. Sometimes, it's because of a faulty universal premise: \\"If I'm good, others should be good.\\"In either case, both universal and particular premises are irrational. First, no one is wholly good, and secondly, even if one believes himself good, doesn't mean someone else is.Both books illustrate the fallacies of such arguments. And, once one sees the fallacy of this kind of argument, the more one feels anger, frustration, and depression dissipate. I personally think, \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" brings out these fallacies more clearly, but both books touch on the same irrational beliefs that lead to the same irrational emotions. Whether it is the universal premise or the particular premise, or both, that cause our fallacies and lead us into emotional grief, it is, after all, our faulty thinking that leads us to disappointment, anger, frustration, depression, etc.. Learning how to detect and correct such premises is what both books are about. \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" tends to be more attractive to those who are more \\"rational\\" about their thinking process, whereas \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" tends to more attractive to those who are more emotive. Both books will get you to the desired end. And either book will \\"get you there\\" for less than one-fifth the price of a single psychoanalysis. And, for those seriously depressed, another book worth considering is \\"Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy,\\" which also uses CBT to alleviate much distress. I wasn't impressed with it as I was the other two. But whatever you do, invest in at least one of these books; unhealthy emotions and depression are not necessary, as each shows."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living,","review":"After reading Ellis' &quot;Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy,&quot; I must say I am disappointed by this book. The flashy, self-helpish cover should have been a clue: this is strictly for the layperson, and even there it is not spectacular.The authors were speak down to the reader. The language is simple and repetitive. In addition, the authors spend far too much time discussing other types of therapies, why rationality does not conflict with emotion, and so forth, rather than on how and why their therapy works.I suspect, from the cover, language, and design of the book that the authors were primarily motivated by profit. For instance, there is a whole chapter, *the first chapter*, on how one should always seek professional help rather than administer help for oneself. While in extreme cases this is understandable, it is simply insulting to the reader's intelligence to suggest that he or she cannot help themselves properly.There are more criticisms of the book, but I have a sincere respect for Dr. Ellis and in no way do I wish to dissuade others from using REBT. I merely want to warn those looking for hardcore information to steer clear of this poorly constructed book.If you want better books on cognitive therapy, read Ellis' more scholarly works or Epictetus' Handbook."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living,","review":"read this book more than 10 yeas ago, bought this one as a gift.

By being skeptical about things and using the information and excercises this book provides, one can prepare himself to deal with a world that is mostly insane.

If you absolutely have to read self-help books, I wouldn't want to discourage you from reading this one. It is, in fact, one of the better ones.What I think we all should do when we read self-help, however, is question the source. Who is this guy who is telling me all these things? Has he gotten where he is by the sheer application of his own techniques, or by other methods as well? Is he telling the entire truth, or is he just giving me a statement of his own opinion in a way that is very persuasive? Whoever gave him a monopoly on rationality?I have been depressed severely for a number of years and I have tried to become happier simply by altering my thinking patterns. I think you deserve to know it hasn't worked for me so far. Granted, it is a step in the right direction, but for some of us other things are required. For some people, it might be pills (medication). For others, it might be opportunity.For me, however, to be told I am simply being irrational is an insult. Sometimes feelings are irrational, and sometimes they are not.I do not want to deter you from reading this book because to do so might mean that you would turn to other books which could be much less helpful to the average person. I may seem a bit extreme but there are two sides to every issue and every side deserves a chance to be heard.Books like this are good, but they are not a panacea, and they are not a substitute for social action where appropriate (I think Ellis may have mentioned volunteering in his book, but I can't remember). We can't make all of our problems go away just by thinking them away.I would say, get this book, and if it is helpful to you as it has been to many people, that's great.

No book can really be so good. I read the book awhile ago, and liked it, but I don't think any book deserves to get so many five star ratings.Please keep in mind that what I am about to say has much to do with being a devil's advocate, and should not be construed as giving advice.First of all, I HATE the use of the world \\"rational\\". What Dr. Ellis seems to be saying is that being unhappy is irrational. I strongly disagree. This world can be very intense, and there are many problems to deal with. Dr. Ellis says that when we expect too much, we are bound for disappointment. He is entirely correct in saying this. But I do think that people have a right to expect AT LEAST A LITTLE out of life, and some people get nothing at all.While Dr. Ellis may be right that much unhappiness may be somewhat irrational, I don't think he is universally right.One thing I have always thought is that people don't pay enough attention to the fact that many of these authors have a good education, intelligence, and make pretty good money from writing books. Many times they are also attractive. Writing successful books confers self-esteem on the author. They receive much attention and gain respect.Sometimes I think that depression is very rational, and I also believe that suicide is sometimes rational. People often have a pretty realistic assessment of their situation in life.You mean to tell me that if Dr. Ellis was never able to graduate from high school, and instead of going to college he was sent to prison, was gang raped, had no friends, and so on, that he would honestly be able to tell himself \\"oh, well, I guess I haven't done well so far in life, but I can still be happy\\". Gimme a break!Now naturally, most of us don't fall into such an extreme category, but I think by using such extreme examples we can see how ridiculous it all is. Yes, in most cases, people have the potential to be happier than they are, but certainly not all the time. There are even bound to be some people with very troublesome backgrounds who go on to achieve much success in life. But we shouldn't ignore that statistically, the odds are against that person.Let's all be optimistic about the possibilities life holds. But lets also be sober about the true facts of our life. There is much about life that is irrational, including some facets of your book, Dr. Ellis.I don't think everybody has a chance to have self-esteem. I really don't. Self-esteem is based on real accomplishment, and many of us do not accomplish much. Maybe that's what you will talk about in your new book \\"The Myth of Self-Esteem\\", but somehow I doubt it. I will have to buy the book used and read it to know for sure.MJ"},{"Title":"A guide to rational living,","review":"Summary: A person is not obliged to be, feel, or do anything in particular, and should not expect anyone else to be, feel, or do anything in particular.

As Old Order Establishments, such as Christianity, painfully pass away, New Religions rush in to fill the Void and &quot;Rationalism&quot; is one of them. The Old Order was convinced that there was something &quot;wrong&quot; with being human, (i.e. Original Sin, The Fall, Ad Nauseam), and Rational-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,(sounds Orwellian doesn't it?), makes the same mistake, though it pretends not to. Orthodox religion presented to us what was and was not acceptable, what was and was not healthy, and Rationalism has been quick to catch the falling garter as Old Dame Christianity slowly passes into obscurity.

While many psychologists and authors focus on one or several &quot;pet techniques,&quot; Ellis and this book show you how to adapt an integrated set of rational (cognitive), emotive, and behavioral tools to your personal situations. And Ellis writes this and many of his other books for us non-psychologists...not just for &quot;professionals.&quot;The book starts by briefly summarizing the results of Ellis' ground-breaking work on what we do that causes us to feel and behave differently than we want. The author then teaches his general cognitive system...which includes very specific instructions...on how to change these feelings, behaviors, and thoughts. Ellis terms this system the &quot;A, B, C, D&quot; method of &quot;disputing&quot; irrational thoughts that are &quot;irrational&quot; because they (i) are not true and (ii) produce results that we don't want. The book then moves beyond this general system and shows you how to easily use cognitive, emotive, and behavioral tools to effectively stop your unwanted patterns. While the methods are extremely user-friendly, they do require work...beyond the reading.Because this book shows how to effectively tackle a wide variety of patterns...the following is a partial list of chapters:1. Overcoming the influences of your past2. Refusing to be desperately unhappy3. Tackling dire needs for approval4. Eradicating dire fears of failure5. How to feel undepressed though frustrated6. Conquering anxiety7. Acquiring self-discipline...and others.While many other psychologists/authors, such as David Burns in his &quot;Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy,&quot; use cognitive methods, Ellis shows how to use many of them far more effectively than most others. And he also includes emotive and behavioral tools, many of which he created years ago and that his non-for-profit institute has used successfully for decades. While Burns' book has some excellent additional tools, I strongly suggest that you start with &quot;A Guide for Rational Living&quot; and then move on to Burns' book if you want.I've gone back to this and a few others of Ellis' books several times during the last 10 years or so. After working through a new situation, I keep realizing how much this one volume still does for me.In my opinion, the book's only weakness is its stlye of writing. It's older style is less interesting than that in some of Ellis' newer books. I strongly recommend it not for its literary value, however, but for what it can do for you."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living,","review":"The revolution I refer to is the one that followed in the wake of the original publication of this book in 1961. Ellis formally introduced his REBT therapeutic model in 1955, but at the time, few knew and fewer cared. However, this book would change that forever. No longer would we have to settle for self-help pablum like \\"The Power of Positive Thinking\\", because now we had a piercing book for the masses that explained both clearly and thoroughly three things that no popular work had ever told us before. First, we don't just \\"get\\" upset, we \\"do\\" upset. Or, in other words, we make ourselves emotionally disturbed. Second, the authors plainly explain how we make ourselves upset. We create our own emotional disturbances mainly through our irrational (aka, unhealthy, self-defeating) thinking. And third, Ellis and Harper give us many effective techniques to combat these thinking patterns. The techniques suggested are divided into cognitive, emotive and behavioral categories, although in fact there is significant overlap for the simple reason, as the authors point out, that we don't just think or feel or behave in a vacuum. Rather, we are thinking/feeling/behaving beings, and this interplay, luckily enough, offers us many ways to a \\"profound philosophic change\\" in our outlook, which is the goal of this work.

For example, if you believe that the world should be fair, then anytime the world treats you unfairly, you will very depressed.

I agree with Philip, another reviewer, in that the REBT approach is the most profound and consistent way of cognitively, emotively, and behaviorally disputing your irrational beliefs. It not only urges the reader to ask: Where is the evidence for the validity of my beliefs? (like other Cognitive therapy approaches), but goes one step further by questioning the basic philosphies, e.g.: Even if I fail at very important tasks, does that make ME a failure? The answer: certainly not, because I am not my behavior and I am far too complex to be given any single global rating. In the essence it all comes to this: rate behaviors and deeds, but never the total person. Accept yourself and others unconditionally, even if you don't like certain behaviors, and, finally, achieve high frustration tolerance.This book is the best starting point to get introduced to the fascinating philospohy of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy.

Our public wisdom is right. So I come back here after gaining great benefit from reading the reviews as well as this book itself to share my opinions with potential buyers and hope my review would get you to know this book more.Dr. Albert Ellis is an acclaimed psychotherapist. He is the founder of REBT (Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy) and originator of the cognitive behavior therapy. What I admire Dr. Ellis is that he coped with those Freudian psychotherapists back in 1960s, in which neuroscience has not developed so well as today. Today more and more neuroscience studies have shown that Freudian subconscious therapy that urges clients to go back to their childhood to discover their deep-rooted hurt heart would do little to help a person to get over his/her destructive emotions. Recent studies have supported Dr. Ellis's theory largely. Such as (1) Our neurons keep developing. (2) Laziness or over-comfort would not bring about happiness. (3)TAN, found by Ann Graybiel and her colleagues in 90s, is an influential factor of habitualization in cognitive behavior therapy, and proves that our will would change the accustomed way of thinking in our brain to be feasible.The reasoning that REBT explains about our disturbed feelings can be abbreviated into a string of letters: ABC. A stands for \\"Activating event\\" or \\"Adversities\\", IB is \\"Irrational Beliefs\\", and C is \\"Consequences\\". The authors argue that while we encounter unpleasant happenings we will naturally feel frustrated, sorrowful, and sorry. And they are healthy feelings, which are part of our human instinct. So we could avoid badness that we don't desire with these feelings. However, despair, depression, rage these sort of self-downing feelings are another story. They do not stem from activating events, but are the creations of our irrational beliefs. A cannot directly lead to C. They are the irrational beliefs that work right behind our thinking process to create prolonged, self-defeating disturbed feelings.The authors spent a fairly large amount of time expounding on why and how REPT works in the early chapters. They even quoted the doubts the readers might want to ask and answer them with sound argument. The way we think is well explicated. They are very honest: No single self-help book or therapy works for \\"everyone\\" since personal valuation and commitment differ. But according to their counseling records and research their therapy would help most. They recommended you to try out their therapy, read on to see if their words make sense. Along with millions of other readers, my answer is a hundred percent positive.They stated ten irrational beliefs that are the underlying power that holds us back, letting us feel anxious, depressed, incompetent, and etc., with each belief described through a total chapter. In the first part of a chapter, they listed several reasons to convince readers that those beliefs are really irrational, and then at least one case was unveiled to show a clear picture what and how these beliefs are held within. Cases are sometimes generic but mostly iconic. At the closing comments in each chapter there are several ways to cope with the irrational beliefs.Not until I read A Guide did I realize that I have so several sabotaging irrational beliefs that disrupt my psyches. For example, irrational belief #2 \\"The idea that you absolutely must be thoroughly competent, adequate, and achieving\\" fits my profile. I used to be a sort of perfectionism thinker. I would just refuse, say, to write this review because of a bunch of silly reasons- I'm tired, my brain not functioning well right now, maybe tomorrow I'll get sober and so on. And my deep-rooted IB was actually the dire fear of failure. I now know I could value myself not in an achievement-oriented fashion. That IB was even blocking me from clear thinking and performing. In P122 it suggests,\\"...stress your doing rather than perfectly well. Not that you won't find it desirable to perform well. Often you will, because by doing so you gain more goods, services and favors. Fine! But not necessary.\\"I now have found this IB inside me and know how to tackle it. I'd accept myself first before finishing an outstanding work. That's called USA- Unconditional Self Acceptance, and is also the main concept of REBT.Rational thinking is different from positive thinking. Positive thinking is way better than negative thinking, of course. For example, \\"If I work hard enough I'll succeed at exam\\" is definitely better than\\" even if I work this hard I will still likely to fail\\". But positive thinking has its downside: (1) you can't totally control the environment (2) It may automatically lead to irrational thinking without debunking irrational beliefs beforehand: \\"I work hard I'll succeed. So I work hard I mustn't fail. If I fail...\\" That's another \\"MUSTurbatory\\" thinking. Instead, rational thinking is like this: I prefer success so I work hard. But even if I don't succeed I still accept myself as a valuable person.\\" In rational thinking you don't down yourself because of your poor performance. And usually, like the authors argue and to my own experiment, the more you take off your \\"must\\", \\"should\\" IBs the better you perform because you don't let your destructive feelings created by IBs distract you and eat you up.Well, I highly recommend this great self-helper to anyone who wants to lead a better life and get rid of those disturbed emotions. It teaches you to cope with your anxiety, panic, depression, anger, discovering your underlying irrational beliefs that cause them and to gain self-discipline. This is indeed one of the best self-thelper ever written. In short, it's easy to read (with numerous cases shown), easy to understand, and simple to follow."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living,","review":"Albert Ellis is the grand-daddy of modern psychology, and this book is the classic. While many psychologists and authors focus on one or several &quot;pet techniques,&quot; Ellis and this book show you how to adapt an integrated set of rational (cognitive), emotive, and behavioral tools to your personal situations. And Ellis writes this and many of his other books for us non-psychologists...not just for &quot;professionals.&quot;The book starts by briefly summarizing the results of Ellis' ground-breaking work on what we do that causes us to feel and behave differently than we want. The author then teaches his general cognitive system...which includes very specific instructions...on how to change these feelings, behaviors, and thoughts. Ellis terms this system the &quot;A, B, C, D&quot; method of &quot;disputing&quot; irrational thoughts that are &quot;irrational&quot; because they (i) are not true and (ii) produce results that we don't want. The book then moves beyond this general system and shows you how to easily use cognitive, emotive, and behavioral tools to effectively stop your unwanted patterns. While the methods are extremely user-friendly, they do require work...beyond the reading.Because this book shows how to effectively tackle a wide variety of patterns...the following is a partial list of chapters:1. Overcoming the influences of your past2. Refusing to be desperately unhappy3. Tackling dire needs for approval4. Eradicating dire fears of failure5. How to feel undepressed though frustrated6. Conquering anxiety7. Acquiring self-discipline...and others.While many other psychologists/authors, such as David Burns in his &quot;Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy,&quot; use cognitive methods, Ellis shows how to use many of them far more effectively than most others. And he also includes emotive and behavioral tools, many of which he created years ago and that his non-for-profit institute has used successfully for decades. While Burns' book has some excellent additional tools, I strongly suggest that you start with &quot;A Guide for Rational Living&quot; and then move on to Burns' book if you want.I've gone back to this and a few others of Ellis' books several times during the last 10 years or so. After working through a new situation, I keep realizing how much this one volume still does for me. In my opinion, the book's only weakness is its stlye of writing. It's older style is less interesting than that in some of Ellis' newer books. I strongly recommend it not for its literary value, however, but for what it can do for you."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living,","review":"This book was \\"prescribed\\" to me by a therapist when I was struggling with a rebellious teenage stepson. The approach of Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy is to interrupt the cycle of destructive thinking that keeps us locked in unhealthy attitudes and behaviors. In this approach, it is not necessary to define deep-seated reasons for the behavior, but to recognize it as it is and to take corrective action. With time, our new healthy thinking becomes habitual as well.After a few introductory chapters, several chapters follow that deal with specific situations, such as anxiety and panic, fear of failure, and self blame. All are very helpful.I noticed, however, and the therapist agreed with me, that after a few chapters it gets repetative. You can read a few chapters dealing the most specifically with your situation, and have a firm grasp of the overall approach. Then it comes time to start living it! No book can change your life just by reading it, but this book gave me a framework that helped saved my relationship with my stepson."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living,","review":"This book is the most useful general psychological self-help book I have ever read. It is a comprehensive guide to overcoming self-defeating thoughts that lead to negative feelings and neurotic behaviors. It promotes the Rational-Emotive Therapy model, which posits that all negative feelings that limit human potential are based on irrational thoughts. Therefore, one must identify the these self-downing thoughts and systematically root them out and replace them with thoughts that will help achieve greater success and contentment. After a thorough introduction to the process in the first nine chapters, there is a chapter on each of the ten irrational ideas that plague people. Throughout the book there are examples of dialogs between the authors and patients struggling with various irrational ideas and neuroses. These examples serve to inform the self-talk of the reader, and show how to derail irrational thinking and replace it with more constructive thinking. The book may be bit too academic for some: the authors put their theory in the context of Freud, Skinner and primal scream psychologists and others, which makes more sense if the reader has some familiarity with those. The language is all 60s-ish, which does not detract from the essential usefulness of the message. I recommend the book for anyone, at any stage of life, who is struggling with anxiety, resentment, needs for approval, feeling out of control, depression, lack of discipline, fear of failure, or desperate unhappiness. While the book was not intended as a cure-all and the authors recommend using it in concert with counseling, I cannot see how it could do anything but help."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living,","review":"When I started college I was a complete and utter anxious ship-wreck. I couldn't sleep, think straight, and felt like I was going to lose my mind. Basic daily tasks suddenly became terrifying or anxiety provoking. It was a scary and exhausting time for me.On the edge, I went to see my school counselor. She recommended I read Ellis's books and his Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy style. I have to admit, I expected very little. Honestly, I felt like she had passed the buck and gave me a book instead of helping me. However, I was desperate and would have tried anything short of an exorcism to feel better. I read his first book, \\"A new guide to rational living.\\" (I would recommend reading this book before \\"How to control your anxiety before it controls you\\", this one gives more background.) I was astonished. Within a few weeks, I legitimately felt noticeably better. Nearly two years later, I can honestly say his books changed my life and multiple friends and family members who have borrowed my books.It takes time and won't happen all at once. As Ellis would say, you spent a life time learning how to be anxious, and can't undo that in a day. It took me about a year to get much better, two years to completely change my life, and three to be an entirely new person. I am deeply saddened that Ellis died recently. I would have loved to thank him for completely overhauling my life and making me a much happier, outgoing, and less anxious person.PS. Dr Ellis is in fact a well respected psychologist. Even the great Beck recognizes his work. Ellis' work is based on his empirical studies with real patients he counseled throughout his long career. His stuff is not Dr.Phil style non-sense like \\"You're like a shoe with no strings,\\" or the ever classic Dr.Phil statement \\"get over it!\\" I hate when people tease psychological books because Dr. Phil (and others like him) poisoned the entire genre. \\"Those\\" people and first and foremost entertainers.

Both books are helpful and advocate similar methods of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, I preferred Dr. Burns' book because it gives many more specific mental exercises to work on in dealing with different mental problems. Dr. Ellis does apply CBT methods to a broader range of issues and his book is certainly less work to finish, but I don't think it's as effective without all the worksheets and charts to do that are in \\"Feeling Good\\". I picked up a \\"Guide to Rational Living\\" mostly because it was the first popular book written about CBT and I was curious to read Dr. Ellis' take on it.

I think that if everyone read and understood Ellis' insights the world would be a better place. Ellis' ideas on how we can correct our \\"crooked\\" thinking are fairly straightforward and should be accessible to all. The copy that I got was in good condition for being over 30 years old, but the paperback binding had become brittle and crusty so the pages broke loose when I opened the book.

Between third person references, uninspired diction, and disjointed construction, this textbook didn't stand a chance.

An example: insisting that the gender of a Latin word carries with it social reasoning, or more specifically the word \\"victim.\\" Unfortunately for Walklate, the gender of a Latin noun has nothing to do with society and everything to do with grammar. Here's a free tip for the next edition: the word for \\"manliness\\" is a \\"feminine\\" noun also.Avoid this book if you are seeking an accurate, concise, or coherent look into criminology.

Beyond that, not so much.\\"The Borden Tragedy\\" tries to cover all bases in the case, introducing the reader to the major actors and the theories behind the murders, which occurred (I'm embarrassed to admit) in my own backyard -- Fall River, MA, barely half-morning's drive from my home. In the sweltering, mid-morning hours of August 4, 1892, someone brutally murdered Andrew and Abby Borden inside their cozy home with multiple blows from a weapon. A maid, a grown child, a border and neighbors scurried about, seemingly oblivious to the grisly drama unfolding inside. Suspicion fell, naturally, on those closest to the tragedy. But hard evidence was equally hard to find. Were the Bordens done in by those of their own household? Was this s revenge crime related to Mr. Borden's business ventures? Or was a madman on the loose?The book reconstructs in fascinating detail the movements of the many individuals on that fated day, but also in the days preceding. The Bordens were odd, in their way, but not seemingly bizarre. Father Andrew was a quite stern and forbidding man, though not unsentimental. He wore a ring Lizzie gave him as a gift years before. Stepmother Abby was hardly beloved, but seems not to have been detested. Daughters Emma and Lizzie, in their 40s and 30s respectively, were unmarried and still lived at home with their parents. If there were resentments, they were kept carefully in check. But was there more to the family drama than met the eye? While the speculation of moderns minds may tend toward the lurid (weird dad + 2 single women = ?) , the author follows the lead of his 19th century subjects and leaves this promising territory unexplored.The book does a nice job of laying out the rather confusing facts of the murders the subsequent trial, and the aftermath for the involved parties. Though the murders were brutal, involving extensive injury to faces and heads, the wounds are always hidden by shadows, except for a display of the skulls in the trial scene. This minor mercy makes the book appropriate for kids about 10-12 and up who have an interest in the story.The author's only stumble was in what must have been a marketing gimmick on the back cover -- a comparison of the Borden case with the more recent OJ Simpson case. Oh well. At the back of the book, the author does include a few newspaper clippings of the day, giving the interested reader the chance to get a feel for journalistic styles of the late 19th century.\\"The Borden Tragedy\\" gave me a good grounding in the case.

I added this book to my library before going to stay at the Lizzie Borden B&B;, and sleeping in the JV Morse room where Abby took her whacks! This book is loaded with content. Maps of the town, drawings of the house layout, newspaper clippings, etc. The illustrated story is told from the perspective of a family friend, and combines several testimonials.

Also, the graphic novel little more text heavy than some might like. Finally, I would have enjoyed if there had been some more photos of the key players, murders, autopsy, house, etc. That would have made it more of a \\"treasury\\" in my opinion.Overall, if you're a fan of Lizzie, this is a must. You might find a lot of it repetitive with what you already know, but it's an entertaining collection and less academic-heavy.

It's like seeing a movie, or if you really get carried away, almost like being there. The telling of the tale is historically accurate, and each frame enhances what is already a good, condensed version of the crimes. Of special importance are the two drawings Mr. Geary does of the inside of the house. He draws it so simply that it's easy to see which room leads into which with that multitude of doors. A definite read for the Borden enthusiast and a plus for your Lizzie collection."},{"Title":"Borden Tragedy: A Memoir of the Infamous Double Murder at Fall River, Mass, 1892 (Treasury of Victorian Murder)","review":"Mr. Geary... my hat is off to you, sir!&quot;The Borden Tragedy&quot; is near perfect in all it's pictoral details and facts. I can attest to this as I have actually stayed the night in the infamous guest room where dear ol' step-mommy's bludgeoned body was found, had a lengthy conversation with the Borden historian in Fall River, read the interrogation notes and the police blotter from the time of Lizzie's arrest, as well as having dug up as much information as I possibly could before my actual visit so I would be ready to ask a plethora of questions. I can tell you with absolute certainty: Geary has his act together here.For those of you that might not be familar with the term &quot;graphic novel&quot;, it basically means &quot;a really fancy comic book with lots of words&quot;. Be that as it may, Geary managed to cram pack the pages with more information about the Borden case than you can shake a bloody axe handle at. (Granted, there is still quite a bit more to the case... but this is just a comic book designed for light reading!)The illustrations are beautifully intricate and detailed. All the maps of town and of the rooms within the residence itself are accurate... down to the placement of furniture. Geary introduces briefly throughout the novel many of the alternate theories and possible other suspects to the grisly murders. He has done a wonderful job of recreating the entire series of events that took place that stifling summer of 1892.Included at the rear of the book are several pages of press clippings of the time as well as Lizzie's Indictment. The back cover has an eerie comparison of the Borden case to that of the Simpson case a hundred years later.There are about 3 discrepencies I have found within the pages of &quot;The Borden Tragedy&quot;, but they are so minute that they really don't bear mentioning. I highly recommend this book to anyone that has a love of comics, Borden affectionados/collectors, or simply anyone wanting a very brief yet still accurate introduction to one of the most famous unsolved crimes in all of american history."},{"Title":"Borden Tragedy: A Memoir of the Infamous Double Murder at Fall River, Mass, 1892 (Treasury of Victorian Murder)","review":"Rick Geary makes that clear on the back cover of The Borden Tragedy, a straightforward investigation into the infamous double murder in Fall River, Mass., in 1892. While the contents of the book focus strictly on the case, its victims and suspects, the back cover draws various amusing (and convincing) comparisons between Borden in 1892 and Simpson in 1994, from the celebrity surrounding the crime to the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict that closed the trial.Between the covers, however, Geary provides a wonderfully direct account of the incident, drawing on anonymous memoirs from the time they were discovered in a trunk in 1990. While using that typed manuscript as his source, Geary verified his facts with numerous other sources, compiling a fascinating summation to accompany his illustrated narration.The terse account is filled with details that suggest it was written by a close associate of the family. The narrative is written formally, evocative of the time, and Geary's black-and-white illustrations provide a fly-on-the-wall view of events as they unfolded. The book draws no conclusions about the murderer's identity; the killer is always off-panel or shown only in shadow. And, while a small amount of blood is unavoidable in a story of this sort, the book never descends into tasteless levels of gore."},{"Title":"Borden Tragedy: A Memoir of the Infamous Double Murder at Fall River, Mass, 1892 (Treasury of Victorian Murder)","review":"The Borden Tragedy is a helpful reference for anybody who is studying Lizzie Borden and needs help visualizing how the murderous events on August 4, 1892 likely took place.

This book beautifully outlines the ambiguity of the Borden scenario, leaving the reader with both the sense that noone but Lizzie could have done it, AND that there's simply no way she could have done it. This book clearly and beautifully lays it all out for you. With his expert eye Geary's illustration-diagrams clarify things in a way that even a movie can't. The wierd layout of the Andrew Borden house has never been more clear than in his cut-away illustration.Noone understands like Geary, the usefulness to a reader of foregrounding the factual information, which leaves you in a position to think more critically about the events. I find his books to be the most useful authority for getting my head around the facts and movements of the suspects, moreso than in the non-fiction books covering the same topic. Geary's best books bring the crime scenes and milieus vividly back to life. His calm, methodical sequencing of the surrounding events lends an operatic and important scale to some tawdry murders. They are perfect for reading just before bedtime."},{"Title":"Borden Tragedy: A Memoir of the Infamous Double Murder at Fall River, Mass, 1892 (Treasury of Victorian Murder)","review":"This is an illustrated novel to provide a quick tour of this famous unsolved crime. The \`Bibliography' fails to list David Kent's \\"Forty Whacks\\", the one best book on this case. Geary's book necessarily skims over the details; there are no page numbers. If Abby was called to the front door to receive a note would the door still be triple-locked as at night? The position of Andrew on that sofa shows how he was found; he must have been sitting upright (try it and see). The drawing of the barn omits the stairs to the second floor. Geary sums up the arguments for Lizzie's innocence, and covers the other solutions from other authors.The wounds on Andrew's skull suggest a right-handed killer who faced him; or a left-handed killer who struck while Andrew was reclining. Abby's killer would have to be right-handed to hit her right side of her head from the back; or left-handed if she faced the killer. This is one of the puzzles of this crime. The question about Andrew \\"apparently fallen over from a sitting position\\" can be explained by Andrew putting on his shoes to greet a secret visitor. Lizzie was guilty of withholding the identity of this visitor. But her actions were approved by the members of the Fall River ruling class. The back cover compares Lizzie Borden to O.J. Simpson on a number of similarities. The last item about \\"any other individual\\" points to an unknown subject given the lack of evidence against either (no bloody clothes or shoes, no murder weapon). Somebody else did it. It would be more accurate to compare Dr. Sam Sheppard to Lizzie. Both were at the crime scene, neither had blood spatter on their clothes or the murder weapon. Both were correctly found not guilty, but suffered from prejudice for the rest of their lives.You can read about other True Crime cases. If no one in the household did the murder, it was an intruder (or unknown subject). The Borden murders was solved in Arnold Brown's book: it was a nephew of Andrew. Lizzie kept this secret to avoid a scandal. Members of the Fall River ruling class knew, and also kept this secret (except to acknowledge it was a secret). Arnold Brown spent two years researching his book. That was more time than the professional writers used. Brown admits he has no documentary proof for his conclusion, the nephew's birth certificate is kept secret by Massachusetts' laws. There can be no documentary proof of the Mellen House Gang conspiracy because a secret is never committed to paper (else it is not a secret). Brown believes the conflict was over Andrew's will. But a will does not require an heir's presence. Andrew did business from his home, he often made loans to people and foreclosed on their property when they couldn't pay. I believe the secret visitor was there to explain why he could not repay a loan that was due. There are many stories of murder for money in True Crime. Remember the loan from Dr. Parkman to Dr. Webster?"},{"Title":"Borden Tragedy: A Memoir of the Infamous Double Murder at Fall River, Mass, 1892 (Treasury of Victorian Murder)","review":"This is a short but entertaining comic book rendition of the Borden saga.

Now that I've read The Borden Tragedy, I have a firmer idea of why that is.My main problem with the book (as it was with the last one) is the artwork. It's thick, heavy-handed, almost fuzzy in places. I got the idea this is to give it a period feel. If so, I can't really tell you if it succeeded or not, but I can tell you it gets annoying after a while. Secondarily, the book is 90% narrative, rather than letting the characters carry it. Geary is creating docudrama here, but framing it as straight documentary. The end result is, well, boring. And possibly duplicitous, depending on your point of view.A decent overview of the case, but reads like a textbook. Read for research rather than entertainment. ***"},{"Title":"Cain x 3;: Three novels","review":"Cain X 3, by James M. CainJames M. Cain was born in 1892 in Annapolis Maryland and graduated from Washington College at age 18. He worked as a teacher of mathematics and English, then as a reporter and editorial writer at Baltimore newspapers and the \`New York World'. He wrote 18 novels and screenplays (1931-1948). The three novels in this book were adapted to movies that are still classics. The books have more details than the condensed and simplified movies. These stories tell how people strive for wealth and happiness but come to grief or worse through illegal methods used to obtain their goals. These are ordinary people who get involved with wealthier people. The \`Introduction' by Tom Wolfe says Cain's novels were \\"fast-paced\\" and \\"hard-boiled\\" and were notorious in the 1930s due to their \\"sex and violence\\". Tom Wolfe claims Cain flopped as a screenwriter before he became a novelist, yet these novels were written in the 1930s when Cain was working as a screenwriter, an employee of a movie studio.\\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" is the story of a drifter who finds himself at a roadside sandwich joint. Frank bums a meal and is offered a job as an automobile mechanic. The help won't stay there long. Then he sees the owner's wife and takes the job. The story has details that dates it, and the attitudes of the people of that era. Was it based on a real-life crime story? Was this an accident waiting to happen? Telling the story from the viewpoint of Frank Chambers wasn't that original.\\"Double Indemnity\\" is the story of an insurance salesman who meets the wife of a customer. Things develop when the husband is away on an engineering job. Walter Huff does not avoid temptation and trouble, even though he should know better because of insurance statistics. Later he learns some shocking surprise about Phyllis. The best laid plans of mice and men still go awry because of unforseen details. Like some other stories of this era the female is more deadlier than the male. [Was this based on the Snyder-Gray murder?]\\"Mildred Pierce\\" is longer than his earlier novels and more daring in its story details. It tells the story of a divorced woman whose hard work is rewarded with financial success. But a fatal flaw in picking the wrong friends leads to personal troubles, and a loss of her business and the person who meant the most to her. Mildred's grief came from her daughters: one died, the other didn't. The novel is a warning against being taken in by the life of the rich and famous when it affects your family and work. As part of the story, it tells about what is involved in starting a small business. No corporate franchises in those days!"},{"Title":"Escape to Reality: The Western World of Maynard Dixon","review":"I first encountered Maynard Dixon in William N. Goetzmann's &quot;The West of the Imagination,&quot; a book about how America's picture of the Western frontier was shaped by early painters, illustrators, filmmakers and wild west shows. Born in 1875, Dixon stepped into a tradition defined by Charles Russell and Frederic Remington, but his portrayal of Western scenes falls somewhat closer in style and attitude to an eastern contemporary, Edward Hopper. His paintings of the Southwest are about the vast landscapes and the big sky, open spaces of color, light, and sharply contrasting shadow. Human figures are often absent or dwarfed by the scale of mountain and desert.This book was assembled to accompany an exhibition at BYU, which has a large collection of Dixon's paintings, acquired from the artist in the 1930s by the University. There are a great many color plates and related black and white photographs, and the authors have provided an extensive written commentary describing Dixon's career, his work, and his relationship with the young photographer Dorothea Lange, to whom he was married 1920-1934. A central chapter in the book concerns his paintings of Native Americans, whom he ennobled while at the same time turning away from the conditions of poverty, desperation and government oppression in which they lived.Lange emerged as a documentary photographer in the early years of the Depression, photographing the growing labor unrest and the unemployed that filled the streets of San Francisco. Returning from the &quot;reality&quot; that he preferred in the desert Southwest, Dixon joined her in creating a series of paintings portraying these same themes, concentrating on the dark, despairing, and often violent struggle between the out-of-work and the police. The book gives side-by-side examples of her photographs and his paintings from this period.The book does not provide a comprehensive study of Dixon. While he denegrated his work as a commercial illustrator, it would be interesting to see his style and treatment of Western subject matter in that medium by contrast with his &quot;artistic&quot; work. The authors obviously respect Dixon's work as an artist, but they also raise questions about the authenticity of his vision, particularly of Native Americans, and the domestic role into which he placed Lange, whose own career went on hold for several years as she kept house and tended to children. You put the book down at the end, marveling at the images, while feeling a sense of ambiguity about the artist himself. All that aside, it's an informative and beautifully designed book and I recommend it highly.Readers may be also interested in the journals of Everett Ruess, who also loved the deserts of the Southwest, was an amateur watercolorist, and visited Dixon and Lange in San Francisco before his disappearance in 1934."},{"Title":"The Heart of Justice","review":"I just recently discovered Wm. Coughlin by reading &quot;The Judgement&quot;. I loved it and started searching for others. I read Heart of Justice after reading 5 others and cannot believe this was written by the same aurhor as the others. It is far inferior and I'm sure not written by a man (not saying a man could do better) as the way characters are depicted implies to me a woman is writing the prose."},{"Title":"The Heart of Justice","review":"This one was published after the author died over one or two years. It's a totally bad story and bad writing. Didn't look like a genuine work of Coughlin's"},{"Title":"The Heart of Justice","review":"This book could not possibly have been written by William Coughlin!! The writing style is completely different...and greatly inferior to his. The plot is slow and ponderous, and the dialogue is dull and amateurish compared to his other books. It's a shame that his name has been attached to a book that is so poorly written."},{"Title":"The Heart of Justice","review":"I must have missed something, considering the amount of praise heaped on the author on the dust jacket, I thought I was about to read War and Peace. There was nothing new here, and the story line moved around like a heart monitor display - no consistent track - grabs something here, something there. This really is a very disappointing book."},{"Title":"The Heart of Justice","review":"After just a few pages I felt 100% certain that William Coughlin did not write this dreadful book. Read any of his Charley Sloan novels (especially \\"Shadow of a Doubt\\") and you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"The Heart of Justice","review":"I got hooked on Coughlin's writing after stumbling across a more recent book of his. Now I'm reading his older works, and I can see how they've improved with time. While not spellbinding, this was still a decent story. There was little or no suspence, if that's what you're looking for, and the ending was rather abrupt and anticlimactic. Not a bad read, though."},{"Title":"The Heart of Justice","review":"Brousing on Amazon I came across Coughlin's Charly Sloan novels and feel in love with all of them. I couldn't figure out why there weren't more until I Googled the author and found out he passed away in 2004. I felt the same way after Lawrence Sanders passed, another one of my favorite writers who create wonderfully interestingly flawed characters."},{"Title":"Understanding Freshwater Fish (Interpet Handbooks)","review":"To the best of my knowledge, there are freshwater fish and marine (saltwater fish). A book called \\"understanding FRESHWATER fish\\", so I would have thought, would include information about coldwater AND tropical fish, since both are, in fact, freshwater fish. This book, however contains information about ONLY coldwater fish. The title, therefore, should be, \\"understanding COLDWATER fish\\". Also, the author is ONLY Dick Mills; Gina Sanford's name appears nowhere in the book, as far as I could find."},{"Title":"Understanding Freshwater Fish (Interpet Handbooks)","review":"No tropicals were mentioned, which was fine with me since I have plenty of books about tropical fish. I was looking for a pond fish guide, and this was perfect."},{"Title":"Death to the Landlords","review":"This book is also set in India, but with Dominic minus his Tossa who is apparently back in England finishing a degree. I think the book misses Tossa. She is always an interesting character. But we have the indomitable Dominic and a very interesting Swami who is Dominic's mentor. The book is about terrorist plots and bombings and is set in sixties India. But it certainly could be now. Terrorists and bombings are in the news every day. In the book it appears that a terrorist is following Dominic and his party throughout India, and he is leaving a trail of destruction in his wake. The book is fast-paced and has a very surprising ending. Certainly worthy of the great Ellis Peters!"},{"Title":"Death to the Landlords","review":"Ellis Peters unfailingly provides a great mystery, character studies, and beautiful writing. She enobles the human condition without being sentimental. Quite a change in location from her usual haunts, she makes India equally accessible and real. I read and re-read her works over and over again."},{"Title":"Death to the Landlords","review":"Ellis Peters, aka Edith Pargarter, is probably best known for Brother Cadfael. She wrote several other books, some historical fiction (though very accurate to history) and some contemporary to the time it was written. One such contemporary series (now somewhat dated) is the Inspector George Felse series from the late 1960s and early 1970s.This book belongs to the Inspector George Felse series, except that Dominic, George Felse's son, is the protagonist. The book comes after Mourning Raga in the series, where Tossa, Dom's fiance and he first come to India. I don't recall specifically whether Dom stayed in India, while Tossa returned to England for her studies, or whether they left India together and Dom returned alone, or even if the book addresses this. In any case, the book is set in India, Dom is working with the Swami from Mourning Raga. There is a bomb-blast set by terrorists that kills two people while Dominic is nearby with some newly acquired acquaintances. All of his new acquaintances become suspect, and Dom, of course, is trying to figure out friend from foe when a second bomb blast occurs, killing one of their number.The book is pure Ellis Peters, acknowledging the humanity of the characters, the beauty of the scenery and the surprising generosity and kindness of fellow humans in the midst of a murder mystery. There is a surprise in the ending that I suspect most will not have figured out.Fans of Brother Cadfael will definitely want to get acquainted with George Felse and his family."},{"Title":"AR15/M16: America'S Assault Rifles","review":"If it is then it's a pretty good demo tape of various configurations of the AR/M series weapons with a little bit of AR smithing and AR/M specific history thrown in. It's a good one for the kids to watch as there is plenty of full auto goodness put down range. It makes a good round out to the generic rifle training tapes that so many of the shooting schools (Gunsite and Thunder Ranch come to mind) offer in their pro shops."},{"Title":"The Pleasures of Children's Literature (2nd Edition)","review":"It's not a book I'd read for fun, first of all. I needed it for a class and we used it constantly. There is a lot of wonderful information in the book, and most of it is very interesting and surprising. However, some of it is very dry and boring. Such is the case with a textbook. The chapters are well divided and easy to understand, for the most part. A few parts are long-winded and boring, which make it hard for me to understand personally. When I was writing my papers for needed something to back up my comments in class, I could always find what I needed in Nodelman's book.

The subtle message about family and loyality resonanted ideals once common. I related with all three main characters as they stuggle with love, relationships and moral decisions. Mr. Simpson effortlessly guides the reader to new places and aferwards you become apart of this new world.And very entertain!!!"},{"Title":"Urban Web Tales","review":"A must read!!!! Excellent book!! Full of excitement, drama &amp; suspense. It was a page turner from cover to cover. Bishop is my hero! He is portraid as a &quot;bad ass tough guy&quot; but really deep down inside is beating the heart of a big ole protective teddy bear. I feel a part of Micah, Noah and Bishop's lives and they a part of me. It was indeed - &quot;one hell of a ride&quot;!!! Anixously awaiting Gregory Simpson's third book, &quot;Unconditional Love&quot; to see what these 3 get into next. The first preview chapter was dynamite and left me wanting much more. Guess I will have to wait until Dec 2004! I have recommend both of Gregory Simpson's books - &quot;Until Death Do Us Part&quot; and &quot;Urban Web Tales&quot; to numerous readers."},{"Title":"Urban Web Tales","review":"Couldn't wait to start reading this one after having read Mr. Simpson's first work, Until Death Do Us Part. This book was just as addictive. Mr. Simpson's style of writing is such that he brings you into the story physically somehow and you're wandering through the tale with the characters! This installment had me at the edge of my seat and once again got through this book in record time. You are missing out if you've not read this man's work. Bring on Unconditional Love!"},{"Title":"Urban Web Tales","review":"Loved it! This was another page turner Mr. Simpson. He showed how at all elements of society were intertwined: corporate businesses, gangs, and academia. He weaved the paranoia of corporate business' love of money in the seemingly senseless killings of citizens. He showed how money and power are always an underlying evil. This takes a peek in how the internet is shaping the younger generation. Great development of the character Micah. He showed Micah's range of emotions and depth as a character. She is not just a killing machine gone wild. Great to have a woman kicking butt with no regrets. I also appreciate you keeping Bishop a true thug gentleman."},{"Title":"Urban Web Tales","review":"THRILLING and ADDICTIVE!!!! In his second book, the author clearly depicts how a woman can hold down a dangerous career, express her undying love for her man, while being the lovable, huggable and adorable mother to their two year old daughter. Micah's \\"bad girl\\" persona, coupled with her \\"love for Noah\\" is detailed in this thrill seeking, roller coaster ride you will experience in the new business partnership she has formed with Bishop (the bad boy). Their love/friendship for Noah is the ties that keep the new business partnership binded on a professional but more often brother/sister bickering level. The author has a \\"nack\\" for holding your interest, maintaining the mystery and thrill, while educating you on the \\"ways of the world\\". I read this book in one day and am now writing to Mr. Simpson's website to encourage the completion of his third book.

Simpson is the second installment of Noah, Micah and Bishop's story. Simpson's first book, Until Death Do Us Part, introduced us to this trio with the focus on Noah and the murder of his wife. Micah, a government operative, and Bishop, a reformed street thug, were there to assist in finding the murderer. As URBAN WEB TALES opens, we find Micah seeking release from her government job and entering into private investigations with Bishop. We also find her settling into a quiet life with Noah and his daughter. But Micah is a magnet for adventure and to quell this need, she takes on a case that involves more entities than she ever imagined. Set in Atlanta and quickly transferring to the city of New Orleans, Micah and Bishop seek the murderer of Micah's ex-lover's son. As they enter New Orleans, their efforts are further financed by a casino owner and thwarted by the local police department and other thugs. They soon find out that they are seeking people who are acting out urban web tales or urban legends that have left a trail of dead bodies. The question becomes, why?Simpson has managed to tell a gripping story with serious social commentaries.While caught up in the action, messages and truths are abundant and compel you to stop and consider the world around us. Again, poverty, drugs, crime and a new wave of wannabes are highlighted. Well written, spellbinding and entertaining, (Micah and Bishop are quick with the tongue lashings) URBAN WEB TALES will give you pause to consider our world and the operatives that appear to run it! This is a very good piece and I look forward to the third episode of Noah, Micah and Bishop.Reviewed by Dawn R.

I read all the Sweet Valley books and every series. Sweet Valley University is my favorite, but I also love Sweet Valley High. This book is a classic. Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield have fallen for Todd Wilkens. Jessica knows she can have any guy at school- but she's wondering why Todd isn't jumping at the chance of getting to date her. Elizabeth secertly likes Todd- and is really sad that Todd chose Jessica over her. But, Todd really likes Elizabeth, and Elizabeth really likes Todd. Jessica wants Todd, and gets him with a few lies here, and a few lies there. Then, one day, Rick Andover asks her out. The night he takes her out she has a terrible time. He takes her to Kelly's and tries to take advantage of her. The police come, and drive her home. They think she's Elizabeth, and Jessica doesn't bother correcting them until they've sped away. Caroline Pearce sees this, and soon the whole school knows. So all these rumors are going around school about Elizabeth, and Bruce Patman is hitting on her. Then a huge story comes around, a very huge story, and soon the school is only talking about it. The Fowlers and the Patmans are feuding and want to make big changes around the school. Also, Steven confesses his love for Tricia Martin and everyone thinks Ned Wakefield is having an affair with Marriana West. Plus, when Jessica goes to the dance with Todd, she gets annoyed at how little affection he shows for her. The only reason he kissed her passionetly, and asked her to the dance is because of a misunderstanding which I won't spoil. Jessica wants to get even with Todd, so she tells Elizabeth that Todd was assaulting her. Elizabeth believes it, and when Todd tries to talk to her, or calls her, Elizabeth tries to act cold toward him, but feels awful. The book countinues on, and Enid is dating Ronnie Edwards. Soon many events happen, and Elizabeth and Todd are together. They soon figure out Jessica's lies, and tell eachother that they loved eachother all along. They kiss passionently, and know that the reason they were acting so cold toward eachother was because of Jessica's lies. They kiss and share romantic moments. Then Elizabeth plans to get revenge on Jessica. To find out if the plan works, or if the romance lasts, read it!

Though I have to say, it was a good portray of sisters these days, and what I read was just plain sad! At the end, though, i have to say!

You might even love it!"},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"I read SVH books CONSTANTLY from the time I was nine years old until I was a teenager, and will still pick one up occasionally just for the heck of it. They are pure entertainment -- so unrealistic, yet so amusing. The characters and storylines are in no way reflective of any 16-year-old's life, but that's fantasy for you. How else could a pair of gorgeous twins have hundreds of adventures with boys, school, and their family and friends, go on dozens of exotic vacations, be kidnapped, held hostage, get into a motorcycle accident, and lose loved ones, all in ONE SCHOOL YEAR and still come out utterly unscathed? Only in Sweet Valley. Double Love, the first SVH book, sets the scene for every Sweet Valley book to come, with selfish, scheming Jessica attempting to wrangle the prototypically handsome, yet sweet, jock Todd Wilkins away from her self-sacrificing, eternally good twin Elizabeth. Jessica's actions still make me want to scream, and I first read this book about twelve years ago. The most unfortunate thing about this series is that it may decieve young (preteen) readers into thinking their lives will be similar to the twins' lives when they get older. SVH characters tend to be far more independent, privileged and seemingly mature than any 16-year-old I have known. Still, the books are fun."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"Double Love is the first Sweet Valley High-book and that is very interesting. When I first saw Sweet Valley High-books in a store, I bought this book, Double Love. I read it in 2 hours. It was so exciting, expecially because it was the first book that I have ever read from this book serie. This book tells about two identical twins, Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield, who look like each other, but they are still SO different. In this book, Jessica tries to steale Todd Wilkins from her sister Elizabeth. Elizabeth is madly in love with Todd. Will Jessica steal Elizabeth's first true love? Read this book! It was amazing."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"I was in high school when these books first came out, and kept reading them for awhile after high school because each book continues into the next one. I'm not surprised by how many bad reviews this first book received, but it's not a good idea to judge the whole series by this first book. The first five or six books are an introduction of the main characters. And yes, the stories are very unrealistic, but that was the whole reason I wanted to read them, so I could escape to a different place. Later in the series, the Wakefield family does tackle some difficult issues, such as cancer, drugs, and a separation. I can understand where some readers would be pretty disgusted with these books if they were looking for deep reading, but that is just not what these books are meant to give, so take them for what they are and just pretend awhile!"},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"I think the first Sweet Valley High book is the best of all of them. Most people think that twins are similiar in every way, right? WRONG! Jessica and Elizabeth Wakerfield are similiar but extremely different. Elizabeth is sweet, innocent and curtious. Jessica is bold, daring and thinks the whole universe revolvs around her! Elizabeth has a crush on the start basketball player Todd Wilkens. Of course Jessica has the hots for him also. Since Jessica is so outgoing she puts the moves on him. Quiet Elizabeth just watches and dreams it was really her. This book is great for girls in high school because you see the similarties and differences of your own high school. The book is great for girls with every personality out there. Enjoy! (I know I did.!)"},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"This book was great! I thought it could be a little longer though. Whatever you do, read this book first because it is the first in the series. I don't know why everyone thought it was Elizabeth who did what she did.(Jessica really did it) I recommend it to anyone 11 years old and up."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"This was the frist book I ever read when I started reading books for the fun of it and I like it alot beacuse I liked Todd and Liz the most and still do I was 12 then and I am 22 now and I am still reading them beacuse I can't stop reading them so if you like romance in your books you need to read this one."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"The plot was kind of trite, the twins are described as &quot;drop-dead&quot; gorgeous and boy-crazy Jessica is flirting with the guy Elizabeth likes. And the setting, ever-sunny, warm, perfect Sweet Valley gets old after a while. Maybe the twins should have been plainer and have occasional lousy weather. If girls hope to have a good body image realistic expectations, they'd be better off reading about the Baby-Sitters' Club, where the characters are physically plainer, but more interesting with realistic plots."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"None of the best-selling followups ever came close to this first SVH book. Identical teen twins, the studious good-girl doormat Elizabeth and her devious, sexually upfront sister Jessica, are pitted against each other for the love of personality-challenged jock Todd. Will Elizabeth's inherent goodness and true love win out over her naughty sister? You have one guess. But Jessica's manipulations and Elizabeth's masochism make this an unusually enthralling teen romance, and the twins gimmick, a staple for the series, works exceptionally well in this volume. It's quintessentially American, but not quite as sexist as it sounds."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"Two beautiful blond girls with amazing looks and talent live in the sun-kissed town of Sweet Valley High. They are adored by their friends, families, and let's face it, the world. Yeah right. Elizabeth, Ms. Goody-Two-Shoes, lets her twin sister Jessica worm and scheme her way into everything. Liz is supposed to be a brain, but is instead, a whiny pushover who can't help but be boring. At least Jessica is selfish and manipulative to even things out. Um, if you think that's how people live in real life...well, you need to move to Sweet Valley."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"The author of this book does so much stereotyping it makes me sick! I mean, Jessica is the typical blonde, blue-eyed (rah-rah) type cheerleader riding in a red Fiat convertable. Can you get anymore cliched? It gets boring after awhile hearing about the sunny California sky &amp; blue-green water &amp; white sand beach. It's so unrealistic! Everyone is rich, everyone has a pool in their backyard, everyone has cars, every woman is a perfect size six figure. This is not a healthy book for an adolescent to read! A child the age of 12 is going to think she is less beautiful because she is not a size six &amp; does not have blonde hair &amp; blue eyes. And Ms. Pascal needs to be more realistic when it comes to situations in the book. I am so sick &amp; tired of Jessica Wakefield getting her way!"},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"I will relive a special time in Sweet Valley High!!!

I wanted to make sure it was appropriate for her to read. After going to our local library, I got this book. It took me a few hours to read ( it's slightly over 100 pages ) and I enjoyed it. It took me back to high school and the drama that surrounds family and friends. There are several \\"lessons\\" learned in this first book. All in all, I'm pleased. I hope my daughter will enjoy it as much as I did. :)"},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"I too am a SVH addict. I started reading them in my teens and couldn't stop. I couldn't wait for the next book to come out. I had most of the collection and then when I started going out with my girlfriends and bought my first car, I gave them away. I regret doing that now. Now that I can get them for my Kindle I will be renewing my teen years of SVH. At the time I got taken away to adventures and love lives of the characters and thought...... Now, I suppose it will be corny to read, but I will be reading them, even at my age."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"This book is acting like Todd and Elizabeth never met before, when in reality, they've been going out with each other since middle school. I've read almost the whole series, both twins and high school and I'm a true SVH fan! I miss the old times and was sorely disappointed in the tv show. My favorite character is Liz."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"Elizabeth and Jessica are identical twins living in Sweet Valley, California. They go to Sweet Valley High school. So does Todd Wilkins. Elizabeth is in love with him, and so is her sister. But when Liz finds out that Jess has a crush on Todd, too, she drops the idea of him. What guy wouldn't want Jessica? So she swallows her love for him and tries to forget about him.Jessica chases after Todd relentlessly. But he just isn't interested. She drops him once she sees how &quot;boring&quot; he is. This leaves Elizabeth free to go out with Todd, who only wanted Elizabeth from the beginning.I really liked this book. The plot itself is realistic, two girls falling for the same guy. I have to admit that the twin thing and their lifestyle is a little unrealistic, but hey, it's a book, go with it. All in all, a pretty good read. And to think this book was only the beginning . . ."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"I thought that this book was really good. Ecspecially for teenagers in high school. The events in this book are exactly like what happens in real peoples everyday lives. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes young teenage books.

I am also very interested in reading more SVH books because the ones that i have read so far have been great."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"Sweet Valley High:Double Love is a awesome book for middle/high school kids to read. I think this book is like true life stuff. I like how this book is about two twin sisters (Elizabeth and Jessica) liking the same guy (Todd).I think that Francine is a great author because she knows how to put action and love in the same book and make it interesting. When I was reing this book I couldn't put it down.Elizabeth is more like me than any other character in this book.Jessica is a brat and thinks th world revolves around her. She hinks she the best thing but she's not, thats what I enjoy about Francine Pascal's writing.

Enjoy Love ya always Alisha"},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"I'd just like to say that yes, this book isn't realistic, yes, it's steriotyped, and yes, it's a silly plot, but come on! Books are for ENTERTAINMENT. There is not a person in the world who thinks that Sweet Valley is the least bit realistic, and as long as it entertains people, why argue against it? At least kids are reading! When I first read this book four years ago, I loved it! And guess what, it didn't occur to me once that it might be realistic or that these girls could excist. This is a fun book, and I think any girl around the age could enjoy it."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"I'm sorry but this has to be the worst book in the entire SVH series. How many identical sixteen year old girls are that beautiful in real life. Puh-leaze. Perfert size six figures, eyes the color of the Pacific Ocean, hair spun like gold. I can't believe how ridiculous this book was. Are we supposed to believe that two sisters who are really that close would fight over the same boy! As an identical twin myself my twin sister and I would never fight over the same guy the way the Wakefield sisters were. And Todd and Elizabeth have got to be the two stupidiest people throughtout the book. Instead of admitting their feelings to one another we have to sit through Todd pining away for Elizabeth and vice versa. Why didn't they just open their mouths up to begin with? The other books in the series are much better than this drivel."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"SWEET VALLEY HIGH: DOUBLE LOVECREATED BY FRANCINE PASCALWRITTEN BY KATE WILLIAMRating: 3.5 EnchantmentsWelcome to the town of Sweet Valley, hometown to twins Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield. They may look identical, but their personalities couldn't be any more different.Elizabeth is the stereotypical \`good girl'. Good grades, good attitude and at times a little nave, especially when it comes to her twin sister, while Jessica plays her role of the \`bad' sister equally well. Jessica wants what she wants and she's determined to get it, even if that means going up against her sister. She's willing to sabotage Liz's possible relationship with the hottie football captain Todd Wilkins, just because she likes him too.When a case of mistaken identity slanders good girl Elizabeth's reputation, will Jessica finally come clean and admit the truth that it was her who came home in the back seat of a cop car? Or will she prefer to stay silent and watch Todd, not to mention the rest of the students at SVH, believe the gossip and condemn Liz for something she didn't even do? And if she does tell the truth, will anyone choose to believe her?But that's not the only storyline going on in the book. Two powerful Sweet Valley families are after the property the high school football field is on and the Wakefield sisters' father is on the case. While the girls wonder about all the late hours he's working (is he having an affair?), older brother Steven is a mystery all to himself. He's been coming from University every weekend but they barely see him. What's he really up to?The Sweet Valley High series has been revamped and brought up to date for today's teens. Blogs, cell phones, digital cameras, web pages, everything that didn't exist in the original version is here for today's version of Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield.SWEET VALLEY HIGH: DOUBLE LOVE is a good kick off to the Sweet Valley High series.

I remember going to the bookstore about once a month and buying the latest book about Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield and their friends' adventures. I would often read each book in one day. These books bring back a lot of fun memories of my early teen years. I still have a large collection of Sweet Valley High books.

I admit it, even as my 34 year old self, cringes a little bit. I stopped reading the series when I was about 19, too old for the books even then, I guess. About three years ago, when I was home for weeks on medical leave I ordered some online (my originals being long gone) and voila, in a few weeks I was the proud owner of the entire original SVH series, AGAIN. I read them until my six weeks of leave ended but I still kept collecting. So its very odd to me, that just a couple years after I start thinking about them again, they pop back up with a modernized version. I was excited. I have a twelve year old daugter. I wanted nothing more than some cool remake to renew the names of Jessica & Elizabeth Wakefield in today's culture. I eagerly sank into these books when they arrived. I was disappointed beyond belief to see the Dairi Burger completely gone to make way for a funky named Mexican restaurant. What, there aren't any small independent burger restaurants in small sunny California towns anymore? The twins are a perfect size 4 now instead of a 6. There are no sororities and fraternities (which seems legit to me as even in the 80's I never knew a high school with them) Enid has straight hair instead of curly hair, which makes me wonder if they are modeling her after the actress that played her on the tv series. Most of these changes are ok with me, I guess. I don't like that Bruce seems to be missing his 1Bruce1 license plate. I don't like that Dana Larson has become a goth girl imitation of herself. I don't like that Winston seems to play a geekier role than before, if possible. I know I will still buy each of these books. I am dying to see young girls devouring these remakes like I did (hopefully), I am dying for the appearance of the much anticipated Sweet Valley Confidential set when the twins are 26 years old, and I am dying for this New Kids on The Block reunion. Hey, I said I was all about bringing the 80's back."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"I went to my local bookstore and saw they were re-releasing Sweet Valley High and I was excited because now I could finish my collection, I had no idea they were rewritten and when I was reading one of the books in the store I was shocked to realize this. I almost flipped out.I can see the whole email thing and cell phones but changing story lines and characters and other stuff wasn't necessary they pretty much rewrote the second book. This is very upsetting.They didn't need to change their sizes from a 6 to a 4. Teenage girls already have issues about that and now they are trying to say a size 6 is too fat? Since when?"},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"As a self-proclaimed SV addict I followed the series throughout my teenage years and began re-reading them well into my late 20's and early 30's for nostalgia's sake. I was so excited about the re-release, yet after I read the first book I was very disappointed. It's as though the authors are trying to hard to compete with Gossip Girls. I didn't buy the updates and \\"modern\\" language and I doubt teenagers will either. As much as I would love to see this series continue to grow (and I am anticipating Sweet Valley Confidental or Sweet Valley Heights) I think the biggest fanbase will be readers like me- those looking for a bit of nostalgia."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"i have always believed that fiction books are just that: fiction. they are a great way to get away from the problems of real life for a little while and just relax. hello, isn't that what tv is all about? i am 21 now, and i read just about every one of the sweet valley high books when i was younger and i loved them. they are great books, well-written, and give some important moral lessons, even if the settings are not everyday-normal. i would recommend these books to any young girl who realizes, understands, and expects fiction books to be fun entertainment."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"I know a lot of people criticise the Sweet Valley books for being 'unrealistic', etc. That's just what they're supposed to be - pure escapism. I love this book and all the other early books - they're fantastically politically In-correct. I mean, Jessica is such a complete witch but, you can't help rooting for her. Liz is also a great sympathetic character but, at the same time, you can't help wanting to give her a slap. I agree with the previous reviewer about the SV series becoming 'hip'. It's a shame. SV was unique in its own way - by making the series modern turns it into any other Teen book series. I'd definitely reccommend reading this SV book - and any other early books you can get hold of."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"Meet the Wakefield twins. Jessica, the self-centered, self-confidant, arrogant little twat twin, and Elizabeth, the sweet-as-honey good-as-gold, naive, gullible, idiot twin. Both are identical, down to there PERFECT golden hair and their TO DIE FOR blue-green eyes. The twins live with their interior designer mother, who hasn't aged at all since the twins were born, their handsome, equally eternally young lawyer father. Of course the twins have a loyal, caring, big brother, who can pass off for their father (naturally the twins can pass off as their mother) His name is Steven, and all the girls swoon over him (naturally) The Wakefield family live in the glorious town of Sweet Valley, California (a town which proves that it hardly ever rains in Southern California) Jessica and Elizabeth attend Sweet Valley High, where they are loved by all their peers (and several other age groups) Jessica lives for gossip, scavenging off of other peoples' misfortune like a vulture. Elizabeth, the vulture's twin, is more like a love bird. She is a reporter for THE ORACLE, the school newspaper and she loves to solve other people's problems (maybe she's a parrot)I guess you would think that this pair of sunny, golden girls have boyfriends. But no. Not only do they not have boyfriends, but they're fighting for the same guy! (Or rather Elizabeth stepped back and let Jessica go out with him) In this book, Jessica fights for the love of coffee-coloured eyed Todd Wilkens, while Elizabeth sits around, letting Jessica take him. In the end, Liz and Todd live happily ever after, after a guy named Rick Andover almost kidnapped them (Jessica went out on a date with him and got into a little trouble with the police. Elizabeth's name was almost ruined at Sweet Valley High when Jessica pretended to be Elizabeth so she could get off the hook. She's a pretty good sister isn't she?) Jessica, naturally, went out with other guys in the end, not caring that she almost broke her sister's heart when she went out with Todd.Well that's all I have to say about the golden girls of Sweet Valley."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"I was so thrilled when I found out they were rerelasing the SVH books.Then, I found out the shocker: As if a size 6 wasn't perfect and threatening enough, they've gone and made it a size 4!Come on, people! There's enough pressure out there today. Why not the perfect 10, 12 or 14..or why \\"perfect\\" at all?!?!I, for one, will spend my money on the rereleases of LJ Smith's novels, and the new Baby-Sitter's Club graphic novels. There, the only pressure we felt was to find a guy as hot as Adam/Stefan/Damon/Julian, and to find clothes like Claudia!"},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"Even though I've outgrown the reasonable age for reading any of the Sweet Valley books, having not read any of the series, I took out to read this first book out of curiosity. I am surprised to say that I enjoyed reading the book, and am planning to read another as well!This book introduces the Wakefield Twins of Sweet Valley, Jessica and Elizabeth. Jessica is the popular, snobbish and immature who feels like the World revolves around her. Elizabeth is the calm, understanding Wakefield sister who forgives her better half no matter what she does. In this book, Jessica steals Todd Wilkins away from Liz, even though she knows Liz likes him. Of course it also talks about Jessica's meetings with Rick Andover, the courtroom trial between the Patmans and the Fowlers, who goes with whom to the school dance, Ned's \`affair' with Marianna, and Steve's relationship with Betsy, etc.How can people not like this book? Ok, if you are a Sweet Valley fan and have read a lot of books in the series, then you can find some reason why you might not like this book. But for someone like me who is reading it for the first time, its great! It has so many twists and turns, good introduction to the characters, love, jealousy, etc everything rolled into one. Jessica stealing Todd from Liz, Liz mocked for something she didn't do, twins suspecting their parents marriage being destroyed, feel that their brother is dating a drug addict, how much more adventure do you need in a book?I felt that this was a great start to the series, and I definitely don't mind continuing to read the next one to see how it goes."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"The Sweet Valley High books written in the 80's were very clever and the characters and stories were interesting and had depth. Now these have been re-written to reflect the current times but I notice the twins talk like airheads now in this new version and the story and characters in general have declined in quality. Its one thing to re-work sweet valley into modern times but did they have to change what we loved about the characters? I wish they had kept everything the same and only changed the names of places and objects (such as letting the twins have cell phones now and etc.) instead of changing the characters themselves."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"I'm thirteen years old living in a world where the new teen books at Barnes and Noble is all about the trashy, rich Paris Hilton wanna-bes. Most teen books today are all about how much sex you can have and how fast you can get it. Every new book series out is about cliques and how speical and great the girls in them are. I am terribly offended when I read those books. Books like Gossip Girl and A-List should not be in the hands of young girls. Sweet Valley touches on these subjects in a classy, subtle way. It takes you back to what used to be the simplicity of life. They may be dull to girl today, and that's a shame because they teach wonderful morals at the end of each story. Yes, they may cow-tow to some obvious stereotypes, and use some crazy plots, but they are so much more age appopriate!"},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"Thanks for your quick service!

Its pretty pointless, but still interesting. Now i own about 40. Including the collage years and the senior years.

I kind of wanted to stop reading it after a while, but I had to press on because I had to read it for my book report.

When she lands a date with Rick Andover, a drop-out, she thinks she's scored. She ends up getting in trouble and when Caroline Pearce, the school gossip, finds out she spreads it around school, only she believed the twin that got in trouble was Liz Wakefield.

Jessica, being the go-getter that she is, quickly makes her move and appears successful in winning him over. Yet Liz can't help but suspect Todd is more interested in her than Jessica by all the attention he shows her.However, any interest Todd may have had in her quickly vanishes when rumors of Elizabeth's scandalous date with high school dropout Rick Andover spreads around school. The rumor, however, is just that--a rumor. Elizabeth had never been out with Rick, nor would she ever do so. But there is one person Liz knows of who would accept his offer--her sister. Apparently, Jessica had been escorted home by the police after their disastrous date and had given them Elizabeth's name instead of her own. Both girls try to clear up Liz's reputation--one twin being a little less convincing than the other--, but most of the students at SVH don't believe either girl. What will happen to Elizabeth now that her reputation has been ruined? And, most importantly, how will this affect her chances with Todd?In the meantime, there are a handful of other pettier conflicts developing, such as a possible affair between the twin's father and the new lawyer in his firm (Marianna West); a strange secret their older brother Steven is keeping over a girl; another hidden secret by Liz's best friend Enid Rollins; and a status battle between the Patmans and Fowlers over ownership of the high school football field. Most of these stories are resolved by the end of \\"Double Love\\", but some continue in the next book, \\"Secrets\\".\\"Double Love\\" is not to be missed if you're a Sweet Valley High fan, because this is where it all began, nearly 20 years ago."},{"Title":"Double Love","review":"This very book was the start (I think) of an amazing book series created by Francine Pascal and written by Kate Williams.

However, being that Damon is now an established and respected Yankees player, I figured I'd give this book a read just to see what Damon was like when he was on \\"the other side,\\" so to speak. Honestly, I was surprised at some of the negative reviews that I've read on here about this book; people complained that Damon came off as arrogant, they complained that he totally cheated on his first wife, and openly talked about having a cell phone exculsively for one-night stands (which I found hilarious, but I'll get to that in a minute). I don't mean to be rude here at all, but I think that several of the negative reviews on this book came from disgruntled Red Sox fans who were furious at Damon for signing with the Yankees, and were looking for an excuse to judge this book negatively. Don't get me wrong; I dont' blame them, and if I were a Sox fan, I'd probably do the same thing, but seeing as many comments here come from the year 2005 or after (Damon signed with the Yankees in 2005), the reviews have to be taken with a grain of salt. I had to ask myself; If Damon were still a beloved member of the Red Sox today, would some of these Sox fans be calling the book \\"boring\\" and \\"stupid\\"? It's worth considering. Because if, say, Carl Pavano wrote a book, I know I'd be first in line to read it and then slam it, no matter what. Because Carl Pavano sucks. But moving on. Personally, I found this book to be fun, enjoyable, and interesting; it's a quick read, so I finished it in about 3 days. I was laughing at certain parts, cringing at others (like when Damon gives a play-by-play of the 2004 ALCS disaster...like I said, I'm a Yankees fan, so certain parts were hard for me to read), and actually learning from other parts (Damon just a great job explaining just what goes on during player \\"arbitration,\\" something I didn't know about before).I figure I'll just go through some of the complaints/issues/comments people have had on this book and give me own two cents, for what it's worth.Debate Issue #1: Damon comes off as really taken with himself>>> I disagree. Honestly, it's actually really refreshing to have a baseball player just come out and tell the truth for once. What I mean is this: to get to play MLB ball, you have to be really freakin' talented. And you have had to be really freakin' talented since you were a kid. Damon isn't trying to sell himself to anyone; he's just telling it the way it is, like \\"I knew I had special talent as a kid because of reasons x, y, and z and yea, I knew that I was really good and could make it to the majors.\\" Damon gives several examples of why he was special at the game, and he leaves it at that. It's not arrogance; he's just telling it the way it is. I wouldn't want him to be so unendlingly modest that the reader never quite knows why Damon made it to the majors; Damon tells us that he had a rifle throwing arm, a great batting eye, and impressive athleticism. Interestingly enough, one of the things that Damon is criticized for today is for having a weak throwing arm; as it turns out, Damon used to have a cannon for an arm, but he fell onto his shoulder during his school-ball days, and he injured it permanantly, and had to learn a whole new way to throw. So that explains his \\"weak\\" arm today.I call Damon's honesty about his talent \\"refreshing,\\" because I'm so tired of ballplayers downplaying their obvious talent; I don't want some steroid slob to be all \\"I'm the greatest in the world,\\" but when players hit .350 with 40 home runs and 100 RBIs and say things like \\"Oh i just got lucky\\" or \\"oh i owe it all to my teammates\\" or \\"oh I\\"m really not that good,\\" I just want to strangle them. It's like listening to a supermodel say \\"oh you should see me without makeup\\" or \\"I'm really just a dork!\\" It's enough to make you scream. Damon is honest about why he is good enough to be in the majors, and he leaves it at that.Another reason why he's not arrogant? He is constantly self-deprecating; he chides himself on making bad plays or a bad out more than once. When he was with the Sox, he makes it a point to say that everyone had a career year one season \\"except me.\\" He takes the blame for stretching out the 2004 ALCS as long as it did, because he wasn't hitting and he was the leadoff man. Damon is constantly praising and admiring other players as well; it's always \\"this guy was a monster\\" or \\"this guy was the best pitcher I ever saw,\\" and \\"so and so was remarkable\\", etc. Damon praises other players and teammates much more than he praises himself. All of the \\"praise\\" Damon gives himself is early in the book, when he's explaining why he was good enough to get to the majors. Other than that, he's more likely to praise teammates.Damon mentions a few good plays that he has, once he says \\"this was the best catch I ever made\\" and so on, but he mostly talks about other guys' big hits, their walk-off wins, etc. In fact, Damon's huge grand slam that all but won the 2004 ALCS was so glossed over in the book, I had to go back and read it a few times to verify that Damon was talking about THE grand slam, one of his biggest moments as a BoSox player. Had Damon been arrogant, he would have focused much more time and energy on his biggest hit of the season, but he kind of rushes through it and focuses more on the pitching and the other guys' plays.Some people also had issues with the fact that Damon talks about his hair too much; he mentions it twice, and I think you have to understand Damon's sense of humor. If you've ever seen him interviewed, you know how awkward he can come across. He says \\"what can I say, I have good hair, my hair is my strength\\" but the tone is oozing with humor; he's not entirely serious. He also mentions ripping off his batting helmet once to let his good hair \\"flow,\\" and I was just laughing; he's just joking folks. He's like \\"yeah, yeah, it's all the hair, the hair is the reason I'm a good ballplayer!\\" He laughs at how his hair became such a big thing, how ESPN came to watch him get his hair cut, and he plays along like a good sport. But he's laughing all the way, he sees it as a kind of joke/karma. I think people are taking him way too seriously when they accuse him of being obsessed with his hair; rather, everyone else was obsessed with it, and he just gave the people what they wanted. In reality, he was just too lazy to cut it!Debate Issue #2: Damon is a Man-Whore who Cheated on His Wife>>>>> This one is a bit more difficult, but here's the thing: there are two sides to every story. Damon characterizes his ex-wife Angie as a jealous, demanding, needy nag who was very insecure, and constantly accussed Damon of cheating on her, especially when Damon's baseball career began to take off. She was obviously no fool; she knew how women are with hot, young baseball players, and she was not secure enough in her relationship to trust her husband. So i can see her side of it, being a bit insecure. However, if Damon's portrayal of Angie is accurate, then wow, she sounds like a nightmare. Damon says that Angie would accuse him of cheating nearly everyday, for really no reason. Damon says that he wasn't cheating on her until much later, when he knew that their realtionship was going to end, and he had fallen out of love with Angie. I can understand Damon's perspective as well; it's never fun to be accused of cheating constantly, and Damon also brings up the fact that Angie was not very supportive of his baseball career; Damon says that when he returned home after a long season, he would just want to \\"surf, fish, relax\\" and \\"not pick out furniture.\\" I get the feeling that Damon, in other words, just wanted to kick back and have fun and Angie was one of those \\"oh good, not that you're back you can do this, this, this, and this.\\" It's can't be easy being the wife of a pro-ballplayer, but Angie chose not to move to Oakland with Damon, and she routinely stayed behind.Damon goes on to say that once he had finally been pushed to the point of not loving Angie anymore, he did cheat on her. He doesn't try to justify it, nor does he seem particularly proud of it, but he's just telling it like it is. Yes, he does mention that he had a separate cell-phone exclusively for women, and I was lauging my head off. Why? Because Damon's tone sounds like he was just in awe of this whole thing, that suddenly because he was young, handsome, and a major-league ballplayer, every woman in town wanted a piece of him. He does have some pretty funny stories about how he would have a one-night stand and then he would hear on the radio the next day that the woman had said she was his \\"girlfriend\\" and blah blah blah. Damon would just be like \\"oh my god, this is insane\\" and marvel at this new, crazy lifestyle. At some point, he also met his future-now wife Michelle, and he did start dating her when he was still technically married to Angie.Was Damon wrong to cheat? Sure. But it's a difficult situation; Damon says that he only stayed with Angie \\"so I would get to see my kids\\" (he had two with Angie). That's hard; divorce means that one parent is going to get to see the kids more often, and Damon obviously loves his kids. Like I said, I can't be on a high-horse about this because I don't know the whole story and I obviously wasn't there. Damon is very honest about how he felt about his marriage towards the end, and I really don't think he adds in the womanizing thing to show off; I think he's just trying to give people a sense of the temptations that are out there when you're a pro ballplayer.Debate Issue #3: Book is Repetitive, etc>>> To a certain extent, yes I agree. In fact, unless you really kind of already know the game of baseball, you might get a bit lost in the translation. Damon goes really in-depth into certain games, and gives play-by-plays of others, and he throws around a lot of player names, dates, and statistics that might be lost on some people. Like I said, I enjoyed it, but I'm a huge baseball fan who's played the game and seen my fair share of MLB matchups; if you just like Damon but don't really know much about baseball technicalities, you might become a bit bored. I found myself skimming a couple of times, mostly when Damon is going play-by-play over games that I've already watched, such as the 2004 ALCS; a couple of times I was like \\"dude, I was THERE! I don't need such a detailed recap!!\\"Where this book really sparkles is the personal stories that Damon shares about his teammates and the inner-goings-on of the clubhouse; Damon's sunny demeanor really shines through when he talks about the fun times he's had with Boston teammates, such as running across the street to a bar with his teammates in full uniform to celebrate a big win, getting called up onstage to sing with his favorite bands at concerts, and playing pranks on newbies (there is a pretty hilarious gem Damon and the BoSox pulled on Kevin Youkilos). Damon talks about how Kevin Millar would crack jokes about guys' bodies when they would shower, and how certain teammates would throw a football around the clubhouse and you had to watch your back if you \\"didn't want to get smoked with it.\\" Damon's free-spirited nature that most Boston, and now Yankee fans, are familiar with shines through as he talks about doing pull-ups completely naked, or how Kevin Youkilos would set up a dozen chairs for Damon to knock over. I love reading about things like this, like the commaraderie that comes from being on a team, and the funny things like the above mentioned that guys do to loosen up. Apparently, David Ortiz would yell \\"you're all a bunch of bitches\\" and then laugh while everyone else had no idea what brought that up. Manny Ramirez would pit his Reebok rep against Damon's Puma rep and threaten to switch right then and there.There is also a pretty funny story involving Damon, a pot of mums, and a pumpkin, but I won't spoil anything. Honestly, Damon is the type of guy who is like \\"Wow, they are paying me millions just to play ball?? SWEET!!\\" He's just a guy who loves the game and loves to have fun; he says a couple of times that he would be happy just playing in a beer-league. He's very laid-back, but serious about his personal game. He comes across as someone who really revived what was a tired, bitter Boston clubhouse. Damon didn't do it single-handedly, nor does he claim that he does, but he basically says \\"this is why we were special this year.\\" Any boastful quotes that Damon has have to be taken with a grain of salt; it's a guy thing, and it's a ballplayer thing, so I didn't have an issue with it.The book isn't perfect; I have certain issues with it. For example, Damon's portrayal of the Yankees is very biased, at best. He really does paint the Yankees out to be \\"the Evil Empire,\\" and he makes Boston out to be the scrappy, good-guy underdogs while the Yankees are the overpaid, uptight, classless millionaires who just keep stealing Boston's championship hopes away. He calls Alex Rodriguez out for slapping the ball out of a Boston player's hand, and calls it a \\"disgrace\\" and \\"cheating.\\" Interesting, because Damon is quick to say that he does not think that steroids are cheating when he talks about how his good friend Jason Giambi got busted. So Alex alledgedly swiping a ball away is an absolute disgrace, but steroids aren't? Hmmmm. To be fair, I don't consider steroids cheating either, but I think Damon poured on the \\"Yankee evil\\" a little strongly at times. Also, he mentions that after the Yankees took a 3-0 ALCS lead in 2004, Mariano said that Boston was \\"finished\\" and Gary Sheffield called them \\"a walking disaster.\\" I dont' ever remember these quotes. First of all, I highly doubt that Mariano would have said anything like that, and if he said anything it all, it was misconstrued by the Boston press. Sheffield would say something stupid like that, so I have no doubt that he did, but not Mo. He's too smart to say something so jinx-worthy. Damon is quick to jump all over that, and portray the Yankees as classless, arrogant a-holes. So it was pretty one-sided at times, and like I said, the play-by-play that Damon gives can get a little tiring when you've already seen the games. I would rather have Damon's perspective as the games are going on, or what was being said in the dugout during those games.On a final note, it was interesting to read this because there is some foreshadowing; there were already clear signs that Joe Torre, Damon's future manager, did not care for him. Though Damon had the numbers two years running, Torre failed to select him for the All-Star team (and there were rumors around the Yankees that Torre thought Damon was a clown). Damon is clearly miffed about that in the book, and we now know that Torre had some less than flattering things to say about Damon in his book \\"The Yankee Years.\\" In addition, at the end of the book, Damon sounds like he wants to be a Red Sox forever; we all know that it didn't turn out that way because, well, he plays left field for the Yankees now and we're more than happy to have him. It's just strange because Damon was clearly really into being a Red Sox when he wrote this book, and you have to wonder what exactly changed to make Damon sign for the Sox's arch-enemy. We know that the Sox refused to offer Damon a 5-year contract like he wanted, and would only offer him a 3-year. Damon comes across as the type of player who is affable and cheerful, but also someone who can be sensitive and get hurt feelings; Damon was probably hurt by the Sox's offer and felt that he wasn't being valued enough in Boston, and so he went to the team that offered him a longer contract. Who knows. All I know is that this book is a fun, interesting read and it's humorous tone is perfect for the baseball enthusiast or Damon fan. I had fun with it (except for the Boston winning parts). If you already don't like Johnny Damon, then you're not going to like this book. It's very Damon-esque; slightly awkward in some parts, slightly crazy in others, very funny, and almost unendingly friendly; rarely does Damon talk about anyone negatively, except for his ex-wife and occasionally A-Rod (but who didn't have a problem with A Rod a few years ago?). I enjoyed this book, and I enjoy watching Johnny Damon play ball."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"I probably would never have had this book in hand if not for buying it for 25 cents at a tag sale..I am a loyal Red Sox fan, have been for many years and thought I would give it a browse..after the first few chapters I found it to be clearly a ME ME ME, I, I, I, sort of book, Damon loves Damon, that is one thing that is clear in the book... after he left the Red Sox high and dry for the almighty more $$$$$ I really had no use for him..he got what he deserved the first time he came back to Fenway and stood up at the plate..you cant be a Judas and expect to be welcomed with open arms.

It is about the life of Johnny Damon and how he created a spark in the Red Sox which would lead to a World Series and an end of a historic curse. The book starts off explaining Johnny's life growing up and his experiences in high school. The book then goes into his career with Kansas City and the A's. Johnny expresses a lot in his book, from his unsuccessful first marriage to his fun partying with teammates. Later on in the Book Johnny signs with Boston and turns the team around as lead off hitter for one of the best rosters to ever play the game. The Curse of the Bambino seemed like it had once again taken down the Red Sox. However, the team is able to have what I believe is the greatest comeback ever in a series and come back from 3-0 to beat the Yankees.

I thought this book is awesome and deserves five stars. I think it is great because it is very, very funny. Idiot is about how Johnny Damon grows up and makes it to Major League Baseball. He then signs with the Boston Red Sox and helps them win the World Series. Idiot gives you a behind the scenes look at how the Red Sox struggle through the regular season and how they pull together as a team. I would recommend this book to Red Sox fans and kids who enjoy humor. I think baseball fans all over would enjoy the book. Idiot is more for kids who are eleven and older.

It contains some good stories of what life is like in the major league, and shows a good amount of respect for the game of baseball and the players who Johnny has played with.

Damon ran track and played high school baseball, but due to an average senior year, according to himself, he fell to the 35th overall pick by the Kansas City Royals. After six years with the Royals he was traded to the rock-and-roll partying Oakland A's for a one-year stint before entering free agency.With super agent Scott Boras negotiating for him, Damon joined the Red Sox with a 4-year, $31 million dollar contract.Along with his insight to the game as well as Red Sox Nation, its fans and its owners, Damon speaks his mind about the media, particularly the Boston media.He lets readers know the general rule for ball players is to only read national publications, namely USA Today and watch national shows, such as ESPN, to avoid the often scintillating angles produced by the daily local writers.Damon goes out of his way to explain the idiosyncrasies of former shortstop Nomar Garciaparra and the pressure surrounding him on a daily basis and being the center of the Boston Red Sox for so many years. He understood the superstar's plight of popularity, along with the pressure of attempting to bring a championship to Boston along with the days leading up to his departure in 2004.If there is any doubt in Damon's biography, it's that everyone on his Boston Red Sox team are good guys. He truly believes in the line of \\"That's just Manny (Ramirez) being Manny,\\", Garciaparra's aloofness and Pedro's often misunderstood comments to the media.Refreshing in \\"Idiot\\" is Damon's own admission of self-concern when he was rumored to be trade-bait for Carlos Beltran. The trade didn't consummate, possibly being yet another key in breaking \\"The Curse.\\"He covers the Ramirez waiver move, the addition of Curt Shilling as well as new manager, Terry Francona.His book wouldn't be complete without a look at \\"The Curse\\" and the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry which comes to light in his review of the 2004 run at the title.Damon gives the inside look at Martinez's \\"They Yankees are my Daddy\\" statement, Shilling's bloody sock and the Boston media asking when the Red Sox were going to give up and die a dutiful, traditional death.With a World Championship, Damon was able to continue his party animal image on the road, appearing on Saturday Night Live, appearing in the movie, \\"Fever Pitch\\" and reviewing the joy of being in the parade of champions in Boston. In typical Damon fashion he includes in his remarks about the afternoon, \\"Somebody threw a baseball up for Pedro to sign and hit him in the head. I got hit by a girl's panties.\\"So goes the life of Boston's resident Jesus look alike.\\"Idiot\\" is a fun-loving, raucous, loving life look at the life of Boston's Generation X centerfielder in Damon and his band of idiots during last year's run at a world championship. Damon's ability to convey his personal experiences on and off the field make \\"Idiot\\" a fun read for all Red Sox Nation fans."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"I have to start by saying that I've become a big Johnny Damon fan over the past two or three seasons. I was really excited to pick up this book, especially in light of beating &quot;The Curse&quot;. This is a great book for Red Sox fans and baseball fans alike. It goes into alot of detail about Johnny's road to the majors but mostly its a blow by blow description of the 2003 and 2004 seasons from Johnny's viewpoint. Initially it took me by surprise how Johnny sees himself in terms of his talent and his role on his various teams. He came off as vain and a bit of a bragger but after I finished the book I see that he is a great ballplayer and he takes pride in the game, his teammates and his place in baseball and he should be very proud."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"I am a huge Red Sox fan and I used to be a big Johnny Damon fan too.

Damon does think highly of himself, but then again many players do. I could get past that part. What I could not get past was the inaccuracy I ran into 30 or so pages in. Damon talks about Ted Williams dying and how the Red Sox were playing in Detroit at Tiger Stadium. I am a Tiger fan, and I was in Boston to see the Tigers play the Red Sox that day. The Red Sox were home that game, I was there, they had a great memorial for Ted Williams. 2nd mistake was that the Tigers were playing at Comerica Park in 2002, not Tiger Stadium. They had been in the new park for 3 years at that point. 2 mistakes that turned me off the book, couldn't read any more.

Too bad too, Damon's story as a fascinating Thai/American elite athlete could have been penned as a compelling one. Was looking for even a minor crescendo during the improbable 2004 ALCS comeback against the Bronx Bombers but nothing really ever ultimately gelled. The book could have vastly improved from better identification of dates and times and avoidance of extensive rehashing of prior events with no added detail. Saved from one star hell by the inclusion of a pretty good photos section.As if the poor writing wasn't enough, idiot mistakes abound, from misspelling the names of numerous major leaguers (Scott Sauerbeck as Scott Sauerbach, Bucky Jacobsen as Bucky Jacobson) to basic errors in game details. You'd think Golenbock would be improving as a writer after his many collaborations with other sports figures.

I enjoyed hearing about baseball from a player who is not afraid to tell it like it is and is not full of himself. Damon's book makes for a light read that is entertaining and fun. What kept this from getting a higher rating from me is that there are several times where the author stretches the truth to make the book more exciting. In one instance he turns a game winning double into a walk off home run (pg 159). I was at this game and know for a fact that it did not happen the way the author tells it. Overall though worth reading."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"This book prooves the theory that looks aren't everything.

I love Johnny dearly, but stick to playing ball and away from books."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"You can tell this book was written by an athlete. First, Damon does not come off as modest. He's certainly willing to tell you exactly how good he is, and how much he means to his teams. It was a quality I had started to notice during interviews his last couple seasons with the Sox. But, it's magnified in the book. He also gives you the \\"straight dope\\". The book reads like you're talking to Damon at a table in a restaurant, and he's on his third beer.If you're looking for great Pulitzer Prize winning writing, obviously this isn't the place to look. While, not exactly well written, it's worth the read. And, it's quick, so you don't feel like you wasted a lot of time. It contains insight into a team locker room, and gives an insider's thoughts on the events of a baseball season. It explores the issues of \\"distractions\\" that the media likes to speak at length about. How much did the players really care when Pedro bolted early?

The book Idiot is an awesome biography about Johnny Damon's life. When he was a kid, teenager, life in the Minors, as an adult, and life in the majors.As a kid he played baseball with friends and in a league. As a teen he played football, and as a senior in high school he was on an all-star team in baseball. In the minors he got to shake hands with Bill Clinton. The majors were tough starting with the A's. He hit his head, and got a concussion. When he got to be on the Red Sox every time they would try to get players the Yankee's got the player first. To find out more about Johnny Damon's life read the book.Johnny Damon did not use any special writing. His language is not appropriate for people under 12 years old.I feel that this book is a masterpiece. I was surprised, because he used sware words a lot.To read this book you cannot stop in the middle of a chapter. You also cannot stop and not read the book for a few weeks.Any Red Sox fan would like this book. You still should be at least 12 years of age.This book is different from other genres because it is not just a book about baseball. The Boy Who Saved Baseball a fiction book, that is completely fake. This is why Idiot is so amazing.Most biographies go on and on about the same subject, while this one is fun and exciting.This author is different than any other author, because in Holes, by Louis Sachar the book does not push the limits. In Idiot they push the limits.The story is set from Johnny Damon's childhood through almost present day, and is set from coast to coast.Johnny Damon is a great baseball player, and has met important people, and other great baseball players. Johnny Damon did many great things in this book. He pushes limits. He also keeps your attention.

Light reading that provides some insight into the mind of a major league ball player. Damon is no Harvard graduate, but her perspective on the game brings superstardom down to earth. It seems big leaguers are just regular guys good at playing ball. They don't seem to know what to do with most of the attention they attract off field except complain about it or grin and bear it. Not really the nuts and bolts, fly on the wall narrative I was expecting from a World Series Champ, but still an interesting read."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"Damon's book is not a challenge.

I chose this book because Johnny got to live every little leaguers dream and I wanted to know what it felt like to win the World Series. Johnny was born in Fort Riley, Kansas where his dad fought in the army. His family started out poor but now he has become such a huge success.Johnny lived in Orlando, Florida with his mom, dad, and older brother named James. When Johnny was eight years old he started to play Little League baseball and this is where people discovered Johnny's talent. Johnny's family didn't have enough money to buy Johnny a baseball mitt, so a relative gave one to him. The only problem was that Johnny was a lefty and the glove was made for a right handed person.When Johnny went to high school he played for the JV football team and he eventually got promoted to varsity. He also played for the varsity baseball team as a freshman. The summer of Johnny's junior year he got drafted for an All Star team by a coach from New York. His team included Alex Rodriguez, Todd Helton, and Danny Kanell. Johnny had an awesome senior year, batting .305, but he was mad because he believed that he should have been batting .500. At the end of the year, Florida State University offered Johnny a full scholarship. He wanted to attend Florida State University. But instead he ended up becoming a professional baseball player so that he family could have more money.Johnny was drafted by the Kansas City Royals, who got him with the 42nd pick in the draft. He started on the A team and he was the star center fielder for them. He immediately got promoted to the AA team. He was playing very well and he got promoted to the Majors, because the Royals Major League team wasn't playing well. He couldn't believe that he skipped the AAA team. He didn't play well those first four seasons, so in the off-season of 2000, he got traded to the Oakland A's. He loved it there and he really liked playing with Jason Giambi, who was a real team leader. He helped them go to the playoffs but they ended up losing. Johnny became a free agent at the end of the season and he attracted interest from many teams. When he signed with the Red Sox in 2001, he realized how tough it was to play in Boston because of the media. He helped them get to the playoffs in the 2003 season but he collided with Damien Jackson while they were both trying to catch the ball in the outfield in the series against the Oakland A's and after that he wasn't much of a help.When the 2004 season came around he was playing great and he was happy with the new arrivals of Curt Schilling and Keith Foulke. When the Trading Deadline came around the Red Sox made what might have been the best trade in Red Sox history. They traded Nomar Garciaparra to the Chicago Cubs and in return they got Dave Roberts, Orlando Cabrera, and Doug Mientkiewicz. They helped them get into the playoffs. They were down to the Yankees 3-0 in the series and they rewrote history not only by forcing a game 7 but by beating the Yankees in seven games. They were on such a streak that they ended up sweeping the Cardinals in the World Series. Johnny believes that the biggest pickup while he was part of the Red Sox was David Ortiz who helped the Sox beat the Yankees in the playoff series. Manny Ramirez won the MVP of the World Series. Johnny still plays for the Red Sox today and he expects many more trophies on that shelf in his house."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"A great read for anyone that is a Red Sox fan, simply a Johnny Damon fan, or both.

It answered alot of questions I had about how some things in baseball work, like arbitration, and free agents. He does at times seem to come off as conceited, but he keeps apologizing for the way he words things. It gives good insite to the feelings of players toward each other, past and present management, his personal life and his upbringing. He also lets the reader in on some funny things that go on behind the scenes. If you are a baseball fan you will like it. If you are a Red Sox fan you will love it.

Certain parts of the book are a little too drwan, but for the most part, a good read."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"I'm a huge Sox fan, but hugely disappointed with this book. First, it's clear they rushed it to print to cash in on the recent WS win. Very poorly written (which isn't Damon's fault, as he's not a writer) The book jumps all over the place and repeats itself constantly. He continually talks about how the players don't care about the Boston media, but then focuses on it repeatedly. We all know Shaugnessey is an idiot. He didn't have to put it in the book 10 times.As someone else mentioned, he does come off very cocky. Pinpoints certain stats in certain years to make himself sound like the league MVP. He calls out teammates/ex-teammates for specific plays/decisions.I was hoping that this would be an \\"inside\\" look at the 2004 Sox from the player/clubhouse standpoint. Don't buy it if that's what you're looking for. Unfortunately, it's just an inside look at a player who thinks a lot of himself. I was surprised that he came off like this. I expect it from someone like Schilling, but really thought Damon was more down to earth. Oh well. I'll wait for Bill Mueller or Tim Wakefield to write a book before I buy another one."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"I am glad I read this book before I saw Johnny Damon in a Yankee uniform, because the book is boring and could have been written by a tenth grader. Damon is in love with himself, talks trash about his ex-wife and the whole book sounds like a bad tv interview. I can happily look at Johnny Damon in Yankee gear and know it's no loss to the Red Sox."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"Idiot is a good title for this book because it's written more like a high school dropout than a high school graduate. Damon gives very little real insight about the game or the team other than to indicate how cool he is. Hard to believe he even had a ghostwriter for this crap."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"Like so many others, I am also a die-hard Sox fan and was, before reading this book, a big Johnny Damon fan. Still love the Sox, but a Damon fan no more. I'd assume (maybe wrongly) that someone writing their first book would write about the things that matter most to them. It comes as no surprise that the book is mostly about baseball and that makes sense because it's been the biggest part of Damon's life since he was a teen. What are the other most important things in his life? Apparently not his kids. Hardly mentions them. His new wife? He seems to like her, but we get no indication of why. Helping others? Well, if you count partying, I guess so. No, what Johnny really likes is himself. He loves his hair, he loves to party, he loves how he's a \\"go to friend\\", he loves how he \\"takes lots of balls for the team\\" as a leadoff man (he must mention that at least half a dozen times), and he loves to be a passive aggressive critic of his teammates. From what he's written, he seems to have no depth as a person and seems to be living in a perennial frat party.The inaccuracies in the stats, cited by others, are appalling.Idiot indeed."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"I was very much looking forward to reading this book. I've been a big Red Sox and Johnny Damon fan for a long time. Now, I don't think so much of Johnny. I figured, with the book being billed as a narrative on his baseball life, that it would be very biographical--what happened to him throughout his life. As others have said, he certainly did not fail to highlight the amazing ballplayer he saw in himself. He genuinely thinks very highly of himself. It was quite shocking. The one part that really brought me over the edge of not liking the book so much was when he talked about how he should have made the All-Star team, but Joe Torre never picked him. At one point, he also says that he had a chance to be named the 30th man to the All-Star roster, but Ichiro's fans in Japan got on the internet and voted. I can certainly understand those feelings if they were coming from a fan. Like I said, I really loved the image of Johnny Damon I knew before. I am sorry to say that he really did come off as a bit of a jerk in the book."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"Up until I read this book, he was my favorite Red Sox player.

He should be ashamed of himself."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"The only thing I got from this book, other than the fact that Johnny Damon thinks very, very, very highly of himself, is that anyone can get a book published...even if there is no meaningful content!I love the Red Sox and I still love Johhny Damon as a baseball player, but as an author, Mighty Johnny has struck out!"},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"...and were just looking for a legitimate excuse, you should definitely read this book. Any Red Sox fan who was devastated by his defection to the hated Yankees should definitely give this one a whirl, as you will come away thinking, \\"Good riddance.\\" You also come away with the understanding that for Johnny, it's all about himself and it's all about the money.What this book is NOT is a good behind-the-scenes look at the 2004 Red Sox. You get a few good bits, but not enough to justify the price of the book. What you get a lot more of is Johnny Damon being repulsively full of himself. His statement that \\"I banged 9 women during my wife's 36-hour labor\\" was absolutely appalling and morally repugnant. Then he has the gall to blame HER for their divorce because she was \\"too paranoid.\\" The book was pretty badly written and was full of typographical errors and factual mistakes that every casual fan will pick up on. I knew from previous input I had from others that I might not like the book, but I didn't expect to come away flat-out hating the guy. That is what this book will do to you. The degree of selfishness and boastfulness is nauseating.Please save your money.

But I can't fathom how they let this many mistakes get through - what was Peter Golenbock doing, sleeping through the whole thing? For example:- misspelling people's names (including Sox bench coach Brad Mills)- in the same paragraph referring to Jim Edmonds correctly and also as Jim Edwards- talking about David Ortiz hitting a 2-run homer in game 1 of the ALCS to bring the score to 8-7...no, it was a 2-run double- describing Mark Bellhorn's homerun in game 6 of the ALCS as going to right-center....no, it went to left field.This is just the tip of the iceberg. Do you blame Damon for this? Maybe - shouldn't he know the name of his own team's bench coach? But again, Peter Golenbock supposedly contributed to this book, but I don't see how that's possible.It's still an enjoyable, if quick, read, but you will have to look past tons of mistakes."},{"Title":"Idiot: Beating \\"The Curse\\" and Enjoying the Game of Life","review":"Johnny came off as being very \\"full of himself\\", something of which I didn't think he was.

In it, he reveals the evryday life as a ballplayer and takes you through the good and bad times. He goes through his career from High School to the Boston Red Sox. He especially reviews the 2003 and 2004 Boston Red Sox seasons.The thing that impressed me the most was the fact he was a loyal teammate. This book defends Derek Lowe and Pedro Martinez. He especially defends former teammate, Nomar Garciaparra. He reveals everyting the media said was ludicrous and they ran away from him so he couldn't defend himself and the media could keep doing what they were doing. He also pretty much says the media ran him out of Boston but prior in the book he reveals the Red Sox owners owned alot of that media.They also have a partnership with Nomar's biggest critics, the Boston Globe(Damon doesnt say that in his book, but it is a fact).He simply loves Boston and the fans so it is a must read for Boston fans."},{"Title":"Aristotle's Metaphysics","review":"Hippocrates G. Apostle has translated many works of Aristotle into English and this edition of the Metaphysics was his first. Someone looking for the Metaphysics does not need the my urging to seek out the Philosopher's thought - he knows himself what benefit this is. So instead I will discuss translation, aesthetics of the edition, durability, and price.Apostle's translations are generally admirable. They are consistent, mostly clear, and accurate. The Metaphysics is no exception. In many cases (at least where Aristotle himself is not being his murderously difficult) the meaning is immediately clear. True, Apostle has no qualms about using traditional Latin scholarly terms for the Greek: you will see \\"substance\\", \\"essence\\", \\"qua\\", \\"activity\\", and \\"privation\\", and most of these also present in italics, giving them more meanings (activity = actuality when actuality is italicized). But to avoid confusion, make copious use of the Glossaries. A complete list of all important words is presented with the corresponding Greek for the scholarly minded, English-Greek and Greek-English. This makes his occasionally confusing terms almost enjoyable.The aesthetics of the book are great. The font is not too small (but be sure you have plenty of light), the margins are medium-sized, and the size of the book is perfect - it easily fits in a bag and it is light.The durability is the drawback. All of Apostle's editions have flimsy spines and weak covers. My spine is not broken, but I take extreme care with paperbacks. Like the Physics, the spine is prone to breaking and in extreme cases, splitting the book in half. Only the Almagest had weaker covers.Price is also troublesome. The list price is $25 which may or may not be expensive to different buyers. I find it expensive.However, in sum the good far outweighs the bad. Sachs' Metaphysics is worlds away in terms of durability, but I prefer Apostle's translation, and he keeps track of the Greek better. This is an easily competitive edition of the Metaphysics, easily comparable with Sachs or Sir David Ross. Now if only Glen Coughlin would translate the Metaphysics like he did the Physics, I would swoon."},{"Title":"Professional Secrets of Nature Photography: Essential Skills for Photographing the Outdoors","review":"Judy is a magnificent and insightful photographer and teacher.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Professional Secrets of Nature Photography: Essential Skills for Photographing the Outdoors","review":"This slim volume includes brief and elementary advice on equipment and film, composition, and exposure. Despite its title, it includes very little advice about dealing with nature as a subject.The 114-page book includes 38 full-page or near-full-page photographs along with the photographs on most other pages. This reader would have been happy with more smaller photographs and much more useful text. Also, while there are some fine images in the book, there are many surprisingly weak ones which seem more than artistically or subjectively out of range - they look like amateur snapshots.In its favour, this book offers a simple and accessible introduction to the elementary basics of composition. It also offers more examples than many better books do of a few of the topics being discussed. For example, a discussion of eliminating clutter from a frame has three large photographs of the same subject illustrating the topic.However in the end I can't recommend this to anyone other than rank beginners in photography. Many of the elementary ideas in the book are found other beginner's guides and magazine or web articles. The purported subject of this book - nature photography - is far better introduced and illuminated in books by John Shaw and Tim Fitzharris, and in stunningly-beautiful books by Niall Benvie. Many of these books, too, offer much of the basic advice found in this book, and are a smarter buy."},{"Title":"La sagesse des Chaldeens: Les oracles chaldaiques (Collection Aux sources de la tradition) (French Edition)","review":"This book can be broken down in three main parts. First, two hundred and ten fragments are presented as the Chaldean oracles, while sixteen more are listed as doubtful; some of the reasons for this are usually stated in the notes, which also cover almost all of the \`accepted' fragments. Next, there are about fifty pages worth of commentary on the oracles by Proclus, Psellus and Italicus, the first two being vital documents on the reception of this mysterious text throughout the centuries. The book ends with a postface written by Alain Verse, and this short piece provides a brief but stimulating introduction to the Chaldean oracles, discussing their possible origin and meaning. All that is included in this edition is only presented in translation, but the one used here - that of Edouard des Places - is highly respected. This book is especially recommended to those who have not previously read other works on the subject; relevant books by H. Lewy and E.R.

He does not teach them, as the viewer is supposed to know the techniques already. So clearly, this is not a beginner level tape.In the film, first there is some general discussion on realities of self defence shooting. After that, Mroz goes on to evaluate each technique one at a time. First, each technique is explained, and Mroz demonstrates how the technique is supposed to work, by shooting live fire at shooting range. After that, each technique is analyzed thoroughly, before force on force demonstration of each technique. And finally, pros and cons of each technique are summarized.Mroz does a good job of analyzing the techniques. You may find out that your favorite techniques are not very good on real-life encounters. But on the other hand, there is no perfect technique, as every technique has pros and cons. In fact, none of the techniques Mroz presents seem to work very well in realistic conditions. This is a bit frustrating, as you'll end up with nothing that you can count on to work. But on the other hand, if that's the reality, you'd better be prepared for it in advance.The production of the film is pretty good. There is nothing fancy, but everything works well. In the live fire sequences, Mroz uses tracer-like Vector ammunition, to better demonstrate where the bullets are impacting.By watching this tape, you may realize weaknesses in techniques you tought were \\"perfect\\", and will therefore be more prepared, if you ever find yourself in armed encounter. If you like Mroz's books, you'll like this film. Those who want easy answers, should look elsewhere.Run time: 0:57"},{"Title":"Gift","review":"Mia Dolan's lifelong struggles against poverty, abusive men, and family losses makes an interesting memoir even if the psychic parts were omitted.

Shortly into their adventure, they rescued a small kitten from the muck on the shore, and &quot;Stinky&quot; ended up traveling 2000+ miles downriver with them, becoming the focal point of much of their travels.What makes this book so charming is also what weakens it a bit...unlike most contemporary travel/adventure writers, Dorie and Lou obviously undertook this trip for the sheer adventure of it, not to race home and write a best seller. This is their authentic story, told by 74-year-old Dorie some 40 years later, drawing on memory...in fact, it doesn't appear that they even kept a journal. There is very little description of the places they visited, (though there are several photos) more about the daily hazards they faced, and Dorie apologizes for having long ago lost the names of people such as the tugboat captain who gave them a free ride for three days.But the heart of the book is Stinky's story. If you're one who believes that cats wander into our lives when we need them most, you'll find this to be a very charming read."},{"Title":"Down the Mississippi with Stinky: Two Women, a Canoe, and a Kitten (Wisconsin)","review":"I personally know Dorie Brunner and she is a fascinating woman. However, the book shown here is not the recent one. She changed publishers and the second print is fantastic. Be sure to track it down!! She is so much happier with the second print."},{"Title":"Down the Mississippi with Stinky: Two Women, a Canoe, and a Kitten (Wisconsin)","review":"What an interesting book, I loved it!!Dorie and Lou's canoe trip from Lake Bemidji in Minnesota to the city of New Orleans is an exciting river adventure. They experienced a number of hair-raising situations that made the book anything but boring. While dealing with the unforgiving weather and the unpredictable river, they meet some friendly people who helped them out along the way. And confronted some who didn't, like a skunk, a thief and other campsite intruders.It's an excellent read for those who love camping, canoeing, river stories and even cats. Dorie gives a good description of their journey and preparations. Even though it took place back in the summer of 1960 it's still very informative and interesting. Especially for those who have a fancy for doing something like this.A pet, such as a cat, can teach its human companions so many things about life. Not to mention how the silly antics of a cat can get its owners into trouble. Just as Dorie and Lou found out when they adopted a lonely kitten early in their trip.Stinky the kitten is a wonderful ingredient to their story, and it's likely that you wont find anything similar to this book anywhere else."},{"Title":"Down the Mississippi with Stinky: Two Women, a Canoe, and a Kitten (Wisconsin)","review":"I love this book, couldn't put it down, I think a movie should be made about this story."},{"Title":"Biography - Krauthammer, Charles (1950-): An article from: Contemporary Authors","review":"Informative but certainly NOT worth the amount it cost.

The facts are clearly stated in an economical style and easy to understand by the mere interested tourist (such as myself). Also the plates are clear and also very beautiful.I am full of admiration for the author, N. Marinatos and the work she has accomplished, and also her father before her. It is good to learn that Acrotiri has re opened now after years of closure and this book will add much enjoyment and understanding to savvy tourists and archaeologists who wish to go to Santorini and enjoy exploring this archaeological site."},{"Title":"Penthouse Adult Magazine: April 1989","review":"Penthouse Magazine July 1973, Volume 4 Number 11.

Not only does Paula Peck hit every target for worry, but she presents simple, coherent advice on how not to sabotage your own best efforts. I came away feeling smarter, better armed to deal with the new realities of my surgery, and most importantly, like I had made a friend. The best part is that this book doesn't read like a textbook. It's warm and unclinical. Frankly, I can't imagine having the surgery and not having this book in my bag for constant back-up information and support. A must read for anyone on the road to recovery."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: The Guide to Long-Term Success After Weight Loss Surgery","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. I found it to be very helpful in making my decision to have WLS. The book makes you think about why you are over weight and encourages you (if you have WLS) to keep the weight off. I gives examples of how to continue your weight loss, how to avoid tempting foods, how to deal with the psychological aspect of losing weight so that you do not sabatoge your life again. The suggestions in the book are great. I highly recommend this book for those that have had WLS and for those that are considering WLS."},{"Title":"A history of Elizabethan literature","review":"One of many books that has not been downloaded properly to the Kindle.Saintsbury quotes a lot of poetry. The poetry is often quoted incomplete, as if there were room for only one Kindle \\"page\\" of poetry before an arbitrary cut-off is reached. Many quoted lines are lost this way, as the quotes are often of long passages.Furthermore, quoted verses often appear so shortened that it takes three lines to show one verse of iambic pentameter, and of course it's hard to tell where separate verses begin and end.The Table of Contents, at least, is displayed with one or two characters missing at the right hand margin. The lineation is screwed up too, you can't tell where chapter titles begin and end.Even at free, this is a bad deal. Saintsbury's comments are up to his usual high standards, but he needs his verse quotes to make his points. The book is available less torn up at other places on the internet. Amazon freebies are a grab bag someone has tossed a hand grenade into. Shrapnel wounds to this book: slightly above Amazon's evil average."},{"Title":"Odyssey with the Goddess: A Spiritual Quest in Crete","review":"This book is wonderful for several reasons, but mostly because Carol takes the reader along on her journey and confides in us as if we were close friends.

The ideas are delivered in a wittly, lively style, that makes it fun to read."},{"Title":"Criminal Law: Concepts And Practice","review":"This casebook was required for my criminal law class, and I'm glad I had it. It was very straightforward in its approach. It starts out with theories of punishment, the elements required for proving a crime, and builds up well to intentional and unintentional killings, which is the most important part of criminal law.The book uses cases in a very meaningful manner: In order to show how different jurisdictions apply the law. It also listed the pertinent Model Penal Code counterparts to the common law rules, balancing each chapter. The authors also included useful notes after cases which contrasted approaches. Finally, I believe the book also gave the best treatment of the subject of rape that I have read. Rape is the most controversial crime, especially because the Model Penal Code, which is considered ahead of its time in promulgating rules, gives an archaic definition that still burdens the victim. I felt the authors did a fine job approaching this complicated subject.I felt this casebook was plain enough and gave me a good understanding of criminal law, but if you are looking for a supplement, I have heard that \\"Understanding Criminal Law\\" by Joshua Dressler is useful."},{"Title":"Criminal Law: Concepts And Practice","review":"This is one of the clearest casebooks on the market. The casebook is laid out well and does not force the reader to strain when reading (big help for long hours of study); the cases presented are clear, concise, and recent; the notes that accompany the cases provide helpful context; 52 practice problems (with case references) help you work on your analysis of the issues. Case studies are also helpful. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Criminal Law: Concepts And Practice","review":"This book uses unusual cases to present different doctrines of Criminal Law. My professor has admitted on numerous occasions that she would not have selected the same case as the one in the book.There is very little information other than the cases themselves, which is not useful when you are trying to take away a general rule and the only substance on the rule you have is a case from an appellate court in Oregon.If I had a choice as to what Criminal Law book to use for class, this would definitely be near the bottom of the list. I don't recommend buying it unless it is required for your class."},{"Title":"Criminal Law: Concepts And Practice","review":"This might be the worst book that has ever been written about criminal law.

Now I'm stuck!!"},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"I picked this book up after Devin took a job in our area. The intro was very well written and I thought \\"hey this should be great.\\"But then the book turns into a string of what we would refer to as \\"bumper stories\\" - 2 minute tales told while sitting on the front bumper of the rescue truck waiting for the horn to blow. Many of the stories have the feel of \\"urban legend\\" having been passed around NJ for decades and morphing over time.And we all know that \\"real guys\\" don't talk about emotion - they just complain about how bad things are, so there is nothing in here that I felt captured the motivation that keeps people in this business. Too many \\"that was a horrible shift\\" stories, but no great saves.Yes, I can recall events like this. But if they were all that made up my day, I would have left years ago.(I did get one smile from a simple line on page 26 - Don't cut a down jacket.Because I've been there.)"},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"Devin relates the trails and tribuations of our nations emergency medicalservices in clear and concise manner. This is a good read for rescueprofessionals as well as for the folks these professionals serve each day. Anote to all you young folks out there that are considering a career in thefield of emergency medical service, read the book, it will open eyes as towhat your getting yourself into. If one is active within the service, Devin'sbook will recall ones memories of their own crazy situations. The type ofincidents you thought could never happen to anyone else. If your justinterested in getting a taste of the life, Devin's book will provide anaccurate account of the life style.How do I know this you ask?I've been a fire fighter/paramedic for the past eight years of my life. Ihope this helps and folks, stay safe, stay healthy and stay happy. We rescueworkers would rather meet you in a social setting not as our patient.Enjoy!!..."},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"I hope he really is working on a movie for this! Nothing I've read so far captures the spirit of EMS like Devin's books. The 9-11 remembrance brought me to tears, and then he turns it all around with outrageously funny and true stories. I'd love to ride with the guy for one day to see all the bizarre stuff he seems to attract. I couldn't put the book down from the moment I unpacked it. I hate to sound like everyone else, but this is a MUST read for anyone in the business, new to the business, thinking about the business, or anyone wanting a good laugh. The radio moments and sex injuries made me laugh so hard my sides hurt. Keep up the excellent work!"},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"I know it sounds trite, but I was blown away by this book. When I got it, I was thinking that it would be like the other EMS books I've read, like &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; or &quot;Into the Breach.&quot; I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't. Instead of hero centered war stories, Devin mixes raw honesty and self-effacing humor to create a blend of stories that really captures the essence of the EMS worker. The chapter on radio transmissions left me wondering how I sound when I use my radio. The chapter on his random thoughts on life and his glossary had me cracking up and repeating them at work. I highly recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in EMS! Simply Amazing!"},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"An EMT student of mine showed me a copy of this book so I had to order one. I haven't laughed so hard in awhile. Devin's honesty and eye for detail kept me hooked. It's refreshing to see someone who loves his job so much. I'm unofficially making this a mandatory read for all my new EMT students."},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"This is the best EMS book that I've read! The author was able to capture the humor, heartache, frustration and satisfaction of being an EMT and Paramedic. It was very well written and very easy to read. This book can be easily read by people in EMS or by families and friends interested in learning about the life and times of EMTs and Paramedics. Don't leave the book laying around the station...someone will inevitably pick it up and not want to put it down. It's that FUNNY!!!"},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"A friend turned me on to this book. He's a paramedic, but I've never been on an ambulance before. I loved it! I never thought I would laugh so hard. The opening memorial for his friend killed in the World Trade Center was a real tear jerker. I thought the whole book would be like that, but I was wrong. I was crying from laughter halfway through the book. A must read for anyone who's interested in knowing more about EMS."},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"I cried in the intro and laughed the rest of the book. I often caught myself agreeing or at least relating to the stories, and I'm still an EMT student. Devin's book shows the real world of EMS, not the stuff you see on tv that is edited and seems to be just the bad stuff. Sometimes EMS is just holding a hand or taking Suzy Psych Patient back to the hospital.This is the best EMS book I've ever read. It's written in a way that I could take it to class and read some on a break, put it down til the next break, and read more, all without getting left hanging in a story.Highly recommended book. If you are in EMS or have a friend or family member who is in EMS, read this book. It will give you a little more understanding of the things we see daily."},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"Thank you Devin for writing such a great book!!!

Great job Devin."},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"My partner bought this book, brought it to work, I read half of it, and went and bought one of my own. The book provides an amusing view of EMS peculiar life in form of short stories, anecdotes, and memorable radio conversations. Although I have found some unfamiliar things (I guess somewhere in Texas EMS work is different), the author successfully makes EMS humor accessible to everyone. The book is a unique collection in its genre, and everyone will enjoy reading it, especially those in day-to-day emergency/police work."},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"My wife got this book for me. I just finished my EMT schooling and was looking for a job when I started reading the book. This book is so great if your in a emt/paramedic program or even if you just like listening about extremely interesting, gross, and funny things that your emergency workers go threw. I am extremely happy to finally see a book out there thats not about cops or fire fighters, which mind you are bolth respectable excellent careers. but It seems like they get all the credit now a days. I am so glad Devin Kerins wrote a book to let people know what the emt's and paramedics of your city's ambulance crews adventures, and lives are like. unfortunately they are usually very under appreciated. I have made 4 people read it so far! A MUST READ! AWSOME BOOK!"},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"As a volunteer EMT, I enjoy reading about he stories from the field. Many authors share the good and the bad of EMS, but overall reflect on the satisfaction of helping others in their time of need... This is NOT one of those authors. This book tells many stories of calls from the perspective of an EMT with a chip on his shoulder, resenting those he serves, and resenting their requests for help. Another reviewer said the book would set EMS back years, and I have to agree, primarily because of the stories of intentionally mistreating patients, bad attitudes, and off color jokes at the expense of others. If you want to read encouraging stories about life in EMS, consider stores by Canning, Patterson, or Perry. If you want to read about the unfortunate EMT that is always difficult to deal with, and seems to resent his job, this is the book. Advice to the author, if this describes the job of your life, then you might want to consider a career change...."},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"So, I first picked this book up probably back in 2006. I have since then read it and had it lost among the shuffle at the station. Between loaning it out and getting it back...and now it's gone again. I have recently decided to buy another copy, simply for the fact that we were talking about it at the station, and naturally no one knew where it was. I would suggest this book to anyone! The sequel was just as good as the first! Mr. Kerins did a wonderful job mixing humor and real life. Congrats, sir!"},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"As a new EMT, I was looking for a book with tips, as well as war stories. And this fit the bill.

Highly recommended for any EMS provider or EMS providers family."},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"The author is funny:) Although this isn't to be considered a medical textbook it does give a good overview of what the job entails."},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"Devin Kerin's is very creative at describing various entities within the emergency services sector. There are several of sections where it made me laugh, and there was other sections that made me go \\"oh really?\\". I have been thoroughly interested in the emergency services for years, and Devin's art at writing this book, has made me interested in the servicies even more. If you want to read a book where it is \\"a journey through the eyes of an EMT\\" then you want to read this book. You will not be disappointed. If you really liked his first book, you will continue liking his second book."},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"This was an excellent book! Although I generally hate books that have been assigned to me, this was a major exception! As a series of shorter stories, it is a fast read and you hardly want to put it down. It'll keep you laughing, especially if you are familiar with the field as I am."},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"This book is a page turner that you can't put down, if you have any interest in the EMS field. Although if you've been in the field for any amount of time you'd probably run into a lot of what is written in this book. Devin does put a funny spin throughout the book on things that makes you laugh out loud while reading this book though. Buy it it's worth the read."},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"Its a realistic look into our world, unfortunate sometimes. Ive followed the authors posted on ems based message boards and after him touting his book - I had to come find it. It was funny, read it all one sitting and is sitting dog-eared at my station right now. Best part - all the radio immaturity. Try as we might to sound like professions - we all goof off, especially on the radios, especially on 'company band' radios. I do agree with a few other posters tho - and would have prefered some more of the \\"good\\" sides of EMS. the sweet lil old lady that just smiles at you all the way in, like your an angel, a great save that you talk about for weeks, the fuzzy feeling we all get sometimes. So maybe if theres an EMS3 - tack on some lighter side stuff. overall tho, i definatly think its a book people in ems can relate to. dont know if ide totally recomend it for 'outsiders' tho, as they might interput it all as lazy and uncaring. (thats only some days!)"},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"I hadn't heard of these books until I attended a terrorism course taught by the author and he mentioned them. I'm glad he did! This and the sequel surpassed my expectations. Its obvious from the book that this guy loves his job. What another review saw as whining, I saw as the author bringing to light in a funny way many of the gripes coworkers have. The public might expect EMS books to be serious and full of gory 'war stories.' Not in this case. What I loved the most, having had the chance to talk with the author, is the way he speaks through his stories.

I read Devin's novels first and loved them. I'm not usually into non-fiction but I figured I would give it a try. I'm not involved in EMS but this completely peaked my interest. I have more respect for those that do the job after reading this and seeing what they \\"really\\" go through."},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"I just finished reading the book. It's sooo good I wish it was twice as long so that I can read until I get book #2. I'm not an EMT but enjoy listening to emt/police/firefighter stories so this was the book for me. I really appreciate the work they do. I can just imagine going to a call not knowing what they might find there, and a lot of them do all this for free. So you know what, if making jokes about clients is what makes them get through they shift with a clear mind, so be it. I wouldn't want an all-stressed-out paramedic handling me that's for sure. I'm sure teachers/lawyers/anybody have their own stories too... I'm glad I came across this book, it gave me a few hours of unstoppable laugh... Read it if you like listening to real life stories, want to know more about what it's like being in EMS and what really goes on inside an ambulance.."},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"Expecting a journal-type of book, where a collection of emergency calls are laid out in chronological order, I was pleasantly suprised to find a sporadic flow of thoughts and memories, intricately associated with a particular moment in a single day in Devin's life. Absolutely amazing! Whether you're part of EMS or not, you have to read this book!"},{"Title":"Ems: the Job of Your Life","review":"Ever wonder why EMS providers don't receive the same amount of respect as firefighters and police officers? EMS is still a young profession and the public does not have a complete understanding of what we do. Kerins' book portrays EMS providers in a less than positive light. The endless complaining and whining about having to respond to calls even during meals did not sit well with me. Perhaps I am wrong, but as an EMT or Paramedic, it is my job to respond when someone is in need. I have also been on a lot of calls that were less than emergent, but in each situation I have always maintained a degree of professionalism. This book hurts all efforts that we EMS providers have made to advance our profession. I wish I could get back the money I spent on this book."},{"Title":"The Edinburgh International Encyclopaedia of Psychoanalysis","review":"Psychoanalysis from all schools of thought in one Encyclopaedia!

There are better, broader decorating books around that make the same &quot;do your own thing&quot; point while taking a broader, truly national approach in the choice of places that are pictured. I get so tired of buying great-sounding books only to see that the people who produced them are not well-travelled and have focused on New York and perhaps California. Disappointing. I wish they would show real homes that most of the country can identify with."},{"Title":"Breaking the Rules: Home Style for the Way We Live Today","review":"Oh,my! &quot;Breaking the Rules: Home Style For the Way We Live Today&quot; is one visually stunning book.&quot;Breaking the Rules&quot; doesn't just rock, it roars.Author Christy Ferrer has taken those stodgly ol' decorating rules and chucked 'em out the well-appointed window.Every page of this book is gorgeous and delightfully iconoclastic.Featured items range from a mink and lucite stool, to an artfully displayed collection of gloves (which once belonged to the Duchess of Windsor),to Bette Midler's stove.These interiors are a fun, funky, ecclectic and joyfully eccentric mix.This is not the typical decorating book that serves up a style for you to copy as if you were some kind of decorating drone. &quot;Breaking the Rules&quot; is an inspirational guide for letting your creativity emerge, maybe even explode.Do you like shocking pink and lime green? Go ahead. Crack open a couple of paint cans and redo that boring living room!This book not only gives you permission, but may even serve as your muse. And, finally, bravely, in the face of all that is accepted and personified as &quot;good taste&quot;, author Ferrer even dares us to: &quot;Think plastic.&quot; This is truly &quot;no guts, no glamour&quot; decor.What a spirited and breath-taking piece of work! Christy Ferrer(with Risa Palazzo) has put together one heck-of-a book.I dare you to read it!"},{"Title":"Breaking the Rules: Home Style for the Way We Live Today","review":"It's called Breaking the Rules but what's interesting about this decorating book is that it explains the elements of design first so your get an education in style even while you are being encouraged to flaunt convention.

I am surprised there are not more reviews of her books. If you are looking for a new mystery writer, you can't do better than Priscilla Masters."},{"Title":"Black Folktales","review":"The book I am reviewing is called Black Folktales, it is by Julius Lester and illustrated by Tom Feelings. This book falls under the category folktales and fairytales. Before I tell you more about the book let me say that the illustrations were amazing. Anyways, the book consisted of short stories about blacks in the south. There were stories about blacks on plantations and about god and how he created the world. Most of the stories were very good and interesting and most of them I enjoyed reading although there were a few mediocre stories mixed in too. The writers writing style I thought was very good. It definitely kept me entertained through out the whole book. There were some very funny stories in the book. there was one about a black man that was feared through out the land, and was supposed to die a couple of times but he kept escaping death, until St. Peter told god that this black man was supposed to have died thirty years ago. God immediately called the grim reaper who started complaining cause he hadn't gotten more the five minutes of sleep in the last two days. He started telling god that he needed some assistants, or else. Anyways I give this book 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Black Folktales","review":"This is a good overview of Black Folklore for the novice of the genre, a teaching tool, or for people who just enjoy good stories.Julius Lester, one of the few living public specialists of tales of this type, begins with a few African stories to show the root of this field. From there, he goes to stories of pre-and post slavery America.He includes some time honored classics of Black Folklore. \\"High John The Conqueror,\\" of a slave who outwits his master, was a favorite of my Dad that I have also seen elsewhere as \\"Big Sixteen\\" and \\"Old John\\" is a welcome addition to this set. In fact I used to regale my friends with this story when I was 12. Read it and you'll see why. Also, the \\"Bad man\\" legend of \\"Stagolee\\" spieces things up a bit (a forerunner of the type of tales found in gagster rap, minus the vulgarity) and the slave classic \\"People Who Could Fly,\\" which was first known to be collected along the Charleston (SC) sea islands in the 1920s.Unfortuantely, most of these tales are not told anymore except by professional storytellers. Additionally, many books that tended to contain such stories in the early 1900s when such tales were still often told were so laden with dialect (Joel Chandler Harris, Ambrose Gonzales, et. al.) that they are often incomprehenbsible to the modern reader. Many kudos to Mr. Lester for keeping this wonderful art form alive.PS, Mr. Lester inquired of the source of the last story in the book. I recall reading it in Zora Neale Hurston's \\"Mules & Men\\" (1935). Hope this helps."},{"Title":"Black Folktales","review":"These tales--told in \\"street talk\\"--will be liked by some, not by others; are humorous to some, not to others.

I would recommend African Folktales by Pantheon, far more authentic and first person. There are also collections by African American authors that have a deeper understanding of black culture than this author."},{"Title":"Blood in the Sea: HMS Dunedin and the Enigma Code","review":"Author Stuart Gill succeeds in doing something very rare among the thousands of WW2 books in print: juggle several points of view to tell a fast-moving story of a largely unknown tragedy. Like a good film director, Gill cuts back and forth between the British warship on patrol, the British cryptographers using the captured Enigma code to track the enemy's moves, and the German U-boat that is first hunted, then becomes hunter.The tragedy that ensues is simply and unsparingly presented. The reader is then cast forward in time to share the heartbreak of loved ones as they receive the news and live with the loss for decades to come. No reader can be untouched by the passage of the young woman who lost her fiance on HMS Dunedin only to find, years later, the love poem he marked just for her.Although the war action of the book is during the 1940-41 period when Britain stood alone, American readers will appreciate Blood in the Sea for the way history often throws us signs. The survivors of HMS Dunedin are picked up by an American merchant ship on Thanksgiving Day, 1941. Those survivors were disembarked at a friendly port on Sunday December 7th. Anglo-American friendship was to endure."},{"Title":"Blood in the Sea: HMS Dunedin and the Enigma Code","review":"Someone needs to make this gripping story into a movie! Well written book and amazing story of loss as well as survival."},{"Title":"Blood in the Sea: HMS Dunedin and the Enigma Code","review":"Naval stories do not get more gripping than the tragedy of HMS Dunedin, a British light cruiser sunk by a German U-boat in 1941, and seldom are the stories better told than the one related in Blood in the Sea: HMS Dunedin and the Enigma Code.The author Stuart Gill uses the experiences of his father, Marine William Gill, one of only sixty-seven survivors (out of 486 crew and officers) to construct a history of the ship, and the result is one terrific read.The ship had seen twenty-four years of fairly ordinary service (in the words of Gill's father, the cruiser \\"was a bit player on a large stage\\") when it went down far off the Central Africa coast. Broken by two torpedoes fired from U-124, the Dunedin sank so quickly that over 200 men were trapped below.The ship had no time to report its position--or even that she was going down. There was not enough room in the seven rafts for all those still alive. Those still in the water soon realized they were surrounded by sharks. The tropical air temperature was unmercifully hot. There was no water. There was no food. The rafts were taking on water. These sailors knew they were as alone as men had ever been on the sea. The moment called for ordinary men to become something extraordinary."},{"Title":"Sweetness: The Courage and Heart of Walter Payton","review":"This is a terrific book, especially for parents who want to show their sports-mad kids a real role model. The photos are wonderful, and the text describes the whole man, not just the football player.

He was indeed one of the greatest running-backs of all time. What this book gives, that many don't, is a review of Walter's off-field perfomances. He was kind, caring, and loving to all. This book clearly shows that Walter was in all aspects.....a hero. This title is a must for all those who miss the headbands, the dives over the goal lines, the amazing runs, the jumping high fives, and a great man----SWEETNESS!"},{"Title":"Sweetness: The Courage and Heart of Walter Payton","review":"...one of the quotes in the book attributed to Bears Coach Mike Ditka. I agree with that, and I think anyone who reads this book will come to understand why. His accomplishments on the football field, as great as they were, were secondary. He was a great human being. We were fortunate to have had him as long as we did.I'm sure this book is of more interest to Chicago Bears fans than it might be to those who aren't, but it needn't be that way; this is a great and meaningful book that everyone can enjoy. Yeager follows Walter's life an career in chronological order from his youth in Mississippi, through his years and Jackson State, his marriage, Bears career and ultimately his retirement and death. The format is generally quotes from others close to him at those times: his brother Eddie, college coach, teammates - particularly Matt Suhey, Roland Harper and Mike Singletary, coaches, friends and business associates. Yeager himself contributes based on his interviews with Walter and includes many details of his discussions with him. The best parts of the book, in my view, are the quotes from Walter himself.Regardless of whether the reader is from Chicago or a Bears fan, I think this book is well worth the price if only for one of the later chapters. I don't have the book handy at the moment, but while he was dying, he spoke to Yeager in three or four paragraphs about what is is to be a Winner. Walter's comments were touching, profound and in my view as a Chicagoan and a Bear fan, defined who he was.I'd highly recommend picking the book up just to read those passages. I think every parent should share those passages with their kids as I did - and continue to from time to time. They serve as a constant reminder of what is really important in life from a great man who understood.He made us all very proud. I'm glad to heave read the book and refer to it often. Walter will never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Sweetness: The Courage and Heart of Walter Payton","review":"Walter Payton was the model of what every player should be like, even in today's &quot;me only&quot; generation. Walter was a first class football player amd first class individual as well.He is what other players should strive to be like, Walter broke the mold and still stands as the premiere football player of all time. Walter can not and will never be replaced, he represented what all of us should be like no matter what color we are or where we came from or anything!A truly remarkable individual that went beyond being a great football player, Walter was a great person as well. If a person couldn't be inspired by what Walter Payton represented, they just couldn't be inspired with anything!I named my son after his son, and my family will never forget watching #34 on the field on Sunday's. Walter is my all time hero and inspiration, and always will be."},{"Title":"Sweetness: The Courage and Heart of Walter Payton","review":"Great pictures.

Dancing through my garden with snippers, merrily collecting herbs for my concoctions I felt that I was &quot;in tune&quot; with the plants and their healing properties. I was wrong. What I failed to understand is the energy and spirit of the plants that I collected. I thought I could run to my endless library of herbal literature and learn everything about the plants but what I failed to see was the spirit of the plants. The Healing Spirit of Plants is a guide to understanding and appreicating plants for more than their chemical constituents.The book begins with an explantation of plant spirit medicine, how to interpret the energies, and how the energies interact with our energies through chakras and meridians. It continues with tips on how to work with the energy systems to increase your sensitivity and connect with plants.From the theoritical to the practical, the book continues with an exploration of various ways to work with plant spirit medicine. Directions on how to make sacred bundles, use scents, flower remedies, and homeopathic medicine are just a few ways the book gives you to enhance your life with plants.Historically, the book covers plant medicine around the world including, but not limited to, North and South America and Indonesia. This historic lesson gives the reader the backround of plant spirit medicine use throughout time and a connection with traditional healers.A plant encyclopedia covers 80 species of plants and their spirit medicine use. Each covers the flower remedies, homeopathy, traditional use and myth. It also includes the scientific name (which I found missing in many pop herbal books) and the plant family.A glossary, bibliography, and suppliers list completes the contents of this book.So why is it three stars when I can't say enough about it? I need to know if they even asked an editor to review the information. I found tons of typos and even places where text is missing forcing me to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; where gaps occured. It is a very sexy book, lots of bright photos, and I think it could have dropped some of the sexiness and put more time and detail into the actual text. The editing mistakes makes me question the credibility of the research. To be fair, I haven't found any misinformation but I haven't lived with the book for very long so we'll see.All in all the book made me look at plants differently, which is what I was looking for in the book. It forced me to collect and use the plants with more ceremony and respect. Not just like a cheap over the counter drug but as a spirit with the potential to heal the disease and not just mask the symptoms."},{"Title":"The Healing Spirit of Plants","review":"This book has a lot of subjects with good pictures in it except does not complete any of the subjects that it covers. I love books with pictures, things to see and imagine easily. This book does an OK job presenting its pictures... I found a lot of the pictures seemed to just take up space then add anything constructive though, and there was quite a few of the pictures that are the same pictures used over. I gave it four books because this book is VERY ENJOYABLE. If you are only a dabbler in the subject of working with healing plants, or you just like to have a book with a lot of easy reading and some good pictures to add to an already good start of a collection then this book will work for you. The limitations of this book would make it horrible for the casual reader looking for information on purchasing a book on plants and thier healing value. The book is divided, half of it talks about just a little (very little on each of the following subjects) about history, healing topics to include chackras-auras, General plant knowledge, a few ways to prepare plants, ect. The other half of the book is the 'encyclopedia' of plants that has about a page for each plant.Limitations: -The book covers about only 45 plants that commonly are known for their healing properties, some common and some less common. -it covers very LITTLE practical ways to use healing plants -it covers many topics a little with out any depth and with little practical use or ways to fit it in the big picture.Benifits: -it includes regions and short histories of plants -it has many wonderful and very accurate and useful color pictures on subjects that I never thought would be in this book -the book is not overwhelming with writing... a lot of illistration and nothing written without illistration.I personally wouldn't buy this book at full price, but you should be able to get a good price for it used.Again I have to say that this book isn't for someone who is looking for a serious book to start from, because there are much better books for that, but If you still think this book is for you and you understand its limitations then you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Healing Spirit of Plants","review":"Wisdom of the Earth, by Barry Kapp, goes into similar ideas.

This applies to shamanic work. Shamanic techniques work from the larger self, especially in service to others. Shamanism means working with the subconscious, and at times superconscious minds. It cannot be apprehended by the conscious mind, the ego. Without service, many things just don't work, or work only slightly.Whispers of the Ancients: Native Tales for Teaching and Healing in Our Timegives you some idea of how very different native storytelling is, and stories shape the Universe.

The old Earl's second wife/widow,Camilla,takes it upon herself to teach Archie the ways of the aristocracy and to help him find a wife. This book is very different in that the heroine is older than the usual innocent 18 year old, and she shows the Hero the ropes in his new role as Earl. Yet,she has experienced a hard life and has demons to learn to over come. The Hero is strong,yet sensitive and understanding. And the interaction between the two main characters is interesting and witty at times.

It still reflects the old AP test format and completely omits entire sections. There is WAY to much emphasis on ecology and not enough on cells. Cell signaling and transduction is heavily emphasized in the new curriculum and this book doesn't even mention it!I was looking forward to previewing this book and encouraging my AP Biology students to buy it. I will certainly not be recommending this."},{"Title":"Cracking the Ap Biology Exam (Princeton Review: Cracking the Ap Biology)","review":"The 2013 edition of this book doesn't at all reflect the changes that have been made to the AP Biology test. This book is almost identical to my 2010 edition of the same book. That means that this book includes a great deal of information that is no longer covered on the AP test, and lacks a great deal of information that is.For example, the new AP Biology course description states, \\"Memorization of the names of the phases of mitosis is beyond the scope of the course and the AP Exam.\\" This book teaches you to memorize the phases of mitosis. What it doesn't teach you, though, is that \\"Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases control the cell cycle,\\" which the College Board requires students to know for the AP test.The \\"Big Ideas\\" that are stressed in the AP Biology course and exam description are completely absent from this book. Instead, this book stresses the themes of the old AP test. Also lacking are any tips for how to succeed in the new free-response section of the test. Instead, it prepares you for the old free-response section that no longer exists.But if you are a college student or general biology teacher looking for a good biology overview, this book is actually quite good. Just don't use it to prepare for the AP test."},{"Title":"Cracking the Ap Biology Exam (Princeton Review: Cracking the Ap Biology)","review":"I have been teaching AP biology for four years and was looking forward to this book being released in the hopes that it would be a good review book for the changes that collegeboard has made to the AP Biology test. It is just like all previous review books with no mention of the four big ideas or any other changes to AP bio. I originally bought the book so I would have more conceptual based questions to show my students and was severly disappointed with this book. It even states that there are four essays with equal amounts of time (when in reality, the new test will have two longer questions and a few short answer).

As far as I can tell, VERY little revising was actually done. In particular, the practice tests still have a heavy emphasis on memorized detail, with little attempt made to include the higher order thinking questions that typify the redesigned test. This makes the practice tests fairly worthless, as they do not assess students in the manner they will be assessed on the new AP exam.There is NO mention anywhere of the incorporation of the 4 so-called &#34;Big Ideas&#34; around which the new test is based - how could the publisher of a test prep book leave that information out? I know Princeton Review has made its reputation on test-taking strategies, but knowing the 4 GIANT themes that every question on the test maps to seems like fairly important information no matter what testing strategies you attempt to teach.The review material seems reasonable - the summaries of facts and processes are accurate as far as I have seen; I'm just not sure how useful they will be in preparing for the real test, which no longer stresses memorization of vast quantities of material.Overall, I'm really disappointed with this book.

I have also been involved with College Board as a reader for the AP biology test. One of the challenges of this school year was a brand new AP biology curriculum and a brand new AP biology test. As teachers, we have been waiting for new materials for this new test. I ordered this book as soon it was available and I was shocked at the poor quality. This book claims to be rewritten for the 2013 test, but the only thing changed was the number of questions on the practice test.The content of this book was NOT changed to match the new curriculum, which means it still includes information that is no longer a main focus of the course. The list of labs also was NOT changed. In the old curriculum, there were 12 labs. The new one has 13 labs. The list in this book matches the old curriculum, not the new one. Several of the labs listed in this book have been eliminated in the new curriculum. Finally, the practice tests do NOT reflect the questions on the new test at all. Every single question on the 2013 test will be an application question, and all recall questions have been eliminated. The practice tests in this book still have a bunch of questions that are simply memorization. In addition, these questions focus on content that will not be covered on the 2013 test.My concern is that well-meaning AP students will buy this book and use it to prepare for the 2013 test. While the content is still valid biology, this book does not reflect what the students will be asked to do on the new test. I am disappointed in the folks at Princeton Review for not producing a new product for a new test. Please, do not waste your money or time on this review book!"},{"Title":"Cracking the Ap Biology Exam (Princeton Review: Cracking the Ap Biology)","review":"I was quite disappointed with this book. Yes, it provides a review of the material and outlines the format of the test. However, the review is not as in-depth as it should be. In addition, the book's suggestions for writing the essays are somewhat ridiculous. For example, it suggests spending 5 minutes outlining each essay after the 10 minute reading period is over. Doing that would consume 20 minutes of the 90 you have to write the essay, leaving a little over an hour to write 4 essays. Spelling and grammatical mistakes in the book are also ubiquitous. For example, in a diagram on one of the chapter quizzes, the Loop of Henle in the kidney is referred to as the \\"Loop of Henlo\\", and the afferent arteriole the \\"afferent arteriale\\". Even in the chapter quiz answers there are mistakes (ex. calling the biome \\"with producers adapted to fire\\" the tundra, yet in the explanation saying most of its vegetation consists of grass). Overall, this book will give you an overly selective review of AP Biology, and is clearly not well edited or proofread.

But does anyone ever really hear of his good traits until now. And in a childrens book! Well I know I didn't. And after reading this short story I found that ole George wasn't such a bad guy after all. All he wanted was for Brittain to become, well...richer. Couldn't those colonists help pay for some of his debts. Well maybe, if those colonists actually had any SAY in British matters then they should have to pay taxes. Well I still think he wasn't a BAD guy, he just tried to take the easiest way out.Tomie DePaola and Jean Fritz-I think-make the perfect team. His comical illustrations with her undefinable text make this book a classic.Fritz or Freedman '04.

It really helped me with my research on the Revolutionary war. In this book you get to learn the funny things about King George and things that happened during his time."},{"Title":"Can't You Make Them Behave, King George?","review":"A charming little book, but nonetheless markedly biased. George III is treated gently, politely and even kindly in Jean Fritz's illustrated fable; the King's sense of honor and duty is palpable, and his character is given a review which is unusual but refreshing. Additionally, the illustrations are superb (they are what drew me in to begin with). The biggest problem I found was that the fact that George's motivations for entering into the war with America were misrepresented. Of course, this is not the place to enter into such a narrative, but any serious biography of him will lay out a set of ideas very different from those found in Fritz's prose. It is slightly worrying that a young child might be fed an incomplete truth; had the author given some of the King's stronger reasons, this would be an excellent gift for any young Historian. I recommend that it be enjoyed with a pinch of salt."},{"Title":"Can't You Make Them Behave, King George?","review":"We are studying American history in our homeschool and just finished this book today. My son loved it and I think he's bummed that it's over! I had planned to read a little each day, but after the first few days he begged me to read through to the end. He couldn't get enough. Some of the print is so funny, then combined with the illustrations, it's hilarious. It's not all fun and games though, it's also educational and historically accurate. It shows the \\"human\\" side of King George III...he wasn't just some tyrannical monster trying to ruin America. He was a devoted husband and father who was determined to be a strong leader, and earnestly did what he felt was best for his country and its colonies. I can't recommend this book enough.

At the back of the book, there's a 4-page Travel Guide, filled with useful information. Mexican design is beautiful and probably no non-Mexicans know more about it than Karen and Joe, having dedicated decades to studying it seriously and having visited and photographed many outstanding examples for inclusion in their books. One place we'll be sure not to miss is Hacienda Petac, the restoration of which was just completed in December 2002. Karen and Joe are partners in that enterprise, the design center of which offers a showcase for Mexican antiques, architectural elements and decorative accents.

Krupp, 1978.This is an excellent book in PROVING the fact of Archaeoastronomy in ancient cultures and traditions. Dr. Krupps, director of the Griffith Observatory, shows us how Stonehenge, the Maya temples, the Egyptian Pyramids and Babylonian astronomies were developed and built into ancient architecture and megaliths. He shows how the so-called primitive cultures may not have been so primitive as science automatically assumes due to over application of Darwinian theory.The ancients possessed highly advanced mathematics, calendrics, and architecture.Dr. Krupps, at the end of this book, also debunks popular myths such as planet hopping amphibians and lizard people. These popular myths were created because our \\"advanced\\" society is over judgmental and prejudiced in its attitude toward so-called primitive cultures. Surely these people couldn't have been advanced enough, intelligent enough, to create such amazing structures and understandings on their own - they must have had aliens who came down from Planet Xenu and did it for them. Or maybe more simply, and if we use Occam's Razor, such leaps of logic show OUR lack of ability to think critically rather than our ancestors.Overall, a 4.5 star work.

That's gotten me curious into looking at all four renditions and the 1902 book that the movies are based on.And it wasn't what I expected. It's caused me to be overwhelmed at the screenplay writer's tremendous creativity. Apart from the name and the year the story occurs, the book and the current rendition starring especially Heath Ledger just don't appear related at all.Okay, so back to the book.

It's not at all an action movie - it's more of a psychological revelation of what Ethne went through.If you, like me, are interested in A.E.Mason's work and how the movie relates, well, yes, of course you need to read it.

Due to his fear of becoming a coward and staining his ancestors' reputation, Harry resigns his commission in the East Surrey Regiment just prior to Sir Garnet Wolseley's 1882 expedition to Egypt to suppress the rising of Urabi Pasha. Yet three of his comrades, Captain Trench and Lieutenants Castleton and Willoughby, send him three white feathers to express their disapproval of his act, and his Irish fianc&eacute;e, Ethne Eustace, presents him with a fourth feather and breaks their engagement. Harry's best friend in the regiment, Captain Durrance becomes his rival for Ethne.After talking with Lieutenant Sutch, a friend of his father, Harry decides to redeem himself by acts that will force his former friends to take back the feathers and might in turn encourage Ethne to take back her feather. Thus, he travels on his own to Egypt and Sudan. Meanwhile, Durrance is blinded by sunstroke and is sent home. Over the next six years, Castleton is killed at Tamai, but Willoughby is now a commander and Harry, with the aid of a Sudanese Arab Abou Fatma, succeeds in recovering some lost letters and getting them to Willoughby. Then he learns that Trench is imprisoned in the \\"House of Stone\\" at Omdurman and allows himself to be captured in an attempt to rescue him. Meanwhile, Durrance and Ethne become engaged, though each secretly realizes that there are problems in their relationship. Will Harry and Trench escape? Does Ethne take back her feather? Can Durrance find a cure for his blindness? And who will marry whom?This book was recommended to me by my friend Thaxter Dickey, a professor at Florida College. Alfred Edward Woodley Mason (1865-1948) was a British politician and author, of whom it is said that he delighted readers with adventure novels and detective stories written in a style reminiscent of Robert Louis Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling, and Arthur Conan Doyle. I would add that this book reminds me of H. Rider Haggard, author of King Solomon's Mines and She. Mason wrote more than twenty books but is best known for The Four Feathers. There is very little objectionable in the story. A few minor references to smoking tobacco, drinking alcoholic beverages, and dancing occur, and the name of God, as in \\"Good God,\\" \\"My God,\\" and \\"O God,\\" is used as an interjection. However, the facts that people prayed, trusted in God, and looked to His providence are also mentioned. And the idea of honor is quite strong. The plot may move a little too slowly and be a bit too complex for young children, but teens as young as thirteen and adults who like exotic adventure stories should enjoy it. I know that I did."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"This Victorian era story of a coward trying to atone for his act of cowardice is, well...very Victorian. The author has good insight into human nature in regards to cowardice, bravery, guilt, and a sense of duty, but there is so much melodramatic soul-searching (especially by Ethne) that parts of it become quite tedious. The dance of deception between Ethne and Durrance is just painful and the author beats it to death before getting back to the story of Harry Feversham.I think the author was trying to make the reader feel sorry for the poor emotional suffering of brave Ethne, but for the most part I found her more annoying and misguided than pitiable. I really liked the premise and overall story of the book, but the melodrama of it all severely detracted from my enjoyment of it."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"My Papa died when I was 9.

And yet he has fought the Pathans in India. None of his fellow officers finds him fearful, much less a coward. With several other officer friends from India he is on long leave in London at the time. Nonetheless, knowing that his regiment is about to be transferred to a new war zone, Egypt/Sudan, he suddenly resigns his commission.Those who don't know that Feversham had been tipped off that he was to go with his regiment in harm's way just minutes before he resigned, understand and accept his stated motivation: he has just become engaged to the beauteous Ethne Eustace of County Donegal in Ireland. Her father's estate is close to ruin and Harry will set it right once married. Moreover, Ethne will never willingly live anywhere but Donegal. Understandable. Acceptable. Even to Harry's best friend and onetime mate at Oxford University, Major Jack Durrance. But Durrance, not a member of Harry's regiment, doesn't know that Harry resigned his commission only after learning he was to be shipped to Egypt. Five years later then Colonel Durrance will have finally put together enough pieces to grasp why Feversham had been rejected by Ethne and had then disappeared.The precise timing of when Feversham made his decision to resign becomes a matter of curiosity to two of Harry's brother officers of the regiment. For they were in his tenth storey London apartment enjoying a party when they saw him receive a telegram which he crumpled up. They guess the telegram's author and seek him out. The three then jump to the conclusion that Harry Feversham has quit the army for the worst possible reason: he is a physical coward. They agree to send him three white feathers and let him know who sent them. They also agree to keep the information about the timing of the telegram to themselves. Why? To spare their regiment shame.Unfortunately, and unintentionally, their packet of white feathers and name cards does not find Harry in his London apartment. It is routed to Ireland and is opened at a ball in the presence of 21-year old Ethne Eustace. Harry confesses to Ethne that his white feathers are deserved. He lies when she suggests that he resigned because of her. She not only breaks their engagement on the spot, but also gives him feather number four for cowardice. Ethne tells her father. Harry informs his father. The story of his disgrace goes no further. So in all the world only seven people know that Harry is accused of cowardice.Harry almost at once decides to redeem himself, to atone, to set things right again. He will prove to his four accusers that, while he may be fearful, he is not a coward. He is never so frightened that he cannot do his duty. The rest of the novel is about Harry's self-imposed new duty: the labor of persuading his four accusers to take back the feathers with which they accused him.Does the plot sound distantly familiar?THE FOUR FEATHERS reminds me of the twelve labors of Hercules, imposed as a redemptive penance by the God Apollo for the rage which had driven Hercules to kill wife and children. Over twelve demanding years Hercules, atoning for his earlier sin, performed seemingly impossible tasks. In the process he remade himself into the greatest mortal hero Greece had ever known. The philosopher Aristotle might have used Hercules and his struggle for moral redemption to illustrate the subtle Greek quality of \\"pathos.\\"And pathos, one sinner's struggle to restore his standing in the eyes of three military comrades and the woman he loves, is what Harry Feversham also exemplifies. Through sufferings in desert heat, in hand to hand combat, in a horrible self-chosen prison at Omdurman outside Khartoum, Harry compels his accusers to admit that he is no coward and happily to take back their white feathers.The difference from the labors of Hercules is that the pathos of Harry Feversham is Victorian English, not Heroic Age Greek. The story of Harry is all stiff upper lip, understated, self-imposed expiation of a freely admitted fault. His first great deed to master terror has an objectively trivial goal: to find under conditions of great danger some unimportant letters written in Khartoum by the doomed General Gordon. Yet that deed is enough for his first accuser gladly to take back the feather Harry carries everywhere with him.Complicating the story is that for nearly two decades only one living man, an aging crippled naval officer who had fought alongside Harry's father in the Crimea, Lieutenant Sutch, understands Harry's soul. The novel hints that Sutch had loved Harry's mother when she was still Miss Graham. Sutch and young Heversham first met on Harry's 14th birthday. On the occasion of a dinner reunion of Crimean War veterans, impressionable Harry heard two tales of undeniable personal cowardice in the face of the enemy. He could only imagine himself acting in the future as they had if similarly tempted. Lieutenant Sutch had, however, seen men terrified before battle who mastered their fear once the cannons began to roar. He is certain that Harry Feversham will turn out such a man.No one else sees Harry that way. And slowly, clue by clue, we piece together Harry's soul and come to understand him ourselves. Characters in the novel ask themselves: if this or that had been different, would Harry have resigned his commission? What if the mother he so resembled had not died young? What if Lieutenant Sutch had not loved Miss Graham? What if Harry's eighth generation military father had paid Harry more attention -- and not lived so long? What if Mrs Adair had not fallen in love with her neighbor Jack Durrance and, in jealously, had not made sure that Harry Feversham wooed Ethne Eustace away from Durrance? What if the regiment had not been transferred from India to Egypt? Had any one of these not happened, Harry would not have acted in a way to make his mates think him a coward.THE FOUR FEATHERS uses war, Africa, desert heats and dangers as mere backdrops, props, against which one modest, honorable man plays out his version of the labors of Hercules. There is virtually nothing religious in the novel, other than the belief formed together in earlier, happier times by both Ethne and Harry that, come what may, they will one day be merry together forever after death.Read THE FOUR FEATHERS for what it purports to be and for the skilled dissection of a psyche which author A.E. W. Mason is performing before our eyes. Do not make the mistake of letting this subtle, multi-layered, understated book compete with the rock 'em, sock 'em. razzle dazzle 'em, macho chest thumping interpretations by screenwriters and directors of the barely related feature films of 1939, 1977 and 2002.The films are fun. The novel is great art. It has depths not touched upon in this review. You may be pleasantly astonished when you read THE FOUR FEATHERS.

The romance at the center was a bonus, as was the detailed glimpse of life in Britain at that time, the expectations that men and women held for one another and themselves.I was, however, disappointed by the inaccuracy in the synopsis on the book's back cover and repeated on this website which states that Harry Faversham saves the lives of the three men who gave him the white feathers in order to be redemeed.I'm not sure where the writer of the synopsis came by that idea but it sure doesn't happen like that in the book. Not to spoil the story for you, but Harry proves his bravery in rather more complex ways.I also was pleasantly surprised that much of the book is told from the perspective of Ethne, Harry's beloved. Her struggle to &quot;do the right thing&quot; is just as compelling as Harry's struggle to make up for the one time he didn't."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"For the best non-fiction account of the Anglo-Egyptian/Sudanese war of 1897-98 read Winston Churchill's &quot;The River War&quot;.

I expected there to be differences from the book and movie, but nothing of this magnitude. I enjoyed the movie, so I thought I'd enjoy the book. Instead, I found the movie to be much more compelling than the book, which, in comparison, was a sappy soap opera. The book - I felt - focused more on Durrance's blindness and Ethne's self-imposed obligation to him. I at times completely forgot about Harry Feversham and what he was trying to accomplish. I felt the book's summary was very misleading; I felt the movie took the more interesting aspects of the book and expounded upon them. Even when you discard any thought of the movie, and you try to rate the book itself, it falls short. In the movie, I knew why Harry did what he did. While reading this book, I was still left wondering why. If I look at it as a romance novel, then it was well written. If I look at it as a war-type novel, then it totally missed the mark. I \\"sorta\\" recommend."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"A.E.W. Mason's book The Four Feathers is a story about courage, love and friendship. When Harry Feversham is notified that his regiment is to be sent to fight in the Sudan, he resigns his commission. Three of his fellow officers send him white feathers - the sign of cowardice. When Harry explains to his fianc&eacute; Ethne Eustace, why he has resigned, she gives him a fourth white feather. Harry did not want to be remembered as a coward and set out to prove his courage, have each person retract their accusation of cowardice and take back their feather.Harry travels to the Sudan in disguise and performs acts of bravery for two of the men, but the third man dies in battle before Harry can prove his courage to him. While Harry is undertaking these tasks, his best friend Jack Durrance has returned to England, having gone blind in Africa, to marry Ethne. His blindness helps him \\"see\\" that Ethne still loves Harry and Jack struggles between his affection for Ethne and his friendship to Harry. Harry's success in the Sudan prompts Ethne to take the two remaining feathers from him, restoring his honour.The book's short chapters make it move along quickly and it maintains its pace. Mason captures the historical mentality of the British under Queen Victoria, and accurately portrays the characters' actions in a believable fashion. The moral of being able to undo previous acts if you want to badly enough makes this book have a different meaning for every reader each time that they read it. Students of Literature or History should read this book. It may not be a historical document, but it allows the reader to see Victorian Britain from the Victorian perspective."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"A man must prove his courage to win back his sweet heart and his own self esteem by saving the lives of those who branded him a coward.

Actually, much of the tale is told from the point of view of the woman, as she learns of his adventures second-hand; it's a neat trick, and allows for one of the most complex female heroines in a tale of this kind.

The main character is a soldier, Harry Feversham. Once Harry is told that his regiment has been sent off to war he resigns as a soldier. Harry then receives four white feathers, one from Ethne and three from his friends in his regiment. The white feathers symbolize Harry's cowardice for resigning. Harry's resignation has further consequences not only involving his friends in the regiment, but the love of his life, Ethne Eustace.This tale is not only about the trials of war. This novel writes of the struggles of a man who has been labeled a coward by everyone he knows and cares about. I would not recommend this novel to any specific audience because I believe the way it has been written allows it to reach readers of every sort.I enjoy the love story prevalent throughout the novel. Harry's love for Ethne and his willingness to overcome whatever obstacles to win back her heart touched me. I admire the loyalty. Despite the original judgments made of Harry by his friends, they remain loyal in the end. Harry is depicted as such a strong character throughout this novel. Although his friends and family did not see it in him, the readers did. I admire Harry for overcoming so much, determined to show everyone that he is not a coward.This novel is incredibly well written. I love to read but I am very specific with what I enjoy. This novel is such an easy read not due to its diction, but to Mason's ability to keep the reader always wanting more. I unfortunately did not discover this novel on my own as it was assigned for school. However I wish I had. I recommend this novel to anyone and everyone. This novel encompasses all that is expected in a classical tale."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"A.E.W Mason's novel, The Four Feathers is a wonderfully written book combining the themes of love, friendship, honor and courage into an exciting and entertaining tale.In the story the main character Harry Feversham is branded a coward by his fianc&eacute;e and three close friends. Upon discovering his regiment is to be sent to war in the Sudan Harry resigns his commission to avoid the conflict. Harry's closest friends discover what he has done and give him four white feathers which signify his cowardice. The disgrace of being seen as a coward by those he cares for forces Harry to redeem himself for what he has done. The story follows Feversham's adventures as he goes to the Sudan to regain his lost honor. The story also examines the lives of those who branded him a coward as they begin to discover Harry's true character and are forced to deal with the decisions they made that sent Harry to the Sudan.The Four Feathers is a very exciting story that immerses the reader in the lives of the characters in the story. The reader can easily identify with the problems that each character must endure throughout the story. The reader is drawn into the relationships that the characters share with one another and begin to truly care for what happens to each individual.Mason's literary style allows the novel to flow smoothly. Although the story moves from place to place and character to character the reader is able to maintain a clear understanding of what is taking place. The novel itself is very entertaining and easy to read.I personally enjoyed this story a great deal. The book is told on a grand scope that took me through the history of the time and gave me a better understanding of culture and life in Victorian Britain. If you are a fan of history or just enjoy an exciting and entertaining read this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"I was very excited to read this book. Of all the choices I made for my classics challenge for this year, I was certain that I would enjoy this novel the most. In this case, my expectations were not met, and although I did ultimately enjoy this book, it will never be a favorite.The Four Feathers is the story of Harry Feversham, an English officer, who is descended from a long line of military heroes and expected to follow in their footsteps. One night, as a boy, Harry is present when his father and fellow Crimean war veterans are relating the tales of their military exploits. That night, they also happen to relate two stories of cowardice, which so distress young, sensitive, and impressionable Harry, that he is convinced from that time forward that he is himself a coward at his core. Years later, after becoming engaged to the beguiling Ethne Eustace, Harry is in the company of three friends when he receives a telegram notifying him that his regiment will soon leave for the Sudan. Harry resigns his commission, and ultimately receives three feathers from his once fellow officers and friends, as well as a fourth from Ethne as she breaks their engagement. Having lost everything he values, Harry begins a quest to redeem his shattered honor, and force those who have charged him with cowardice to recognize his worth.Prior to having read the novel, I had seen two movie adaptations. In both cases, the films contained quite a bit of action, intrigue, and hair-raising escapes. As I read the novel, I was somewhat surprised to find that the majority of the narrative resides in England and Ireland, and focuses particularly on the characters of Ethne and Jack Durrance, once Harry's greatest friend. Durrance is a great character; he is a born soldier who finds himself unexpectedly handicapped and forced to adapt in ways he had never expected. His honor is in some ways even greater than Harry's, and the ways in which he and Ethne relate to each other as romantic adversaries is interesting. However, I found myself longing to read about Harry. So much of Harry's story is told in hearsay and vague allusion by other characters that I found myself getting somewhat frustrated. For me, the last 70 pages of the book were the best as I was finally able to read about Harry and some of the situations in which he found himself.Despite my frustrations, there are many things to love about this book. The three main characters of the book are all studies in self-sacrifice for the good of others. If you enjoyed any of the film adaptations of the story, you may want to give the novel a try."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"My husband and I both really enjoyed this book (I always like when that happens). I liked the \\"old time\\" values already discussed in previous reviews - honor, honesty, etc. I'd like my children to read it when they get older and discuss it with them. It was hard to put down - I could have just kept right at it all weekend long (I don't get to do that much these days). Based on what I've read in the other reviews it seems like the movies might be a disappointment and it seems hardly fair to judge the book by them (the book came first!). I think it just might show what a good book it is that after all these years they've made as many movies as they have based on it! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"This edition is abridged. I have verified this, having (sadly) purchased it myself and checked against another edition.

It's no wonder Hollywood has made so many movie adaptations (my favorite adaptation, by the way, was the one starring Jane Seymour)!"},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"This novel by A.E.W. Mason is an epic tale about a young soldier named Harry Feversham. After receiving three white feathers of cowardness from his fellow soldiers, and one from Ethne, Harry sets out to redeem himself. The novel is slow to start, and stays dull throughout his ventures. For being a love story during a time of war, the book is lacking romance and battle. There are so many characters in the book that none of them ever seem to be fully developed; not even Harry. Halfway through the book I found myself wondering who three quarters of the characters were and what their significant role was in the novel. I have read the book twice and I still have no clue why Harry was retrieving the letters from the wall and what their importance was to the story. If you chose this book to read at night to put you to sleep, or really like patriotic British war stories, then by all means, this may be the book for you. As far as I'm concerned, the book was extremely hard to follow, the characters had little depth, and there was no action at all (this is supposed to be a story about a soldier). The novel was extremely predictable, and like most love stories, everything ends happily ever after. After Harry's heroic acts in the desert the three soldiers take their feathers back and this also wins Ethne's heart."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"I'm a fan of some kind of B-movies. Which means I like them if they are so silly you can laugh or at least smile through them. This works the best with movies that take themself very seriously. Honestly, I wouldn't have thought that a book could have the same effect, but \\"The Four Feathers\\" succeeds in being extremly funny - unintentionally, I suppose.A man is crazy enough to be afraid of war and therefore gets thrown out of the society by his friends and his fiancee because there is nothing they could less understand. Soon he figures this out himself and does some really exciting things to save his honor or something to that effect.As some have mentioned the book is \\"misunderstood\\", which means that it is not about Harry Feversham's stupid adventures to save his stupid honor, but mostly about the absolutely crazy relationships of his fiancee Ethne and his friend Durrance. This has to be read to believe. Durrance is blind you know, but since he is some kind of superhero he can sense everything this conversation partner does, breathes or thinks. Which doesn't help him of being the most miserable guy in the book getting nothing for giving everything. But there is Ethne, the woman, too, who feels pretty proud in marrying whoever comes along, as long as she can play some violin. Talk about some strong female roles here.And there is Harry, the main character, who is absent most of the book. Which may not be too bad, since his actions are far beyond reason. Not his \\"cowardishness\\", but everything after the feathers, his actions and thoughts.There is not a single character in the book you can relate to, because everyone is crazy about war and dying. Harry doesn't explain why he was scared of going into war. Everyone else doesn't understand it and the only person who pretends to understand it (Sutch), doesn't explain why. I suppose, the author had no idea too, so, well...I though it was great that it was called \\"Four Feathers\\", that four feathers were given out most dramatically and that one of them simply is for free, without any meaning. You could ask yourself why it simply wasn't called \\"The Three Feathers\\" and one was left out, but if you start like this you get crazy with this book.I can't believe anyone admires this. It is entertaining, somehow, I admit. It's not boring you know and, as I said, you can smile all the way. But taking it seriously is far beyond my understanding. I mean, this is a book that admires war, especially the colonial war that was all about expanding the white race. Therefore the \\"foreign\\" or arabic characters are just silhouettes or servants.But if you always wanted to read about a woman who gets happy when she hears a person was killed and her big love is tortured in a prison (because at least, that's not cowardish), then this \\"classic\\" is right for you. Or if you watched a movie like \\"Star Crash\\" or \\"Double Team\\" often enough and ever wondered if it was possible to manage to write a real B-movie-trash-book. Because this is definitely what it is."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"The front cover of the book might lead you to misunderstanding that &quot;Four Feathers&quot; is a book about war; actually, though it deals with the war in the Sudan in late 19th century, the book consists of superb descriptions of complicated psychology found in the hero, the heroine and their mutual friend. &quot;Four Feathers&quot; as a whole is not a book like &quot;She&quot; or &quot;Beau Geste,&quot; but it is rather a special kind of romance which could be found only in this era.To disprove his disgrace, the hero Harry Feversham, who quit his regiment just before being sent to the Sudan, decides to go to Africa, disguising himself as a Greek, and firmly is determined to give back three white feathers sent to him as a symbol of his being a coward. One clever touch is given here; his fiancee also added one feather to them, and rejected him in the face before their marriage. Now you think Harry must prove that he does not deserve such an act. And probably, you expect the book to draw you into the world full of adventure. No, you're wrong.There are certainly descriptions of adventure under the sizzling sun of Africa, but you must wait. Before they come, we are introduced to the complex relationship between Harry and other characters that are involved in his action. Various feelings of love, regret, courage, and suspicion, all caused as aftermath of the crucial action of sending white feathers, follow with a surprisingly and deeply psychological insight. Though the story is, as you expect, very melodramatic and sentimental, the characters are well-drawn and convincing, and if not as insightful as Henry James, surely deserves much serious attention.The adventure scenes come in the last third of the book, but the suspense is a little diminished due to the rather hasty ending of the book. (If you want to read a book full of adventure in Africa, I recommend P. C. Wren's &quot;Beau Geste,&quot; which I found a gripping tale, too.) Still, the descriptions of the House of Stone, concentration camp of POW, (where the author himself visited after the war ended) are still realistic and shocking, and will haunt your mind after reading, and as an adeventure story too, you won't be disappointed. In short, &quot;Four Feathers&quot; is one of the greatest forgotten bestsellers in the English literature."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"This book is full of noble ideas and notions of Victorian honor in the days of the British Empire. Those who come to this book after seeing the 1939 Korda classic, or even the more stark 1979 re-make might be in for a suprise. Even as this review is written yet another cineamtic foray is being planned with a Fall 2002 re-re-make. No doubt 21st century notions of Political Correctness shall be heavy handed on this 19th Century classic.Still, I think readers will be in for a bit of a disappointment here. Not for the book itself which is a sublime piece of writing, a work typical ot the pathos of the time, but because of the lack of action contained therein. This is a pyschological and emotional work. The main charcters have many inner feelings to deal with. The plot moves slowly at times, building to a gradual crescendo typical of Victorian novels of the day before it resolves itself in rapid sequences.The film versions convey the general impression of the book, but there are not big clamatic battles of Omdurman or prison breaks which made the Korda movie such a rousing epic. Here Harry Faversham is very much on his own to resolve his fears and inner emotions, as are his friends. Its good to see a book like this revived, but readers who come to it from the movie theater or video are apt to be suprised at what they find here. Lets hope the find the suprise a pleasant and interesting one. I know I did."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"This book is NOT Four Feathers. It may be Two and one half feathers. It is mercilessly abridged, but if you haven't seen the original, you won't know how you are being cheated. Be warned and stay away."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"A.E.W. Mason's classic story of love lost and courage found is over a hundred years old, but its themes are timeless: love, friendship, and courage, along with the human desire to make right the wrongs of the past.Harry Feversham is a young officer in the British army whose greatest fear is to be seen a coward, and disgrace those whom he loves. On the night he finds out that he is to be sent to war in Egypt, he resigns his commission in order to avoid any possibility that his fears may be realized. In response to Feversham's act, three of his friends send him three white feathers as a symbol that in their eyes, the decision makes him a coward. When Feversham's fiancee, Ethne Eustace, finds out about Feversham's act and the three feathers, she gives Harry a fourth feather, and casts him out of her life. A broken man, Feversham quitely resolves to redeem himself by proving his bravery to each of the four, forcing each to recant their accusation of cowardice and take back the feather that each person gave.What evolves is a grand tale of adventure, as the lives of Feversham and his closest friends move along through the next few years. Ethne moves on with her life, while not entirely forgetting Feversham, nor forgiving herself for her harsh treatment of him. Harry's best friend, Jack Durrance, is blinded in the Sudan and returns to England to marry Ethne, but never forgets about Feversham, and wonders what happened to his friend. As details of Feversham's deeds begin to emerge, both Ethne and Durrance begin to understand Feversham's character; they realize their true feelings about him, and about each other.The characters in Mason's story have a Victorian simplicity, which, while limiting their outward emotions, adds to the conflict with which they have to deal. The desire to do the right thing, for love or friendship, is a strong theme in this book, which works well with the contrast between the harsh Sudan and the comforts of England; for in each location, the characters are found to suffer and survive in different ways, but in equal measure. For having been written 100 years ago, the characters and story hold up very well against modern standards.I very much enjoyed this book, and now understand why it has been made into a movie several times. The combination of intense emotion and epic adventure in far-off lands makes for some compelling reading, and a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"My first exposure to this story was the 1977 movie version featuring Beau Bridges and Jane Seymour. I always thought it was a great story, and when I heard there was a new movie remake coming out, I looked into it, discovering that there was a book behind it all.One reason I was fascinated by the book is that it is a cross-cultural experience. The book is now over a hundred years old, so the world-views and values of the characters and the author are significantly different from my own. Certainly I would agree with other reviewers that the Arabian and African characters are nothing but silhouettes, and that colonialism is not necessarily something Westerners should be are proud of. But these things are in line with the worldview of the author and his society. Other contemporaries of Mason may have questioned the values of the day, but he doesn't explicitly oppose them. Even if the reader doesn't agree with the 19th century values, one can still appreciate how the characters each wrestled with their lot in life within the framework of their society.I also enjoyed many of the author's insightful descriptions. At one point he describes the reason for Ethne's fear and reluctance to play her violin as that she considers it her \\"indiscreet friend\\" (p. 191). It will reveal her feelings when she most wants to keep them in. Then there is the simply hilarious description of Captain Willoughby's social skills, or lack there of, on page 241.Having seen one of the movie versions first, the original story had some surprises for me (pretty hard to squeeze a 400 page book into a two-hour movie). Ethne's character has a lot more depth and fascination than the 1977 movie. And the adventure story line has a few extra twists as well. Also, Feversham as a main character is almost absent more than he is present. The story is his, but it is told as observed and discovered by the other characters.This story offers adventure combined with a serious romance. If you can go along with the late 19th century perspectives on life, this is a story worth reading."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"My mother bought this book for me when I was a young girl-tomorrow I'll be 66 yrs old..I remember reading it over and over and even though I knew the ending, I'll could sabor the whole story like the first time--Now I'm buying for my grandchildren and hoping that they will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"I found this book to be a classic tale of honour and redemption, dealing with love and perceived cowardness. This book is about a young man, Harry Ferversham, who is brought up in an old military family, thinks he is a coward and is about to be married to a girl who's father disproves of the military. As a result, he decides to quite the military. The trouble comes when he finds out that his unit is about to be shipped off to war, just before he quits, but he decides to quite anyways. Three of his friends in his military unit send him white feathers of cowardness, and when his fianc&eacute;e finds out, she breaks off her engagement, and gives him a fourth feather.Harry, with his life in tatters decides to go and attempts to do heroic acts for his friends, in the hope that if they redeem their feathers, his fianc&eacute;e, Ethne Eustace, will withdraw hers.Meanwhile, Jack Durrance, one of Harry's other friends, finds out that Harry and Ethne's relationship has been broken off, but not why it was broken off. He tries to court Ethne, as he was in love with her before, but she has now decided that she made a mistake with sending Harry away, and doesn't love Jack. Before she can tell him this, Jack gets blinded, and she decides to pretend to love him so that she can care for him.Interestingly, this story is told, after the feathers have been given, primarily from the viewpoints of Ethne and Jack, which allow the reader to find out what's happening only as those characters do, and it also allows us to see Jack and Ethne's thoughts towards each event as they slowly piece together what is and has happened with Harry.A warning note is, like many of my fellow reviewers have stated, there is very little action in the book, unlike in the movie adaptations, as many of the events are just mentioned as a backdrop. But, this is not a bad thing, as this story does not need any major action scenes, and they would probably hurt this story, which is more of personal struggles, of love and honour, than battles.This story has some 19th Century ideals, such as colonialism, and the fact that there is only one non-white character in the book, who, while he plays a fairly major supporting role, is not that well developed, nor is he a very strong character. Despite all of this, I really enjoyed its tale of honour and redemption, and if this book is taken as a product of it's time, it is really quite amazing. The book also gives the reader a great view of upper-class English life in this time period."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"The Four Feathers by A.E.W. Mason is a riveting tale that relates the natural human need for redemption through a story that realistically depicts the complex interrelationships between love, friendships, trust, and courage.Harry Feversham, a young man who finds himself born into a historic family of proud British military men, wants nothing more than to be free of such a heritage. Whereas his forefathers fought and died with great courage, Harry is petrified of risking his life for his country and mentally labels himself a coward. Nevertheless, he has little choice but to follow in his father's footsteps.When Harry's regiment is finally summoned to go to war in the Sudan, Harry's fear of his own cowardice overcomes his fear of his father, and he accordingly resigns his commission. Once three of Harry's closest companions uncover the reason for his decision to resign, they decide to each send him a single white feather to signify his cowardice.What ensues is a story of Harry's heroic attempts at redemption, not only from his friends and from his father, but also from the girl of Harry's dreams, who, being present at the time Harry receives the feathers, adds her own to the original three.Throughout the exciting events and plot twists of The Four Feathers, Mason presents to readers a reality of human emotions and impulses which cannot draw comparison. The characters of The Four Feathers explore the complexities of humanity, loyalty, friendships, love, courage, and justice in such a fashion that each reader can relate to in his or her own individual way, making each turning of the page even more personal and captivating than the last. The three most primary characters of The Four Feathers, Harry, Ethne Eustace, and Jack Durrance, become involved in a triangle of love, loyalty, and misleading each other about how each feels about the other two in order to try and preserve these traits.Mason's novel, The Four Feathers, is highly recommended for all those seeking an exciting romantic adventure to capture their attention for hours on end. There is no question that Mason's work is one of the masterpieces of twentieth century literature."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"The four feathers is a tale of the meaning of Victorian virtues of heroism. The tale takes on a very Clausewitzian stance on the difference between physical courage, shown in Durrance, and moral courage, shown in Harry Feversham. Harry is disgraced for he refused to face combat in Sudan in the late 1880's. He is sent white feathers by his comrades and given one by his to be fianc&eacute;, Ethne. He then takes a path of redemption to regain honour in the eyes of his friends and woman. Overall, this novel is an excellent show of the difference between moral and physical courage, and with deep psychological development in the characters.This novel is one of the most intriguing character development novels, perhaps even rivaling Heart of Darkness. The characters of Harry, Durrance, and Ethne are all so engaging and enticing that you cannot but help to get engrossed within this novel. Yet that is where the engagement ends. The front cover of this novel is indeed very deceptive. The work is predominately, as one reviewer already noted, a psychological and emotional journey. This book is not an action war novel in the likes of Cornwell, Clancy, Smith, O'Brian, Forrester, and other military writers. The reader used to these kinds of action-packed works with a great balance between character development (Sharpe and Harper, or Aubrey and Dr. Maturin being the most famous character pairs)and historical military action will find this novel sorely lacking. The novel retains a hint of allusion to action such as breaking of squares and night-actions and the like, yet the reader seeking a vivid mental imagery finds the material lacking in description. The descriptions of POW life and the House of stone were haunting, yet seem misplaced within a Victorian war novel. The action (or allusion to it, as is predominately the case) in the novel is sorely to further the admittedly outstanding character development of Harry, Durrance, Sutch, Ethne, and other distinguished characters.Overall an excellent character development story, yet to those looking for action and a historical analysis of actual battles and fighting, look to the aforementioned authors instead."},{"Title":"The Four Feathers","review":"A.E.W Mason's novel, The Four Feathers is an intriguing journey of a seemingly unheroic man who finds courage in cowardice. The Four Feathers is a novel of honour, love, friendship and courage.The main character, Harry Fevershman overcomes the disgrace of receiving three white feathers of cowardice from fellow officers, as well as one from his fianc&eacute;e Ethne Eustace, and therefore partakes on a journey in which to redeem his honour. After his sudden loss of sight, Harry's friend Jack Durrance, begins to realize Harry's true character. As Jack and Ethne become engaged to be wed, neither can forget Harry; his friendship, love, and in due course, courage. From Harry's cowardice, he is given the courage to embark upon this life changing crusade.The novel is written in a very fulfilling manner, with in depth explanation of characters and situations. The structure of the novel is fantastic; much of the novel is interoperated by the reader from the character development, as opposed to being explained by the author, with no thought on behalf of the reader. From this, the reader is always kept at a distance, guessing the next move, the next conflict. This is most defiantly shown, as Jack only after the loss of sight, can see the conflict which drew Harry and Ethne apart, and embarked Harry on his mission of redemption. The Four Feathers makes for a remarkably intriguing read.The portrayal of loyalty and courage recited within the Four Feathers enhances the emotions of the reader remarkably. Contrary to the film The Four Feathers, directed by Shekhar Kapur, the battle scenes within the novel are not as enhancing and exciting as portrayed by Kapur, but the characters are explained in much more depth and precision. This book is recommended toward the reader who prefers stimulating character development, as opposed to preference of battle scenes and extreme action."},{"Title":"Thirty years among the dead","review":"Dr. Carl Wickland MD would not have agreed with the conclusions of Dr. Stevens [...]. He specifically stated that all of the memories observed in such cases were actually originating from the discarnate spirit of the deceased, who was attached to the patient. He did not accept the case of the deceased spirit entering into a new incarnation. Of course Dr. Wickland was dealing with the psychosis of much older patients and did not to my knowledge examine any of the type of patients that Dr. Stevens did.Dr. Wickland's work is of great importance to the understanding of Origenes' theory of \\"The Restoration of All Things.\\" [...] But it only addresses one aspect and that is of the \`Lost Souls\\". Early Christians had prayed regularly for the \`Lost Souls', and Dr. Wickland gives us many reasons why we should do so today. When discarnate spirits do not accept the divine order and return to where they belong, they are able to \`molest' people with whom they have had some sort of special relationship.What does this have to early Christian teaching? First of all, it gives us a very good lesson in Free Will. As M. C. Steenberg [...] most rightly points out, if all souls were destined to go to heaven, then where does Free Will come in? Dr. Wickland describes in great detail the amount of havoc that these discarnate spirits were allowed to bring to his patients. He also shows how they must choose to stop their activities among humans and accept divine guidance.Secondly, his work gives a hint of the order that exists in the divine spiritual world and gives us an idea as to how many angels are actually around us, active in the restoration process, guiding us during our life and afterwards.The discarnate spirits that Dr. Wickland encountered in his work certainly represented only a small subset of the discarnate spirits. When their body dies, the majority submit to the divine order. To find out about these, we must look to different sources.Shawn Murphy[...]"},{"Title":"Thirty years among the dead","review":"I read and reread this book several years ago. It gave great insight into the realms of the spirits and their rather very serious impact on those living. The departed spirits communicated through an intermediary, medium, his wife. The stories told touched my heart and enhanced my understanding of the nature and character of the spirits. That provided wealth of information for my book, Secrets of Life, Beyond...I would highly recommend this book not only to healthcare providers but the public at large.Mohinder Goomar, M.D., F.R.C.S. (Ret.), author, Secrets of Life, Beyond..."},{"Title":"Thirty years among the dead","review":"I read this book 15 years ago, so my memory may be getting dim. But it's about the author's experience treating cases of spirit possession. A typical case is a young man who felt the need to run away and go to sea. It turned out, as the author discovered, that he was being strongly influenced by a dead sailor. He asked the sailor to leave the young man alone, and that was the end of that.Wickland claimed no spiritual powers but used an intermediary (I think it was his wife, who would go into a trance). His method was to interview the spirits hanging around the patient. He would inquire as to how their life had been, and what they are trying to do with the patient. He would then recommend that they leave him alone and go rather with the \\"Mercy Crew\\" (a multi-racial group of higher-lever departed spirits who chose to work with the Wicklands).So he did confidently what Joel Haley Osmont (of \\"I see dead people\\" fame) did fearfully in \\"The Sixth Sense\\".Forgive me if my memory deceives me in a few details. I think I'll order a copy and re-read it."},{"Title":"Thirty years among the dead","review":"This is a great book! If you are haunted or believe in afterlife (or think you do) you should read this. It explains magnetic aura attraction and earth bound entities. It also explains the importance of your spiritual conciousness.

The multiple conversations in each chapter explain the topics and the level of conciousness of the earthbound entity.

Wickland's &#34;Thirty Years Among the Dead&#34; is a classic and one of the most important works on spirit possessions and channeling. This book reveals the author's efforts to &#34;cure&#34; his patients through spiritual/psychological techniques, and one of these techniques was much similar to a spirit release therapy. He would subject his patients to an electroshock therapy in order to drive out spirits, and then these spirits would be transferred to his medium wife, so the author would speak with the spirits. He did this in an attempt to convince the spirits to let go of his patients and move on to the next level, so to speak. In most of the cases, it was a success and the patients were &#34;cured.&#34;The book, consisted of 450+ pages, goes on for 17 chapters, including both the case examples and theories of spirit possessions. I do not recommend this book to be one of the kind, but only one aspect of the whole for understanding of spirits and how they can be attached to living people.Personally, I've found this volume to be a remarkable resource and a full of interesting case studies, including a number of cases where spirits would still be craving for drugs and alcohol after death and they would be attached to physical people whom in turn indulged in the similar consumptions.

It's written in such a down-to-earth style for the average ordinary human. Howell tells us the stories of a man who was born 2000 years ago and makes us fall in love with this crazy radical called Jesus. He shows examples from those &quot;saintly&quot; lives like St. Francis and Mother Theresa and Augustine and Martin Luther as well as many, many others who believe 100% that Jesus is the Son of God and how it has transformed their lives. They believe Christ lives within them... and thus their hands do Jesus' work-which is that of loving and taking care of all those around us.In the self-absorbed century we just left, we have very much gotten away from helping our fellow man, haven't we? Howell suggests that perhaps we are just all too full of &quot;stuff and things and material possessions&quot;. We need to get involved....to develop hearts that are impassioned for mankind.If you belong to one of those &quot;tight Christian social clubs&quot; where everyone in your church is homogeneous and you emphasize in reach more than out reach, this book is a much-needed wake-up call for you. Read and absorb... We are all mortals who will face that judgment day. How empty-handed are you?&quot;We are put on earth a little space, that we may learn to bear the beams of love&quot;-a thought-provoking quote by Wm Blake. What a perfect read to begin the year 2000."},{"Title":"YOURS ARE THE HANDS OF CHRIST THE PRACTICE OF FAITH","review":"I grew up with James C. Howell. In fact, he's my brother.

It opened my mind as to the limitless things I could do that would be an extension of Jesus.James is non-judgemental. He simply presents what he feels is the love of Jesus through other people in the ways they touch, heal, teach, or feed others. Who are these other people? Mother Teresa, for one - but my dirt poor grandfather is in there, as well as other &quot;plain ole folks&quot; that I've never had the privilege to know.James tells you how to be one of those who make a difference.Now, keep in mind that James is a minister.

This edition has a complete Table of Contents which not only allows you to navigate to each individual play, but also to each act and then each individual scene.This is EXACTLY what I was looking for in a KINDLE Shakespeare collection. Every other version I've tried has been a terrible waste of money and I wonder how long it's going to be before Amazon starts acting responsibly and deleting the worthless e-text versions of this and other collections or offering trial samples of every book listed so people will stop being ripped off.The only improvement I could see is for the table of contents and the individual listings to be justified on the right side of the screen next to the Kindle cursor, but the spacing is wide enough between lines that this is really just quibbling. I would like to see every Kindle book with this simple modification."},{"Title":"WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE","review":"I downloaded the sample chapter of this e-book, and immediately noticed two things. First, it's not properly using the Kindle \\"table of contents\\" feature. While there is a page near the front of the book that says \\"Table of Contents\\" on top and has links to the contents of the book, if you load up the Kindle's \\"Go to...\\" feature the \\"table of contents\\" button is grayed out, so they must not have tagged their table of contents page correctly.Secondly, and much more importantly, there are no line breaks after the individual lines of dialogue in the play. Shakespeare's plays are mostly composed in iambic pentameter, and these iambic pentameter sections are almost always printed like poetry, with a line break after each \\"line\\" of five iambic feet, so that you can discern the meter more easily. In the sample chapter of this book, there are no such line breaks, and all the dialogue runs together into paragraphs. Having the line breaks in the right place is one of the baseline requirements for an edition of Shakespeare, so I give this one star.If the publisher revises the book to correct these two features, then it'll be worth taking a second look at this edition. Otherwise, avoid it."},{"Title":"WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE","review":"The book that I received was not the one that I ordered on Amazon.com.

The story is fictional, yet it focuses on an issue most of us have had to deal with at one time or another, and that issue is loss of someone we love. This story ventures further down that path to a type of loss from which there seems no redemption, and that is the unbearable sense of loss when one feels they were responsible in some way for their loved one's passing. Grief mixed with Guilt can literally steal away a person's soul. They live in constant pain and remorse. Sometimes that level of grief/guilt is so destructive the person feels it is not fair that they get to continue to live their lives. So it was with the main character in the story named Skip. Grief/Guilt caused him to leave everything behind and cease to exist,emotionally. He tried living homeless on the streets for that was all he felt he deserved; he didn't deserve a good life. This action did not relieve his pain, so there was only one step lower to go and that was to cease to exist physically, he would commit suicide. His wife and child's deaths had to be avenged. All along his journey toward his own end, good samaritans seem to appear, showing him kindness and love, trying to get him to see his humaness and that there is a world of consequences in life that happen to us and our loved ones outside our own control. Maybe there was something that he should have done, or shouldn't have done, but if one's actions were not purposed upon harm, it was a condition called being human with all of its imperfections. This was the lesson others were trying to teach Skip before he took his own life. Human love and compassion shown by others snatched Skip from the grips of death and gave him purpose of life again. You walk each step with Skip and feel every emotion he feels. A very gripping story."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"This writer, Mr.Tim Greaton, obviously knows his craft. The characters are brought to life early in the story and continue to grow in the reader's mind.

Have you ever started reading a book and felt an immediate connection with the characters? That's exactly how I felt as I paged through this relatively quick read.

The beginning seems to be a haunting of sorts, which is not fully explained until the end of the story.The existence of the homeless in our cities is explored through the eyes of a man who has lost his wife and infant son in a tragic Christmas Eve fire. His guilt in not being with them that night ends his successful career and leaves him homeless and wandering, seemingly purposeless and yet feeling destined to make amends for his perceived fault in their deaths.The settings of an upstate New York urban area, with the callous attitudes of regular people toward irregular people is balanced by the kindness of the rural small village population in far northern Vermont. This stereotypical portrayal of people in cities is somewhat balanced by the character who cares for the homeless in her own tough way, but it seems not quite enough, which is why I rated this one four stars.Great use of language, very few typos, and a storyline that somehow fit the season.You can find it at Amazon as a free Kindle book. I am glad I took the time to read this story."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"This is a very well written story which has the protagonist returning from the brink of disaster to a meaningful life.

Getting there and jumping off that bridge are not easy, though.

For some reason, I thought this was a horror story about a guy dressed as Santa. Boy, did I get that wrong.I absolutely fell in love with the characters in Albany and then the tiny Vermont town. Every situation this down-on-his-luck hero gets thrown into shows us more about our own attitudes and what's really important in life.I absolutely don't want to tell much of the story here because what you don't know as you start reading is as important as what you do know.

A former lawyer is homeless in Albany, New York and deeply depressed over the loss of his wife and child in a fire on Christmas Eve a year ago. He contemplates suicide and goes to Gray, Vermont, a small town near the Canadian border planning to leap from a bridge he hears about.This is a wonderful spiritual tale of hope and the chance to redeem yourself and to help others no matter how low you get. Thank you, Mr. Greaton for a story that brightened my Christmas season and probably for many Christmases to come. I hear he has a sequel coming out soon, but I can't imagine how how he will top this one.I paid only 99 cents for it a few months ago, but it is worth much more.

Anderson, Author of DEADLINE"},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"This is an imaginative story that grabs you at the beginning and doesn't let you go. So many Christmas stories end up sounding very familiar. This one doesn't. It's an entirely different Christmas story that deals with sorrow, guilt and generous spirits everywhere. It frames Christian behavoir without being specifically a religeous story. I recomend this book to anyone who would like to be reminded that each of us has the ability to change someone's world for the better. This is not a story for families of young children. The topics of extreme guilt, sorrow and homelessness are mature in nature. However, it is very clean and would be a good story for teens."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"There's a tendency for Christmas novels to dwell on its joyful, glittery aspect, but here is one with a difference. It deals with the darker side of Christmas - the side experienced by lonely, deprived and ill people, the homeless and the bereaved, who find this time of good cheer and happiness hard to bear.Our hero is Skip who lost his family in a Christmas Eve fire. He was at a boring office party and so escaped the same fate. However, he's consumed by guilt and falls apart, ending up on the streets. He makes up his mind to commit suicide on the anniversary of the deaths of Tabitha his wife and Derek his son, but bumps into an assortment of warm-hearted, selfless people who start to test his resolve. It takes a visit to The Santa Shop in Gray, Vermont, to point Skip towards making the right decision.This is a sad book but it's also joyful. You see the depths of human despair and people at their worst, but also people at their caring, generous best.

Very touching and makes you appreciate what you have in your life.."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"THE SANTA SHOPWhen I ordered this book, I expected a thriller. Since it said Samaritans Conspiracy wouldn't you? Well it was more of a feel good book and I did enjoy it enough that I will get more of them. However, it was definitely not the type of \\"conspiracy\\" that I am used to when I pick up a book that has that word in the title or series name. I love thrillers, mysteries etc. They are more the type of book I usually read, but this was interesting and I now have a new type of book to read, which is very refreshing!"},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"What is it with Hollywood, and all the pessimism that fills books and movies these days? Seems like the art of gladness and erupting joy has disappeared with a society that is becoming secular. It is no surprise that since we have been taught we evolved from primordial slime, and we just dissolve into nothingness when we die, that books and movies with good endings are very rare these days. Enter the Santa Shop by Tim Greaton! Finally, a man who knows how to build suspense into an eruption of pure joy, bringing tears of real happiness, and shouts of acclamation! After reading this book I purchased everything Tim has written. If you're tired of the pessimism of those who have no hope, if you're indignant at the \\"art\\" produced by those who shield themselves in darkness, if you're longing for the good old days when a good ending was considered a good thing, then read this book (and all the other books by Tim Greaton)!"},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"An absolute must read for all people who enjoy books that tug at the heart strings. The Santa Shop will pull you in from page one. I will put a book down if the author doesn't peek my curiosity from the first page. Tim Greaton had me from the first word! I did not put this book down until I had finished it. It took me approximately 2 hours of non stop reading. For those you that rarely finish a book because it does not capture your interest immediately, this book is for YOU! A story about life, loss, guilt, family, soul searching, suicide, options, redemption, and forgiveness. A must read! I can't wait for Tim's next book."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"After hearing about this book, I read the few chapters on &quot;The Santa Shop&quot; website and immediately went and bought the book. I could not put the book down. The Santa Shop was definately heartwarming. This is a great book for someone who wants fast and easy reading. I read this book in a day and loved it."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"I read this terrific book in 1 and a half days, I could not put it down! This is a wonderfully written story of love,despair,and hope as the reader follows Skip's journey of self discovery through the emotions that come with loss, and the discovery of what Christmas, and life, is all about. As Skip experiences homelessness and other people's reactions to it, the reader can easily put themselves in his shoes, and realize just how quickly a person's status can change in life. This is an absolute MUST read, highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"There are no superflous words or padding in this Novel...it is purely distilled emotions, guided by a very adept writer. Powerfully written, yet crafted with a velvet pen.Greaton's characters come alive upon first appearance, and he has that rare ability to 'put you there in the scene.' If you have any imagination at all, the light reflected from the altar will hurt your eyes; you will feel real resentment at the offer of unsolicited charity; the extreme cold of the steel bridge rails will sear your fingers...and you will be the better for it.Buy this book; read it with an open mind, and your heart will rediscover the real spirit of life; not just Christmas. This is not a ho-ho-ho sleigh ride with Santa; It is a veritable roller-coaster ride from laughter to sorrow, and back again.This is the most engaging first novel I have read since Harper Lee's \\"To Kill A Mockingbird.\\"Sam ElmoreAmelia, La."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"Tim Greaton has written an incredible book. It takes the reader on a journey through twelve months with a man whose life takes a tragic turn on Christmas Eve. His self-imposed guilt, surrounding that evening, weighs him down until he decides to take his own life. What happens at that moment shows us how we are magically tied together as humans. How every thoughtful thing we do, or say, to each other, can help lift another person up from the depths of depression. Can inspire them to do something positive with their life. And may save their life.The Santa Shop is a truly inspirational book."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"Downloaded this book to my Kindle last Friday. I started reading it during a lull on a visit to an elderly relative, I had intended only to read a few pages, but the story drew me in so completely that before I knew it I'd read the whole thing. I loved the unexpected twist at the end, really clever.Truly a very emotive story, brilliantly crafted. I whole-heartedly recommend this to everyone...and not just for Christmas reading. This is a great book for any time of year."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"I read it in under 2 hours only because I couldn't put it down. Inspiring, unexpected and a feel good story!"},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"I read this book in one sitting and must admit that the story and emotions portrayed were very engaging and very real.Living in Arctic Canada, where suicides occur more often than in the southern provinces, The Santa Shop provided a glimpse into the heart, indeed soul, of a person plagued by thoughts of suicide. I wrote a non-fiction book at one point dealing with this very subject and, when I release it as a Kindle version, I will me promoting The Santa Shop along with it.Without giving away the story, this book definitely shows - even from a work of fiction - that God is ready and willing to meet our every need. Even when we are at our lowest point, God is willing to embrace us and fill our souls with hope and promise. Absolutely wonderful, Tim!"},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"What a joy it was to read this touching story. I love that the protagonist is a homeless man. It gives Tim Greaton the opportunity to show us the world from this character's point of view. The adjective that kept jumping out at me was \\"invisible.\\" It is sadly true that this is the way \\"normal\\" people often treat the disadvantaged. It is easiest to turn away, not because we humans are inherently cruel, but, as Tim says, because we see what we fear we may become. How many of us are only a tragedy away from living life in the shadows?This is the tale of a man's pain and guilt over the death of his wife and child. It might seem strange that one so filled with these terrible emotions could, at the same time, be so practical in the way that he plans his own suicide. Yet this is often exactly what happens. In extreme misery, latching onto an idea, no matter how self-destructive, gives you a focus that enables you to carry on. Our hero (for he is most definitely a hero) is able to worry about the effect he has on others, right down to the concern over who will find his body. It is actually amusing to follow his thoughts as he prepares, while never forgetting his pain. His journey back to the light is accomplished with the help of many people, some mysterious and some just ordinary folks whose acts of kindness warm the heart. This is an absolutely beautiful story in the true Christmas spirit that inspires all year round."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"Loved every bit of this story. actually made me get a little emotional at one point.Finely woven plot, with a deep, underlying message...couldn't put it down and will definitely read more by Mr. Greaton.Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"Awesome story, couldn't stop reading until it was done.

Tim Greaton leaves nothing to assume--he leaves you broken and ashamed right alongside Skip. The title, The Santa Shop, becomes ever clearer at the end of the story and I couldn't think of a better title.Just when you think there couldn't possibly been any good to come of Skip's story, Santa has a gift up his sleeve.

It is hard because you wish that you could help everyone out. End hungry and all kinds of other things people suffer from. This story was close to another book/story called \\"Pay it Forward\\". Great concept. . ."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"I first met Tim through Twitter (of all places). I sent him a tweet about a number of errors in the Kindle Edition, but it turned out to be someone else's book. Oooops! Sorry again, Tim. He mentioned \\"The Santa Shop\\" to me and I grabbed the Kindle Edition. Ever since, Tim has become a my second favorite author from Maine.\\"The Santa Shop\\" grabbed my attention from the first few paragraphs and held it to the last few words. In fact, I read through the book in one sitting as I didn't want to wait to see how it turned out for Skip. I am glad that I read it through in one sitting the first time as it helped satisfy my curiosity. The best part was reading it a second and third time as it allowed the images and feelings and words to really sink through and take hold. I found myself pitying Skip for the painful time he went through. I was comforted by Father Johnston, Martha and Jenny as they each try to reach out and help. I found myself pitying Skip again as he stood by the bridge comtemplating what to do next and by the end I was smiling and cheering for Skip's decision.As a pastor and a preacher, I am always on the lookout for a books that touch/speak to you in more than one way and \\"The Santa Shop\\" did just that. I have already passed the title to a number of friends and church members. Also, I am sure that it will pop up in a sermon or two...especially during the Advent/Christmas Season.Give it a shot! It is certainly worth your time and you just might find yourself more thankful for what you have in life and maybe even a bit more willing to help others in need."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"It doesn't happen for me often, but every once in a blue moon, I read a story that touches my heart and soul. This beautiful story by Tim Greaton is such a book. It is a \\"Christmasy\\" story to an extent, but it can be enjoyed any time of year. Greaton's book teaches a few very important lessons about love, understanding, forgiveness, hope, and acceptance.Unlike some who have commented, I was able to connect with the main character, Skip, right away. I rode the tide of pain along with him as he speaks about his losses, which are many. I also fell in love with the characters who, although had smaller parts in the book, made a big impact.This is a lovely book that needs to be shared with the world. I've read it twice now and each time, I took something from it lifted my spirits and made me smile. It is truly an inspirational story that can teach us all so much."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"A beautiful story of loss and redemption.

It's a little slow in the beginning, but staying with it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"Tim Greaton chronicles a tension-filled story of a homeless man who finds Christmas haunting him against his will. You are there as you see Skip struggle, tied to his desire to find an end to a grief-filled existence. Skip meets person after person who challenges him in ways he finds hard to resist. His bare bones living is punctuated with examples of a meager life lived mostly in his head, while he crawls through the gritty underbelly of life as a homeless person in the world around him. The reality of the daily search for survival while he plots what he should do is gripping. Engaging characters try to get through to him, but Skip's devastated heart leads him on toward his destiny.My heart hurt for Skip because the chosen words tied me to the story I couldn't quit reading until I reached the end. No stopping till I found out what happened. With a sigh, I hoped that everyone has a chance to read this new Christmas classic with an age old lesson or two thrown in."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"The Santa Shop by Tim Greaton is simply a wonderful read. I couldn't put it down. Tim weaves this story in such a smooth, masterful way. Its message is simple and meaningful. His descriptive writing will paint pictures on the walls of your mind. I've never really had a strong desire to visit the Northeast, so I couldn't believe how much he had me wishing I could take a trip to the small Vermont village he describes. The only thing which could have made it better was if I'd read it on Christmas Eve, but don't wait until then. You can always read it again."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"I won't forget this novel in a hurry and in fact, shed a few tears along the way.Tim Greaton explores the grief and guilt of his main character in a loving, sympathetic way. Skip, a hot shot lawyer until Christmas Eve one year previously, is on the streets. Driven to madness by his grief at the loss of his wife and son in a fire, his questions - Why was he not there? Why didn't he save them? He should have been the one to die - seemingly will not be answered. So he decides to punish himself by committing the ultimate act.However, through a magical journey of love and caring, Skip learns that fate has ideas other than his desire to follow his family and finally understands that to start climbing out of an abyss, one has to get to the bottom first.A wonderful story from a deep-thinking, gentle writer and I would recommend this book to everyone who has needed solace at come time in their life - and haven't we all?"},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"Who hasn't been in the position where you felt guilty about something and wanted to do something to atone or change the past?

I loved the characters and the mystery that kept you on through out the novel. I also liked the writing style very much and thought that it put and extra spark to the story. I really enjoyed how Tim made you feel a very strong connection with his character and made the life experiences so real that you can feel the emotions just as strong with the character. This story had very natural life like resemblances to what you might actually feel or do if you were put in this situation. Tim Greaton has a very unique writting style and I can't wait to read his other novels.If you like up lifting stories that will bring your spirit up and make you think, this is the book for you.

I could not begin to love the character as not enough was told me about him. I didn't quite have the compassion for his plight I should have given his story.The use of first person worked towards the end, yet I found myself confused at the start. Between Chapters One and Two, the change of person lost me entirely. More needed to be said to indicate it was the perspective of two different people, as I did not know who was speaking.I was somewhat surprised by the plot(parts of it were predictable)but again, not enough was explained about the Vermont town to give it enough suspense. I questioned at the last how the town kept producing a girlfriend for each \\"Santa.\\" Given it's a small town, that seems unlikely.My biggest peeve was with the grammar and spelling, words were misused and misplaced and sentences needed better structure to create good flow.

The plot could have been interesting if there had been any attempt at character development or fleshing out of details, but it was just page after page of bare bones information without the detail needed to make it interesting. The writer made the mistake of telling the story instead of showing the story.

Many people look at homeless individuals as low life or lazy. This novel is from the eyes of a homeless man. He was well educated and a professional and yet he found himself homeless. How he was treated for the most part was not a surprise. It was nice to see that there were a few individuals out there that took the time to get to know him and show him some kindness. To consider suicide it has to be about as low as you can possible get. Greaton brought this character into my home and I will truly try to look at the homeless from a different perspective. This is not a humorous book, but one line I will remember forever. You've got to finish your Pop-Tarts. Made me laugh, I even had to read a few paragraphs to my husband. It was such a great line.

I do hope that the author has plans for a sequal or series as it was pleasantly open-ended. I can't wait to read more by this author. 'Under-Heaven' is also a great read by this author."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"This is a truly engaging story; once started, putting it down was NOT an option. It is rare to find a book that allows you to feel as though you walk the journey yourself. The social undertones of The Santa Shop with its vivid portrayal of homelessness brought me through the currents of life that can sweep any person to that place. The author has done a wonderful job of bringing together the despair that so many feel in the holiday season and the hope that can be found even when your not looking for it. This a very well written novel that captures the meaning of Christmas in a way that is rarely depicted. I think it's a must read and I am so glad I did!"},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"I normally have a set outline for reviews, but this book has left such an impression on me that I felt compelled to deviate from that format. There is a good reason for this and I will explain. This story is about a man who had a horrible Christmas experience that brought him to a suicidal state one year after that tragic incident. For me, I have never been suicidal, but Christmas has always been an emotional time for me due to similar reasons. My mother died just two weeks before Christmas when I was nine years old. The doctors knew she wouldn't make it and warned my family to prepare for her upcoming death. Brain cancer had left her in a very weakened state, but she wanted to see me and my younger brother open our gifts one last time. So we celebrated early with her that year. Then just a few days later, the cancer won the battle and took her from us. When the actual time for Christmas arrived, my father, brother, and I were in a rather depressed state. A few small, cheap gifts were exchanged. My father was trying, in his own way, but he wasn't our mother who did Christmas in a big way. Also, despite medical insurance, the cost of cancer had left us nearly destitute.We tried to hang in there that first year. My father attempted to play the dual role of mom and dad, but eventually his depression caught up with him. Alcohol became his alternative and what money we had went toward feeding that need in him to drown out his sorrows. Our Christmas' became a decorated tree with little or nothing under them. Every year, I would cry myself to sleep and mourn the loss of my mother who had always known how to make holidays so special. By the time I had reached fourteen, it became too much. I planned ahead and saved every dollar I had, usually it wasn't much, maybe twenty or thirty total. Then, just a couple days before Christmas, I would go to whatever store was within walking distance to purchase little gifts for my brother and father. I wrapped these meager offerings up and placed them under the tree with the order they not be opened until the appropriate time.Once Christmas eve had arrived, I would drag my brother to the living room and awaken my father from his drunken stupor. Under my supervising eye, they would open those gifts and each might give a smile. It wasn't much, but somehow I had to make the holiday better for them. They had both fallen to depression, drinking, and other things by this time and I was the only one hanging on. In some way, I was trying to give them a bit of happiness. Then, after the wrapping was cleaned up, my father passed out again, and my brother back in his room, I would go off alone to cry. I had done what I could. All the holidays until I left home seemed to pass this way with only one or two minor exceptions.That first Christmas when I was eighteen years old was spent in Army barracks in North Carolina. I had just arrived at my unit two months before and only the soldiers who had been in the unit longer were given leave to go home. Perhaps not more than a dozen or so of us were left and I didn't know the others. I sat in my barracks room with its ugly cinder-block walls, once again depressed and even more alone than ever before. Then someone started pounding on all the doors, ordering us out into the hallway. We stumbled out, it was perhaps around 7pm so most hadn't gone to sleep, yet it was dark outside already. They told us all to go to the barracks entrance steps. I didn't want to and argued against it, but they told me it wasn't an option. To my surprise, upon reaching the entrance, a gathering of families were outside singing Christmas carols for us. It was a very cold night, yet they braved it to give us a little cheer. We even received cookies as a small gift. The children smiled so happily, knowing us soldiers needed that extra lift for the holiday. For ten minutes they stood there, just singing in chorus, in the cold, before moving on to the next building. It touched my heart to see people who selflessly came out on their holiday evening to show that they remembered us. The soldiers who sat alone in the dreary old barracks. Maybe they will never know how grateful I was for that kindness, but I hope they did.So you are probably wondering why I related my story to you. Well, if it touched you at all, then this book will as well. It is about depression, Christmas miracles, and people giving out of the goodness of their hearts. I couldn't read this all in one sitting. It brought out my own memories and caused tears to pour forth from my eyes. I had to walk away from it a couple of times, but always felt compelled to come back and read more. It touched me deeply and I'm glad I read it. For this reason, I'm giving it five stars. Any author that can write a story that pulls so deeply at my heart is truly talented. You will not be sorry for having read this story. It is truly a beautiful tale."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"Tim has written a wonderful book, more about life than Christmas, which was an inspiration to me. His characters are alive and you feel as if you know them. You hurt when they hurt, love when they love, and feel what they feel. His descriptions put you right there and I wanted to help!! So much of life packed into this story, and I was wishing for more at the end!A must read for everyone; read it to your children! I will be watching for this author's works!!"},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"When I read this book I was taken on a journey that moved me to the depths of my being. This book took me through many emotions, happiness, fear, hope, and anger; the strongest was hope. There were places when I cried, and others when I laughed. I really LOVED this book. Anyone who picks it up and reads it will find that they can't put it down until the final page is turned. I am highly recommending this book to everyone I know. Pick it up and you will find the hope that you thought was lost."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"Just from the title of my review you start to understand the power of this story. As someone who has lost a loved one to suicide, I can only say EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK. We've all experienced down times in our lives and most of us have experienced loss. That's where this story begins--with terrible loss. But as Skip moves through the deepest stages of grief and begins his plan for suicide, I saw a reflection of my own life's challenges and felt myself changing as the story moved on. By the time Skip stood on the rail of a bridge above a steep ravine, I was literally begging him, screaming for him to stop.Read this book. Before you turn the last page you will have traveled a lifetime...and tears of happiness will streak your cheeks."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"The Santa Shop is a nice little story that leaves you feeling good after finishing it.In this first person narrative, we get acquainted with Skip, a man who after the tragic loss of his wife and baby son ends up living on the streets of Albany. Filled with remorse and guilt about the death of his family, he decides that he can't go on living anymore. While working out how to take his own life, he meets another homeless man, who tells him of a special bridge that people use to say farewell to their earthly existence.On hearing this Skip decides that jumping off the bridge is a good way to go and he sets out to find this bridge, in the hope of reaching it before Christmas Eve.As we follow Skip on his journey, we get a realistic idea of what he is going through. His desire to die is well told and easy to sympathise with. The people he meets along the way are nicely described. Most of them he meets only once, but they are believable and real. Some of the characters that jump out are Father Johnston, a priest who lets Skip sleep in the chapel for a night, Barwood Stone, the homeless guy who tells him about the bridge and Jenny, owner of a corner store.The Santa Shop is not a very long story - probably not more than 10.000 words. But it doesn't need to be longer. It is a well written story that has a good structure and keeps you wanting to read on. Ultimately you feel empathy for the main character Skip and although you don't want him to die, are willing to follow him on his journey to a better and happier life.The conspiracy that engulfs Skip is not a transparent one. It is a good conspiracy anyway, which leaves you to think that the world really can be a better place if more conspiracies like this happened more often.I recommend The Santa Shop to anyone who is in need of a feel good story. Especially one that can be read curled up on the couch on a cold winter afternoon."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"I've just finished reading \\"The Santa Shop\\" & yes, it was a great read! I must admit that I was initially skeptical - suicide is such a delicate issue; but hope & optimism are skillfully woven to overcome despair. It's the kind of book that sucks you in, right from the very beginning, & just never lets you go - with the writing, and the substance of the story, getting better & better as the reader accompanies Skip on his arduous journey.Skip's odyssey begins from the depths of emotional grief & physical depravity. His wife & child are dead & he believes that he is to blame. Having no other family left, he takes to the streets & lives among the homeless, guilt-ridden & despondent, & eventually comes to the conclusion that suicide is the only thing of which he is worthy.As Skip begins to plan his own death, we become aware of a quiet \\"conspiracy\\", a conspiracy of good faith - of hope.

Along the way his plot gets hijacked by the \\"Santa Conspiracy\\".Well written and edited, Mr. Greaton has a wonderful talent for making his characters real, the dialog believable, and the locations familiar.

A beautiful story."},{"Title":"The Santa Shop","review":"I want to believe whole heartedly that Gray, Vermont and The Santa Shop exist. Real or not, they will forever be alive in my mind. The power of this book rests in the author's ability to walk us through the depths of despair, making us feel Skip's desperation and allowing us to truly understand why he believes suicide is the only way to atone for the death of his wife and son. This book is filled with loneliness, sadness and the utter loss of faith. And then something amazing happens. After we have emotionally joined Skip in his desperate search for an end to his pain, the author moves not just the character but also the reader to a better place. Yes, I know with all my heart that Skip's pain is real. And that what makes this journey so amazing. Our belief grants it impact and power. While the title might sound like a feel good story, The Santa Shop is more about hopelessness and recovery. I know I recovered.

The story that is told is very emotional and interesting, but given where the book starts and ends, it feels like it's missing so much. I wanted to know so much more about the Santa Shop, about what happened after the book ended, etc. It seems that (from what I can see) even the sequel to this book doesn't continue this particular story. I wanted more."},{"Title":"Sweet Dreams, Sweet Princes","review":"Mack Reynolds was a man who liked to drink beer and talk politics, and so do many of his characters. Between karate fights, they may be found in a favorite bar, dialing drinks with credit cards and debating about the state of the economy, who really holds power in government, and whether the ends justify the means. It must be acknowledged that their conversation is slangy, filled with remarks like \\"Holy Jumping Zen!\\" and \\"Wizard!\\" and \\"It's your top, you spin it.\\" It must also be acknowledged that their dialogue often sounds more like political speeches than normal conversation. In fact, Reynolds's characters talk in the style (though not exactly the substance) of a John W. Campbell editorial: folksy, colloquial, and assertive.Yet these dialogues, for all their literary faults, are the heart of a Mack Reynolds story. Other elements of the story-- the action sequences, the sex scenes, even the changing allegiances of the characters-- are important but not really essential. To Reynolds, politics, economics, and history matter greatly. In story after story, he invites us to be partisan about the social sciences. The political dialogue is critical in getting the reader to think about these things._Sweet Dreams, Sweet Princes_ was serialized in _Analog_ in 1964. It is the third of a trilogy of novels called the Frigid Fracas novels. The Cold War has cooled to the Frigid Fracas. War is outlawed, but conflicts between countries are carried out in gladitorial contests. Most of the proletariat are slobs vegetating in front of their television sets and watching the games and circuses.The Frigid Fracas novels [the other two are _Mercenary from Tomorrow_(1968) and _The Earth War_(1963)] all feature a mercenary named Joe Mauser. But in _Sweet Dreams, Sweet Princes_, Mauser is not the central character. The main characters are now a younger generation of soldiers and spies who are all plotting various types of revolution and who sometimes find themselves making strange alliances with nominal enemies.Reynolds uses political dialogue to explore the various aspects of his society, and to answer the question: Of the various approaches to revolution, which one is likely to be most effective? There is a lot of action in this novel, and a lot of twists and turns and double-crosses. On the balance, this is an entertaining and thoughtful novel."},{"Title":"Sweet Dreams, Sweet Princes","review":"I read this a long time ago along with the companion edition, Joe Mauser.

Place Names in the Big Bend Country.","review":"But this book is mediocre compared to her two greats! \\"I'll Gather my Geese\\" and \\"My Gose is Cooked\\". It is interesting if you want to know a little more history of the Big Bend region."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"Ted Conover is good at immersing himself in the subject on which he is writing, whether it be the world of illegal immigration in Coyotes, or that of prison guards in Newjack. In this work he immerses himself in the world of hobos. It's one of his earlier works, and it's obvious that his style had not yet matured as it did in later works such as Newjack. He takes the reader along as he goes from being a college student, to being a hobo. Along the way he both shares the stories of other hobos he encounters as well as some of the inernal struggles he experiences. This book is a worthwhile and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"I've read all of Ted Conover's books now, but I read this one, his first book, last. Perhaps I think this because it's most recent in my memory, but I think it's the best of all of them, and I think they're all worth reading. This is an experience which I hope to never experience first hand, but should I ever need to ride in a boxcar, I certainly picked up plenty of tips about boarding them, the etiquette of sharing a boxcar, and how to stay warm. The risks the writer took were extreme, and I commend his parents for not dying from worry. After reading this, I also look at homeless people a little differently, not more sympathetically, but with more awareness that they view \\"normal\\" people like me as another tribe altogether, and that given the chance many would not have any qualms about stealing from me or worse."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"Less a &#34;romance of freighthopping&#34; and more just vignettes of homelessness in various places. Ted's writing was a good match for his subject matter. Ted mentioned that one of the reasons for the demise of hoboing was the prosperity of the '90s. That situation is being reversed...Go to Northbank Fred's website for some of the adventure."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"Living on the streets. Jobless. Homeless. Living in pure poverty, with no money. This is what most people think when asked about hoboes, but is this all there is to hoboes? Just homeless people with an ambition that is nothing but to survive, get a job, and earn their living. Through Ted Conover's novel, Rolling Nowhere, readers get a whole new perspective about the life of a hobo. Conover's novel completely defies the average person's thinking, by showing how even the unlikeliest people, who are thought to be extinct, can have the craziest of adventures. The author, Ted Conover, himself, delves deeper into the mysterious life of hoboes and breaks through all the superstitions or beliefs one may have about hoboes, through experience.Pete Seeger once said that, \\"Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't.\\" True to this quote, Conover first-hand experiences the crazy action-packed world of hoboes first-hand, by traveling and living like a hobo for a span of about several months. From going to jail to jumping trains, Conover did it all. Leaving his old life as a \`civilized' man from the middle class, he goes out into the world of a hobo, beginning his first chapter with his first experience at jumping a train. Conover carefully captures each and every moment, every beat of adrenaline, and every movement onto paper. Through reading this book, it's as if the reader is watching over or even beside Conover as he tries wild stunt. Each chapter is a separate, little mini-story that leaves the reader hanging and wanting more.This book is refreshing experience that differs from the norm, mainly due to the fact that Conover experienced every step, making it possible for him to relate and describe his experiences better. Even though this is a great read for adults and children alike, I don't recommend that children under the age of fourteen to read it, due some vulgar scenes and non- age appropriate \\"swear\\" words. Other than that, I'd recommend this book to almost everyone and especially to those who would like to expand their horizons to those in the world that aren't mentioned in current news or other common websites, to a whole new group of people that live lives that differ from that of theirs.Throughout the book, Conover using the powers of imagery to successfully capture a scene and play it back to the audience, multiple times, as a result, this is one the few books where the author manage to make a connection to the readers. According to the Los Angeles Time, Conover's novel is \\"His vivid, sensitive account of this dreary, often humorous and always compelling odyssey explains life beyond the pale of comfort. Rolling Nowhere is a book that stays with you.\\" From simply reading this book, readers can gain \\"insider information\\" and a whole new perspective about hoboes that they never knew about before."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"Written when Conover was in his early 20's, the prose is at times raw and unpolished, but the stories of life on the rails are interesting and serve as important reminders of how the U.S. does not adequately take care of those most in need."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"I'm happy that there are still people like Conover who are attracted by good old fashion American wanderlust, a la Kerouac, Whitman, London, Woody Guthrie and others. Unfortunately, this is not as good a book as it could be. It's mostly a series of vignettes of life in the hobo \\"jungles\\", with the eccentric, often disfunctional beings who inhabit them between train rides. Conover brings to the book no small amount of naivete and bleeding heart idealism combined with a stereotypically jaundiced view of American society. He sounds like a little rich kid whose guilt leads him to make occasional forays into the underlife. To his credit, he kinda admits this. Plus,hopping freights is a tough life and Conover could have quit at any time and just gone home to warm showers and good meals -- but he hung in there. The vignettes of life in the jungle are interesting, but not fascinating. I don't know that they hold the book together. I think Conover could have spent more time telling us about the train rides and less about fairly dull fellow tramps in the jungles. In other words, more romance, less sociology. I'm trying not to be too critical here -- the book was interesting and informative and if you possess a strong wanderlust, you will enjoy it. I just think it could have been a lot better."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"This is one of the best works of non-fiction I've read. It reads like fiction in a Mark Twain sort of adventure, with the author putting himself carelessly in harms way. Many memoirs I've read left me wondering if parts of them were contrived to make them more interesting. I never felt that way while reading this book. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to live the life of a tramp, riding the rails, and living in a hobo jungle--you won't want to pass this up."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"first off, i love trains, the sound of rumbling trains in the night, anything to do with trains. ive always loved the idea of hopping freight trains. there aren't very many books on the subject. ive read hopping freight trains in america which is a great manual if you are planing on taking a ride. this book gave an inside view on what its like to live the tramp life. after reading this it made me want to ride the rails even more. great book."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"first he doesnt really identify himself as a hobo. i never had the feeling he did, even if he began to fit in. he always had to have a seperation which i thought sort of ruined the book. otherwise the book is pretty nice. a bit more details about riding and less about the people wouldve been nicer for me but i guess the average joe wouldnt enjoy that as much."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"An ok read but should have been titled \\"Suburban kid wants to dip his toe in reality\\". When you read, you see how awkward it is to have somebody from suburbia that has obviously never been beat down, shot a gun, seen a hooker, etc trying to fit into this life. It reminds me of the liberals in California throwing parties for the Black panthers thinking that they are doing some good, while all along the Panthers are blowing the money on dope and Cadillacs OR how white youth are imitating the miserable life of inner city black youth. I think people are drawn to that which they fear so that they can try to conquer it. Anyways, I give the author credit for trying to be a modern day Jack Kerouac. The book was a little light on delivery though."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"As a young man, in his early 20s, Ted Conover traveled on foot and by rail over most of the Western states, first with hoboes and then with undocumented farm workers from Mexico. In his travels, he discovered two itinerant worlds, sometimes overlapping, that are often misunderstood, and invisible to most Americans. In many ways nave and sometimes too trusting, Conover also discovered the limits of his middle class upbringing. His first two books, \\"Rolling Nowhere\\" and \\"Coyotes\\" were based on his experiences. Together they represent a kind of coming of age in America.With little knowledge of real hobo life, Conover left college in the East, jumped a train in St. Louis and headed west. In the months that followed, he crossed and recrossed 14 states, meeting and traveling with a dozen or more modern-day hoboes. He learned from them how to survive, living off of handouts, sleeping rough, avoiding the railroad police. And he learned about loneliness and loss of identity.There are moments of pure pleasure, a tin cup of steaming coffee on a cold high plains morning, the unbroken landscape gliding by open boxcar doors. And there are times when the romance of adventure disappears completely -- in bad weather and bad company. I greatly enjoyed this book and was often touched by Conover's youthful pursuit of independence and experience, often taking risks and crashing head-on into realities he does not anticipate. At the end, the romance of the rails has been pretty much stripped away; he's not sorry, but he's had enough.His book \\"Coyotes\\" is a great companion to this one, as it shows him a little older and somewhat wiser, on yet another risk-taking adventure that throws him into yet another marginal world."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"The hobo has been declared extinct many times, just asAmerica is always declared robbed of her innocence.However, it IS true, I can vouch as a freight-train ridermyself, that economic and legal changes have greatlyreduced the number of tramps in recent years. What Teddid as a very young man was to explore a shadowy anddangerous world that is full of unforgettable memoriesand vast scenic rewards and to come out the other endwith a great book. He captures the longing, the pain,the exhilaration of exploring the country in a way shunned by itsincreasingly organized and comfortable citizens. He capturesthe agony and durability of the (almost entirely) men whowind up in this underworld and manage to stay alive andsometimes even defiant. This is a great book. Along with&quot;Good Company&quot; by Doug Harper (1980), it is one of the veryfew testaments to freight-train riders to come from recent times."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"You've got to give Conover credit, the kid has guts. Discontent with his college studies, which seem a bit unreal and removed from real life, he decides to do some hands on research and give the life of a hobo a try. Predictably, things are not what he expects. The life of a hobo (more accurately known as a tramp) is far from romantic and most often full of hardship and danger. However, Conover also discovers a world of fascinating folks who, when push comes to shove, are not so different from the rest of us.There is Lonny, the eternal optimist whose head is full of dreams that never materialize, Pistol Pete with his injured hand and jealous sidekick BB who propose a 3-muskateers deal and then run off with most of his gear, Forrest and Bill with whom he discovers the depths of being a tramp, and Monty who is pursued by personal ghosts.Equally important to Conover's education is his personal transformation from a well-dressed, polite city kid to a rail smart tramp who won't let anyone take advantage of him. His hair grows, his clothes become dirty, layered and ragged, he learns to smoke and drink cheap booze, to scavange in dumpsters for leftover food and how to apply for food stamps. Even more revealing to him is how he is treated as his physical appearance changes. Suddenly people look away, a policeman finds a reason to arrest him for walking on a public sidewalk and he is treated with mistrust and even disgust when he goes into stores.Conover emerges from his adventures with a bad case of head lice but nothing worse physically. However, it is clear that his inner psyche has undergone a transformation. He has questioned the assumptions of his middle class upbringing and dared to immerse himself in the lives of one of our country's most misunderstood groups. In writing frankly about his experiences, he forces the reader to see hoboes for who and what they really are - people like the rest of us doing the best they can to get by in this world. Such a revelation is always a bit of a shock, but in this case it was also heartening. The people in Conover's book are full of life and memorable quirks. They are real characters in every sense of the word, who force you to respond to their lives. The book is not an appeal to save the downtrodden, a psychological dissertation on the causes of poverty or a condemnation of a society that produces hoboes. It is simply one man's quest to understand another way of life and himself in doing so. You'll come away challenged, touched and questioning some of your own assumptions about how life should be lived."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"This book is part of the \\"Vintage Departures\\" series, a group of travel books from unusual angles. Some examples are a book about gamblers and the gambling world, \\"back country\\" travel in the most remote parts of the world, inexperienced mountain climbers, and near poetry. This book tries to take a different look at our own country, as as seen through the eyes of a constant traveler, the railroad tramp.While it does indeed describe some of America, the author quickly loses focus on the aspect of seeing American through the eyes of the hobo to looking at hobo society itself. For the most part, he does this latter quite well, except where he finally intrudes and makes a bald statement of his opinion, and what he deems to be the reader's opinion, in the last page.Conover is refreshingly naive, in some ways, and not afraid to place his naivet&eacute; in what could be considered a work of autobiography. While I doubt someone could use this book as a manual for catching a ride on a rail, it does allow for enough detail to catch some understanding of the complexity and difficulties accompanied thereto. As a travel book, it's interesting and worth the time."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"While growing up, author Ted Conover was fascinated by the hobo lifestyle which represented freedom, independence and adventure. So, in 1980, he took time off from studies at Amherst to play hobo and ride the rails through the western states, ostensibly gathering material for a senior anthropology thesis. Hopping a freight in St. Louis, he went by stages to Denver, Salt Lake City, Pocatello (Idaho), Havre (Montana), Fargo (North Dakota), Spokane, Seattle, Portland, Eugene (Oregon), Oroville (California), Elko (Nevada), Oakland, Bakersfield (California), Los Angeles, Yuma, El Paso, and back to Denver. Along the way, he meets and loosely befriends those that wander from one place to the next in search of food stamps, discarded edibles and a safe place to sleep - an autonomy and liberty gained at the sacrifice of loved ones, comfort, security, and the income from a steady 9 to 5. The most interesting was 50-year old Sheba, the rare female tramp, who'd built herself a multi-room shelter out of old tires.Conover is a talented writer who deftly captures the \\"romance\\" of the rails in ROLLING NOWHERE.About the scenery from a boxcar: \\"A twisting chasm of waterfalls, spillways, gray rock, and isolated scrub trees hanging on to the canyon walls for dear life, the Feather River Canyon was inaccessible by car, but ... spectacular by freight train.\\"About the grunge: \\"Forrest ... scratched his scalp vigorously and pulled out a small something. He flicked it away with distaste toward the other side of the tree where I slept.\\"About the food: \\"I ... shared ravenously in the fare: a bottle of cold white port, a small, dirty Baggie of lettuce, and two brown bananas.\\" But hey, the chow isn't all bad. Evidence gathered by Ted suggests that dumpster diving in back of KFCs after closing hour yields a feast of mashed potatoes and fried chicken. And I love fried chicken. (\\"Say, Hon, what are we doing for our wedding anniversary dinner?\\" Am I a romantic devil, or what?)The author's youthful idealism is evident at the book's conclusion when he preaches for fairer treatment of hoboes by the society through which they wander. They are, after all, victims of the system. This is several pages after he describes his welcome of a fellow traveler trying to climb aboard his moving boxcar uninvited: \\"He was about to leap in when I set my boot down on his fingers, hard. With a yelp, he disappeared.\\" A nice touch, don't you think?While reading ROLLING NOWHERE, I was struck by the author's almost complete lack of humor in describing a journey that should have afforded more opportunities for such. This is a serious piece written in a deadpan style. I wish Ted had lightened up some. There were also so many instances of deja vu that I soon realized that I'd read this book before - probably back in the early 80's when first published. I need to write myself a note that twice is more than enough such that I don't pick it up again two decades from now. Instead, maybe I can find a book about vacationing in the garbage dumps of Calcutta."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"Although twenty years isnce it was first published, the book has a timeless aspect that is quite moving; essentially, Rolling Nowhere is an indictment of how the most wealthy, powerful and materialistic nation in the history of human civilization treats those who have fallen through the cracks. As taken in and enthralled as I was by the author's experiences, I was in the end more saddened than anything alse."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"This is the first of Ted Conover's four books available today. I am now reading the fourth. I recommend all of them. Rolling Nowhere is a fascinating look at a fading overlooked culture. Ted's compassion for marginalized populations is evident. I'd love to meet the author and talk about his other adventures that didn't become published books."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"Recently I developed an interest in freight hoppin' and the Hobo lifestyle and I began to look around for books to read. Out of the few I found here on amazon I'm glad I choose Conover's adventure.The meat of the book consist of a young Conover traveling across the west by freight meeting tramps (as they like to refer to themselves as, rather than \\"Hobo\\") He meets a variety of different individuals, and quickly learns tramp etiquette. He also learns how to survive off the system by using \\"Sally's\\" (Salvation Army) and \\"Willy's\\" (GoodWill) along with the missions and the availability of food stamps (Which most of the other tramps use to buy alcohol with)On one occasion he finds himself in an awkward position and is unfairly jailed because of his unruly hobo appearance. He remarks had he been neatly dressed he would of never encountered this problem. This really starts to give him an insight into the disadvantages hobos have with the law.I used to think of the rails as a romantic place to be. The sights from the trains, the freedom, and the adventure, but Conover's journey suggest slightly otherwise. Romantic as they may seem, the rails are a dangerous place to be...other tramps, bulls, kids throwing rocks, etc. After you've been riding them for a while you're hardened and the romanticism slowly dissolves away when you're fighting to survive.He wrote this in the late 80s as well. I imagine to hop a train these days, in 2007, would be close to suicide with the abundance of terrorism laws. It'd be interesting to see how the Hobo population has changed since then though."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"Kudos to Ted Conover for having the guts, shortly after graduating college, to spend time riding the rails in the western United States to learn about the lives of modern-day hobos. He is unclear about precisely how long he spends on this adventure; I think a few months. He finds pretty much what you would expect to find -- lots of drunkards and mentally ill men, plus a few women, who bristle at authority and prefer to spend their time riding from town to town. He quickly learns the ropes of how to get free food and sometimes money in various cities, and he takes great pride in acquiring sufficient expertise that he can identify others who are less skilled than he. Conover also takes pain to make sure we know he is more broadminded than other hobos, making friends with Hispanic laborers as well as white tramps.The weakest part of the book is Conover's occasional political analysis. The strongest is when he quotes Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London, though the quotations from that fascinating book remind us just how much better a writer Orwell was than Conover.The book is a quick read, but I don't think many people will get much from it beyond that fact that Conover happened to take this trip and that the hobos were pretty much as expected."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"There's a certain kind of journalism/travel writing/ethnography that greatly appeals to me, in which the author immerses themselves in a culture or subculture that I find fascinating but have no desire to visit myself. This book is exactly in that vein, as Conover took a break in 1980 from attending Amherst College to ride freight trains as a hobo. I found his experience compelling enough to later check to see if he had written anything else, and only then realized that the naive 20-year-old who rode the rails grew up and spent a year as a prison guard as research for his critically acclaimed book Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing.As a product of a nice upper middle-class family and a student at a prestigious liberal arts college, he had to undergo a physical and psychological transformation to embark on his trip. And he began his hobo journey with the vague sense that riding the rails would both tell him something about America and bring meaning to his anthropology classes. One of the common pitfalls of such experience journalism is that the author has a somewhat silly romantic notion as to what awaits him. Fortunately, while Conover was somewhat naive, he did enough background reading to have realistic expectations about what he'd encounter.It's fascinating to watch him dive into the hobo way of life, picking up the tips and tricks that sustain the mostly male subculture. He runs the gamut, from literally jumping on and off moving trains, to spending nights in missions, dumpster-diving food, working welfare systems for food stamps, giving blood for money, calculating the cheapest way to get drunk, setting up camp in hobo \\"jungles,\\" working in the fields as a day laborer, and much much more. Along the way, his simple and clear writing conveys how he shed his notions of what to expect along the way.While he's generally sympathetic to the hardships endured by many of the people he meets, he's also honest enough to let their stories speak for themselves. And while some are certainly driven to the nomadic life by their economic circumstances, the hobo life seems to attract a certain type of man who has trouble living within the norms of society and feels the need for freedom from these norms. This psychological aspect of the hobo life is one area where Conover left me wishing for a little deeper insight into the people he meets. He does, however, spend a good amount of time grappling with other aspects of their psychology, especially the instinctual distrust they have of anyone, even those they get to know well.At the time of his trip, many people were surprised to know that freight-riding hobos still existed and had assumed the practice was long dead. Some 25+ years after his trip, that assumption seems likely to be more on target, if for no other reason than the post-9/11 tightening of all forms transportation security."},{"Title":"Electricity and Magnetism (Usborne Understanding Science)","review":"This book is written at an elementary level and explains the basics of various aspects of electricity and magnetism. It has about 30 pages that filled with text and full color illustrations and has a few experiments in it for you to do at home such as making a compass, making a simple conductor and making a simple battery. Topics covered include Static Electricity, Magnetic Compasses, Electric Circuits, Elctromagnetism, Electric Motors, Generating Electricity etc. This book is full of simple and basic information since it is intended for elementary use."},{"Title":"Electricity and Magnetism (Usborne Understanding Science)","review":"This brief book is useless except, perhaps, at a kindergarten level."},{"Title":"Core ColdFusion 5 (With CD-ROM)","review":"This book is great. It has all of the code for the things that I want to do. So many books like this you get a bunch of code that you can't do anything with. This has so many things you can use right out of the box.What I like most probably is the writing style. This almost reads like a regular book, not a technical manual. Probably 10 times when I was reading I read a paragraph and thought &quot;well what about this?&quot;--and then it was answered in the next paragraph!with all the code and how clear Hewwitt talks this book is more than worth the money"},{"Title":"Core ColdFusion 5 (With CD-ROM)","review":"First off, this book doesn't cover every aspect of Cold Fusion. It doesn't pretend to. I agree wholeheartedly with the author's choice of what to cover. You won't find much information about little-used ldap connections in here or what I've come to see as frankly cheesy aspects of coldfusion like CFUPDATE. Maybe it would be nice if they could be covered, but it makes other books are so big that they make nice references but not the best learning tools.This book is the best way to learn Cold Fusion I've seen. It walks beginners through so they really understand each step of the way. And once you're done, you know enough about how CF really works that you can do the things it doesn't cover on your own.The other thing is that it focuses on showing you the kinds of apps you need to build in the real world, and tying those in. It doesn't try to win you over by being cutesy and cracking jokes. If you're not a beginner, the code makes it worth a read.I espcially like the discussion of lists, arrays and structures. Far clearer than in Mr Forta's book which I also have read. Also good is the custom tags chapter.And I have to say this because it gets on my nerves when I see it. This book has probably the fewest typos of any new computer book I've seen. Though it does have a few, they're obvious."},{"Title":"Core ColdFusion 5 (With CD-ROM)","review":"If you are using this book as a reference for Cold Fusion tags and examples, this may NOT be the book for you.Some basic tags are missing from the appendix, while more importantly there are significant mislabeling that make understanding the book difficult. An example is with &lt;CFFILE ACTION=&quot;UPLOAD&quot;&gt;. The attributes are all mislabeled making understanding the examples difficult. Unfortunately this isn't an isolated case.The examples presented are mainly in the context of an online store. It is up to you to interpret how do use them for your own uses. I think more generalized examples would be helpful.In summary, the book is fairly informative but confusing enough to leave you frustrated."},{"Title":"Core ColdFusion 5 (With CD-ROM)","review":"I thought this book was excellent for many reasons. First off, it is full of real world code examples that you can really use. Many books just give you little code snippets to illustrate a function or method, but this book provides good small applications that really show you how things work. In addition, the writing style of the book is refreshingly candid, casual, as well as knowledgeable.

However, I bought the book primarily for the shopping cart code included on the CD. After several days I was able to get this cart working but I did find a few problems in the design.Being a newcomer to Coldfusion, I contacted the author. He was at first helpful, but his last answer to me was &quot;the store was primarily meant to illustrate certain points and integrate everything that had been learned up to that point in the book.

I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of the book in Australia, but when I first saw it, I was disappointed by the bland cover and photocopy- paper quality of the book. Nevertheless, I bought the book in anticipation of a gripping and realistic story as only Clancy could write. I was however, disappointed by the obvious lack of discipline of Rainbow Six members after each operation, in particular the talking to rescued hostages and one of the members smoking a pipe in full view of the TV cameras. It was fairly predictable that the Russian ex-spy Popov would catch on later. Definitely not up to Clancy's usual accuracy on military operations, but it was a page-turner nonetheless."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read all of Clancy's books but I am surprised he is still getting paid by the word. There is WAY too much padding in here about the &quot;tree huggers&quot; motivations, the camaraderie of combat and the need to give those terrorists a good butt kicking. And the pharmacist comment. During the description of the treatment of the human guinea pigs he erred greatly in discussing the dosing of narcotics in two areas. One is the statement that once tolerance to a dosing level is achieved, the dose can be greatly increased with no problems. Wrong!! The patient will still suffer respiratory depression and other adverse effects. And the second point was when he got morphine and Dilaudid mixed up. Dilaudid is the brand name for the narcotic Hydromorphone. And the IV dose of 12mg is not really that high. Maybe Mr. Clancy could use a consultant pharmacist on his next book. I could easily make myself available. The ending tied up much too quickly. The assumption is that the 4 really bad people left disappeared without a trace in the mean old ecological miracle called the jungle. And has Clancy ever heard of Murphy's law? His technological gimmicks never, ever have any problems. Missiles land within cenitmeters of their intended target, bullets dissolve heads and only foreign hostages get killed. And yet when the Irish terrorists depend on technology (to wit-their cell phones) they get blowed up real good. I guess only good guys get good technology."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Too predictable and plodding for Clancy. As usual, excellent character development and attention to all the details needed to thread the story together. But the story just is not plausable. Operational securtity could never be maintained for such a preposterous plot. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The episodes of an elite counter-terrorist unit in action make for decent escapist reading. Beyond that, Clancy makes use of an uninspired, all-too-familiar biowarfare system taken directly from his last book. John Clark becomes judge, jury, and executioner at the ending which is at once rushed and trite. There are pages of tangential dialog that can be skipped without being missed, but unfortunately each reader has to discover this individually. In Mr. Clancy's defense (and I am a fan from the first) what does one do for an encore, especially when Jack Ryan is now the President of the United States? To see John Clark become an unprincipled vigilante is disappointing."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"After his lackluster &quot;Executive Orders,&quot; Clancy returns to form with this New World Order thriller. He exposes the extreme fringe of the radical environmentalist movement (aka Earth First) and the danger they pose to normal, sensible Americans. If you read a bad review of this book, it will likely be from one of the crowd who wants to return to the days of horse drawn carriages and meals of lettuce and carrots. Love the way he jabs at the contradictions so inherent in the left liberal enviro movement. This one WON'T be on Al Gore's reading list!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I read the preview of Rainbow Six in a PC Gamer, and after getting a taste of it, I had to buy it. I really recommend this book to anyone, yet it flaws too much detail."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has been losing it for his last several books and this continues the trend.

He just gets better at writing and at capturing his reader's attention and interest. With Rainbow Six, I realized that I couldn't put the book down and when I did, I couldn't wait to get back to it to find out what the Six team were doing. That's because Tom Clancy has mastered the art of giving detailed scenes and background information without boring the reader as sometimes was the case in his previous books. I enjoyed very much reading Rainbow Six and getting to know better John Clark and his family. However, I cannot wait to read more about what Jack Ryan is doing as the President!

They are better than the best!They combat terrorism mostly. They are called in when no one else can handle the job. To save the lives of hostages, they &quot;take down&quot; the terrorists. Forget prisoners! When Rainbow Six goes in it is eliminate! The hostages are their only concern. Of course, terrorism is not the only thing Rainbow Six combats, but it is the biggest.***Tom Clancy brings it all to life! Not only are you riveted to your seat by the action and efficiency of the team (which is made up of several nationalities) but by the plot which slowly comes to a boil between it all. I highly recommend this one!***"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Bought Rainbow Six and had high expectations. Expected a fast paced and action packed read, similar to Clancy's earlier novels (Hunt for Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin, et al.) but got just the opposite. The novel drags as a result of Clancy's painstaking descriptions of the inconsequential. The book could be edited at least in half, or maybe two thirds could be edited away and the story line wouldn't much suffer."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What else can I say? It's the nature of the publishing business that Clancy could write his laundry list and people would buy it. Don't buy this. Go look up Bob Mayer and buy some of his Riley series special forces books. Mayer was in special forces and knows what he's talking about. He also doesn't waste your time with fast-paced, to the point stories. Try CUT OUT, based at Fort Bragg and involving a special forces soldier in the Witness Protection Program. Or DRAGON SIM-13 which reminded me a lot of Fail Safe except using a special forces team instead of a bomber. Every time I get on board a Combat Talon for deployment I wonder . . ."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has continued his technical expertise and entered the world of special operations warfare. Technically and tactically he expresses this world well. The only gap I've found is that this type of warfare is much dirtier and much more personal for the warrior. I think if he had delved a little deeper into the personal or emotional side of his subjects, it would have been a bit more to home. I'd recommend it to anyone who prefers this genre."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy doesn't care about his readers any more-- that is obvious from this lackluster effort. Read some of the other thriller writers out there. Coonts latest is good. Also took recommendation and read THE OMEGA MISSILE by Joe Dalton. Great thriller."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy changes course and concentrates on John Clark and Ding Chavez rather than Jack Ryan. This is a good thing as Mr. Ryan has gone as far as he can, and Clancy has taken the character about as far as he can. Clark and Chavez, however, have great potential. While this book is nowhere near Mr. Clancy's best--Without Remorse and Clear and Present Danger lead the Clancy canon by far--Rainbow Six delivers a good story. The set-up is plausible--even if the villains and their agenda are a bit far-fetched--but overall, this is a decent political thriller. Like any writer of this genre, Clancy flirts with crossing the line where he lets his politics get in the way of his story. Fortunately, he just flirts with it, stepping back into the realm of good story telling rather than hammering too hard on his Reaganesque version of America as it should be. (This is what ruined Executive Orders.) I hope we hear more from Mr. Clark and Mr. Chavez. The don't have the agenda of Jack Ryan (or Tom Clancy) so we can simply have good stories well told."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Why did I buy this book? Answer, &quot;Tom Clancy has written many books which I enjoyed no end. They could be re-read more than once and still be enjoyable.&quot; Sadly Tom Clancy has used up all his credit with this one.It doesn't get off the ground at any point. Although it is a &quot;speed read&quot; it never captures the reader like &quot;Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; , &quot;Clear and present danger&quot; or &quot;The sum of all fears&quot; did. It hasn't got the &quot;I must read one more page or else...&quot; feeling that his previous books had. It is as predictable as watching paint dry - and you feel just as cheated afterwards. Read &quot;Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; and remember the good old days, when Clancy still knew how to write."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"When I received this book, my first impression was that it was too big. Upon reading it, I felt as though the editors could have cut the book in half and made it more interesting and less repetitive in its descriptions about the characters and the training. At least we recouped some of its cost with the amount of paper it used."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy's last three books have been very poor. He increasingly injects his stories with his own extreme right-wing political point of view. This becomes very tiring and is not a believable makeup of his characters. The right-wingers are the saviors, anybody else is a cold, bloodthirsty lunatic. How boring. And how often does the reader have to be reminded of what each character's intentions are? Each individual in the book has to repeat how they feel and what they're thinking about three dozen times. In school, this was considered &quot;fattening&quot; for length rather than content. The result in RAINBOW SIX is that the story gets continually bogged down."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy is the master of the techno-thriller but this book lacks the &quot;techno&quot; of his others. The premise of an international anti-terrorist unit is great but the villains were absurd. With the fall of the USSR and frequent use of middle eastern terrorists, I guess militant environmentalists are the only bad guys left. The book's saving grace are its protaganists, Clark and Chavez. The bio-warfare was done to death in his last book and he needs a new threat to the world. It's good mindless summer reading, but if you're expecting a good &quot;Tom Clancy&quot; novel, maybe you should check out his earlier works (Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger). Despite my comments, I'm still the first in line to buy his books!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The excitement of TOM CLANCY'S books is here, but with some problems. John Clark was missing his passion from his earlier characterization in CLANCY'S books. Ding Chavez was more prominent, but lacking full dimension. While the missions of the unit were exciting, the big mission at the Olympics was a fizzle. I found the main plot lacking the power that CLANCY delivers in his earlier novels. The editor of this book should have spent 6 hours on each page finding the embarassing spelling and grammar errors. These errors could have been corrected by any fan of CLANCY'S. I hope he hires a new one. CLANCY is still one of my favorite authors, and I will eagerly await his next book. This book may just represent a mid-life crisis for CLANCY, but I have faith that he will return to his master-storyteller form soon.

He's my favorite Clancy character and I was disappointed he got so little face time in the movie. Maybe he'll get more action in the next one.Despite the length of the book, it contains very little fluff. Even the parts that could have been less developed (like Popov's early morning horse rides), while not always crucial to the plot, had purpose. As always, the technical stuff and battle scenes were top notch, and he spent more time on character development than I remember from his earlier stuff.The thing I was most impressed with was how he jumped from character to character, getting inside their heads and illustrating their respective viewpoints so skillfully. From Clark's intensity, to the machismo of Chavez, to the pragmatism of Popov, to the by-the-book legality of the FBI agents, to the fanatical idealism of the terrorists and Project members, he wore each hat with aplomb. It was fascinating to see the same moral and environmental issues analyzed by opposing thought processes - sort of a self debate. Clancy did such a good job, there were times I thought he could be a Project member himself.I admit the overall plot was a little hard to swallow, but by Hollywood standards it was realistic and down-to-earth. Considering what some people are willing to do for their beliefs, it's not that farfetched. This is definitely a strong candidate for the next Clancy movie. I can't wait to see how the environmentalists react when it comes out . . ."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Of the Clancy books I've read, I thought this one was best. The action is superb, the plot is involving, and there is good character development - especially when one considers the sheer quantity of characters that are followed in this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Having read all of the Jack Ryan novels, as well as No Remorse, I think this book is a marvelous addition to the series. In fact, along with Executive Orders, this book I bought when it came out in hard cover, and feel it was worth the wait and the price of admission. With that said, I should go into why I liked the book so much.When I was in the army, my S-4 1lt., a real go-getter, always had a Tom Clancy book under his arm. At the time, 1990, I had no idea why someone would read a Tom Clancy book while they were living the &quot;real thing,&quot; so to speak. However, after being discharged, I am able to read on of Mr. Clancy's books and suppress the occasional longings I have for the military life I departed. I read and re-read the books often, and I get the same feeling of fun, excitement, and suspense each and every time I do. Not too many books of this nature can make this claim with me.I also admire Mr. Clancy's research and detail. I am no techno-weenie, but being a historian who has researched counter terrorism, I enjoy what he is able to provide to the reader in understandable language. Specifically, highly plausible and factual information within a grand plot.So why four stars instead of five? Well, to be honest, this plot borrows too much upon continuing a theme brought forth in the book, Sum Of All Fears. Namely the means by which the terrorists use to attack the United States. Also, with Clancy, I see a reluctance to allow bad things to happen to major characters within this last book. Yes, the terrorism hits close to home, but that is all, just close. I understand an attachment to characters, but these people are the luckiest people in the world to have all of this danger strike so close yet never hit a major character.In the end, I am hooked, for good reason I might add. To this end, Rainbow Six is a wonderful book, even if you have never read any of the other Jack Ryan Books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the first Clancy book I've read and I really enjoyed it. The action was non-stop and the story was very engaging. I especially liked the way Clancy details the battle scenes. Even though the vividness may seem gruesome it makes the action seem real. One beef though is that Clancy backs off on detailing the battle episodes as the book moves on. It almost seems like Clancy felt the book was getting to long so he cut down on the description. All in all this being my first Clancy book, I will probably eventually read the rest of them. If you like stories about covert government or paramilitary action this book is an excellent read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I originally played the Rainbow Six computer and N64 game, so I thought the novel would be a great read. I wasn't disappointed and Clancy delivered a knock out novel. It starts off like all of the Clancy novels I have read, with a plane hijacking of ex-CIA agent John Clark and his new son-in law and his partner Domingo Chavez. Clark is the leader of a new black counter-terrorism outfit code named RAINBOW. Chavez leads one of the two teams located at the SAS base in Hereford, England. Clancy weaves a great plot involving a huge bio-technology company, a security agency handling the 2000 Olympic Games and an ex- KGB agent. The world gives RAINBOW lots of work and they rise to the task. This is one of the best novels I have ever read, great action, it keeps its readers on their toes and unable to put this awesome novel down."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"In 'Rainbow Six' master spy John Clark is the head of an international anti-terrorist task force with his sidekick and son-in-law Chavez at his side. 'Rainbow' starts with a bang and doesn't let go. From thwarting an attempted hijacking to stopping the kidnapping of a Swiss banker to Battling baddies at a Spanish amusement park, 'Rainbow' is unique in Clancy's novels as it is almost non-stop action. This is both a plus and a minus. While the pace is fast and the story riveting, some of the humor and political intrigue that marked his previous novels are missing. Also, President Jack Ryan wasn't even given a walk-on appearence. Even mention of him was restricted to only 'The President.' Reguardless, 'Rainbow Six' is must reading for all Tom Clancy fans."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Read this book for a very compelling insight into Special Ops training and action. In this way, Rainbow Six is great. I sense thorough research in this regard.Unfortunately, the underlying conspiracy that acts to bind the plot together isn't as convincing. Neither are many of the characters (some of which may represent Clancy's personal political views).I do recommend this book (from a library, of course). The descriptions of tactical combat exercise and execution are awesome as are the action sequences. The action is perfectly to the point and never hurried. Images from various aspects of a situation are described in such a way that the reader gets a sense of that they are occurring simultaneously."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I usually find Tom Clancy novels a little too technical but I truely enjoyed this one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've read all of Clancy's Ryan/Clark books, and this one stacks up pretty well. Definitely better than the boring &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; and the awful aren't-we-just-perfect &quot;Executive Orders&quot;. R6 is fast-paced and interesting, with a manageable dose of the macho posturing that was so overbearing in EO. Some pretty neat plot twists, though not on the scale of Red October or Sum of All Fears. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I first discovered Rainbow Six by playing through the video game, which is quite good. But, even someone who hardly reads would enjoy this book. The way Clancy intertwines the stories of the charecters and the way they come together in the end is amazing: 5 stars P.S My name really is John Clark"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was my first Clancy novel. I loved it! The book had its slow points but the overall book and the plot was excellent! Since then I have read almost all of the Jack Ryan and John Clark books that Clancy has written about. This is a must read for true Clancy fans."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Okay, first of all, this isnt a Jack Ryan book, so dont be discouraged if you cant find your favorite hero in here. I think they mention his name once or twice, but the MAIN character is John Clack (I.E. John T. Kelly from WITHOUT REMORSE). Anyways, I think Clancy did a great job on this one, adding TONS and TONS of action packed carnage into this book. This book is basically about an anti-terrorist organization that has to stop all those bad terrorists around the world and make peace and harmony everywhere they go. I dont want to ruin the book for you, but its really good. The only, and I mean ONLY problem with this book, was that the ending left a little to the imagination, and I kinda wanted a little more action to follow, but otherwise I damn fine book from Mr. Clancy. Lets just hope &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; which comes out in August will be as good.... ;)"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Good book with a non-trivial plot. The only problems I have are multi-page boring journeys into beer drinking details and family matters."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is what you can call a epic. Well it least I think of it that way. You seem to know the chacters better and better and they are like you best buds when you get done with the book. But I should stick more to the plot. The plot is very very good and it does not really become apparent of whats really going to happen to about page 400. The boom!!!! put on your seat belt for one hell of rollercoaster ride of suspense, terror and tears!!! -Daily World"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is one of the best books i have ever read, bar none. But hear me out. First of all, i have a great interest in secret ops and military/government operations. Secondly, I found that the plot was quite well constructed. While long-winded at times (repeating information, etc, hence the 4 instead of the 5), this is definately a great read- provided that you can find the time to get through it all. Overall, though, a great book worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I think Rainbow Six was Clancy's best. I loved the non-stop action. It's a book you just can't put down. Executive Orders has a better plot but Rainbow Six has better action parts and more of them."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"While action streamed readily from the novel, the overall architecture of the story was just a bit too stilted, too crude for my tastes. The narrator(s) seemed to think I, a reader, was unable to remember facts for he kept repeating them (\\"I opened the trunk -- the boot that is,\\" the novel told us in yet another way of describing the disparities between American English and English proper.). I was also lectured to about the \\"psychopathic profile of a terrorist\\" at least five times throughout the course of the story. We see that the narrator is not only condescending (or feeble) but fascist in style as well. He kept a choke hold on the plot even when the maintenance of it meant lapsing into fantasy (government agents behaving personally against the bad guys; both of whom appear to get stupider as the book wears on). And as the plot continued on in Nazi-like fashion, I began to question whether the characters and narrator were of sane mind. Don't misunderstand: about half of the novel read like any good pulp, but afterwards it seemed like the storyteller wanted to make sure that he touched on scenes A, B, C an D regardless of the ensuing incongruities. Informationally, the novel helped describe some pretty nifty concepts: modern weapons and suveillance systems, combat aircraft and tactics used by counter-intelligence organizations. I've heard that one of Clancy's earlier novels came close to describing events that took place early in the eighties. Unfortunately for us, Clancy's \\"Rainbow Six\\" illustrates that he continues to move further from detailed realism and toward a type of story that is both unlikely and mediocre."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Once again, the master has produced a simply awesome book. You can't read it fast enough, it keeps you wanting to know what happens next. A &quot;can't put down&quot; book that is full of suspense, thrill, action, you name it, it's here. This one is a must read - this would make an INCREDIBLE movie as well!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've read most of Clancy's other books, and I think this is if not his best, at least among the top three. His characteristic tehnological detail and likable characters make the length of this book undaunting. Ex-SEAL Clark has a large role in Rainbow Six. He keeps the action coming; this book is very hard to put down."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've never read a book with so much action and suspense. Some people think that reading 900 pages is a waste of time but you can't pass this opportunity. I wish they make a movie out of this and show James Bond who the real action heroes are. It's worth every minute you spend reading Rainbow Six. This is a really really good book if not one of Tom Clancy's best books ever. Read this book before you play the game!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Mr. Clancy's books seem to automatically become best sellers. Among the writers of techno-thrillers Clancy not at his best is still better than most. This book is not one of his best--but is still well worth reading. (The best book of this genre out right now is Stephen Coonts' FORTUNES OF WAR -- great characters, great story.)I did enjoy RAINBOW SIX and I did finish reading it although it's too long. When readers complain about length it's because there is something lacking in the story although they may not be able explain exactly what that &quot;something&quot; is. (I didn't finish EXECUTIVE ORDERS. I quit after about 400 pages and listened to the tape.) RAINBOW SIX becomes a little too predictable, with a little too much moralizing. After 535 pages the question, &quot;When is this thing going to end?&quot; was lurking in the back of my mind.Three other comments: 1. The Russian, Iosef Andreyevich Serov, is the best character in the book but it's a little hard to believe the perfect spy would throw his passport in a garbage can. 2. Environmental extremists are certainly out there but I believe the plot of this book is stretching things a little too far. 3. John Clark may face &quot;. . .the world's greatest fear--and his own...&quot; but other than needing his past reputation to set things up and his code name for the book title he doesn't do much.I guess I can sum up my review by saying I have a list of authors whose books I buy and read and a list who's books I read but check out at the library. I just put Mr. Clancy on the &quot;Library&quot; list."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As an avid fan of Tom Clancy's work I eagerely looked forward to his latest book. I found it lengthy but nonetheless a pleasure to read (in comparison with others) yet I was very dissappointed with Clancy. His patterns are all the more aggravating to because he doesn't seem to be attempting anything original, he just uses the same patterns. How many times do the hero's family's have to be attacked (in order to convince us of how evil the villains are even though such attacks are diversions from their objectives) Ryans' in Patriot AND Executive, then Clarks' in Rainbow? Why do we now only have villains who's &quot;ends justify the means&quot; philosophies explain thier every decision instead of the older villains such as the KGB Colonel from Cardinal who also had loyalties (to a different state)that were simply opposed to the &quot;good guys&quot;? Clancy's researching has also failed. Why does Rainbow operate in countries that already have thier own counter-terrorist units? Contrary to what is stated in Rainbow, Austria DOES have a unit (called Cobra) , Spain has two different teams, and the UK has the almighty SAS which Clancy inexplicably ignores or sidelines. With the exception of Ryan's Secret Service Bodyguard, all the women in his books tend to be either evil (the India PM) or ineffectual (Ryan &amp; Chavez's wifes)? Why is it that whatever his heroes do is inherently right while whatever their adversaries do is inherently wrong? Clancy must learn (I thought he already did) that &quot;evil&quot; villains simply are not interesting. If Clancy wants to keep his devoted fans he will simply have to work harder."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What a poor book this is. Gone are the days of the techno-thriller for a re-hash of previous plots and performers."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As usual Clancy is ahead of the game. He really gives us something to think about and the possibilities of what crazy minds will do."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As usual Clancy is ahead of the game. He really gives us something to think about and the possibilities of what crazy minds will do."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Let's face it. This book is one long cartoon. The good guys? Not a scratch on 'em. The Bad guys? Nuke 'em. The good guys? Fine, upstanding family men. The bad guys? Dysfunctional low-lifes. Clancy's politics? To the right of Rush Limbaugh. Clancy's women? In the kitchen (or the hospital ward) where they belong. The plot was laughable. And I used to be a Clancy fan."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy is my favorite author. Waiting for a new book from Tom Clancy is like Christmas for me. Today, I found lumps of coal in my stocking. All Clancy fans who want or need to buy this book should wait till it comes out in paperback...and at a used book store."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is one of the best Clancy books I have ever read. To the reader from Bayville, NJ, you said never has so little been conveyed in so many pages. You call a terrorist bank robbery, killing a terminally ill kid, taking hostage an Austrian, and taking hostage thirty-three kids little. You are just blind."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is a typical Tom Clancy novel. By that I mean it's great all the way till you get to the NON- climatic end. I have read every Tom Clancy novel there is and all ways enjoy them. But, as he grows in years, the same non-climatic end comes to be. Yoy read 700 pages and he tie's it all up in the final few pages. God, I hate that. You spent 700+ pages telling a fantastic story and end it in 20. Thats a Dam shame.........."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It certainly seems to me that Tom Clancy's political grandstanding seriously detracts from the story. It's getting harder and harder to wade through these massive tomes. Mr. Clancy's political beliefs have always been apparent in his work, but now he seems to feel that his novels are podiums fit for bludgeoning us over the head with. He always has been an excellent storywriter, but the dogma is very much overpowering the story. I find that I as I reread his earlier novels, I enjoy them less because of the civics lessons I was forced to endure in &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; and &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;. I certainly could not reccomend this book to a non-fan, and fans should definetely edit as they read. I just hope Mr. Clancy realizes before his next novel is finished, that Ronald Reagan is no longer in need of a speechwriter."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As a longtime Clancy fan I've picked up this book without hesitation the day it came up. Coming home, I breathlessly settled in for another exciting read...only to be throw back with all gentleness of a car crash. What the hell? Environmentalists who would like to kill all the people on earth. Well, gee, that's right on the par with generals who're just itching to start nuclear war in the believability department. &quot;We project 85% casualties Mr. President, but our way of life will be safe!&quot;. Pfft.But what really killed it for me (besides the paper thin plot and cardboard characters) was the continuous exposition. &quot;And now I,Dr. Gene Evil, will explain to you my motives. In excruciating detail. And repeat it couple of dozen times so you don't forget.&quot; Oh gawd...After the 2nd half of the book, I was reduced to just flipping through the book to find some action scenes, which at least were moderatly involving."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Read the title of this essay and you've completed the whole book without having to go through the 900 pages the book consists of. Basically, this book is a long construction of different terrorist operations being disrupted by a secret anti-terrorism society named &quot;Rainbow&quot;.The plot of the book is very weak, and is barley held together by the somewhat intense and exciting segments when team one or two of Rainbow is storming terrorist operations and blasting everyone's guts everywhere, including some hostages. When I first looked down at this 900 page monster, I thought &quot;How the heck can Clancy turn the subject of an anti-terrorism team into 900 pages?&quot;, it's obvious to me now that he can't.Another thing that is simply horrible about this book is that it's written so poorly. You could tell that Clancy only wrote the book for a computer game and maybe a future movie. The only thing I like about this book is the computer game that was made out if it. Other than that, this book is void of any good literature and a waste of money and time. Do yourself a favor and read something else."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was surprisingly bad. Clancy's flair for telling an exciting story took a vacation on this one. The basic plot isn't very interesting to begin with and then he fills the book with pages of exposition on the environment and government and I felt like I was at a lecture, not reading a novel. The terrorist plots the group foil along the way to the main story are poorly executed. The team never misses a shot or takes a misstep while the bad guys are like Keystone cops. When you get to the main story, your boredom turns to laughter. It was like Simon Bar Sinister on the old Underdog cartoon and his plots to \\"ruuullle the world\\". Clancy has written some classic thrillers. Go re-read one of them."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is a sad, disappointing book. It makes it even more disappointing when the author is capable of writing much better books such as The Hunt for Red October. Rainbow Six is about an elite international counter-terrorist group that tries to stop some nature-freaks from destroying the world's population.Depending on who you are, you will either love or hate this book. I hated it. The characters are cardboard cutouts, the far-fetched scenarios that Clancy thinks up are ridiculous. ... The game that is based on the story is actually much better than the book. Half the story is about how these druids think and only about twenty pages in the entire thousand-page book are about actually executing the missions.Better luck next time, Clancy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have been a Clancy fan from the beginning, but don't expect that I'll spend another dime on one of his works. If you want a disgused diatribe against environmental extemists without the snappy thrill and demonstration of techno-thriller know-how such as Hunt for Red October or, even more so, in Red Storm Rising (my favorite Clancy book), then this is a great book for you. The stupidly outlandish ultimate raison d'etre for the Rainbow team is absurd and insulting to readers. What is Clancy trying to do, simplify complex issues with simple jingoistic positions? I can get that from most of the people I know for free."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'd read one Tom Clancy novel before this one: NetForce. I found NetForce to be quite interesting but I never quite got it. What is Clancy's point? What is he trying to show? Though NetForce held my interest (ever so barely), this one was just plain old trash. Maybe I'd read it again if it was either this or Barney Goes To Town or some other 4 year-oldish book. And the two books aren't far apart. Both have childish and disorganized plots (keep in mind I've never read Barney Goes To Town, I'm just trying to prove a point), both have stupid characters that seem to be able to do more than any normal human (or dinosaur) could. And both authors must have been drunk or unaware that they were making such a horrible book.This is usually the section where I tell the plot, but the plot's so dumb (as well as the characters) that I think this book doesn't even deserve a section for it (the plot). Basically there's a bunch of super human guys who work in some SWAT-like team, shooting everything in sight, whether it be acutal threat to civilians, or a dog on the side of the road (I'm kidding, but seriously they attack people who really don't need to be attacked).Once again, I find my self after reading a Clancy novel, What are you trying to say, Tom? Is there any point to your ridiculous stories? Or do you want to make a complete fool of yourself in front of millions of readers? Please answer A.S.A.P.Don't read this book, that's the bottom line.A. A."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Absolutely the last Clancy novel I read. Mr Clancy is getting lazy in his wealth. His research used to be maticulous in every detail. As an Air Force Special Ops pilot I can say this one is full of slip ups.Another 900 page plodding novel that, typical of his books, takes the first 700 pages to get it's act together. Then he cobbles together the last 100 pages. Too bad, he used to write really good books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The premise of this novel is interesting enough...eco-terrorists want to cause an epidemic to wipe out most of humanity in order to \\"save\\" the environment. Of course there are nutcases out there who would probably like to do just that, and as Clancy's novel postulates, it is not out of the question that some of them could conceivably put a plan into work to attempt something of the sort.This novel's strengths are Clancy's familiarity with military technology (as always) and his fairly good grasp of how Washington's power structure functions. These strengths make this a fairly good read, despite the negatives. The negatives are that this novel is at least twice as long as it needs to be, the storyline rambles, the terrorists are unconvincing, and the characterizations are not particularly good.All in all this is a good cautionary tale by a good writer who needed a stricter editor."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is one of Clancy's best by far. Very descriptive and entertaining as well. The book read fast considering the size. I found myself not being able to put it down. Clancy didnt over do himself with too much dialogue, but i did find myself wanting to read about more missions. Clancy kept the book exciting, Intriguing and to the point, plus explaining important topics about mission essentials was detailed and not over done. If you're not familiar with this type of job, Clancy makes it very understandable. I too would like to see a movie about special operations, like some of the reviewers have mentioned. Tom Clancy is the only person that i would vote for to help with a real-world special ops type of film."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Truly, Rainbow Six was a joy to read. It gives incredible insight into the world of counter terrorism, along with the thrill and excitement of seeing the units, clad in body armor rush into the heat of battle. Rarely do I ever read books of such length, however, I wish it was longer. It was sad to see the words THE END."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I guess they won't have to go very far for action seeing as how the English are among the biggest eco-terrorists around. The nuclear waste being dumped into the Irish Sea..."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read all of Mr. Clancy's work, and this rates as one of his best.Like other readers, I enjoyed Without Remorse. Having a book dedicated to John lays out a good framework for the future, since the next position for Jack Ryan is the Pope.Excellent read, well worth adding to your library!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Leaves you at the end of your seat throughout the book. It will keep you up many nights wanting more. But can get a little tiring in the middle of hte book. Can also get confusing during the end. But still it is well worth it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Thank you Tom for giving the faithful Clancy fans of Clark, Ryan and the rest another great book. It is difficult to wait so long for Clancy's books but as usual the wait is well worth it. Similar to the excitement of seeing and old friend you have missed.I have read all of Clancy's books and they never fail to leave you wanting his next book more than the last.John Clark is the most exciting character in a book since Ludlum's Jason Bourne and Jack Ryan is what we wish we could have in Washington.Clancy has become the American Fredrick Forsyth with all the excitement of Robert Ludlum. Don't make us wait so long for the next one Tom!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I just finished Rainbow Six, the latest book by Tom Clancy. As usual I stayed up way too late reading it. After ten books I knew what to expect and found it. However, I was a bit disappointed in some areas. Clancy has been doing a lot more than just write technothrillers lately. I think that diffusion of effort shows in Rainbow Six. I noted several continuity errors and some things just weren't explained very well. I finally had to go to the Sydney Olympics website to find out when those Olympics are being held. Since they are the Summer Olympics, most readers assume the heat Clancy writes about to be normal. However, Australia's Olympics will be in their late winter, early spring, and that kept nagging at the back of my mind. It seemed to me that Clancy has toned down the technical side of things for this book. Sure, he talks about some neat, \`whiz-bang' gadgets, but without the hard edge of technical realism that defined The Hunt for Red October and Cardina! l of the Kremlin. Also, the book became predictable. When I read Sum of All Fears, it was with growing disbelief and astonishment at the turn the story took. Rainbow Six has no such surprises. I'm sure Clancy fans will enjoy adding Rainbow Six to their shelf, but for me it will only be in Clancy's top ten until he writes another book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"While I enjoyed reading Rainbow Six, I have to admit I was a little disappointed. The plot was excellent, with all the intricacies we know and love. However, the characters seemed more flat than usual and the dialogue was quite common. I find it hard to believe that Clancy spent 6 hours on every page. But even though I don't consider it his best book, I still couldn't put it down - I finished in 3 days."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is all too representative of what Clancy has done since his first book, The Hunt For Red October. Rainbow Six is overwritten and underedited. It will become a best-seller on the strength of Clancy's name, but since Red October, which was a very fine tale, he's done only good book. That was Clear and Present Danger."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm not quite done with Rainbow Six. As always, Clancy's novels are page turners. I can't wait to get home to get back to it. However, after the first 40 pages, Clark has called himself an REMF 5 times. Not being a Viet Nam Vet, this was really annoying and forced me to go on line to search for the term. And what is tempesting? This is mentioned twice already without any explanation. So far into the book, it would have been better if there had been explanation of these esoteric terms."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy is a fine writer and I enjoy his style and characters. He crafts entertaining stories and keeps the reader on edge waiting for how the heroes will save the day. However, I must temper this praise by saying Clancy is far from the best writer of the 20th Century. For you Clancy buffs out there I strongly suggest you read Alistair MacLean's &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;, &quot;Force Ten From Navarone&quot;, or &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot;. MacLean writes with a style and flair which is thoroughly engrossing, technically exciting, and light years ahead of Clancy in artistic ability and the shear art of storytelling. Clancy is Salieri to MacLean's Mozart."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The action is fast paced but one- dimesional. The characters just are not as developed this time. Not really disappointed but it could have been better."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"... and, if you like repetitive, episodic action, you should buy the computer game ... or watch six episodes of a bad TV show. The only reason to buy the book is to prove to your peers that you can read. Tom Clancy has, regrettably, taken the final, fatal plunge into complete commercialization of his waning talent. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"So far, I have read and enjoyed all of TCs other novels. However, 'R6' ranks rock-bottom. After finishing the book, I began to question whether this book was even written by THE Tom Clancy I've come to know and admire. Over the years I have read other books on counter-terrorism, and the plot for 'R6' lacks plausibility relating to the subject. The plot and the characters seem to be out of a comic book. There were also technical inaccuracies to types of counter-terrorist weapons and tactics described in this book. The idea of having a powerful villian with the ambition to wipe out most of the world's population in order to create an eccological utopia is just too much like a generic 'James Bond' movie. Like my other TC books, I bought this book in its original hardcover edition. However, I am quite disappointed in this book. Cmon TC, I know you can do better!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors. I had the misfortune of selecting Clancy's new book for review. I can't tell you what a let down it was. The characters are weak, redundant, and have too much irrelevant background information. The plot is boring, twisted, and has unresolved issues at the end. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Try anything by Steiger, Connelly or DeMille instead."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I found this book distasteful. We serve because we believed in our country and its laws-- the men I worked with were professionals and would not take the law in their own hand. Clancy is a former insurance salesman who makes a buck off of these men. You want good special ops books-- try Andy McNabb's SAS books or Bob Mayer's Special Forces books-- they were there and know the reality."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Ahh, too predictable, too many &quot;coincidences&quot;, not enough realism. What are the chances that the worlds best counterterrorism team is going to be on the same 1 in a billion airplane that gets highjacked? The &quot;professionals&quot; make stupid, ametuer mistakes constantly! Not up to pre-clancy greatness. The plot was VERY anticlimactic. The end was very drawn out, instead of the action packed, last chapter punch, with a one page post-logue like most of clancy's other works. I love clany's other books, and Red Storm Rising is my all time favorite book, ever. Go buy Red Storm Rising!!! p.s.- The PC Game &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, and its sequal game, &quot;Rouge Spear&quot;, are the best games ever made, these i HIGHLY recommend. You will not regret it!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read most of Clancy's books, and, as time goes on, they offer more and more of Clancy's political and philosophical views and less and less story and excitement. Rainbow Six is also a thinly disguised attack on the environmental movement, dismissing such organizations as the Sierra Club as fanatical, with a strong implication that environmentalists are exceptionally naive at best and extremely stupid at worst. They are all emotional &quot;tree and bunny huggers,&quot; rather than thoughtful and intelligent people. Clancy continues to be enamored with organizations like the CIA and the FBI, who alone have the welfare of the country in mind. I think this is the last Clancy book I will read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you're gonna write a 900 page thriller, you need to keep people intersted. And that's something this book does not do.&quot;Rainbow Six&quot; severely lacks the tension found in such works as &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot;. (Incidentally, &quot;October&quot; was only about half as long as this book.)The story involves an anti-terrorist military unit who fly around the world taking out terrorists whenever they start taking hostages. This anti-terrorist unit is supposed to be in the top of their game. Unfortunately, they are so good at what they do that nothing interesting happens. For example, all is quiet in the book for about 100 pages, then a terrorist unit attacks a bank in Switzerland; the Rainbow team blows the door kills the terrorists in a matter of seconds and then the reader waits another 100 pages for something else to happen.This wave of attack and execution, attack and execution, get's really tedious really fast. You're halfway through the book and still nothing interesting happens. Most people will make it to page 300 and then never pick this book up again. Tom Clancy needs to be reminded that a thriller is supposed to thrill."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"From a die hard Clancy fan that has read all of his books, I found this book somewhat disjointed. I was dissapointed that no real mention of Jack Ryan was made. I would have prefered to have known about the power structure of the world. For most of the book, you don't even know who is the president of the U.S. The setup of the book seemed to be rushed. It is the first Clancy book that I found easy to put down.This book is a spin off from a previous Clancy series without an updated from that series. In all I found it wanting."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Like most of those who have slammed this book in their reviews, I was once a big Tom Clancy fan, however, his latest work is mortally wounded by Clancy's overly preachy undertones, uninspired action sequences and a complete lack of development for both the good guys and the bad guys.His political views are pretty apparent, I would bet $200 he votes Republican. Though one might call some of the fringe environmental issues debatable, I don't think even the most right wing types out there view everyone who cares about the environment as a completely insane wacko. Those who like to go into the woods and make bang bang with big guns like Clancy have to admit that at least a passing concern for the environment is a must.I sometimes couldn't tell if I was reading a fiction novel or a ballistics report from an ammunition manufacturer. Also, as much as some of his more testosterone supplied readers might like to read descriptions of 10mm hollow point bullets entering bad guy's skulls, it takes away from the usually accurate and realistic tone of his other works. Reading about people's faces being turned into &quot;pink puffs of vapor&quot; might be enthralling for weekend Navy SEALS, but anyone with any combat experience dreads the thought of being put in any situation where such is necessary to do to someone else. I don't mind a novel or even a movie using such descriptions to enhance some sort of realism (i.e. Saving Private Ryan), but anyone who enjoys such thoughts as much as Clancy apparently does (with the sheer volume of text devoted to exploding craniums), scares me.Even the world's best counter terrorism units have amazingly high failure rates in close quarters combat... which is why most scene commanders heavily resist their usage, even under the most optimal circumstances. Rainbow seems to not have these problems at all. Other complete lapses of tactical accuracy are shockingly bad compared to the usually sharp knowledge Clancy displays in other books.As shallow as the anti extreme environmentalist plot was, it is only aided by half baked development of antagonists and protagonists which leave the reader only really caring about one or two people at the most. &quot;Ding&quot; has got to be one of the worst nicknames in the history of writing. Back in the cold war days, Clancy could deliver &quot;black and white&quot; participants who's general thinking conformed to the two main real life organizations who trained and paid them (the CIA and the KGB), however with the demise of the Cold War, much more diversification is required, and I don't think Clancy can deliver.All in all, where the classic Clancy novels got one thinking about the dreary outlook that the global political stances adopted by DC and the Kremlin, or the middle east's effect on world politics, Rainbow Six serves only as an &quot;Popcorn Novel.&quot; Entertaining for those who don't know much about the technical aspects of which Clancy writes, but not the sort of work that ignites the mind any longer."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Though the plot outline is intriguing, Clancy has developed an annoying habit and going into extraneous detail. This gets him, or his proofreader, lost. Character names are changing within a few pages (Tim, then Tom, then Tim); new characters suddenly appear and interact as if they have been introduced before; mystery characters are revealed accidentally in conversations (confirming one's suspicions) and then are dumped back into the shadows for later revelations. Sorry, I've enjoyed Clancy's earlier works but I've lost my taste for details of minutiae (e.g. what they ate for breakfast), repitition of character's motivitations and lack of details on key events in character's lives (Ding's wife's delivery is quickly passed over though we hear about the team's morning routine ad nauseum)."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I enjoyed this book on a surface level - it's fast paced and the action keeps moving and is quite exciting - but it falls foul to the usual Tom Clancy blunders - maybe even more than usual as all of the book is set in a non-American country.Clancy uses all the sterotypical versions of &quot;foreigners&quot; - all the English call each other &quot;old chap&quot;, the Austrailians use the word &quot;rather&quot; which is completely untrue and I get the feeling that if some Austrians were in the novel they would be wearing leiderhosen and singing &quot;The sound of music&quot;. Other facts about the English setting are completely inaccurate - if a book is to be set in a real life place then care should be taken to accuratly describe the setting.Then of course there is the usual Clancy right wing political and military musings which become rather nauseous after a while. The characters are pretty one dimensional and don't seem to have any depth to them.It's a good book to simply read and enjoy - but sickening on a deeper political level and extremely annoying and insulting to the non-American. Hence 3 stars only"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six being my first book read by Tom Clancy, I did not know what to expect at first. The 700+ pages did not seem very appealing to me at first. But to my surprise, it was an excellent ride. As a lover of books that are fast paced, I was handsomely rewarded with this novel. Rainbow Six talks about a counter-terrorist group called \\"Rainbow\\" going around the world trying to stop the terrorist incidents that were happening. The \\"Rainbow\\" team ends up going against these nature loving \\"tree-huggers\\" extremists that want to destroy humanity to preserve the Earth. Although the extremists described in the book seem far-fetched, is would be crazy if something would happen like that. I would recommend Rainbow Six who likes action packed scenes and likes espionage type of books. Lastly, I had one minor complain. There was a little too much dialogue in the novel. Other than that, Rainbow Six is a great book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Over the course of the past year and a half, I&#65533;ve been slowly working my way through the Tom Clancy novels. Now that I have finished Rainbow Six , I only have two left. If you have read other Clancy novels, you know what kind of book this is. The pacing is somewhat faster than other Clancy novels, but nowhere near as fast as Without Remorse. Now that Jack Ryan is President of the United States, Rainbow Six switches the focus back onto CIA operative John Clark. Clark has made appearances in most of the Jack Ryan series, as well as being the focus of Without Remorse.With the permission and blessing of multiple nations, John Clark is the head of a multi-national anti-terrorism group named Rainbow (Clark, being an intelligence man, has the code name of Six). Rainbow is split into two teams, one of them headed by Clark&#65533;s partner and former CIA office, Domingo (Ding) Chavez. These teams are trained and authorized to respond to terrorist actions across Europe (or anywhere else in the world). As Rainbow is formed is begins to come together, there are more high profile terrorist actions. Rainbow responds, perfectly. At the same time, there is a plotline focusing on a team of scientists developing a virus to kill most of the population of the planet (yes, we&#65533;ve all seen that movie before, but Clancy makes it semi-believable). Tom Clancy weaves together several plotlines into a gripping narrative and makes for very interesting reading.I&#65533;m reluctant to put this book near the top of the list in terms of Clancy&#65533;s best work, but this is a very solid novel and Clancy seldom writes [poorly]. This is far from [poor] and is quite good. Definitely worth a read, if you are a fan of Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"In the year 2010, terrorism has become an out-of-control force, used to give leverage to radicals. John Clark is the head of an advanced field tactics unit, used to put an end to terrorism, dubbed Rainbow. The book follows the team throughout the world, as they end hostage situations and resolve conflicts. I found Rainbow Six demonstrated Tom Clancy's writing style in flying colors. The book is a realistic insight to actual military operations. Although not all aspects are real, there is a seamless boundary between the author's imagination and the true to date actions of a military unit. The climax of the book extends throughout, although it is most evident in Rainbow's actions to knock down a terrorist leader in Germany."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"i am 13, and though i may seem young to be reading these types of books, they are among my favorites. \\"Rainbow Six\\" is a book not for the weak of heart. it is full of graphhic violence, \\"He raised his MP-50 and fired the lethal automatic, and was satisfied to see a cloud of red mist appear where the mans' head had once been.\\" it is also full of some pretty perversive language (...). it is great on how well Tom Clancy discribes his environments and weapony. it gives the reader a sense of feeling that he or she is actually fighting along side the other combatants. i enjoyed this book a lot, and i think that if you are a fan of Clancy;s other reads, then you will enjoy this as well. my advice is: buy it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was very interesting to read. It was the very first book that i have read that kept my interest from beginning to end. In this great novel you will have the ability to see pride, honor, bravery, and many other extraordinary traits in the many characters through out the story. If you like reading great action packed, edge of your seat fiction that will have you constantly anxious to discover what is yet to come in every part of the story, then you will love this novel.I highly recomend this book to readers with a reading level above the elementary level. The story may be extremely long and parts may get boring for some people depending on your attention to detail in this book. I still recommend this book higher than any other I have read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is an extremely well crafted story of international terrorism and the elite warriors who exist to stop it. Tom Clancy's understanding of international politics, military, and governmental agencies is amazing. Rainbow Six left me wondering how any fiction author could possess such a profound level of knowledge. Clancy accurately portrays his subject matter down to the most minute detail. RS does not read like the script to a brainless action movie. Clancy intelligently presents all aspects of spec ops, including the bureacratic/political side, intelligence gathering, logistical considerations, tactics, and strategy. Anyone with serious interest in military matters will greatly appreciate the authenticity and attention to detail.I've seen a few recurring complaints regarding this book in the other reviews. I would have to agree that Clancy is not the most talented character writer. Certain important characters, such as John Clark and Dmitry Popov are well developed and interesting. The minor characters in the Rainbow squad are also well written for their supporting role in the story. Clancy truly captured the mentality and work ethic of Spec Ops troopers well. At the same time, a lot of the minor characters just seem to blend into each other. Different people seem to possess the same mannerisms. This is forgiveable to a point, but Clancy probably takes it too far. But the truth of the matter is that Clancy's power as a writer is fueled more by his scenarios than his characters. When two Rainbow members are killed in an ambush, it seems distant and uncompelling. Clnacy does not take the time to portray the team's mourning the loss and honoring their fallen comrades. In fact I don't believe he even specifies which two troopers were killed. Despite this flawed moment, the Rainbow story is still an extremely well crafted Spec Ops story. I disagree with those who say the idea of fanatic environmentalists posing such a serious terrorist threat is implausible or ridiculous. Reality is sometimes stranger than fiction. Clancy's environmentalists don't seem any less likely to me than Hitler's Third Reich, Islamic fundamentalism, or Heaven's Gate. When you unite a group of people in some form of fanatic ideology, the results can be frightening. The fanatics in Rainbow Six had a radical goal (as do all fanatics) and with a major American corporation backing them up, they had the means to attempt to carry it out. This doesn't seem implausible to me."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you are in to suspenseful novels with surprising twists, this novel is for you! From start to finish, possibly one of Tom Clancy's best. It gives details and keeps you in tune the whole time, never leaving the reader in the dark and simultaneously biulding a plot to keep any reader interested foir the duration. Very well done!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"In Rainbow Six the reader once again meets Clancy&#65533;s &#65533;other&#65533; main character, John Clark. In Rainbow Six Clark is much older than he was in &#65533;Without Remorse&#65533;, and he now heads a secret, international, anti-terrorism coalition called Rainbow Six. The purpose of Rainbow Six is to fight terrorism, wherever it may occur, with soldiers of many nations. The men and women of the Rainbow Six task force are from all over the world, and each one brings a specialty to the team.Throughout the course of the book the reader follows the team as they respond to a strange, increased presence, of terrorism across the globe. And as to what is really going on, it is only a matter of time until our heroes find out and come to save the world in the nick of time.The plot of this book, while entertaining, is laughable at times and seems like something straight out of a James Bond movie. And, as a previous reviewer stated below, may be a little offensive to the people of GreenPeace and other environmental protection groups. But given the fact that it is very entertaining, and done well, I consider it worth checking out if you&#65533;re a Clancy fan."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was one of the best books I have ever read. It had action, suspense, drama, and a lot more. I loved the novel and would recommend it to anyone. I would personally love to see it become more than just a novel and game.

He writes novels that combine entertaining action and suspense with a lot of realism. They can be long, but are very much worth it. The characters are all very human and their personalities are flushed out in great detail. The plot is great as always: a team of radical environmentalists decide that the human race is destroying the planet, and must be removed. Therefore, they have created a virus called Shiva that they will spread all over the world (with an anti-virus exclusively for them) starting with the summer games. Meanwhile, John Clark, the ex-Navy SEAL introduced in Clancy's previous novels has started a new top-secret international counterterrorism commando unit code-named Rainbow (for the rainbow of different nations involved) headed by him, a coupla British guys from the SAS, and his son-in-law and ex-Army Ranger Domingo Chavez. There is also an ex-KGB officer who unknowingly works for the environmentalists, and is handed tasks of terrorism designed to keep peacekeeping forces busy. Rainbow deals with these threats, each one growing in severity, effectively, but suspense is kept up not only during the missions but afterwards as they try to discover the reason for these attacks for themselves and stop these biological terrorists before its too late. A highly entertaining read for anyone who is willing to read it (after all, it is a lot to read). I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Without Remorse left us with John Kelly turning into CIA legend John Clark. Unfortunatly for Rainbow six, that doesnt leave much for charator development. Besides the good guys it doesnt leave much for bad guys. Although they are anything but typical, think of them as hippies gone wild. Rainbow Six isnt a total let down though. On the contrary, it's anything but that. It's starts off hard and fast, and ends the same way. But you can't help but catch your eyelids falling as you read inbetween the action parts. It's fun to read, but none the less, can't match up to Without Remorse."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy rainbow six was one of the greatest and most memorable books I have ever read. Hi my name is Master C and for the following I will explain to you why I enjoyed this book. First off there is the main characters consisting of John Clark, Domingo Chavez, Ding, and Alistair Stanley. Firstly I liked this book because they are always either off doing some mission or they are getting ready for a mission or even reflecting on how good they did on their last mission, and personally that's what kind of stuff I would enjoy doing any time of the week. Even when they are not on a mission they are always involved in a action and dangerous situation. They are always getting ready for missions by practicing and practicing, practice makes perfect that's what I always say. I also like it because they always are traveling places like Switzerland and Germany, and Russia and by the sounds of it they are not there for a holiday it is serious mission involved trips. I also liked it because when they are doing their missions they don't just storm in there and try and kill as many people as they can without dying. They have lot of pre mission practice and when they get there they wait in till they now the coast is clear and then they throw bombs (non-explosive off cause) to either blind them or make them delusional so they can not react to the special forces flooding in and securing the area. Finally I liked this book because it was not just all fighting and killing it was also like real life situations that either us or some one we now has been in, so I kind of connected with the book in that way."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was the first Tom Clancy novel I read and it got me hooked. I had looked at some of the back covers on his other books and thought that they looked kind of boring but this one looked interesting. I have now read all of his books and this is still my favorite. Personally, I get kind of sick of reading about Jack Ryan all the time and I'm glad that Clancy branched off into another topic. I will admit that the ending is an anti-climax but the rest of the book has as much action as any book that I have read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Although not marketed as such, Rainbow Six is really science fiction. Like a few other very popular authors, Clancy is too big to be marketed with a genre label, especially one like science fiction, which evokes images of four-eyed geeks, Dungeons and Dragons, and adolescent computer nerds (at least among the marketing departments of book publishers). Hell, Clancy is a genre, much like Stephen King or Dean Koontz. But calling a dog a cat doesn't make it a cat, and Clancy's book is science fiction whether or not his publisher wants to admit it and market it as such. It's science fiction because central to the plot is the development of a genetically engineered super-plague intended to wipe out the human population of Earth. The scariest thing is that we almost have the technology right now to attempt what the villains do in this book. In a few years... well, let's hope this book isn't thinly veiled prophecy.John Clark, an ex-CIA agent, now heads the international anti-terrorist group code named Rainbow Six. Based out of England, Rainbow has a true international reach and is called upon throughout the book to respond to situations in a variety of countries. Made up of dedicated, highly trained experts, they prove more than a match for the terrorists they find themselves pitted against. Popov is an ex-KGB agent hired by the high-powered American executive Brightling to coordinate seemingly random terrorist attacks. Brightling is the head of an international biotech research company, a billionaire, an environmental extremist, and the architect of a plan that could result in the near-extermination of the human race. There are plenty of other bit players here as well: members of the Rainbow team, associates of Brightling, the various terrorists, and more.Clancy writes long. Loooonnnngggggg.... Trimming the book by a third or more would have made it a much more energetic read. There are several lengthy scenes that could have been cut entirely, and the application of an editor's scalpel would have gone a long way towards trimming the fat and making this a more enjoyable meal. Do we really need to know what everyone eats from breakfast? Do we need daily training regimes broken down in such excruciating detail? Do we need three page historical accounts of weapons, or organizations, or personal histories? Clancy has a reputation for including all the technical details and leaving nothing out, so perhaps complaining here is out of line. By now, we should all know what we're getting into when we pick up a Clancy book. Still, it makes some sections of his book read like a training manual or a textbook. Some like this style. Others, myself included, would like to get on with the story and the action.The action (when it does come) is well done and authentic. His characters are adequate to the story, rather one-dimensional in purpose and motivation, but realized well enough so that they aren't a hindrance. I didn't care about them as much as I would have liked, but I cared about them enough. Clancy obviously knows what he's talking about when it comes to the military, the CIA, and various other aspects of 'spook' work, although he does make a few mistakes. One such is referring to the nickname of MH-6/AH-6 helicopter as &quot;Nightstalker&quot; when it's really &quot;Little Bird&quot;. I don't think these slips will cause concern though, since 99 percent of his audience won't notice.Despite the action and a thorough knowledge of his subject, some of what happens in the book strained my credibility. How did Brightling, a man of such extreme beliefs and conviction, rise to the position he holds and become so close to so many in power? And his ex-wife, who is a close presidential advisor, also holds those same beliefs. Wouldn't have someone along the way picked up on the fact that these two were wacky? Dangerous wacky? I mean, you can cover it up, but only so much when your beliefs are so strong. On the surface, their plan of developing a super plague seems like a good one. But how could so many people be in on it and nothing get leaked? How can these big, expensive facilities (intended for Brightling's hand-picked survivors) get constructed and no one wonder why? Clancy touches on security efforts, but never goes into any real detail. With that many people knowing, something would get out, and the same holds true for Rainbow, the 'secret' anti-terrorist team.Lest I sound too negative, let me say that overall I enjoyed the book. Some sections were real page turners--too bad there were too many pages between them. If you like hard-core, (mostly) realistic military/political thrillers by a man who knows his stuff (and doesn't mind writing at length about it) then this is a book for you. If you're looking for something leaner, driven by better developed characters and with a faster pace, you might want to look elsewhere.Read more reviews, as well as articles, interviews and more, at www.SFReader.com."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is Clancy at his best. There are costs to everything. On the far right, there is the side-effects and pitfalls of a military war on drugs (Clear and Present Danger). On the far left, there is radical environmentalists (who consider humans a parasite on planet Earth who should be destroyed).What Clancy really writes about is the costs involved in any kind of political change, and the dangers of extremists. Clancy always takes very real political situations one step further. Is it right for radical Muslims to promote nuclear war (The Sum or All Fears). Is it right for radical enviormentalists to commit genocide (Rainbow Six). Plus, what would happen if an honest, non-political man found himself in the position of George Washington - faced with rebuilding the government from the ground up - but with a press who was so used to lies and political posturing they didn't know how to deal with an honest man who was doing his best (Executive Orders).What I would believe is somebody who admits there are no easy answers. The far left would undermine national security; the far right would eliminate privacy rights. Clancy solutions are often poetic justice (the wacko enviromentalists being forced to live in the jungle without ANY technology from a knife to clothing - all that was part of technology, not nature, plus a drug lord, which the US decided they had no legal right to keep, being delivered to his opposition in Columbia)."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbox Six is a damn good novel. Sure Clancy messed up on some things; (like when he called latin women latino. No, they are called Latina's, men are called Latino), and definitely when Clancy refer's to the English as &quot;chap's&quot; no, they call each other &quot;mates&quot;. The book starts out great: a high-jacking of a plane. The book stars John Clark: Ex-Navy SEAL and former CIA agent. He leaves the CIA to head to England and start a secret anti-terrorist organization called RAINBOW. Along side is his partner in crime Domingo Chavez (who from previous novels have done some things most men like myself dream about), so now as they get down the terrorist, they then set up shop, and they are headed to their first mission; a bank robbery gone bad in Switzerland. RAINBOW is made up of the best of the best; they come from Germany, France, England, and the U.S. So then the team gets there, they kill the terrorist and they go home and train some more.Now in America, a team of scientist are working on a virus which they want to wipe out human existence for good so that mother earth can repair herself from human destruction. Now comes in former KGB agent Popov. He see's what RAINBOW can do, and is very interesting on how they plan and move with stealth precision and able to get the job done. Eventually they are called to more jobs; terrorist take over a theme park killing a disabled child, and terrorist invade the house of a important diplomact in Romania. Eventually the tree-huggers kill enough people to see if the virus works; it does. So now, in order for it to do it dirty work, they send it to Australia which they have the maintenance guys installing a cooling system there so that the virus can spread and they can pass it. So now, they find out who did this, and while before this is happening, terrorist take out a London hospital where Sandy (John's wife) and Patsey Chavez (Ding's wife) are doctors there, and Patsey is pregnant with Ding's child. So now, Ding use's his street mentality on one of the terrorist and he cracks. So now, as Popov finds out what the scientist are doing since he knows one of the men in charge, he then escapes and tells the U.S. government what is going on, and it goes back to RAINBOW. They then find out where they went: the Amazon jungle. So now RAINBOW heads there, and takes them out.the novel is good, but some people might not like it because it has a lot of action, and some people might find the ending boring, but so what? It is good, so to all the haters out there, dont hate on Clancy, only hate him for writing Red Rabbit and The Teeth Of The Tiger."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is a great book; Tom Clancy is an awesome author"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"At its heart is ex-Navy Seal John Clark.

A band of men and women so extreme it could truly mean the end of life on earth.This book is action packed. It is full of munitions experts, sharpshooters, and all-around daredevils. Clancy carefully researched this book to make it truly realistic. This is Clancy at his best. His description of special-forces operations is as real as anyone will ever see."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is an entertaining read. I will admit that the numerous negative reviews led me to approach this book with less than enthusiasm. While this book is not as good as many of Clancy's other books, my favorites being Cardinal and Without Remorse it is an exciting read. I have no problem with Clancy placing his political beliefs into the story as all authors tend to do this. Whether or not you agree with Clancy, you can enjoy this tale. While the &quot;tree huggers&quot; were exaggerated the reader has to realize that they were the villians of this book and after all the book is fiction. Clancy did repeat himself too often with certain phrases but this did not overly affect the story for me. After this book Tom Clancy will remain on my automatic read list."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Three stars for some exciting action scenes, but that's it. I was entertained, however, the plot was too James Bondish, not something I'd expect from Tom Clancy.There is a real problem when the most interesting character is one designed solely to link the plot together. Scenes with former KGB colonel D. A. Popov had more depth than those with one of the main characters, Ding Chavez.The villians were about as cartoonish as they could get.Clancy threw some really low blows against environmentalists. I guess if you're concerned about air and water, you're just one step away from being an enviro-extremist. This attitude deeply offends me, since I served six years in the Navy (and was impressed with Clancy's early works) and knew fellow officers who did care about the environment, including a Navy SEAL.The author's photograph on the back cover really worries me. To much like a wanna-be."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's technical understanding and ability to translate the excitement of technology, if you will, provides interesting reading.

A save-the-earth organizationof manic mentality is manipulating the world terrorsism scene to divert attention from its plan to use biological means to cleanse the earth of all but a chosen few. A former Russion spy is on the payroll of the save-the-earth organization until he discovers its ultimate aim, then jumps ship to inform Rainbow Six of the pending biological catostrophe. The outcome, as I mentioned earlier, is no surprise."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm not a big fan of flaming anyone--this book is entertaining to an extent-- I wish the good guys could have been more human, which would have added more suspense. I took one of the other reviewers advice and read a couple of Bob Mayer's books-- very good and realistic. The good guys make mistakes, the bad guys aren't stupid and the action seems real given the author is a former special forces officer. I'm hoping Clancy gets back into Hunt form soon."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy seemed to be filling pages as if he has a contract for somany words.

Tom Clancy has written an excellent book, with a believable plot; mostly because I know a few tree-huggers myself. Even the way it happens seems like it did happen. The topic matter is original; the characters are good (albeit old); and the plot is fast-paced. The idea of an entire corporation trying to kill us off seemed a little far-fetched a year ago. That was before the Microsoft suits. If they wanted to kill us, they could. I admit I didn't understand how the Brightlings got back together; but it wasn't that important. Why can't more books be like this?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six by Tom Clancy is a excellent book full of action and genius. With a little touch of comic relief to liven it up.

The plot centers around an anti-terrorist group based in England, comprised of primarily Americans and British commando types, with a few continental Europeans thrown in for good measure. This group quells one terrorist incident after another, setting the stage for a final encounter. Everything here is by and large predictable, a few surprises do await the reader. Tom Clancy wrote this novel circa 1999, obviously dated as you will see if you do decide to read it, being pre 911 is just a part of this. I found it long and dull, being punctuated by brief periods of action. A plodding writing style indeed. 899 pages...give me a break, if an author cannot get his ideas across in 400-500 pages he/she needs to get a better editor. Also, if you truly believe in the environmental movement and are cognisant of how we are harming the earth with our industrial way of life you will be disappointed with this novel as Clancy generally disparages environmentalists as extreme. I suspect Clancy may be a far right-wing neoconservative, just a guess on my part. But more to the point, this book is far too long and contains lots of filler, not recommended."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Mundane book with two dimensional characters marred by a major plot flaw.When it's summertime here, it's winter in Australia.

Never mind that it's right wing extremists such as Bin Ladin and Saddam Hussein that have given the world so much trouble since the collapse of communism.If the preaching isn't bad enough, consider the barrage of two dimensional characters. The heros have no personality whatsoever. They are basically automatons going around killing the equally shallow bad guys. Clancy might know that even soldiers have feelings and individuality, had he not been a draft dodger himself.Clancy is an author I would compare to Arthur C. Clarke, in that both are fully competant with the technical side of what they write, but seem to be incapable of expressing any real emotion in their work. With Clancy the world is just a black and white place where communists still hide under the beds of all God-fearing people and governments do no wrong."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've read quite a few of Tom Clancy's books and liked most of them.

We follow them on several of their missions where they demonstrate their talent at putting three bullets into the head of each terrorist in the wink of an eye. You see Rainbow is based on military principles, not police concepts or laws against murder, so there are no silly rules about \\"hands up, drop your weapon!\\" Just get close enough to shoot and then shoot to kill.All well and good, and I'm sure that if I was ever taken hostage by terrorists that I'd welcome the arrival of a group of highly-skilled cold-blooded killers who would take care of my problem.The thing that bothers me is that Tom Clancy wants us to believe that these same guys who make their living killing other human beings are loving, caring husbands and fathers, and they experience no conflict between their occupation and their family life. This is apparently very important to Clancy because he goes on and on about what wonderful family fathers all of these guys are. They're all married and all have children and all of them have the wife and kids stationed on the outskirts of the army camp where Rainbow is based.Clancy describes, for example, how the members of Rainbow feel no regret when they come home from a hard day of slaughter. When wifey, watching the TV coverage, asks, \\"did you actually kill any of them?\\" they brush it off with, \\"you don't really want to know, and anyway, I'm on the side of the angels, remember?\\"I don't think this is very realistic, to put it mildly. Most of what I've read about Special Forces personnel, and especially the ones who have actually been in combat and killed in the line of duty, is that they make lousy husbands and fathers. Which is OK - a civilized society needs some uncivilized nasties to keep the other nasties at bay. I just don't see why Clancy feels the need to claim that you shouldn't mind having your daughter marry one of these killers.Clancy also wants us to believe that these guys are intellectuals. For example, Ding, the leader of one of the two Rainbow teams, has a Masters degree, and his wife is a medical doctor! And what sort of daily problems does Ding have which needs great intelligence and a Masters degree? Well, he does spend some time thinking over whether he should do more target practicing with his automatic rifle or his handgun. The art of killing terrorists is obviously something that not just any old idiot can do right!Another aspect of the book's lack of realism has to do with the fact that being a terrorist killer is not without its risks. At one point two of the Rainbow team members get killed, and we're presumably supposed to believe that their wives and children take the loss of their loving, caring, intellectual husbands and fathers in stride. They died serving a greater cause so their loss is to be accepted. Uh-huh? And why were these loving, caring, intelligent men so dumb that they got into a line of work where there was a high chance of them turning their loving, caring, intellectual wives into widows and leaving their children fatherless?I realize that I've focused on just one particular aspect of this book, but it's an aspect that Clancy apparently considered very important, and which I found very unrealistic and thus very irritating.To make things worse, Clancy managed to irritate me in another way in this book. The bad guys in the book are a bunch of environmentalists who have gone off the deep end in their desire to get back to Nature. That's OK, but what I didn't like is that Clancy obviously has no use for environmentalists in general. The good guys consistently refer to all environmentalists as \\"tree-huggers\\" and imply that anybody who worries about the ozone layer or the future of our planet is stupid. A very dangerous and shortsighted attitude.No more Tom Clancy for me for a while.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"this book was a very boring book. i injoyed the acion parts but most of the book was talking about nothing!over all i really disliked this book. there is to much about americans."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Talk about action, this one is great.

It portrays a situation where a company executive who is a big time environmentalist decides to solve the problem of people depleating the Earth by creating a disease that would basically wipeout the human race. However, a vaccine is made for him and his counterparts so they can survive and study nature as they belive it should be. On the other half of the story a world anti-terrorism group is formed and run out of England. As the story progresses there is various terrorist incidents that are put down by the anti-terrorism group. In the end the plot is discovered by the anti-terrorism group and put down. The characters in this book are easy to &quot;get to know.&quot; The plot is very well made out and makes for a very interesting story.

This created what is known as the Canadian Armed Forces. The base at Gander is known as CFB (Canadian Forces Base) Gander.I stopped reading when the character Popov was travelling on a US passport because his employer arranged for him to become a resident alien. Sorry Tom but only US citizens may travel on a US passport.What happened to the level of accuracy of Red Storm Rising?

I found the multilple story lines to be very well constructed and ideally placed to keep the reader going just a little further to see what happens next.

Not bad at all."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Just too many words. Could have told the same story with half the pages. Clancy seems enamored of the equipment of CT teams, but it's the men who are much more important and I feel he did them some disregard in this book by making them one-dimensional thugs essentially.

The technical data, as expected, is superior to most other war novels. The plot is rather original compared to most of the books I read, but there was just something missing. Tom Clancy tried to be to modern, and changed his writing style, for the worse, to appease his audiance. This was not worth the effort, as many people would have read and enjoyed the book any way. I would recommend this book, but I did think that it could have been better. -Justin Barr"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This long, long book lacks characteriztion, believable plot, and a purpose. I knew about the same before I read the book as after. Too much discussion about cleaning and caring for one's guns. All the characters were shallow and lacked all emotion.

It seems that in each novel he writes Clancy increases the level of villany of the bad guys. In his latest creation, Clancy has his very, very bad guys outdoing Hitler in genocidal madness. What evil is he going to invent for an encore?And then there are the good guys. They are oh so perfect -- and so one dimensional. John Clark is superb at what he does, but he is a total bore. Beyond his ability to smash terrorists, there is nothing else to this character. Ding Chavez is a Latino version of Clark -- all macho, but with one additional characteristic. He likes fatherhood. Clancy loves these military folks, but it is interesting that they are so devoted to family values. No fooling around in Clancy's world, no sex at all actually, even between man and wife. Every member of the RS team is married, has kids (but no sex), and is a devoted father. Maybe Clancy should have titled this one, &quot;Father Knows Everything.&quot;Really, the most interesting character was the former KGB agent, Popov, who combined the good with the bad. He is a bit more complex, and for this reason, I would be surprised to see him reincarnated in Clancy's next novel. But it would be a good idea. Along with other readers, I would recommend waiting for the paperback. RS is an OK book but not worth the hardcover price."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Mr. Clancy has been well known for his books. The hunt for Red October, Cardinal, The Sum of all Fears, etc. Those were very good books, but it seems that Mr Clancy has the same nemesis that James Bond, the end of the Cold War. Mr. Clancy has no idea of the international arena and its players, nor does he know about other cultures and people. He level of knowledge is about the same of a country bumpkin. First of all, even if I'm not a basque, on his opening chapters, there were 3 terrorists on a plane, and one of them was called Miguel. I'm sorry but when I checked Miguel does not exists in Basque, the proper name is Mikel. Basque, in case Mr. Clancy does not know (he doesn't) is considered Europe's first language, and the Basques are considered the first Europeans. They take great pride on their language, culture and heritage, and a peace loving people, except for an extreme few. Another unreality by Mr. Clancy was that Basques only target Spanish government figures and police/Army, they don't attack international flights, it is not their Modus Operandi. Changing subjects, the idea of a Civil War in Spain is more far fetched that having one in the US. Furthermore, theUS is a more likely place to be suffering a Civil War, since it got a lot more Socio-Economical differences than Spain (which has Cultural differences). I do not mean to say that there will be a civil war in the US, but if it sounds ridiculous it is doubtly so when you think of a civil war in Spain. It is true that there are cultural and ethnic differences in Spain (were 4 languages are spoken and people have ethnic roots that go from the Mediterranean Sea to Scandinavia) but nobody would go to a civil war for them, not anymore. Other than that, I completely agree with Mr. Clancy view on terrorists, which I think are the scum of the Earth and should all be behind bars. One recommendation Mr. Clancy, read on your History and Geography, and then read some more. Travel overseas and learn about other cultures, DO NOT ESTEROTYPE, and do not pretend to write on international events if you do not know what you are talking about, and by the way I hold a B.S. in International Economics and a Master in International Affairs, both from US universities."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was a terrible book. Right-thinking fascists blow the daylights out of horrible, menacing tree huggers. The characters were so unreal it was hard to finish the book. It would have been much better to portray the trained killers (the supposed heroes)as tortured ambivalent souls rather than caring family men. Caring family men do not become covert operatives, stroking their guns for a living. Also Clancey allows his own disdane for environmentalists to show through and often allows his characters to preach to the reader."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As a long-time Clancy fan, I was deeply disappointed with this latest effort. The plot was lame, the ideology was shallow (and endlessly repeated) and the characters nanometer thin. Looks to me like Clancy has gotten so big for his britches that he has demanded publication of his first draft without meddling by a copy editor -- and that was a big mistake."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was absolute, long-winded drivel. Time for clancy-San to come up with some new characters. I usually enjoy Clancy's work because of the attention to detail that he gives the readers, but that attention to detail, not to mention character developement, is glaringly lacking in this novel.I have been waiting for Clancy's work to improve since he wrote &quot;The sum of all fears&quot; but I have been consistently let down. I didn't even bother to buy this one, I got it from the library. Good thing, I would have been really angry if I had spent 30 dollars for it.The thing I hated most about this book is that Clancy creates an aura of greatness around the &quot;Rainbow&quot; (stupid name) organization, whenin reality they weren't doing anything that a good polce S.W.A.T. Team couldn't do with a tenth of the assets.Absolute garbage."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Having read all of the previous Jack Ryan/John Clark novels I was looking forward to this, but was in many ways disappointed. The story doesn't really come together and move at the usual Clancy pace till around page 550, which makes the first two thirds of the book very heavy going. Also, we learn nothing new about John Clark, yet one of the subtler pleasures of the previous novels was the gradual unfolding of his character. The plot is, in part, a rehash of Executive Orders and is weaker than Clancy's usual standard. Finally, while I always realized the man is right wing, it's now begining to get in the way of his writing - feral greenies indeed! And check out the jacket photo - the man's begining to think he's John Clark (or is that Jack Ryan?!)."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has a great opener for the set up to the story. Many will remember the mid 70's and through the 80's as hostage ridden. This story will take you into the world of the terrorist like no other. Clancy delivers a high impact ride through the world of those who would terrorize and those whom the terrorist themselves fear. As a military officer some would say that I am biased to this type of reading as it is a story line that is of great military interest, however, Clancy does his homework and has your attention from start to finish with a storyline that reaches global proportions and has you guessing. The reader is not just treated to the story of what is going to happen, but all the behind the scenes detail that rounds out the story, bringing it to a greater level of reality.A great read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I just got through reading Blind Mans Bluff and Lady President and decided to pick up Rainbow Six. Very impressive work Mr. Clancy. I especially like the way you stick to details and the idea that we must always keep fighting for freedom."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The Hunt for Red October was a great read, and I probably can't expect Clancy to reach that height when he's expected to crank out a 700-page tome every twelve months. But this was the worst product he's produced. It appears to be ready made for Hollywood. Maybe he's tired of scriptwriters butchering his product and has prepared a ready-for-Hollywood text, but this is trite and preachy. While trying to get into his characters' heads, he has become an apologist for the Conservative Agenda. This time the enemy are enviromentalists. If he keeps up with this trend, I expect Jack Ryan to have an affair with an intern in the next book. Well, maybe he can get some good material from the Starr Report."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Not Clancy's best, but still good. I would have liked more development of the characters, both good and bad. They were too black or white. As a special forces soldier, I know that we have a spectrum of people serving and our potential enemies also run the gamut. I recommend a few other books: Coonts latest, Andy McNabbs-- BRAVO TWO ZERO is real good about the SAS; Bob Mayer's SF books like CUT OUT or ETERNITY BASE; Joe Dalton's THE OMEGA MISSILE. All those guys, unlike Clancy, actually served in the military so there's an extra edge of realism to their books.

Infact it took me over a month just to finish it cause I feel asleep everytime I tried to move a bit farther into this convoluted story.In trying to top the scare/shock/suspense factor of the past several novels in the series, we get to see a company with insanely homicidal tree huggers designing a new version of the same bug that Iran tried to use to stem population growth in the US in the last book, Executive Orders.It's a plot to destroy every one (except the treehuggers of course), and you know that they will fail just because that would end the series.No suspence, no excitement, no reason to ever read it again."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Like just about every other Clancy fan I was hugly disapointed by this book. I even felt that I had wasted a weekend reading it. This book Lacked just about everything that has made Mr Clancy wealthy enough to consider buying the Vikings.

These villians may be great scientists, but they probably could not find there way across the street with out a map and detailed directions.

They were entertaining when there was a real enemy that was capable of competing with the Western Allies, but nowadays they have to stretch pretty far for a story. It's always amusing to see that the He-men in these books are married to nurses (more nurturing you know). Thus the scene is set:&quot;Gee Honey, how can you kill somebody?

The good guys win, of course. International terrorism (and this time the arch-villain is, believe it or not, an American !) is defeated once again.

Bill Henrikson flew from Sydney to Canberra for a meeting which should have taken place in Sydney with the New South Wales police commissioner and authority being granted from New South Wales' Olympics Minister!

Excellent!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"For anyone else, this would be a pretty decent techno- and action thriller. From Clancy, I expect more. _Rainbow Six_ is flawed but OK and enjoyable on the first read, but it has almost NO &quot;re-read&quot; value whatsoever, and that's a first for this particular author (at least in the Ryan and Clark series).You know, there are two things that particularly disappoint me about this book. Until reading this, I used to compare Clancy to Charles Dickens for the way in which he developed the minor characters in his works, and I got laughed at by a lot of people for doing so. If the characterization in _Rainbow Six_ is going to be par for the course for Clancy, I might just start laughing at myself very soon for making such a dumb statement. The characters in _Rainbow Six_, aside from the fascinating Popov and perhaps Ding Chavez (whose character, however, is developed and analyzed far better in other books in this series) , are extremely shallow and unbelievable. Clancy has somehow managed to turn what was once an overwhelming strength into an obvious weakness. And, Tom, while you're at it, could you perhaps come up a form of central disaster other than an Ebola or &quot;Shiva&quot; epidemic? If Clancy's next Ryan or Clark book contains any reference, except in passing, to biological warfare or bioterrorism, he's going to have one less reader.While _Rainbow Six_ is preferable to any of Clancy's non-Ryan/Clark oeuvre (other than _Red Storm Rising_), it ranks dead last in that series. One can only hope that his forthcoming continuation in the Ryan series is a return to the previous and recent high standards he set with _Executive Orders_ and _Debt of Honor_.For Clancy completists only. DEFINITELY not the first book by Clancy to read, and if it was the first Clancy book you read and you were disappointed, you may want to give him another chance - he's usually not off by this much. :-) Any of his other books in the Ryan/Clark series would serve as a better example of the REAL and considerable talent of Tom Clancy. This is just me talking here, but my least favorite Ryan/Clark novel besides this one is a tossup between &quot;Without Remorse&quot; and &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, both of which are about 10 times better than this book. As a final aside, this may be the only time in history that a computer game based on a book is more interesting than the book from which it was adapted. :-)Sorry, Tom, but it's the truth. Better luck next time. :-("},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the first book of Clancy's I read. And I think it was a great choice! Rainbow Six is a suspenseful, action packed and entertaining book. This is one of those books that when it gets to a good part you can't put it down, it's like it is glued to your hands. Occasionally it is so boring you wish the Rainbow team would bust into that chapter and kill the guys talking. But that rarely happened in this thriller. Just as a hint all chapters are important and have an effect on the ending. If this book to you becomes a let down, skip to the last 60 pages cuz they are so cool.

There's no time to think, not for the heroes, who deserved better, not for the reader. The new gadgets appear so obviously as &quot;I'll be used&quot; that you may expect John Clark becoming Q in the next 007 movie. A pity that the best character to appear in his books (the one who made &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; memorable) is wasted in a us-and-them-(we're the best of the best and we'll remind you every 60 pages)-bad-movie-plot. As everyone who watched &quot;Jurassic Park 2&quot; knows, lack of a good plot and characters can destroy a lot of good intentions.

The first 2/3 of the book, exciting in spurts, was essentially boring. The last 100 pages (of 740) was really exciting, giving those bad guys what they deserved without being really nasty. What annoyed me intensely was the suck up to the FBI (&quot;we have to obey the law&quot; stuff) when history records that the FBI has been the most flagrant violator of constitutional rights of any organization except Bill Clinton's presidency."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've been a fan of Clancy since I first read The Hunt for Red October. Without Remorse giving Clark's background was a winner. I thoroughly enjoyed Rainbow Six, and while Clancy seems to have gotten Dickens' contract who cares? Rainbow Six is exciting and suspenseful. True Clancy fans will enjoy the book immensely and still be waiting anxiously for his next. Clark and Ding's escapades will keep readers up until the wee hours refusing to put down the book. A must read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Just finished 'Rainbow Six'. Big book. Big disappointment. I counted probably 17 editing and continuity errors throughout the text. Apparently there are also significant spelling errors, too. I don't expect this is a $30 novel. It almost seems to be a ghost-written. Perhaps Tom is spending too much time developing the computer game versions of his books? Even worse, perhaps he's writing the books with the game in mind(!). Sorry but this is one Clancy novel that is not worth buying. And I'll be reading the next one in my local library."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The 2 possible scenerios:1) Either Clancy didn't write this book, and then was too busy to read it or 2) He fired his editor, and now we know who the real talent is.The book is unbelieveably repetitive: it could have been written in half the pages. There are technical errors not worthy of a Clancy novel. The re-use of phrases (&quot;faster then closing a zipper&quot; and &quot;niggeredly&quot; were both used 4 times that I counted) made me scream. And Tom, Richmond is not a borough of New York.This is the worst book of all time."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has provided yet another tale. Same thing different book. It reads well, but is unsatisfying overall - no new ground is being broken here. His best is still _Red Storm Rising_. His characters are starting to appear similar to those in Ludlum's sequels: older, but still trying to be the original characters they once were. The characters have not evolved. A new set of characters, ones who haven't had a chance yet in Clancy's tired realm, might breathe new life into the world. But he continues to use the same names, the same mannerisms, the same threads. The tale might be better told from the perspective of John Clark's lieutenant, Dingo Chavez, and only from there. We shifted from Ryan to Clark, now let's shift from Clark to someone new. An evolution, shall we say."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have been a dedicated Clancy fan since &quot;Hunt&quot; came out way back in 1984. It used to be that the only requirement to being a Clancy fan was a desire to be entertained by a well crafted techno-thriller. Now, it seems that you have to be a right-wing, anti-environment Republican to enjoy his latest books. As a Democrat and environmentalist, this is the last Clancy book I buy-next time I'm making a $25 donation to Greenpeace. Unrealistic bad guys, a comic book plot, various elements taken from his other books, and insulting pot shots at anybody who doesn't share his political views all combine to make R6 a real dog. Don't blow your money on this piece of crap."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Another great story. I enjoy Clancy's original characters more than the &quot;Op Center&quot; series, so it was nice to see another book featuring them. The story is well written and the plot is something that could happen in the here-and-now. Definetly one of his best yet."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"After reading the last page, my first thought was: &quot;Did Tom Clancy write the whole book or just two chapters?&quot;The first and last chapters are Clancy at his best. Pity the rest of the book does not keep pace: - 4 similar terrorist actions featuring Ding Chavez - Same virus research as in Executive Orders - Same virus as in E.O. - Same mode of spreading the virus as in E.O.The ending is surprising and imaginative. Unfortunately, the book is much like a Big Mac: big and juicy on the poster but there is not a lot of meat inside the bun. Mr. Kelly/Clark has earned his pension and he should take it; Ding Chavez is up to the task.Could it be that mr. Clancy was focusing more on setting up a syndicate to buy the Minnesota Vikings than on maintaining his own standards? Then again, maybe I was just expecting too much!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It would appear that Mr. Clancy has decided to go the way of Allen Drury as an author. That is to say he is diluting the power of his characters by overwhelming them with far rightwing political plots making his storylines less and less believable.It is no longer fun to read one of his books.My two stars are for the jacket and the font!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Living in Barcelona close to where part of the story takes place and also working in the Olympic Stadium helped bring the story home for me. I have read all of Tom Clancy's fiction work with the exception of the Op-Center series which I understand he didn't actually write anyway. I found this book to be right up there with all of his others with a few drawbacks in terms of the plot. But after Debt of Honor and Executive Orders you can't try to reach a higher climax so you go off in another direction. He did a great job of it. He's truely the master of the techno-thriller."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This work is better than the Op-Center works, but still lacks the feel of a Clancy novel when the main character is Jack Ryan."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As a dedicated reader and fan of everything Clancy, it pains me to read the latest adventure of John Clark and Ding Chavez. Not since 'Sum of All Fears' has Clancy woven such a lose and outright boring tale. The story line is only exciting when the newly formed Rainbow counter-terror team deploys for action using the hightech devices at their disposal to to bring down the bad guys. When the story reveals that the true enemy is a bunch of Eco-Terrorists intent on killing the world's population...enough is enough! Tom please!?! Has the world gotten this boring since the demise of the Soviet Block? This dear Clancy fans is a must miss!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It is unfortunate that tom clancy has decided to release a new book per year. This pace really decrease the quality of the thing. This last book was too predictable. From the first couple of pages you know that nothing really bad is going to happen to Clark's team so you lose the interest really fast.Reading about a bunch of soldier killing people, even terrorists, did not keep me on the edge of my seat. Clancy wrote great books I hope this one is only an exception"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Because I have read and enjoyed many of Clancy's other novels, I was eager to read this one, too. What a disappointment! This book just plods on endlessly. It's about as suspenseful as finding out that all your blue jeans are blue. Don't bother to buy this one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was entertaining with some good action scenes. However, the plot was too predictable and the book did not contain Mr. Clancy's usual attention to character building as was present in his other novels. It was enjoyable reading. However, I feel that I'd have been better off waiting until the less expensive paperback was available."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read all of Clancy's books and have enjoyed them all. At first I missed the Jack Ryan character, I quickly got into Rainbow Six. I really enjoyed reading it!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I thought that this book is an excellent read for the reader who craves action. Page after page of attacks and operations keep you reading. The only real downside to the story is that it is missing some of the depth and mystery that Clancy usually brings to a novel. Also, the book is a little bit to predictable. My biggest complaint: Clancy uses the same team over and over again on missions when it should have alternated between the two. When he finally uses the other team, what happens?? Read it to find out what I mean! All in all, an excellent read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six was a wonderful book. I thought it had a lot more action in it than Tom Clancy's other books. I couldn't put it down. I was up till 2:00 in the morning reading it. It was all worth it though. I recommend it to any Tom Clancy fans."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is a big book. This is a thriller. This is a page-turner. This is a fascinating dive into the lower dregs of terrorism. The first idea you have to consider is that terrorism is a profession and terrorists are professionals. Hence to fight against this phenomenon, which is in no way new but which has very new means and weapons, you need to have professionals anti-terror fighters. This leads to the question of who can control these fighters. It has to be a multinational body under the control of some agencies, but which ? The book takes the stand that ultimate control comes from the CIA, the FBI and the US military, and yet this body of fighters must keep their autonomy and hence be able to intervene under no control except the ethics of war, even when war is not declared, and in any country, with or without the agreement of the local government, though the latter case is only considered for countries like, in order of appearance, Australia, Venezuela, Brazil. This leads to serious questions about the legitimacy of this anti-terror group and also about the US leadership that seems to negate local laws and even local authorities, as if, as the book says, a new sheriff were out on the frontier that the world is. But the book goes a long way farther. All kinds of officially known and identified terrorist groups are seen as the heritage of the past (the new islamist groups are not taken into account) and these groups are manipulated into doomed actions. But this reveals that there is another possibility in the field : terrorism coming from american corporations that have tremendous means of action. They are rich and can use enormous amounts of money. They can take advantage of all privileges of international and multinational big corporations that enable them to by-pass all regulations in the field of air transport, customs controls and financial management. Hence they are beyond legal control. What's more they are managed by very small groups of people who have practically no accounts to give to anyone, even the shareholders, as long as money is pouring on the latter's bankaccounts. The case taken into account in this book is an international american-based pharmaceutical corporation that can mobilize tremendous research, development and financial means to reach their aims. They can also use professional spies or ex-spies, some of the best and best-trained in the world like the ex-KGB spies, to develop activities in the field of terrorism. These ex-KGB people, when turned capitalists, are particularly dangerous due to their connections and prestige in some revolutionary circles. The book shows how the newly-set Rainbow anti-terror group can cope with such menaces. But the motivation of these criminals is their love for nature and they are so extreme, and, since no differenciation is made between these and normal environmentalists, the book seems to condone those who consider that the environment must not be taken into account at all. The conclusion of the book is just absurd since it is a reference to the Brave New World that is coming in the future : but this reference to Aldous Huxley's novel promises us a strange future : the conditioning of any individual from birth into one of five classes of people without any possibility to escape this social hierarchy, except by getting away into some kind of rebellion in some wild uncontrolled territories. How can we accept a future in which one will be forced into one social class by some technocrats or politicians transforming everyone into an unconscious pawn on a chessboard that only this narrow ruling group can control ? In other words this vision leads to a totally undemocratic and unethical world that Aldous Huxley rejected and denounced and that Tom Clancy seems to endorse entirely. A fascinating book that leads to a dangerous vision if the reader does not inject his own distanciation into the discourse, if the reader does not see that this allusion to the Brave New World of tomorrow has to be read as an ironical warning about the future of this anti-terroristic vision and management of humanity. And we will credit Tom Clancy with this distanciation in his mind, even if his book does not in any way goes that way.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"With the fall of the Iron Curtain and the subsequent dismantlement of the Warsaw Pact, Tom Clancy lost his chief villain (as did James Bond) and had to scour the planet for new villains. These new villains included the drug cartel, terrorists, disgruntled Native Americans, ex-KGB agents, the Chinese, socialized medicine, the Japanese and tree-huggers (with tree-huggers being the worst of them all).Thus we come to the book that I am reviewing, \\"Rainbow Six,\\" which is entirely focused on the actions and thoughts of John Clark and Chavez Ding. Clark's been given a job where he'll lead a team of multi-national anti-terrorist super soldiers. And when I say \`multi-national', I only mean three nations. There are a few Americans, some Brits and one German who are all stationed at a military base in England. All is well until trouble starts brewing on the other side of the Atlantic. Several eco-friendly scientists and one cowboy are developing a virus designated \`Ebola Shiva' and plan to wipe out pretty much all of humanity (except for themselves of course). Why? Because humanity (or rather the extremely large bulk of it) has abused poor Mother Nature long enough. The tree-huggers shall inherit the Earth!This revelation depressed me. \`So, the entire book is just an extended Bond-style plot?' is what I first asked myself. Then after finishing the book, I answered myself with a simple \`Yes.' But the fundamentally weak plot didn't prevent me from highly enjoying certain spots (such as a hostage rescue at a theme park or the final assault on the eco-terrorists). Also I really enjoyed the display of militaristic technology in this book, which is best personified via the \`tricorders.' These \`tricorders' are devices that allow its user to detect the heartbeats of targets behind walls or in the great outdoors.However, Clancy's books are more about the sum rather than the parts. So in the end, \\"Rainbow Six\\" has entertaining parts but a weak sum."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Mr Clancy appears to be getting sloppy:a) He has obviously never been to Herefordb) He has no clue how the UK health system and training works (Mrs Chvez appears to be doing American medical training in UK)c) He is apparently not aware that you do not need to cross the International Date Line flying from UK to Sydney (I assume he is looking at it from US, where you do have to cross the dateline)d) He has forgotten that when it is summer in UK, it is winter in Sydney (rather silly)e) He has no idea what actually happens when you inject 40cc of heroin quickly into a vein (his description is laughable really)f) He thinks veganism and vegetarianism are synonymousIf this is any indication of Mr Clancy's much vaunted attention to detail, I am leery of his accuracy regarding military matters. Perhaps this is why he continues to publish without any real government inteference - I'm sure they like a good laugh every so often like the rest of us.I wouldn't mind it so much if he would just tone down the rampant self righteousness in his books"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"How very sad. I've read all of Clancy's non-fiction (not counting the ghost-written pulp he puts his name on) and they have steadily declined since the Sum of All Fears. His right wing paranoia has overtaken his ability to write a plausible plot. Character development has never been a strong point for Clancy, and here he has taken his least interesting, most one-dimensional character and surrounded him with a *team* of uninteresting characters.This isn't a politically based review. One *can* write a book on eco-terrorism, however, Clancy's villains here are completely wrong and I can think of no real world equivalent.This is not just a book to be set aside and put away; it is one which must be hurled as far as possible, while yelling as loud as possible."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I always enjoy the Tom Clancy books, especially the Jack Ryan series. The stories of the military and special projects have always interested me. His books are not only interesting, but addicting because they keep you in suspense all the way until the end."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I think Rainbow Six is one of Tom Clancy's best known books and I know why. Because it's great. Perfect story, perfect character development (especially Dmitry Popov) and it's perfectly written. It's definitively not too long, I can't imagine how shorter would Clancy write this story. This book is great, from the first page to the last one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is pure rubish if you want geopolitical realism; however, the action has a more or less authentic feel to it. The action is intense and all together fast pace. Lots of detailed research about the weapons and tactics was present. However, the plot was somewhat ridiculious. I highly doubt that the enemy in the story could pull off something like that without being caught (esp. since its not even a country). Also, it seemed a bit glorified about the Team, which was composed of mainly, surprise, Americans. All in all, a decent story with lots of action and little plot."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I loved Rainbow Six because it added the realism that I love about Tom Clancy, but I gave this novel 4 stars because he messed up on one little thing.That thing being is that one of the charatchers Tom Clancy is referring to, is that he was born to a Chinese father and a Latino mother.One...when you are referring to a woman who has Latin blood in her, you dont call her a Latino, she is a Latina. Second Latina's dont date Asian's or Germans, they only go out with black's and other Latino's.But beyond that, this is a GOOD novel, the action is there, and this is one of his best novels, I just wish that Red Rabbit had the same action like Rainbow Six does.I also liked the charatcher Domingo Chavez, and another thing when his son was born, he named him John Connor Chavez. One other thing; A Latino man does not name his son John Connor Chavez or any other name that is not referring to his Latin roots.Latin men who have kids want their kids to have Latin names and for a Latino man to name his son John Connor Chavez is just out of the picture."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is a good buy for any avid reader of Clancy. He does a nice job of paying attention to detail, but not like in the Jack Ryan series. Unlike others that I talk to, I enjoy reading entire chapters on how and why the bomb detonated like it did. There is detail, but not nearly where I would like it to be. I like the idea of having a spin off of John Clark books, but the references to \\"the President\\", who all who read Tom Clancy know is Jack Ryan, became distracting. I expected at least maybe a slight role for good old Jack, but there never was one. I also found the end to have high suspense, but there wasn't that good old drag out knock down fight at the end that I always enjoy so much. And finally, the plot was too over the top to be believable. Most books that I read by Clancy have plausible plots, but this was just a little over the top for me. Even with all of these \\"problems\\", I would recommend it to an avid Clancy fan. If your looking to read a Clancy book for the first time, I recommend something like Patriot Games, or Red Storm Rising, you'll get a better taste for what this author can really do."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What was Clancy on when he wrote this?!I'm not even past the first 100 pages,and already I want to return it!I'm not in to the whole military thing,so half the time I don't even know what the ... he's talking about.I giving him another chance though.I have The Hunt for Red October and The Cardinal of the Kremlin.I'll review them and if they both don't get at least 4 Stars,I'm through with Clancy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was very much like Patriot Games, a lot of action and not as much technical description as seen in most of Clancy's work. In my eyes Clancy is the best writer and Rainbow Six is another great addition to the 'Clancy Shelf' in my library."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I bought this book for my husband for Christmas. How surprised I was when I turned to the first page and got well and truly hooked. You have no idea how hard it was to read this book in bed (with a Dean Koontz dust jacket used as a disguise!!) and not be able to turn to my Best Beloved and say &quot;What does he mean by that?&quot; or &quot;Where is that Airport?&quot; When it came to the ending - which is the BEST ending I have ever encountered in a book! - I nearly chewed my lips off in order to stop myself reading it out to him! It was such a relief to tell him, on Christmas morning, that the book I'd been enjoying so much was the one he'd just unwrapped. The best part though, would have to be the entire shelf on our bookcase dedicated to Tom Clancey and the contemplation of reading them all."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"After enjoying many of Tom Cancy's books, I must admit this was probably the last one I'll read. The whole book is full of cardboard characters in make-believe scenarios, taken out of a shoot-em computer game. Clancy is a great writer, and used to research his books well. Too bad he missed big-time with this one... So as not to completely ruin the plot if anyone still wants to read, I won't go into the many factual and tactical mistakes of the book, but they are just waiting to be found."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I thought the book was execellent, although in some parts it did get a little discusting. I beat the game before I read it and I found them quite different. I still liked the book - read it in less than 2 weeks."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Good page turner once more from Tom. Had me enthralled and for once I managed to figure out before Tom told me - who the &quot;employer&quot; was. Excellent ending as well...."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Before you start reading, I'm complaining here about the quality of the audio casette version here.It's...um...awful. I can't bear to listen to any of the attempts at accents, especially the English and Irish ones. And all the women sound like they're propositioning you. All the best lines are cut out, only the Americans sound like human beings.Avoid it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Personally, having read this book all the way through three times, I've found that the best way to enjoy it is to read whichever bit you feel like at the time. I did enjoy the way it didn't treat the whole world outside of the US as decoration, and it was fun watching Clark, Chavez and the rest of the Americans settling into Britain (although there are one or two mistakes - an overstaffed hospital???).The overall plot I found disappointing - I have visions of Clancy sitting at a desk and thinking 'Now how can I come up with a bigger threat than last time...?' I have to wonder what he'll do for the next book - an alien invasion, perhaps?In short, uneven, and best read all the way through once so you can pick out the bits you want to read again."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Actually, I read this thing like a year ago (when I was 10 years old), and I just couldn't put it down! This is one of Tom Clancy's many masterpieces, and no one can best him when it comes to this category. This is more than worth your [money]! Go get it! Shoo! Stop reading this review! Go add it to your shopping cart!Adios, Amigos"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was a really exciting book!!! You should go see it. In every mission, it was heart-stopping for me!!!

The book goes into so much detail, if you dont read every line of every page, your lost. The best character was Ding Chavez. I also have the action packed video game. Even though Chavez dies in my game, hes the best of the book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've been a clancy fan for years, but the main reason I decided to read this book was because of the popularity of the video game. As soon as I picked the book up, I was glued to it and just couldn't stop myself from pulling on to see what would happen next... This book has a much deeper plot than most of clancy's other books and adds a whole new dimension to the video game experience. Spine tingling excitement from pages 1-740! This book however could have used more character development, but with the large number key characters, I think that's understandable."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have just finished reading Rainbow Six. It is an excellent book that I couldn't be pulled away from. I knew what was going to happen but it didn't matter. The story still captivated me. I enjoyed the continuation of the characterization of Ding and Clark. I was however dissappointed with Clancy for leaving out Jack Ryan. His name was mentioned only once. This leads me to believe that there will be a blockbuster of a book with all the characters in one final Jack Ryan novel. Also a request that Clancy put in for a movie for some more of his books."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"John Clark and Ding Chavez in addition to Jack Ryan, Tom Clancy's most incredible characters who are driven by passion, purpose and honor. Finally another book which allows us to learn more about Ding and John."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Like Exec Orders and Debt, This novels starts out slow but builds to a climatic ending. The plots are getting too predictable. Put more into the earlier chapters ( Like Kremlin) Develope new characters. Including Mr murphy, Things never go that easy!Been a big fan since 83."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy, as usual, has succesfully written yet another wonderfully suspenseful story of adventure,and terrorism. As usual Clancy does a terrific job of introducing his audience to his wonderful variety of characters, and locations. However, the ending reveals things about the nature of his main character, Mr. Clark, that are quietly frightening. I sincerely hope that our government does not solve problems that way in reality. After reading the book, and carefully considering it, I must say that Mr. Clark's solution to the book's main problem, is starkly unconstitutional, something one doesn't expect from Clancy's conservative persuasion. Also, the foul language in the book is both unnecessary, and unrealistic."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"&quot;Rainbow Six&quot; is a suspensful, cliff-hanging, action-packed adventure that no author other than Tom Clancy can beat. One of Clancy's gifts would most likely be his ability to glue his reader's eyes to the book, not wanting to stop, wanting to find out what happens next so much, you would sit still throughout the entire book, wondering what happens next. Clancy makes the business of writing look so easy to do. From his first novel, &quot;The Hunt for Red October,&quot; to his latest, &quot;Every Man a Tiger&quot; Clancy has won readers everywhere with his kind of ability to write, and write well! This is another typical Clancy novel, as the others, suspensful and riveting to the end. Clancy's fans will most likely like this new novel, and those who have never heard of Clancy will be motivated to try Clancy's books. One of Clancy's must-reads."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Two Words: READ IT....Ok now realy it is one of Clancy's best.

I stopped at the 100th page, hoping for it to get better at page 50 but it didn't. I only gave this book 2 stars because the beginning was suspencful and entertaining. During the first 10 pages I was so pleased and I thought I was into a real adventure, but then it got a little too complex and the action was just plain boring. After reading Tom Clancy's Net Force, Debt of Honor, and Executive Orders, Rainbow Six was just plain. . . BORING!

I am at present only halfway through Rainbow 6 but find myself forcing myself to hang on for just one more chapter in the hope that I'll develop some empathy with the main characters.

This may be exactly what people in this line of work are like, but it merely justifies the position that Clancy beleives that describing the minutiae of his imagined environment = reader involvement. How many times do we need to be told that in the UK we call a car trunk a &quot;boot&quot;? Is this as irritating for the US reader as for me?Nevertheless Clancy engages the reader with his knowledge of the international security apparatus, and he can certainly weave together a complex layering of circumstances (even if Rainbow 6 is a little more obvious and predictable than some of his previous works). I just wish there were more characters like Popov, with whom Clancy proves once again that his forte is expressing the manueverings of a ruthless, analytical and focussed mind (I recommend Red Storm Rising).While &quot;Red October&quot; is possibly my all time favourite read, I must add that I did not finish &quot;Executive Orders&quot; either! (SLOW!)More &quot;Old Clancy&quot; please, Tom!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I guess that out of all his books, Tom Clancy is allowed one that misses the mark. And this is it. The plot stumbled from scene to scene like a poor adventure. Fact checkers would note that Aer Lingus - the airline Joseph used to fly from Boston to Ireland - hasn't used 747's for four years. They got rid of them in 1994 and replaced them all with A330's. The IRA splinter group attack was not credible. In one scene the characters describe them as the best organized of any terrorist group. In the attack itself Tom uses 15 men to do a hopeless job. A more likely scene would have used three men and two large bombs. And they would have got away with it. Briefly; They drive two 300 lb truck bombs to the hospital. Make the calls to get the SAS attention. Leave the hospital and watch the scene from the site where the TV crew are. And at the right moment, detonate by remote control. The story was, in my opinion, too predictable; the last 300 pages contain 100 pages of fluf/filler. The book ends with what the British would call a damp squid - a damp firework. Sadly the main plot was a weak rehash of his far more powerful last book. I'd prefer Tom to stop writing now and leave the arena at the top of his career."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've really never read this book.

If you're interested in Mr. Clark, WITHOUT REMORSE is a far better read. CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is also a better told tale than Rainbow Six. The characters are shallow and poorly developed, the plot is totally implausable, Clancy tends to run on and on for pages when he should be concise and surgical in his writing, and the ending ... well, let's just say it stretches credibility to the breaking point. IMHO, Tom Clancy has reached the end of his run. I've read several of his most recent collaborations, and the same problems occur in each and every one. For my money, Tony Hillerman is a far better writer who says more in two paragraphs than Tom Clancy says in 200 pages. After reading Rainbow Six I felt Tom Clancy had shown little respect for his readers, and forced us to endure a poorly told tale for the sake of meeting his obligations to his publisher. Too bad. The Hunt for Red October, Without Remorse, Clear and Present Danger, and Red Storm Rising are the definitive Clancy. Everything thereafter is pretty awful ... especially Rainbow Six."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am a Clancy fan and have read most of his books. I was dissapointed with this effort. The premise is far fetched, the events are disjointed and the characters, superficial. While he is an acknowleged master, I feel Mr. Clancy is playing on his past reputation. I should have waited for the book at the library and not bought it. Mr. Clancy needs to get back to novels like &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Along with many of the other reviewers, I too was diappointed with Rainbow Six. I'm a big fan of Clancy's earlier books but his work has been on the decline for some time now. The battle sequences held my attention but the rest of the book was a snoozer! Poorly written and poorly edited. And what is up with the photo on the back cover? Did he even serve in the military? What a poser! Enough with the ego trip, try producing some quality work Tom."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Just finished reading the book last night -- actually the wee hours of this morning. Not as good as some of Clancy's others such as Clear and Present Danger and Debt of Honor, but it held my interest. With the exception of the book's climax, which I found riveting, the action &quot;scenes&quot; were not as suspenseful as in previous novels. John Clark deals with the antagonists in his usual unique and creative manner at the book's end.

The plot is a rehash of his last two novels. The characters, which used to be interesting and &quot;real&quot; are flat and boring. Oh, I'm sorry. There's lots of shooting and explosives. Oh, right, that's what makes a book good. Tom, I'm sorry, but your old stuff was far, far, far superior to Rainbow Six. We know you can write. You just decided to pretend that can't. Right?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tighter standards apply to Tom Clancy than to run-of-the mill authors. By Tom Clancy standards, RAINBOW SIX is disappointing. The entire first half of the novel is based on two untenable premises, 1) that a sudden increase in terrorist activities would influence which of many competing companies an Olympics security contract would be awarded to, and 2) that an organization would spend 100 million dollars or so, sponsoring such random terror, when simply undercutting competitor's bids would be more effective. Clancy's writing has achieved a high quality of excellence. Characters are evenly and appropriately developed for an action novel. However, for a Clancy novel, there isn't much action. At times the novel is painfully slow paced. The unnecessary repetition of philosophical an technical points-frequently verbatim, or nearly so-gives the impression of sloppy editing."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am a big fan of Tom Clancy and all of his previous works. Having said that, I also think &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; is one of the worst books ever published. This book is living proof that Clancy's reputation and marketability has outpaced his capacity to write. The book is MUCH to long. The story line would have made a nice short story at best. Dear Tom: You ripped me off! I want my money back. Also, I should receive compensation for dragging this thing across the country on airplane flights.

Instead, if you like thrillers, take this recommendation: buy EYES OF THE HAMMER by Bob Mayer in paperback for $3.99 from Amazon. See if you like it. Then if you do, get the rest of his special forces series featuring the same main character; although the rest are only in hardcover, they are well worth it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As soon as I saw &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; on the bookshelf, I bought it. I never wait for the soft-cover to come out, however, this time I should have. Editorial errors such as a character changing names from &quot;Tim&quot; to &quot;Tom&quot; in a page shows that speed was the driving factor not quality in this latest Tom Clancy book. Unfortunately, this is not the first time this has happened in a Clancy novel. The plot was generally plausible, but the lack of substance to the characters was most dissapointing. All the &quot;good&quot; guys were alike, almost like clones of each other. The book reads like it followed a standard formuala for its construction and so consequently it is highly predictable. The one refreshing departure from past books was that the &quot;bad&quot; guys were from the US. I would not recommend you rush out and buy this one, but if you have some time to pass and want something not too challenging, then buy it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has once again written an outstanding thriller. In his most recent novel, Rainbow Six, Clancy starts off with a terrorist incident aboard an airplane heading for England. On board are John Clark and Ding Chavez, the heroes of earlier Clancy novels. Rainbow has some of the typical Clancy traits; including a well developed plot and an emphasis on the technical aspects of the story. The characters are also well-developed. Ding Chavez is a perfect example of this. The reader sees how fatherhood, his wife and his job affected his conscience. Clancy has written another thriller that the reader will not be able to put down."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is a waste of time featuring ludicrous plots and a plethora of unreal, dumb, &quot;bad guys&quot; It becomes obvious immediately that Mr. Clancy has run out of ideas, what is next, Jack Clark and Ding battling aliens or perhaps giant prehistoric creatures?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I forgot it on the train in London after 300 pages. I was inititally upset, but had absolutely no desire to purchase it again. Sorry Tom, but you blew this one. Where is the twisted plot that uses the 150 pages for plot foundation and another 800 to unwind? It read more like a Grisham...not a thinker, just a time passer."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Despite some small flaws, this book shows that Tom Clancy is back to form - and it is a great relief to have him back in person after some Op-Centers and Power Plays. Halfway into this novel, it becomes a real page-turner, and that's what thriller fans are looking for. The plot is not as complex as in Clancy's most recent novels which many readers will consider a shortcoming (me, too) - but it has one advantage: This book is only a brick-stone and not a giant-sized rock like f.ex. &quot;Executive Orders&quot; with its 1400p in paperback. Now, to the flaws: As some readers already pointed out, yes, the good guys win too easily. In this novel, I never had a doubt that the good guys will win. Well, most thrillers end like this, but the art of writing a good thriller makes the reader at least THINK that there might be a possibility that the good guys will at least have some problems. Second and last flaw: As like in all of his novels, there is also a sub-plot in this book which just slows down the proceedings and can be easily skipped: The &quot;virus-testing&quot; episode in the first half of the novel. This is pretty familiar territory and, well, quite boring. Just for the record: Like always, left-winged readers will hate this, so to all of them: Stay clear! All the others will find a suspenseful, fast-paced novel, better than Clancy's most recent, but not as good as his best. One last thing: The action set-pieces are terrific, and one can clearly see that Mr. Clancy had a lot of fun staging them. I had fun, too, and that's what I expect from a good novel, Mr. Clancy. Review by Oliver Naujoks, Marburg/Germany"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Normally I would keep my disappointment to myself, but having read some of the five star reviews, I just can't. If you've read Clancy's books, actually read them, then you've already read this one. Tom just wasn't trying. The IRA are back and attack the hero's wife and daughter - Patriot Games. Baddies using a devastating virus - Executive Orders. The evils lurking under the cover of the jungle - Clear and Present. Bad guy becoming the saviour of the day - Cardinal of the Kremlin. And there's a lot more - I don't want to ruin what little excitement in the book there is by giving away the other deja vu moments. Tom, if you can't be bothered , why should we?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Just for the record, I am a big Tom Clancy fan. Having read all of his fiction works, I hope I can deliver a balanced few of Rainbow Six.Hidden within those 700 and some pages, it is possible to glimpse the outline of a good techno-thriller as only Clancy could write. Unfortunately, it seems that Mr. Clancy has forgotten how to go beyond an outline. He punches in some action sequences, takes the requisite stance for good, and provides a little commentary, but just can't seem to get beyond what should come just before the commercial break. At no time is the reader drawn to care about the characters, even though Clancy makes a heavy handed attempt by threatening the wives and children of Clark and Chavez. There is more character development in the first 20 pages of &quot;Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; than in all of Rainbow Six.In regard to the politics involved, I must admit that I am in no way surprised that Mr. Clancy is very Conservative. Nevertheless, I am disappointed that he has decided to preach rather than use comparison and contrast to make his point. I understand what he is attempting to say, and even agree with him at times, but would have preferred a less simplistic and demeaning approach.One question that I was left with at the end of the book was, &quot;Is there so little real political and philosophical conflict left in the world that Mr. Clancy must rely upon unbelievable fantasy?&quot; Russia is teetering on collapse, the Middle East is quickly coming apart, and revolution and separatism are brewing to varying degrees on our northern and southern borders. Is there not a story in there somewhere?For those of you contemplating whether to purchase Rainbow Six, I would recommend waiting for the paperback. Better yet, try out the computer game by the same name."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is one of the best books i have ever read in my life...You think itss origanaly about one thing and then all of a sudden the best parts hit you right in the kiser!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Good, but not great, book about a crack international team of counter-terrorists. They are prepared for anything, but unknowingly face a plan to annihilate most of the world's population."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Currently the United States and other major nations of the world are at peace, so Tom Clancy has to look to new sources for conflict. No, he didn't go to outer space a la Starship Troopers. Rather he weaves international terrorism and a rich bioengineering corporation together in a plot to make the world safe from man by basically getting rid of most humankind. Standing in the breach is a multinational anti-terrorism strikeforce led by John Clark and Ding Chavez. Mix together Michael Crichton's Andromeda Strain, Stephen King's The Stand, Ernest Callenbach's Ecotopia, and Clancy's own Patriot Games and Without Remorse, and you have the beginnings of this book. I found it to be a real pageturner, and I kept stealing free moments to read it to completion."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I swore off Clancy after Patriot Games. Too many words, thinly-drawn characters, language out of the '50s movies he grew up on.(I grew up on them, too; does anyone actually use the word &quot;pal&quot; anymore?) But I made the mistake of buying this one. It's based on an interesting idea (with one interesting character -- the Russian), but Clancy has no sense of character, so he just writes and writes and pages pile up and nothing happens and you don't really care about anybody. It must be the Stephen King syndrome. The author has become so commercially successful, nobody can edit him.Be warned. This one ain't worth the effort. And if I ever buy another Clancy book, I hope my wife kicks me right in the butt.For much better writing, try LeCarre for espionage and Stephen Hunter for paramilitary."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"John Clark is the leader of of Rainbow, a multi-national covert force of men who are the best of the best.

Don't get me wrong...his overall story ideas are usually right on the pulse of current day problems; his action sequences are marvelous; and his grasp on military technologies still remains unsurpassed. But, his latest novels just lack the &quot;oomph&quot; of earlier works. For example, R6's ending just kinda dies...slow and unremarkable (although I did appreciate the very last mini-chapter), especially compared to &quot;Sum of All Fears&quot; or &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;.

Led by the secretive John Clark, Rainbow scours the political scene, sending his troops to disolve these threats as they happen, before any more innocents get caught in the crossfire.Like all of Clany's works, the situations are highly detailed and descriptive.

Clancy takes the lives of several characters and intertwines them in amanner which awes its reading audience as the plot unravels, exposing the genius of Clancy andhis ability to weave and unweave the lives of his characters. A multinational counter-terroristteam has been assembled in Europe by top government officials in several countries. Thiscounter-terrorist force must complete missions with perfection every time, while still keepingtheir top secret identity top secret. The groups move around the world on a moments notice,fighting terrorism where ever they are called. This is much to the dismay of a terroristorganization employing former KGB agents for global terrorism. Combined with thediscontentment of top-government officials in the United States, a biochemistry developmentgroup and a handful of the most dangerous terrorists on the planet, Rainbow Six takes itsaudience on a road where the counter terrorists and the terrorist meet in an explosiveconfrontation toward the end of the book, as is Clancy's style. Unfortunately for me the endingdid not provide for an ending suitable for the characters Clancy developed. According thecharacter development Clancy portrayed, the terrorists should have been forced to address theissue that they leave everything rational blindly for a cause. Accurate military informationcoupled with Clancy's ability to describe in detail a situation and multiple characters giveRainbow Six the edge over any other military books. While the ending dragged, the book wasstill entertaining and informative, giving me insight into military operations."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"After reading this book i am a commited clancy fan. Rainbow six was the first of clancy's books I read and I now know that it is a large step away from his other books and in particular, his series. The book still clings closely to the Tried and True Clancy Formula, with character profiles taking up a good third of the book. However, once I finished reading the full 900 pages.... which i agree, to some may seem extravagent and unforfilling, to me it represented a brilliantly crafted diplay of writing and storytelling excellence and it has succeeded in making me a fan of the legendary writer, Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"It is scary how this man writes, and then his words come true. In real life, events of September 11, 2001, have prompted governments to form a coalition to fight terrorism around the world. Yet Tom Clancy talked about such an effort years before this happened. As seen in real life, the dangers of terrorism in the air and on the ground are horrifying, but one man, having done extensive research, writes about how a war against evil can be fought. Let's hope another part of Tom Clancy's literary premonitions comes true... after all, he does have the good guys winning the fight.

The team has members from various NATO countries. The beginning is great, it grabbed my attention. But then, nothing for about 100 pages. This 900 page book is not for light readers. I'm in Junior High and I found it a little hard dragging the giant paperback to class. The action scenes are great, malticously planned out. But do we really need all this mumbo-jumbo inbetween fighting. I underrstand this book can't be all action, but Clancy is getting worse. He is clammoring to write long, drawn out books. Come on Tom, we need a little more. The plot is also a bit too predictable. Rainbow literally saves the entire human race in under a page. No shootout, not enough a resisted arrest. No complaints about leaving Ryan out of the picture, I think we all need a break from him. Clark devolps very well in this story. Hopefully Clancy will take a nice long vacation and come back home and write a real good book. The newest Bear and the Dragon is 1000+ pages. Clancy is going insane! I pray he returns to writing shorter and better action novels. Overall a great read for those with the time!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is a story about a counter-terror team headed by John Clark. In the beginning of the story, Rainbow is dispatched to three seperate terrorism incidents in Bern, Spain, and Vienna. Eventually, they are attacked by PIRA soldiers, at a local hospital, employed by Dmitry Popov who is employed by John Brightling of Horizon Corporation. They capture many of the soldiers and one of them, Sean Grady, identifies Popov and Rainbow starts an investigation into the information leak. Popov, in the meantime, is flown to Kansas to be protected by Brightling. Popov finds out about his plot to kill everyone in the world and he escapes and contacts Clark. He tells them of their plot and contacts Ding Chavez in Sydney, who is able to stop them from carrying it out. Finally, Rainbow is able to track Brightling and his people on their way to Brazil and their alternate base and Rainbow Six, Clark, and Rainbow are able to shut them down. For a change, this was a book I really liked. I usually don't find myself motivated to read, but this book really was an exception. True, at times it got a little uninteresting but, the book as a whole was great. There was lots of action and a good plot. Clancy really made it easy to feel what the characters were feeling and what they were going through. Clancy really made it hard for me to put the book down."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was very good, but in this review I'm going to post negative aspects of the read. 1. The book is strongly biased in favor of the militant right. 2. Supports the myth that Americans are of course, the very best. 3. Supports the myth that terrorists are nearly harmless. 4. Openly bashes the vegetarian and environmentalist lifestyle. 5. Openly bashes and secular movement in the USA today. I hope that should prepare you for an other wise great read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you have never read a Tom Clancy novel before this is probably not the one you should start with. In my opinion, Clancy is the master at character development, which both good and bad. I love the way he develops his characters, but I hate that it takes so long to do it, but by the end of each book you will be glad that he took the time. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; is yet another great story in the life of the infamous Mr. Clark. John Clark first rose to fame in the series of Clancy novel featuring Jack Ryan, and from the time he made his first appearance in \\"The Cardinal of the Kremlin\\" he has fascinated readers with his adventures. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; finds Mr. Clark as the head of a top secret, elite, multinational anti-terrorist group. I must admit that I was riveted to the pages as the many characters began to come together in the fast paced climax of the book. If you have read all of the Clancy novels featuring Mr. Clark, then this is one you must read. If you haven't read a Clancy novel yet, I would start with my all time favorite \\"Without Remorse\\" and then move on to \\"Clear and Present Danger\\". But if you read this book, just remember it starts off slow, but then you better hold on."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The book was fine (if you're a Clancy fan), but quite predictable and repetitive. The worst part, though, was the poor research. The Summer Olympics are being held in Sydney in July, and it's 97 degrees? I don't think so. Down under, it's winter, and in Sydney the temperature ranges on average between 46F and 62F degrees (according to my National Geographic atlas). This would eliminate the need for air conditioning and defeat one of the main premises of the book! This book was written way too fast. Clancy should be forced to re-read The Hunt for Red October five times before writing his next book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"There is not much to say about this book, other than it is essentially boring and poorly constructed. The writing itself is of a decent standard, but the way in which the story progresses is mediocre at best. The reader essentially knows the outcome of the novel by a quarter of the way in. There is no intrigue, no hidden plots or intricacies within the storyline, and that means that the whole read is devoid of interesting substance. Anyone who calls it 'fantastic' or something similar has clearly not read many books in his/her lifetime, and thus is unable to appreciate a really good novel. Tom Clancy also seems to take delight in boring his readers at times - so much irrelevant writing is contained within his novels (this is not SO apparent in R6, i admit), that you feel as if the book could be cut in half and still not detract from the readers' experience. I found myself banging my head against the wall at times whilst reading The Sum of All Fears, the level of boredom being unbelievable at times - in it Clancy took delight in explaining things similar to the molecular stucture of gum tree leaves, the exact tint of Bock's hair when in a certain light, the amount of polish of his shoes, the life story of his hat and how it came to come on his head. So much of the content of his books is not needed that it does indeed become hilarious after a while and u find the Sum of All Fears turning into a comedy. Of course, R6 isn't quite so bad, but u nevertheless find yourself desperately wanting to do something else after 100 pages of pure boredom and then 10 pages of interest. I was also disappointed with the 'villains' within the novel - Brightling was an amateur, and Popov, despite all his training, did his best to act an idiot towards the end of the novel - how bloody long could it have taken to deduce what was going on with the Project? Previously in the novel he stated that Brightling was devising something &quot;greater than mass murder&quot; - in fact he states this several times in the first half of R6- and later, when in the Project building, he deduces, after MUCH detailed thought (which Clancy kindly, and laboriously, runs us through) that maybe the Horizon Corporation is planning to buy out the surrounding countryside. Well done, you genious ex-KGB spook - oh yeah, but of course this would be too expensive even for the HC, so Popov drops that idea and continues wondering, continually thinking &quot;what could it possibly be?&quot;. Plus, after realising that the authorities were onto his 'Serov' ID, he loosely throws his passport and credit cards into a trashcan! (which makes Popov look like an idiot), which is then by chance ripped open by accident by a garbageman (which makes Clancy, the author, look like an idiot). The only reason why i am giving this book 2 stars is because it contained some good content on how anti-terrorist forces deal with terrorists, and the majority of the action sequences were reasonably good."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I loved Without Remorse, so I was looking forward to reading Rainbow Six when I learned it was about John Clark. Over all, it was a great action book. Sure, the character development was shallow and predictable, but if I wanted the emotion cluttering the adventure, I would read a &quot;Chicken Soup for...&quot; book.

If you are a big fan, like myself, you will still enjoy this book to a certain extent, but it won't take you much past that.Mediocre work from such an excellent author."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy has recently been kinda stale, and it shows with his recent books. Those books I would give 1 star, but this book is a bit different. I can still see a touch of Tom Clancy in this book, of the old Tom Clancy that is. His next book should be great if he learns from his mistakes. It's a slow book, but in the end, it's rewarding."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was disappointing - I have always liked and looked forward to certain author's works - Mr Clancy among them - after reading this I will not be in any hurry to read his next output - My main objection to this book was I felt Clancy was on a soap box too much. Also the action sequences seemed to be the same thing over and over - I can always go back and reread his earlier works - which I have started to do."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The cast of characters in this book will be familar to readers of other books by this author. The action in RB6 is good but the goal of the bad guys, who the reader KNOWS will never be reached, is too much to believe. The notion that a large group of people could conspire to pull off such a double bad deed without somebody spilling the beans is way beyond belief."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Thought this was much better than his last one but still something lacking...Just couldn't give it five stars. Good group of main characters just wish I would have found out something more about them. If they are part of the plot of his next book then Clancy needs to do a better job focusing on their work not just their personalities."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have been a long time fan of Tom's work, but this book has simply left me scratching my head---for the first 250 pages, nothing seemed to be happening, except a very slow setup. After that &quot;short&quot; interlude, the book did pick up steam, but following on the same theme of his prior novel, &quot;Executive Orders&quot;, makes you wonder if Mr. Clancy has run out of &quot;novel&quot; ideas. The resulting ending was not as captivating as his priors, and to be honest, a little farfetched, even though this is fiction. Personally, I can hardly wait for his next book---this should give some indication where he is heading."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I found this book a little hard to get into at first (as with other Clancy books), if this is you, persevere, it's worth it. Some of the characters are already well known from other books but even if this is the first Clancy books you've read don't worry, you'll soon get the plot.I got to parts in the book where it became impossible to put down as I became desperate to know the outcome of one of the groups missions, as with any good James Bond film, you know the good guy always win's, however Clancy paints such a vivid picture of the places and characters.In my opinion, an excellent read!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"An excellent work by Clancy, this book deserves a spot on every Clancy fan's bookshelf. While some of the book gets jumbled, the rest flows smoothly, combining emotional conflictions and in depth description, topped off with Clancy's immense military and intelligence knowledge. Wonderful book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I played the game for the PC which made me buy the book i made a great decision!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I did not like his previous book that focused on John Clark instead of Jack Ryan either. This book is cheesy and very predictable. The character development was weak except for the few main characters. The supporting characters were important enough that they should have been developed further. He has sunk to the level of the rest of the pack of military techno-thriller authors. While this would be an accomplishment for some, his previous books demonstrate that he is a better author."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy's books are often uneven, but usually they are strong overall. When this one focuses in on the main plot halfway through, one can't help but notice that the villains are very poorly rendered. They seem like a hodgepodge of misguided keystone cop bad guys. Their logic and actions are so ridiculous that the book falls apart by the end, leaving the reflective reader very disappointed. If only real life terrorists and mad scientists were this incompetent, we could all sleep safely at night."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is definitely the most realistic and accurate book by Tom Clancy.

Unfortunately this book does not measure up to the author's reputation. I became bored with the repeated rescue operations that seemed to contribute nothing more than weight to the book. In Mr. Clancy's previous books, it was clear that the long buildup to the conclusion would all come together in the end but also that the buildup/plot building had meaning and interest of its own. It is obvious that much of this book is filler that an intelligent reader is not going to appreciate. I am ashamed to admit it but I could not even finish it. I feel like a blasphemer."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, like his other books was a page turner. The main character, John Clark (also in Clear and Present Danger, Cardinal Kremlin, and Without Remorse),an ex-navy seal, is offered to head an international counter-terrorist agency centered in England. After agreeing to he finds himself in a web of hostal-terrorist and murderers. Each mission challenges him in a different way. Such as a swis bank robbery and a Hostage take over a large amusment park in France.

He has held on with these characters for the past few novels, but he falls woefully short in this story. The set up is classic Clancy with all of the story's pieces scattered about the world. Then as each chapter unfolds the story begins to take shape. The middle of the book again is classic Clancy. Gripping you and keeping you up all night. The end however, is lacking and not very imaginative. The reader is really let down in the last 100 pages. I suggest reading the first 600 pages and letting the rest go to your imagination. Again many terms that are sure to be lost on nonmilitary types. I've served and still struggle to catch all of the jargon. Tom consider a glossary."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"How does one critque an author in a class by himself? Rainbow Six is not as good as Executive Orders. But it is head, shoulders, and waist above most anything else out there. Uncharacteristic of Clancy this requires more tolerance of his characters.

Outstanding by any measure ... unless you compare it to other Clancy stuff."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I used to be a Clancy fan.This has changed with the last few novels. Way too much repetition. Rainbow Six has great action, a vaguely believeable plot (you have to try!) but could easily have been written with half as many trees!I saw another review which commented that descriptions were repeated - this is absolutely my impression as well. Please Tom, if you have described something already, give your readers the benefit of the doubt as to whether they will remember it! Some of the descriptions of plots/ people are word for word the same in multiple places in the book.Having said all that, I was vaguely entertained."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"&quot;They made me write it,&quot; or so Tom Clancy would seem to imply. Perhaps he is disinterested with his past style, or maybe this book fulfills a contract. Rainbow Six is analogous to Beethoven played on a Casio toy keyboard -- the talent is hidden somewhere, but the result is too mechanical to be enjoyed. Those who have read his other (very good) stories must, of course, read this superfluously opinionated sermon/novel. A word of caution: be prepared to bulldoze your way through every tedious, exhausting minute of seemingly never-ending verbiage. As a die-hard fan waiting with sweaty palms, this book was most disappointing and irritating.Rainbow Six belongs at the grocery store next to the &quot;Bran Flakes,&quot; with a stark white cover displaying in large, black letters only the word &quot;CLANCY.&quot;"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is really a great thriller if you havent read Clancy's other work.

Highly recommend!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"With this overly long book, Tom Clancy is opening the door for other thriller writers to gain the prominence they deserve. I personally prefer to read writers who have some background in what they write about, not those who invent everything. Stephen Coonts is a former combat pilot who knows whereof he writes. Bob Mayer, whether writing under his own name or the pen names Joe Dalton and Bob McGuire, is a former Green Beret who has a bunch of very good books out there begging to be read. Check them out."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy was at his best in Red Storm Rising, Red October, and Clear and Present Danger because his plots were bold but plausible. That's not the case with this book. His notion that a small group of environmentalists would seek to destroy the human population of earth to protect the animals is illogical, impossible, and ludicrous. The conservative Clancy is trying to pose a threat (which doesn't exist) from the &quot;greens&quot; to validate his right-wing paranoia. Stick to subs and tanks, Tom."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"For the past 4 years I've been playing the string of games that bear Tom Clancy's name. Rainbow Six. At the time I had no clue he was really a well established author and one day saw Rainbow Six in a Chapters and realised that the game wasn't based \\"loosely\\" on the book, it WAS the book. So I bought it.It was everything I'd ever wanted in a novel. Gripping action that the way Tom Clancy describes it, makes you feel like you're actually holding the HK5, looking down the sight, and popping a terrorist with 3 suppressed shots. Whats even better is how he builds it up so well, slowly, preparing you with tiny bits of information that you dont really piece together until just before hell is unleashed.Since then I've read Hunt for Red October, the best novel ever, Sum of All Fears, Debt of Honour, Executive Orders and the Bear and the Dragon, all of which I recommend highly - but only if you like fast paced action and books that you absolutely cant put down."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is far out but the plot is excecuted brilliantly. It is a mix of terrorism and the organisation that battle it and a deadly virus spread over the world so earth and the animals will survive. If its action you want, this is tom clancy at his thrilling best. His knowledge of guns and technology, organisations and countries, and psychology and ideolgy is breathtaking.A word of warning for Clancy lovers. Rainbow six is very different from his other work in the Jack Ryan series but you will be happy to know that John Clark, Ding Chavez, Oso Vega, Ed Foley and Dan murray appear in Tom Clancy's most thrilling book. This book is my all time favourite and for poeple who liked this book, I recommend Ice Station, Temple and Area 7 all from Matthew Reilly."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"CIA blackops John Clark creates and leads an international anti-terrorist team that has the capability to enter any country's borders. Despite its rather outrageous Hollywood-style plot (no spoilers), the charm here is how Clancy pulls this plot off and not be silly in a realistic frame of mind. The book doesn't suffer and bog down from the heavy technical details usually criticized against Clancy's previous books Sum of All Fears and Debt of Honor. It's actually relatively easier to read than Sum despite its near 900 page count. I can't help thinking that this book is somehow Clancy's way of giving the middle finger on groups like PETA and Greenpeace. It's not because he disagrees with the philosophy of caring for your planet and animals, it's the priority and hipocrisy these people sometimes display. This issue is seen through one of the major characters in the book, the ex-KGB spy Popov. I must say he is the most interesting character in the book and I can relate to him in many ways. The rescue operations conducted by Rainbow Six in this book are still possible scenarios. Someone in the past here criticized these scenarios as being so '70's era. I must disagree, just early this year, there've been at least 2 airline hijacking. It's also a continuing problem in my country. This book to me serves as a certain appeasement for revenge. This feeling is also evident in the good guys in this book. So, I would have to say this feeling certainly is not corny."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Action. Excitement. This book has it all. This book is about a group called Rainbow. Rainbow is a group that stops terrorists and rescue hostages. The members in Rainbow are highly trained and come from all over the world. This book has a lot of action and is very exciting. The detail in this book is amazing and makes you feel like you are in the book. All of these things make this book very interesting and good. This story also has a very well written plot. The book takes you on very realistic missions that will excite you. All of these things make this book one of the best I have read in years. I enjoyed this book and I think other people will enjoy it too. I would recommend this book to people that enjoy action books, because I believe that this book is very exciting and action packed."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"1/26/05Rainbow SixTom ClancyPutnam booksDo you like stories that are peaceful and quiet, or maybe romantic and happy? If so don't read Rainbow Six. Rainbow Six is an action packed contemporary fiction adventure story with great character and setting development. This book follows an antiterrorist team called rainbow. The book follows them through five different missions four of which are hostage situations. But they also have a war of wits with an ex-KGB man named Popov who arranges terrorist operations for his boss. Rainbow six has non stop action, suspense, and insight into the criminal mind.Rainbow Six takes place in many locations,but most of the time is spent in England usually london, and in New York, Washington D.C., Kansas, Chicago and other places in the USA. They also have missions in Germany, Austria, and Spain. All of these places are described extremely well.There are many characters in this book, all of which are described very well in this book. John Clark and Domingo Chavez are the main characters in this book. John Clark is the leader of Rainbow team but he doesn't actually go into the field but he really wants to, and his son in law Domingo Chavez is the team two leader along with Peter Covington who is the team one leader. Also there is Popov who sets up terrorist operations for someone who shall remain nameless for story's sake. And there is John Killgore who is an environmentalist extremist who values other animal likfe over human life, Carol Brightling who is the president's science advisor and John Brightling who is Carol Brightlings ex-husband and enviormentalist.I thought that this was a good book for many reasons. One thing is that it kept my interest throughout the story, also it wasn't boring at any time. I thought the book had really good character and setting development, because I could picture everything down to the last detail. Also it had really good plot development.Overall I would give this book four out of five stars, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes suspense and action packed contemporary fiction stories."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"\\"Rainbow Six\\" is an excellent book for one main reason: it accurately captures the ideological and religious core of the environmental movement.Clancy is the first popular novelist to accurately capture the eco-fascism and hatred for all humans at the core of the green religion. The quotes at the end of this review are often reflected in the paraphrased statements used in the book. The lack of true science behind the environmental 'scare of the month' is also realistically captured throughout the book.What comes through again and again in the book, especially in the ruminations by Popov, probably the most interesting character, is the all too true similarity of the Green movement to the Red (Communist) and Brown (Fascist) parties. Understanding this enables one to fully appreciate both the irony, and the appropriateness, of Popov's critical actions in the last half of the book. (Popov is a former KGB agent). That makes for some real page-turning reading. Interesting also is the very real threat to national security that the eco-'true believers' pose when they are appointed to political posts. If humans no longer matter, why should we try to protect them?For those who consider Clancy's plot too extreme a dose of reality is reflected in these quotes from the eco-extremists themselves:\\"If I were reincarnated, I would wish to be returned to Earth as a killer virus to lower human population levels.\\"Prince Phillip, World Wildlife FundIn a 1994 UNESCO publication Jacques Cousteau stated: \\"It's terrible to have to say this. World population must be stabilized and to do that we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. This is so horrible to contemplate that we shouldn't even say it.\\"\\"In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill,\\" declared members of the Club of Rome in a sweeping 1991 report on global governance.\\" All these dangers are caused by human intervention.... The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.\\""},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What can be said about Tom Clancy and any of his novels other than, he knows his stuff. \\"Rainbow Six\\" is a pure page turner, no if's, ands or buts about it. As most Clancy reader's know, John Clark is a well developed character in the \\"Ryanverse\\" to include \\"Without Remorse,\\" which gives his back story. \\"Rainbow Six\\" puts him in a more modern spotlight. I read this masterpiece not long after it came out, however, on that tragic day of September 11, 2001 this and a couple other of Clancy's novels were what I thought of. It's literally very unfortunate we don't have these heroe's out there watching our collective backs! Hopefully for us, the bad guys of the world have never heard of Tom Clancy, for they might get a play book for terrorism.From the first page to the last this novel, like his other novels, is purely enthralling and you will hardly be able to put it down. Even if you've never read a Clancy novel before, pick this up if you're looking for pure intrigue, thrilling action and a few good laugh's along the way. A huge thank you to the Author for this one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What a page skipper. With the exception of the Op-Center series I have absolutely loved everything previously written by Tom Clancy. This book, however, is contrived, poorly researched and too long, with hero characters that you eventually wish would get shot. It also seems that once Mr. Clancy has written a paragraph he likes, he will slightly re-word it and use it several more time throughout the book. It was written more like a serialized novel where he revisits the same information over and over in case the reader was too stupid to remember it from 30 or 40 pages earlier. I found myself not just skimming but fanning past entire chapters that had little or no relevance to the plot line."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm certainly gonna become a tree-hugger, as Mr Clancy calls conservationnists. Indeed, it really is a shame to grow and fall trees in order to print his latest novel. Mr Clancy's writings get more voluminous every time. However there is a difference between volume and quality.There is in fact no suspense at all. It is a very linear story. That combined with the size of the book (900 + pages) makes it a real bore.Too many considerations about what manhood is, as if we had awaited Mr Clancy to think about it.

When ever someone mentions the word Clancy, images of Harrison Ford (and Alec Baldwin [Hunt for Red October] immediately come to mind. I have always thought that John Clark was an dark, brooding and very interesting character who has realized that today's bad guy has evolved into something horrific and the only to beat the bad guy at his own game is to fight like him.I liked this novel, it has everything that is needs, a good hero, great supporting characters, and wonderful dialoge.

Perhaps the 4 or 5 novels by Clancy-wanna-be authors I've read in the meantime have effected my perspective. Simply put, no-one comes close to Clancy in this narrow action genre. RAINBOW SIX may not be quite the equivalent of WITHOUT REMORE or EXECUTIVE ORDERS, but it is miles ahead of anything written by the copy-cats. In RAINBOW SIX Clancy added a new element, a mysterious conspiracy. The action sequences alternate with the unveiling of the mystery. Unfortunately, much of the mystery plot is implausible. Readers thus rush through the action and character-development sequences, not fully appreciating them, to get to the mystery sequences, which are ultimately unsatisfying. As a result, readers are disappointed with the entire experience. The action sequences and character development, are good by Clancy standards, terrific by comparison with anything else in the genre.As to plausibility, as one of the creators of the very first Earth Day, I do not find the fanatic environmentalists in any way implausible. I've known such people, intimately. The science too, is perfectly plausible. It is other, relatively irrelevant, plot elements which are implausible."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"For the most part it was a pretty good book, but was way to involved.

The action sequences make up for an un-Clancyish plot (most of his other books could happen in real life).

The first few he wrote, including the Jack Ryan series, were an enjoyable read by an author who knew what he was talking about. In Rainbow 6 however, while he still knows what he's talking about (the research is evident), it hasn't got the pure feel of his earlier work, which were based much more closely with experiences and machines he knew about. The book is 300 pages too long, and constantly, and I mean constantly repeats itself. (maybe he bypassed an editor). On the plus side his characters are strong, and none stronger than our old mate John Clark, whose adventures and experiences are as familiar to readers as those of Jack Ryan, and the storyline itself is excellent, if far reaching. i.e. the main bad guys have the biggest mouths and the worst security you could possible imagine, and if troops and their families at Hereford could be attacked that easily I would be very surprised. Take us back to the Navy Tom, to the subs we loved so well."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you're looking for another Clancy book on par with &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, or &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; you're going to be somewhat disapointed.

While the book has enough of the typical &quot;techno-thriller&quot; wizardry to satisfy readers in that respect on gets the impression that the plot becomes the vehicle for Clancy to strut his knowledge of cool toys, and historical trivia. The upshot being, that you never have to doubt the top-notch quality of his research.However the sizzling plot twists that made books like Kremlin, and the wonderful sparkling characters that populated those books are noticiably absent. I think that Clancy is trying to delay the inevitable conclusion of the Jack Ryan series of books, and the overextension shows. Perhaps the distractions of all of the franchise (OP-Center) etc series has something to do with the quality of the book. Maybe this one's just a dud, albeit an interesting and plausible plot basis (bio-tech/large corporation run amuk) is if nothing else an interesting if somewhat paranoid notion. At any rate it made for an interesting distraction for a long plane ride, but I wouldn't lose any sleep staying up to read this one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow 6 is okay.Positives:-Clancy is masterful at describing the Rainbow team's actions in the field.Negatives:-The book is way too long. So many of the chapters felt like unnecessary filler. Clancy spends way too much time with the people testing the virus on the kidnapping victims in the lab. We get it, the Shiva is a killer virus. We don't need a chapter devoted to every single time a patient coughs.-Clancy has no idea how normal humans interact. The conversation scenes between Domingo and his wife are painful to read. Steve Seagal movies have more natural sounding dialogue.-Rainbow troopers are too much like super heroes that can never be harmed. Every mission goes perfectly. Every shot is hit. The bad guys are all bumbling idiots. The only time they ever took a punch was when the Irish terrorists basically ambushed them. Besides that brief moment they were 100% successful at every single task."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy spends to much time talking about the philosophical points of situations. The story drags along for a lot of the book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six, he indulges in small unit tactics for a whole tome. In many ways typical Tom Clancy, the book is instructive at a layman level about anti-terrorist tactics as practiced by special forces units. I have little doubt that the usual level of research went into this book that Mr Clancy usually carries out. I admit to being an unabashed fan.So why not five stars?Well, to be honest, nothing ever goes wrong for these guys. The books continuously alludes to the virtual certainty of problems with operations, but then nothing really does. I kept waiting for the problem and the subsequent analysis, but it never happened. I realized that, among the other obvious things that I like about Clancy, the recognition of the failings that people have and the way these play out on a broad stage are much of what I enjoy about his books. This one doesn't really have that."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The multi column view does not work with this particular book.I've never encounter same problem with all other Kindle books, including ones from same pulisher.How come?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was a simply written and enjoyable book. I enjoyed the easy nature of the read, the intrigue of the secrecy of the unit involved, and the concepts Tom Clancy puts down."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Like the title says, this book is probaly great if you're familiar with the characters in his other books. Clancy is a good writer, he's not new to writing books so expect something that's going to flow well if you're going to buy this book. The idea of the book is cool: a dream team of special forces guys from all over the world.Ding Chavez seemed a little mechanical to me at times, but I guess he's a military guy so that's how they're supposed to be."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I love this book, and looking back, I appreciate it even more as it was written before 9/11 and yet has the same \\"feel\\". This, and Without Remorse, are my two favorite Clancy novels. Okay, Red Storm Rising too. This book has intelligent and realistic scenarios that keep the reader interested and excited cover to cover. Definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy's \\"Rainbow Six\\" is a fun action-filled novel that follows the characters who make up a newly formed international counter-terror organization called Rainbow. There's plenty of character development throughout the book which focuses mainly on Rainbow leader John Clark, one of his lead soldiers Domingo \\"Ding\\" Chavez, a former KGB agent named Popov, and Popov's employers who lead a secret nature-saving organization known as \\"The Project.\\" Clancy does a great job articulating the plot in this long story. He doesn't give away too much information too early; only a little bit at a time keeping his readers guessing until the story nears its climax.The Rainbow group embarks on quite a few counter-terror missions which, to their surprise, all occur within a rather short period of time. These missions, as well as the story's opening scene, are real entertaining to read because of the great way Clancy handles the action and suspense, and it makes this book feel a lot shorter than 900 pages. However, some of the chapters between these events progress too slowly, mainly because of the excessive detail Clancy sometimes uses in his narration when describing what certain characters are doing or thinking or feeling and when describing some of the weapons and technology being used. Those chapters made the book feel like it was at least 900 pages long.There were times when the dialogue was rather stilted and there was also a plot element at the very end of the story that seemed a little absurd to me, but overall \\"Rainbow Six\\" is a fun book to read. I was hesitant at first to read it because of its length, but I ended up really enjoying it for the most part. It's not perfect, but there's some solid character development that enhances the story, and there's also a lot of action and suspense that makes it a quality page-turner."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I started reading Clancy with his first book and always look forward to his new ones........I can see why he keeps being OBE [Overcome by events]. So sorry....."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Loved the book on CD. Tom is the best. I've never played the video game, now I want to do so!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is one of the worst written books I've ever read. The author keeps describing the same thing over and over again, and he forgets what he wrote. At one point one captured terrorist says something in a taped confession, but it takes a few hundred pages to another terrorist say the same thing and that be received as a total surprise. It looks like the author is paid by the page, and has no time or will to think. Keep away from it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I haven't read a clancy novel since Patriot Games, now i know why. How many times can we hear the same one dimensional characters mouth or think the same monotonous drivel? This book is plotted at the level of a nintendo game, first mission; handle the hijacking on the plane, second mission; handle the terrorists at the bank; third mission etc... Clancy fails utterly to invoke any depth into his characters. The bad guys (which are referred to as &quot;bad guys&quot; about 500 times in this massive pile of crap) are consistently the same self-deceived zealots, time after time, and the good guys after killing the bad guys move into the same self satisfying passages of supposed reflection. His portrayal of environmentalism and environmentalists is a pathetic and transparent attempt to vilify politics and ideology he clearly has no understanding of, merely to serve as the punching bag for his own right-wing longwinded philosophy. I can't believe i read this junk."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has finally done it. After a long and illustrious career of writing techno-thrillers that I have enjoyed, he has finally produced a major snafu. I have been a fan of Clancy's book for the past 16 years and finally decided I have had enough.Clancy's characters are so wooden that they must have carved out while the tree is still standing. His apparent bias on Team 1 success is so blatant such that when the only time Team 2 led by UK based Covington was in action, the team got plastered.The killing of a hostage was glossed over and justified by the team as &quot;she's going to die anyway&quot; despite the obvious fact that it was an action prompted by the team's psychologist decision to push the terrorist. How obscene.Clancy obviously needs new material because repetition is getting obvious as you go through the book. I simply couldn't wait to finish so that I could recycle the book and save some trees. A complete waste of time."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"We have a saying down hyar in East Tennessee regarding efforts that just aren't up to expectations: &quot;That dog just won't hunt&quot;. And, I believe that phrase can be applied to Tom Clancy's derivative &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;. I found the novel to be an unenjoyable read that was plodding, preachy, and utterly predictable. I won't be so quick in the future to plop down good money to buy a Clancy effort. As with all of TC's latest efforts, this baby is a long one at some 700 pages - and after wading through some of it, you find yourself wishing that the author's editors had exercised more control over the effort. Or, does TC have an agreement with the publisher where he's paid by the pound? The novel so beats to death some already beaten to death themes of Clancy's universe (evil environmentalists, crudely drawn liberal politicians, terrorist bioweapons, Good(ie 'whitelike')Minorities, Bad Minorities, and Stalwart NRA Poster-Children Men With Guns) that you wish he'd just get on with it. The novels of Mr Clancy's recent output have had Simple GoodMan (More Republican than Thou) Jack Ryan dealing with all of our post cold-war bugbears: the Middle East, Japan, Resurgent Iran. In this novel, he deals with rampant, uncontrolled environmentalists who are so cartoonish and as one-dimensional as the Good Guys (who don't believe in all that global warming stuff) that the whole 'conflict' comes off as contrived. Tom: don't preach, just tell a good story like &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; or &quot;Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot;. And, of course, you know who's going to win-that is, if you've read any Clancy in the past. I got the novel thinking that it was going to be a military themed work where his command of military technospeak and his sketchy characters work best (the US vs the PRC over Taiwan: a logical follow-on to Consecutive Odors). Instead, I found a tedious rehashing of old themes, preachy right-of-Phil Gramm political diatribes, and just too many pages to wade through for the predictable pay-off. Sorta reminded me of a first draft of what would become &quot;Exec...&quot; but was altered a little, inflated, and served up so Mr. Clancy could earn enough money to bid on another NFL team. And, if anybody's interested: I have a 10 year military background (Army and Air Force) and consider myself a liberal (thinking) Republican."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is a novel that may be worth more in the second edition -- after Clancy and the publishers hire an editor. References to a &quot;Kansas tornado&quot; twice in 20 pages; using the idiom &quot;faster than zipping your fly&quot; more than three times; referring to a character as both &quot;Tim&quot; and &quot;Tom&quot; in the same paragraph. Not to mention all of the completely ridiculous military and medical errors in fact. I actually started hiliting errors until my pen ran out of ink. You'd think an 800-page book would have rich character development and meticulous detail. All it had was glib references and redundancies. Tom, I know you needed this one done in a hurry, but you owe me $30. I would, however, like to thank you for giving me strong forearms and biceps. That's about all I got from what was far and away your worst book ever. I hope you're as embarrassed about writing it as I am about reading it cover to cover. One bad one in ten isn't a bad average. If you're planning on making it up on your next one, that's great. If not, then please, don't bother sullying your once-impeccable reputation."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I used to love Tom Clancy. Granted he is no John Irving but his stories were fun and well told. But this book is a drudge. I've grown tired of the mutual admiration society the characters are mired in. And everything is just too simple. There is no gray area, just right and wrong. And the conservative political agenda sticks out a little too far for me. Clive Cussler lost me with that book where he and Giordino trudge through the desert (Sahara?). His shallow characterization and endless macho themes finally turned me off. I shall never read another Cussler. Rainbow Six challenges Cussler for emptiness and will be the last Clancy I ever read unless he regains his old fire."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The book came in great condition. Fast Ship! It was a present for my boyfriend, he loved it and enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Liked it a lot! I enjoy all the Jack Ryan novels. I also like all the \\"Six\\" characters.More to come I hope!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"A great book, good voice acting (not the best). I converted to MP3 and it works on iPod and other MP3 devices. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"as expected from Clancey, a spell binding page turner. looking forward to the next one. and reading my first book on a Kindle was a treat."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"As usual, I rushed right out to buy the latest work from Tom Clancy. While I am not totally disappointed, I do long for the 1980's when Clancy was at his best.In past works, I've found myself suffering from sleep deprivation in order to finish Clancy's page-turners. The last two books have taken me much longer to finish.While the basic premise of Rainbow Six is a solid idea, the well worn Ebola plot just didn't catch on. Compared to the nuclear terrorist plot in The Sum of All Fears, this one just didn't wash.I realize that with the end of the Cold War, Mr. Clancy's available subject matter has become limited. There are other dangers out there. Perhaps with a little more time and less ancillary work, like OpCenter, (Harry Hamlin as the protagonist runied any hope for this series), he will come back with more fulfilling work.I agree that the book will probably go over well as a movie as long as they stick to the early anti-terrorist action, especially since the movies bare little resemblance to the original works anyway. One word of advice to the screenplay writers: leave the eco-terrorist wackos out of it. It'll take too long to develop and won't go over anyway!If you collect Clancy's books, by all means, buy it. Otherwise, wait for the library's copy or the paperback."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I liked it up until the final confrontation where the team used some completely unrealistic &quot;magic&quot; technology to defeat the bad guys without any kind of difficulty. It was rather anti-climactic and destroyed the story."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I rather enjoyed Rainbow Six. As I was reading it though I was wondering if it had been proof read by anyone. There were several typos, but I can live with that. The seen when the hospital is under attack the terrorists announce that they have Mrs. Clark and Dr. SANCHEZ. How can that get by? I wondered about it for several pages.I am looking forward to the next book and highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Like many of the other reviewers on this page, I have read virtually all of Clancy's books. His early books were excellent reads but a few of his more recent efforts seemed overblown. This latest is the best in some time. Terrorism is unfortunately a timely subject and the Rainbow Six concept is out of today's headlines. There is an unreal sense of fabulous success in the missions but this is fiction. As for the subplot, think off it as poetic license, dispense with reality for a few hours and enjoy the patriotic and heroic acts of Rainbow Six."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Clancy has again come up with a truly believable scenario for evil vs the rest of us. I really like the solution to the problem posed for extremest environmentalists.Furthermore, the plot raises some questions we all should ponder about our relationship to environment."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Mr. Clancy's previous two books Debt of Honor and Executive Orders were excellent. This time, however, Mr. Clancy was obviously preoccupied during the writing of this book -- a divorce, an attempt to buy the Minnesota Vikings. This book would have benefited from some serious editing. The 740 page book should, by rights, be about 500 pages long. The excess is constant repetition. If I had to listen one more time to the summary of the bad guys' plan of action, I would have screamed. If I had to hear one more character say one more time that someone has &quot;been there and done that&quot; or any of another dozen cliches, I would have puked. Clancy's strength is drawing up an exciting plot. His weakness is trying to present interior monologues from his characters. He should concentrate on the plot and give up the monologues -- they are so boring. As for the plot, he is starting to rehash old ones."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"To put it simply Tom Clancy latest offering is just plain bad. Rainbox Six is basically an international version of Tom Clancy's Op-Center. The over all plot is totally unbelievable and something that you would expect from a James Bond movie, which one of the main character points out when after discovering the villians plans says &quot;Who thought this up - Spectre?&quot;. Along with the ridiculous plot the villians in this book have the brains of Willie Coyote in a Warner Brothers cartoon. I am rating this book at 1 star only because I can not rate it any lower. My advice is not to by this book but go back and re-read any of Tom Clancy's previous novels."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"OK, let's start with what was right. Once again, Clancy's eye for detail carried the book. The detail in the action sequences was up to his usual standard, and the book didn't drag in getting started.The concept, was OK, although he'd done bio-warfare once already, you can only find so many Big Bad Threats. I can accept that.However Clancy's politics were overpowering. A good author should be like a teacher. You know their politics are there, and if you think about it, you can see them, but the points are subtle and don't require hitting you over the head.Come on Clancy, give your readers some credit for an IQ larger then our shoe size. We handled Hunt for Red October, we don't need to be spoon fed the point!Additionally, it's not neccesary to write ONLY about Clark or ONLY about Ryan, you can include them both in a novel successfully."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This one's in the upper 87 percent of Tom Clancy's books.Althought I missed seeing a lot of Navy action in this one, there's another excellent mind-tweak as the plots come together!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Unlike most other Tom Clancy books, this one is not well researched nor well thought out. The plot is almost regurgetated from part of his last book. He is extremely redundant throughout the book - he repeats parts of the plot so many times you cant help but skim though portions of the text. Usually Clancy is dead nut's on technical accuracy. This time however, some of the technical aspects of the book are pure fantasy - ridiculously so. Is it a good book? Well its fair as books go, but its well below par for Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tree Hugger terrorists out to distroy the human race - what a great idea! 800 pages on Mr. C and Ding - about time. A thoughorly enjoyable read. Another classic from the Master. Holywood where are you make a movie of Rainbow Six and Executive Orders."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The only reason I was anxious to end my vacation was because I knew a copy of Clancy's Rainbow Six would be waiting for me when I got home. (I had ordered it via my book club) I knew I was hooked when, on the first night of reading it, I couldn't put it down! Being caught up with familiar characters is like running into old friends, even family. Although Clancy isn't strong on emotional involvement between the characters and the reader, this book pulls you in, because you feel you &quot;know&quot; these people. Can't wait to finish......"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Looks like Clancy and his editors were rushing to get this one out the door. Numerous editing errors (e.g. Clark leaves his house twice (pp. 25/26)). Lots of repetition-how many times do we need to read the same graphic description of someone getting shot in the head or the number of shots that each character fires with their silenced weapons? No real climax, it just withers (meanders) away to a predictable ending after the hospital scene. And what mysterious disappearance at the end of the book? The Gulfstream pilots knew where they were...Tom, we expect better."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"A breathtaking story, well written- vintage Clancy. His depth of character development and continuity across momentus novels is as if you are catching up on the lives of old friends and new. A true page turner- I regret finishing it so quckly. An addictive imaginative drug- well done!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Tom Clancy did his usual job of entertaining us with this techno-thriller but his characters are all so perfect,that they do not come across as believable. It seemed that Clancy loves his main characters so much that their aura of invincibility was never seriously threatened- this makes for an uninvolved combat narration because you know that the bad guys are doomed even before the entire sequence is played out. Extremist groups for the environment are a tiny minority and Clancy chooses to put nature conservation ( which should concern us all ) in a very bad light- no doubt reflecting his very narrow minded view of the World according to Clancy."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I see Bruce Willis as the mature but still lethal John Clark, Lou Diamond Phillips as Chavez. Lets add for awesomeness, Wesley Snipes, Don Chetle, Matt Damon/ Tom Sizemore, Kevin Spacey and we have the makings of a serious Rainbow force. Those who think that this book was the first time Mr Clancy has written his political views obviously need to read the other books a little more closely. This book along with Executive Order, just hits closer to home and discusses issues that are smacking us in the face daily. Mr Clancy continue your commentaries and educate those willing to learn. I for one appreciate reading about the good guys winning over the nut cases out there. Life is not black and white. Keep pressing the point and maybe a few more folks will &quot;get it&quot;."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Not one of Clancy's best. The plot is like something out of a 60's bond movie and the writing lacks his usual depth. Wait for it to come out in paperback."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I would rather have given it a 2 and a half but it just wasn't possible. I hate to say it, but I wonder if Tom Clancy is losing his touch. I really do love his writing having read all his novels and a few of his non-fiction. Maybe it is the fact that he is writing in a time that has not yet come, but it seems that hs past few books (baring Without Remorse) have been lacking in his original flair.I still enjoyed reading it eventhough I could actually predict accurately what was going to happen. Like many others have commented the first part of the book was the best part, and after that it just got a little &quot;old.&quot;As for those that gave it five stars I would really like to know why. I could see it getting 4 but 5 seems a bit much. Those who gave it a 5 I must wonder about how much writing background they have. The book is quite entertaining but is lacking the character deapth, plot thickness and unpredictability that has been a benchmark of Clancy's.I look forward to his next book and hope it will be better."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"If you are a Clancy fan, you will not be disappointed. I won't go into details or give away the plot. If you enjoyed &quot;Without Remorse&quot;, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Great Clancey until end of Amusement Park Episode. After that....well, how frustating is it to watch a top-notch ex-KGB officer, who always does his cultural research, take an incredable amount of time to uncover an eco-terrorism plot? (only explanation: Popov did'nt read or watch enough James Bond during his training). The only thing missing was that Dr. Kilgore was'nt sitting in a stratolounger, viewing multiple blinking lights and petting his cat! Clancy was at his best at describing an e-attack on our financial markets in &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; . . . Unfortnately, he cant &quot;get real&quot; with this plot. Read it until the amusement park incident is resolved, then put it on the book shelf and wait for TC to re-evaluate his plots and return to greatness. This one's little more than a made-for-TV movie, presented in poorly edited print."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is very interesting and has a great plot and interesting characters, I would reccomend this book to anyone whom likes Tom Clancy books because it is truly a classic."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"My god, this is a great book. Once I got past page 100 i couldn't put it down. THis was the first military book i've ever read, and I want to read another! Clancy really wrote so you would route for Rainbow group."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I personaly think that Tom Clancey has written another action/adventure masterpiece."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I found myself hoping that several of the &quot;enemy&quot; missions were far too incompetent. I felt that the Rainbow team was no challenged enough after the various terrorist scenes. They always ended up fairing well. For example, there were only a few injuries suffered by the 1st team during the hospital scene. Those injuries were only on undeveloped characters in the novel, not signifcants characters like Chavez's or Clark's wife. I wanted the terrorists to succeed more than the Rainbow team. I quit after that scene."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was my second attempt at reading Clancy and it will be my last. I've read thru boring, repetitive, slow, drawn out submarine chases in &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; awhile back and thought maybe this would be an improvement but no such luck. This book is just a slow and drawn out and wordy. After drudging thru 500 pages the plot finally starts to unfold and makes sense but it's still disjointed. The other pieces unfold after another 100 or so.What's worse is that he's not even a great story teller. He definitely knows his stuff, I give him credit for that, but when it's overdone it becomes banal so how interesting can that be to read. You might as well read an encyclopedia."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Undoubtedly, this is certainly one of Clancy's most fast-paced and thrilling novels, his best since THE SUM OF ALL FEARS and RED STORM RISING! Unlike EXEC ORDERS, this one does not get bogged down in unnecessary subplots which go nowhere. This one concentrates on John Clark, who heads an international anti-terrorist elite force codenamed RAINBOW. Clark's call sign is RAINBOW SIX, hence the title. The RAINBOW teams are based in England. Anyway, there's three terrorist incidents in Europe the team is called to, a Russian agent shows an interest, and then we come across a group of eco-nazis who have planned the biggest mass murder in history to further their selfish causes . . . I won't tell you the ending but I guarantee it'll make you laugh out loud as the bad guys and gals got what they deserved! The military action comes thick and fast, there are some interesting methods of elite forces training and some awesome gadgets(the people-finder is quite feasible). It may not be as accurate as the portrayal of the SAS by writers such as Gordon Stevens, and the true-life stories such as BRAVO TWO ZERO, or a Bob Mayer novel, but it's such a thrilling ride you cannot help but be swept along by the intrigue. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I just want to say to all those commenting on their opposing views to read on what I have to say. I know a lot of you do not like this book and I can understand some of your reasons and other ones are clouded and sometimes not even stated. I just finished reading &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; and think that even though it isn't one of Clancy's best, it shouldn't be used as a firestarter. You people are tearing this book up on these posts and almost never giving good reasons. Give Tom Clancy a break people, he is going through tough times and trying to live up to our expectations. If you don't like the book then don't put crap on these posts about a page long about how much you hate Clancy for writing this book. If you are true fans then show it, it is the readers that we are posting for. If you have to say &quot;don't buy this book&quot; or say &quot;buy this book&quot; then make your reasons clear. If you don't then the purpose of these reviews is gone and it just sounds like pure opinion. So please people, every writers' books will never meet everyone's expectations so give Clancy a break, calm down, and act responsably."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am in the military and a conservative. I liked this book. People seem to be really polarized on this one and that doesnt surprise me. If you are a liberal you probably wont like it but are you really surprised. Books about the military arent exactly liberal fare anyway. Also, to those who dont like all the technical stuff and complain about the novels length, there are other authors out there for you. Somebody has to cater to those of us who like our action realistic, full of details, and long. By the way, speaking of realism, this book has some rather grave errors in that department which is rather uncharacteristic of Clancy. These have been fairly well documented in previous reviews so I wont go into them in detail but mainly they have to do with language errors with a few technical errors thrown in. Those errors are the only reason I cant give this book 5 stars. Most of the other bad reviews given about this book seem to be from foreigners who hate the U.S. or the military or both and also environmentalists who seem to feel that they were slammed in this book. If you like technothrillers and if you like Clancy you I urge you to try this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Well I hate to say this, but the companion computer game that followed the release of the book held my intrest and kept suspense more than this 800 page flatliner from Tom Clancy. The book focuses on an international anti-terrorist team that gets caught up in a corporate conspiracy to destroy the world in the name of Nature. The characters were dull and boring and, unlike Clancy's previous work, the book didn't seem to keep much suspense. The way he tackled the pending doom of the planet seemed dull and unimportant. The weight of man's power to justify his own actions as the right ones seemed to be lost. The characters of John Clark and Ding Chavez seem grosely macho and had that I-embody-every-virtue type feel to them. It almost seemed like I was reading a pamphlet praising the army, like military propoganda. By the time I reached page 500 I was ready to throw it aside but found the will to finish it only because I wanted the sense of accomplishment. In the end, Clancy brings up a chilling concept that seems real and devistatingly possible but destroys it by not examining the other sides of the fanaticism that is quelled by the Rainbow team. I'd say this is an easy one to skip and definatly not up to the standards of a decent Clancy read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors. I had the misfortune of selecting Clancy's new book for review. I can't tell you what a let down it was. The characters are weak, redundant, and have too much irrelevant background information. The plot is boring, twisted, and has unresolved issues at the end. The length of the book is a mystery as any amateur editor would have cut 35 to 50 percent of it out and thrown it in the trash can. It seems like he took pieces from his previous books and tried to change the plot and characters to fit. Not one of seven writers who reviewed the book liked it. I read the first 100 reviews and realize some fans would like reading Tom's grocery list and would give it 5 stars. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Also The Notebook is excellent. Also see 'No Safe Place' by Patterson and Blood Work by Connelly. There is a reason this book went from number 1 to the 40s on the NYT Best Seller list in under two months."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Before I even knew of the existence of this book, I was a huge fan of the Video Game series. Wanting to read a good Video Game tie-in book, I read this. This was by FAR one of the best books I have ever read. This book got me interested in Tom Clancy's Novels, and I then read \\"Clear and Present Danger\\", another absolute winner, but not quite as good as Rainbow Six. If you like Special Ops or the game series at all, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Has anyone been able to find this in unabridged audio, I was about to purchase and realized it was abridged. ; ;"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK, ALTHOUGH IT COULD HAVE BEEN SHORTER. CERTAINLY, SCARY....A MUST READ IF YOU ARE A CLANCY FAN, OTHERWISE, READ HIS OTHERS FIRST."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It was too drawn out and too many subplots. Hard to keep all the characters in mind. Actually, if I hadn't read any of Vince Flynn's books, I might have been a little more excited about this book. I have read some other Clancy books and enjoyed them, but this one dragged on."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I had never read a Tom Clancy novel before \\"Rainbow Six\\", and this one left me wondering if I want to read another. It weighs in at 740 pages, but didn't need to be nearly that long.In college I had a film professor who told us \\"So what if it's long if the story takes a while to be told?\\" Well in this case there is a big story, but it really could have been told more concisively. Clancy takes several points and just beats them to death: okay, we get it that John Clark would rather be doing the soldier's duty then being in command, but he realizes he's too old. Okay, we get it that the Rainbow troops are the best at what they do and enjoy their equipment and enjoy their work, but understand that it's hard to feel good about killing people even if they bring it on themselves. Okay, we get it that the former KGB agent wants to understand why his employer is having him do all these weird things, but he can't figure it out. Okay, we get it that things have changed a lot for former Soviet spies since the end of the Cold War. These are just a few of the points that Clancy pounds into the reader's head with all the subtlety of a jackhammer.The last 250 pages were frankly rather dull, and if I hadn't been 2/3 of the way through I might have stopped reading it altogether. Clancy just seems determined to show everyone how much he knows about military hardware and philosophy, and after a while it borders on pretentious. The John Clark character didn't seem to me to be that fleshed out at all, which really surprised me. He seemed to get lost among everything else that was going on, which was disappointing.I chose to read this book because I like the game that was based on it (or is it the other way around?) Hopefully the rest of Clancy's library is more interesting than this bloated tome."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the first Tom Clancy book i read, and it is very good. There are countless good points about this book. There are so many characters, so many plot twists, and a good variety of aspects of this book. The action parts of the book is probably the best I have ever read. The story is expertly told and you could only guess of what the ending will be."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"NO - The Ultimate Bad Guys leave a lot to be desired - Environmentalists? Pa-lease!NO - Not a lot of characterisation, you have to read most of Clancy's previous novels for that - I recommend 'Without Remorse', 'Clear and Present Danger', 'Sum Of All Fears' and 'Debt of Honor'.NO - you will still enjoy this book even if you haven't read those previous ones.YES - It's FULL of action."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is one of Clancy's best works since 'The Hunt For Red October'. This novel starts out with a hijackers trying to hijack a plane! Now how great of a beginning is that?The story is about a black organization called you guessed it 'Rainbow'. It is set in London and it goes like this.John Clark is the leader of 'Rainbow', it would be best to read Tom Clancy's earlier novels to understand who John Clark is, and with him is his partner in crime Domingo Chavez and their wives Sandy Clark and Patsy Chavez. They are on their way to London to set up shop, but just when you suspect it, HIJACKERS are on the plane, and they of course try to hijack the plane.So with John and Ding come in, they then stop the hijacking and save the day.While they are on their way to London, extreme enviromentalist are working on a disease that is able to wipe out human existence forever! The diesease is called Shiva, their goal is to wipe out the human race to help save the enviroment from utter destruction. They test the virus on homeless people, and so far, things are going according to plan.John, Ding, and their wives make it to London safely, and just when they were setting up, they are on their first call. Two bank robbers holding hostages in Sweden. So Ding and his crew head to Sweden to see the scene, and of course they kill the bad guys, and they get the hostages. With one hostage killed, but the robbers did it to flex their muscle. Now the whole world see's this, and they are wondering 'who are these men in black doing all these jobs?'Of course it is a secret, and Rainbow does not really exists. The creation of Rainbow came from Jack Ryan, who is president, AND HATES IT!, to fight terrorism throughout the world.As the story moves on, a former KGB agent named Popvo see's Rainbow for the first time, and begins to wonder who is this group?Back at home, one of the cabinet members in the Ryan Administration HATES JACK RYAN because she does not agree with his enviromental plan. She of course is part of the plan with the extreme enviromentalists, and the same thing with a high commander in the Army.So as the attacks keep coming ranging from hostages being held in their own house by terrorist, and the event at the amusement park in Spain, John then thinks that there their must be a link between these events.Now terrorist are now forming to take over a hospital where Sandy and Patsy work at, Patsy is pregnant with their first child, and Ding is a person who is strong and represents a good role model for the Latino community. So they find out what is going on, they go in there and they get the terrorist who were hell bent on killing everyone inside.Now we head back to the doctors (or killers), one of their victims are in their trap, and now she is trying to get contact to the outside world, so she sneaks out of her room, she is intoxicated with Morphine, she then finds a computer with internet access, and e-mails her father about what is going on and she does not know where she is.The father is looking for her daughter, but when he gets the e-mail, he has hope now, but they cannot find where the e-mail was sent from.But something else is wrong too, the General from the Army is now going to plant the virus in the cooling system in the Olympics in the land down under. A employee see's something fishy and calls the cops. The General then dumps the plan, and they find the virus.Now Popvo comes back into the picture, and he meets up with some people who are working on the virus, he then finds out the truth on what is going on, he then makes a run for it, he then tells the government about what is going on, and now Rainbow comes into the picture. They then went to their headquarters in the American Plains, but it is deserted.It turns out that they are in South America, now as Ding and his crew come back to America, they get brief, and they are headed to Brazil in the Amazon rain forest. They get the killers, and they save the day.This is by far one of his best novels, and I just wish that Mr.Clancy would write more novels like this instead of bringing garbage out like The Bear And The Dragon, Red Rabbit, and The Teeth Of The Tiger.Great novel, and definitely a must read for any Tom Clancy fan out there."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Great read and easy to get into, but the whole concept is kind of hoaky.

Grabs you and doesn't let go. Realistic plot and action packed story.A must read."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The book of Rainbow 6, I do admit, is one of Clancy's best. It is very action packed and always gives gory details. It is perfect for kids. Did I say kids? I meant adults. The book has a whole lot of swearing and a little bit of sex. Like I said this book is very action packed but, it does have some boring parts, like after terriost incidents. Usally you'll have to wait 'bout 150 or more pages of tiny , tiny print.

The novel really tell us what it would be like to have an anti-terriost force made up by members from various countries special forces."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is absolutely awesome! It is full of heart-beating suspense throughout almost all the nine hundred pages. Two words describe it. ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING! Domingo Chavez is simply darn cool and the terrorists rock, especially Brightling. The plot was great. Don't screw it."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I would give this book 10 stars if they'd let me! Scary, action-packed, involving, addictive! Scary: Mr. Clancy is so convincing in depicting the baddies that he had me wonder if something like this couldn't really happen! Action-packed: I am playing the game (Rogue spear) and found myself reading every action scene three or four times in a row and I was jumping in my couch while I was reading them! Involving: The characters are so convincing you feel the story evolve with them. Addictive: I am having big trouble lifting my head from this book. Can't stop reading it! I'm addicted! WAY TO GO, TOM!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read a lot of books, but I'll have to say that this is one of the best I've ever read, but there were some minor problems that didn't bother me too much. One of them was the start of the book. It starts out really cool, but then it kinda goes no where for some time. Disjointed plot at times. Once you get further into the book, all the pieces start to fit the puzzle, and the book gets more exciting. I especially thought that the end was great. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes technology, weapons, and espionage all put together. I thought this book was so good (It was my first Tom Clancy book) that I became an instant fan of Mr. Clancy, and I have currently started another one of his books, RED STORM RISING."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Another drawn out Clancy thriller in which I had to wade through hundreds of pages in search of some thrills. I didn't find many. What's happened to Clancy's inspiration? Everything in this novel is recycled out of better books and movies. For a much better techno-thriller about genetic engineering and biological terrorism, check out Joseph Massucci's Code Alpha."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is a good story which is badly written and disastrously edited. The characters, whom we've met in previous Clancy works, are stunted; their dialogue stilted; and their emotions stereotypically trite. The book's cumbersome, redundant prose is peppered throughout with grammatical gaffes.A strong blue pencil might have debulked this book, rendered it more readable, and reduced its price to that of its better-edited peers.All-in-all, this is Tom Clancy's worst offering to date. He gets two stars for the story and none for the storytelling."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"What a McNovel. The same phrases and cliches were repeated several times (why do people complain about the food in England......have you tasted this bread?), the characters never develop, what a shallow piece of trash."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Although I have liked Clancy's other books, I was not able to finish Rainbow Six. There were far too many implausibilities in it, such as an elite international counter-terrorist team that forgets to include a helicopter and pilot on its roster and has to add them later, or a group of ultra-greens who decide to spread a genetically-engineered virus around without once considering what it might do to the animals they are so interested in saving. Skip this one and read Marcinko or Bob Mayer."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The bad guys simply aren't believable. While I won't deny there are fanatics who would like to do what the bad guys try here, someone sufficiently fanatical isn't also going to be a successful enough businessman to get into the position he was. Many of the criticisms I've read on here I don't think are valid, though. They weren't going around dropping hints, they mistakenly believed they were talking to a like-minded individual. A believable goof, not utter stupidity."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book was fun to read. It may not be the same style of book as past Clancy novels, but then who wants to reread The Hunt For Red October every time. The only possible reason I can see for all of the negative reviews is that some people probably agree with the enviromental wackos in this book and had their feelings hurt because they were the bad guys."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I want a discount on a future Clancy for finishing this one. Too many scenes at the firing range. Too many undefined acronyms. Too many reminders of what happened in earlier chapters. An incredibly insulting ending. I chalk it up to author arrogance. A victim of his success. I hope he gets a wake up call from his publisher and rebounds with something worthwhile."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"An expert on military matters, and a master of technothriller novels, Tom Clancy has once again provided us with an in depth and riveting look at the military world, this time taking us again into the world of black ops with John Clark and Domingo Chavez, along with President Jack Ryan. The events occuring so recently at the World Trade Center, Oklahoma City, and now the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania make this this book's gripping tale feel far more close to home. Although most people don't know it, &quot;black&quot; (secret,special ops) operations do take place quite frequently, and the men of these units, while they are shrouded in secrecy and most likely will never be given full gratitude for their service to the free world, will continue to hold the front line against terrorism until that threat is eliminated. This book tells the story of those men, and of the war against terror that they have and will continue to fight for some time."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I agree with a lot of the reader-reviews I have seen of this book. It does not come close to approaching Clancy's previous books. His characters have all become one dimensional killing machines, very similar to Hollywood's misrepresentations of Jack Ryan and friends. The story meanders and is guessable by the second quarter of the book, Clark and company will ride in to save the day! It is also a weak repackaging of the storyline from Executive Orders, without Jack Ryan.Another thing that bothers me is the editorial style of the book. I counted no less than five spelling errors and a couple of technological mistakes. Another problem is that Clancy will toss out a military acronym and not bother to explain what he is talking about. In earlier books, he very subtly would let the reader know what things were without talking down to them.Lastly, what is with that picture on the jacket cover?"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is by far the worst Tom Clancy book...TC really seems to be short of ideas... Caricatural characters, a VERY POOR ending (for those who might think that the punch is worth it!)Those who gave a 5 stars review to this book probably only read the first chapter, the only good one of the book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am a long time (early) Clancy fan, I read the Navel Institute edition of Red October, before his discovery by the general public. I mention this because Rainbow is not up to Mr. Clancy's standards. Probably 400 pages more than necessary- sorry Tom."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I enjoyed the book reading it in less than two weeks.Some concepts in R6 were similar to other Clancy works. As an example, this is his second book about bio warefare. He also introduced (for Clancy) something new. In this story, a corporation has the resources and capabilities of a Nation State. This includes the ability to develop weapons of mass destruction and make war. While that concept has been examined in other works, I have never seen it described as well as Clancy did in R6."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am a Tom Clancy fan. At least of his 'large book' series. I looked forward to Rainbow Six. I was sorely disappointed. The characters wrer colorless. The plot was bizarre and the action sequences were anti climatic. The ending was a drag."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"The book starts off as a how to on setting up your very own anti-terrorist squad; equipment, personnel, contacts, etc. Still, very interesting. It really isn't until the assault on the Spanish amusement park that the true Clancy genius explodes. The sequence takes you through an emotional gauntlet, and is wrtitten so well you want to reach through the pages and choke the terrorists because you hate them so much.Of course, all these terrorist incidents hide a more sinister conspiracy. A group of militant environmentalists plan to use an ebola-like virus to wipe out mankind and restore Earth to a more natural setting. Clancy does an excellent job developing their characters into people you can't help but hate because of their absolute contempt for human life. Scarey because some die-hard environmental types actually think that way.I wouldn't call this a Clancy classic, but it is nonetheless enjoyable and exciting reading."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Here's a quote. There are some questions in this life that we never can answer properly. Fortunately, the chicken or the egg question about the Rainbow Six game and book that's gone around the block in this space a couple of times in the past couple of days is not one of them, as Red Strom Entertainment's Jeff &quot;Mad Samoan&quot; Wand, modeler/artist on Rogue Spear, sends along what's hopefully an authoritative explanation of which is the cart and which is the horse here:The book was based on the game. The original concept for the game was conceived in a brainstorming session with Clancy. The original idea was that it be a 3D first person SWAT game, but Clancy threw in the idea of taking it on a grander scale and giving it an international antiterrorist angle. Some time later after the brainstorming session, he decided it was such a great idea that he'd make a book out of it, tie it in with the game, and maybe someday, a movie. Hopefully starring me."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"(For clarity: I read the dutch translation)WHen I first read Clancy's &quot;Patriot Games&quot; I liked his use of cutting edge technology mixed with knowledge about the U.S. Intelligence community. The stories could in theory have happened without us knowing it and the drama wasn't overdone. But my positive emotion declined rapidly with &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; and &quot;Executive Orders&quot;. The overconfident attitude towards the capabilities of the U.S. militairy turned me off. The scenario of these novels seemed extremely unlikely. Cutting to the novel in question, &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; seemed just the novel to repair my enjoyment with Clancy's writings. I was wrong. The over confidence was still there. As if Switzerland would submit a bank robbery to a U.S./U.K./German/French elite-team. I was surprised there was not more motivation for the deploying of the team in every occasion separately. Especially the Austrian case would not have been a problem for any other elite unit in the area, like the German GSG-9 who would be prepaired to 'assist' I guess. They have travelled abroad in many occasions anyway. And, I admit a bit of chauvinism is there also, why did Clancy ommit to include the very capable Dutch BBE, which performed several, and I quote, 'textbook operations' early in its career.Aside from that, the story just didn't seem to start, and I didn't realy care for any of the men except those I knew already... and I more and more disliked them too. The useless slaughter of the obviously untrained civilians in the jungle was also a very unappealing concept if you catch my drift .... No I did not like the arrogance with which Clancy violated countries and civil rights because 'these people are bad'. Especially the abscence of questioning of the use of force in a certain case, and the depiction of any enemy the Rainbow team faces as a completely corrupted psychopath (or a set of them) was rather lame to me.The abscence of 'activity' in the U.S. was rather strange. And why not in Asia, or anywhere else but Europe?All in all I did not like the concept and execution of the book, though promissing from the cover it didn't realy work for me, and I thought it lacked intelligence in both the peculiarities of jurisdiction and transfer of it in countries not known for their flexibility (read: Switzerland). Believe me, my sister used to live there and told me repeatedly how hard it is to get things done however urgent they are for you. So I'd disadvise those who are about to buy this one to do so. But that's just my opinion ofcourse."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'll be brief: If you liked Without Remorse, you'll like Rainbox 6. In my honest opinion they're two of Tom's best works. They both focus on John Clark, rather than Jack Ryan. I love the Jack Ryan books too, dont' get me wrong, but the Clark (or Kelly, depending on which book you read first) character is so deep. Jack Ryan gets into a lot of stuff and gets lucky quite often. John Clark doesn't take unnecessary risks, and those he does take he executes with ruthless precision :) Kind of blowing it out of proportion a bit, but trust me, any fan of Jack Ryan is a fan of John Clark. They stand for the same things, its just John's earlier years were....well, quite interesting for those who haven't read the previous book. Pick'em both up and you won't sleep for a month, because once you've read'em both you'll want to go back and re-read all the previous novels looking for hints of Clark and paying more attention to his parts."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This was my first Thomas Clancy novel, and it was definitely a commitment to complete 900 or so pages. Fortunately, that was not a problem. This novel, though flawed, is still impressive. It provides a fascinating glimpse into the world of Special Operations, training, technology and techniques. I personally found myself MORE interested in the development of the biological weaponry, though, possibly because I hadn't read any of Clancy's other works. I understand from several of these reviews that this particular plot device has been heavily recycled from his other efforts.The themes are skillfully interwoven into the story but the answers are left up to the reader to ponder, for example: (1) How does one come to choose between dedicating one's life to doing good (ie, working to prevent/cure disease) vs. evil (destroying 99% of the world's human population)? How is the decision impacted when the so-called good choice has negative consequences (further increasing the population) and the evil has positive ones (saving the planet)? (2) Does the end justify the means? Is it OK for hunters to kill if they use the meat? Is it OK for counter-terrorists if they save lives? Is it OK for scientists if they save the animals and the planet?When all was said and done, I enjoyed the book, but I had the following minor quibbles with the writing:First of all, certain characters are presented, somewhat developed and then completely dropped, never to be heard from again. For example, whatever happened to Dr. Barbara Archer, Skip Bannister, Kevin MacDonald (President of the Sierra Club)?Secondly, when some of the good guys are killed off, they are tangential to the story at best. In fact, after finishing the story, I couldn't have even told you their names.Thirdly, the odds are heavily stacked in favor of the good guys from the beginning and the story thus fails to generate a great deal of suspense during the terrorist take-downs. Although the confrontation at the Olympics was not the climax of the story, it was a letdown. The only real question was whether Team-2 would get the necessary information in time, and the alternative was just not plausible.Fourthly, the story tries too hard to cover all the bases, but it just doesn't gel. The only way a former KGB intelligence agent like Dmitry Popov could take SOOOOO LONG to figure out the scheme was if it was so farfetched as to occur only to a madman. However, the author takes great pains to point out that John Brightling was NOT a madman, and that he had legions of people devoted to the same idea. I had trouble swallowing these contradictory positions.Finally, the entire environmental movement was portrayed in a negative light. Just what is going to happen to the planet if we don't wake up and start taking care of it?All-in-all, an engrossing, action-packed read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have read all of TOm Clancys books so far. My favorite before this one was Without Remorse. Usually in his books I feel that I could have had just as good a book with 100 or so less pages. BUT NOT IN THIS BOOK. I had read all the reviews and noticed that the average rating was a 3. and I can not understand why. His last few novels have been longer than needed, and maybe not up to his high standards. Alot of authors fail to reach the heights they reached earlier. John Grisham is one of those...Once a great author, now a horrible BORING one. I feared that Mr Clancy was heading the same direction after the last two novels and the reviews here, but NO SIR! he is back with avengence! I can not think of editing out a single word of this novel. Do yourself a favor and pick it up... And while you are at it, grab Vince Flynn, and Steven Hunters latest... both are first rate thrillers.."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I've been an acolyte of Tom Clancy since he was still selling insurance. My uncle, a Navy Sea Systems guy, got me _The Hunt For Red October_ when it was still a hardback you had to get from the Naval Institute Press directly, OK? But if the badly ghostwritten and error-laden drivel of _OpCenter_ and his other little &quot;series books&quot; weren't proof that fame has finally ground the cutting edge off of the poet-laureate of America's warrior class, he manages to come up with a goofy, convoluted porker of a book like _Rainbow Six_.OK, a multinational spec-ops unit would be a nice idea, but he had to put Jack Ryan in the White House to make it even vaguely plausible. Unfortunately for the bookish Clancy, this is NOT the sort of warfare that you can get out of _Jane's_ or a couple VIP tours at Quantico or Fort Bragg, and it just falls flat. You get the impression this one was done just to pay his alimony (Wanda still around or no?) or pay off his part of the Baltimore Orioles. Most of the new characters (can't badmouth Clark or Chavez, I've been through too much with both...) have all the life of the _Rainbow Six_ computer game and there are technical goofs and factual errors he would NOT have made when research was still his religion. This is the only pure-Clancy novel I finished at 0200, nine hours after I bought it, and asked myself &quot;I stayed up all night for THIS?&quot;I await his next one, in hopes the once-Master will redeem himself. Meanwhile, check out Steven Hunter's _Point of Impact_."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Another great book by the master of the genre, Tom Clancy. Carrying on with his trend of introducing new characters and then following their exploits across many novels, this time we are treated to something different. Instead of Jack Ryan in the spotlight, we get two individuals that have grown in importance in the last few books, mainly since (and primarily starting with) Clear and Present Danger; John Clark and Domingo Chavez.The President in this book (Ryan, but never mentioned by name that I recall and not an important character) orders the creation of Rainbow, a multi-national (primarily NATO with some Israeli particpation) anti-terrorism task force. Based in the United Kingdom, the highly secretive organization is comprised of two teams, one always on duty, set to respond to hostage and terrorists activities anywhere on the world at a moment's notice. Clark is called up to be pretty much in charge of it, with Chavez as a right-hand man. Rainbow is formed and trained, comprising American, British, German, and other nationalities, and is ready for action.They don't have to wait long as a series of terrorist and hostage situations occur in Europe, first in a bank in Swizterland, then in a private residence in Austria, and then again in a Disney-esque amusment park in Spain. What is the linkage, or is there one? Why the sudden rash of terrorism? Rainbow deals with each indicedent very effecitively, but is something larger at work here?It isn't long before the reader finds that there is someone behind the attacks, at least some of them, though it is while before events become clear to the reader (and much longer to the characters in the novel, not only the members of Rainbow and the intelligence, military, and law enforcement communities that support them, but also in the guise of former KGB agent Colonel Dmitriy Arkadeyevich Popov, who works for the main antagonists in the book, but does not have the &quot;full story,&quot; at least at first).The main villains, it is revealed, are members of a very secretive cadre of very hard core environmentalists, ones who are experimenting with biological warfare, with the goal of wiping out all humanity except for a elite few, ones who can properly &quot;appreciate&quot; the natural world. How this ties in with Popov, Rainbow, and the rash of terrorism is revealed, and it is chilling. Soon, the all of humanity is at stake here.Some have criticized making environmental terrorists the key vilains in this epic novel. Some have said that this represents Mr. Clancy's views on protecting the environment. Personally, I thought the villain choice was unusual and interesting and made for a great story. He has already dealt with Irish and Arabic-Islamic terrorists, I think he was going for something that he (and others) had not explored previously. While I don't think he was condeming all environmentalists and conservationists, he clearly felt (my opinion here) that some are capable of such actions, and I don't think he is that off base. Not all terrorists and mass murderers come from Northern Ireland or the Middle East; one need only look at Jonestown Massacre, Oklahoma City Bombing, and the Heaven's Gate mass suicide. The scariest thing is that those in government might not see the next source of terror, one that might come from among its own members, and Clancy explores that with skill. Clancy does not discount all of the concerns of these very radical environmentalists, but he makes clear that their ultimate goal in this novel is postitvely ghastly.A good book, a few flaws, but all in all highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I'm a great fan of Clancy and have read every one of his novels, however I've always harbored doubts about his mental stability. With this book, there are no more doubts and it becomes pretty clear that he's slipped over into the deep end. I don't have any brief for radical environmentalists either, but to concoct a plot where they're conspiring to use an engineered virus to exterminate the entire human race in order to save the planet? This is too much. The best parts of this book are the accounts of the military actions executed by the Rainbow Six team against three terrorist missions in the early chapters. These scenes are top-notch vintage Clancy, but since they are only indirectly related to the main storyline, they too only add to its disjointed nature. As always with Clancy, character development and dialogue are pretty shallow. The climactic action at the end of the book where Rainbow Six takes down the eco-crazies in an effortless turkey shoot comes across as little more than a childish revenge fantasy on Clancy's part, wholly unworthy of the warrior ethos he generally represents in his work. Clancy was a his best in his early books where plot and character were incidental to the military action. He's trying to do it the other way around now, and he's out of his depth. He's still fun to read, but he could use a strong editor rein him back into his zone of competence."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I love the novel's gripping plot and heart-stopping counterterror strategies. Despite my love for it, I can't help but feel Clancy putting all his contempts toward environmentalist in writing this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Takes a lot of pages before you learn what the plot is all about. Clancy takes up too many pages about clark's wife & daughter & her husband Chavez. About halfway through the book you learn what the plot is & then it gets very exciting."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Any review of a new Clancy book must take into consideration his library of prior novels. Even though each new book stands alone, it can not be separated from it's brethren. When reading RB6, I kept getting the feeling that something is wrong here. After finally finishing the book, the problem hit me. Clancy is getting boring. Whereas prior novels kept getting more intense as they went on, RB6 just kept going on and on. It seems as though Clancy himself is the one getting bored with the writing, and we pay the price, (twice!). To test the thought, I re-read the last 350 pages of Debt Of Honor, a recent Clancy full novel. You're interest doesn't wane. After Red Storm Rising, Clancy's focus sharpened considerably, and hopefully he will get back on track with his next major novel."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is the one of best books I ever read in my life. I love Clancy's writing and there aren't enough good things to say about this book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This is the second review I have written of this book. The first did not appear as I was unfortunately a little too strong with my opinions, for which I apologise, but this is one of the worst books I have ever read. More so because I used to really like Tom Clancy novels but this one was laughable.I spent months ploughing through it and getting continuously more and more frustrated. I was brought up in a military family and know the ins and outs of the British military fairly well, and I was also raised in Hereford. Not the SAS side of it but I do know the area well, Tom Clancy doesn't. What I found to be most annoying were the little things, his lack of knowledge of simple geographical facts e.g Hereford is not near a motorway/highway yet a major sequence is set on such a road, and London does not have 'Blocks' like US Cities. Tom Clancy was also unable to establish a decent British accent, people were either terribly posh or a farmer from Devon I would have hoped that a writer of Clancy's expierience would have been above using such stereotypes. His writing of the British military was particularly gaulling as he simply did not know his stuff, again the little things, e.g we do not have NCO Clubs!!! Yet this was a constant setting through the book, again research would have quickly and easily found this out. His writing was stifled and cliche ridden bumbling yocals saying ...(not a direct Quote) them men at the base are a different breed they walk like lions.. etc etc. I was almost laughing out loud. I hope his next book is better but lets face it, it cannot be worse."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow six is a non stop action thriller. It is exciting and new. It will catch you at every turn and is very realilistic. So I recommened buying it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is spictacular from begining to end! I loved it! I don't understand how it could possibly get such a low rating!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I have the game rainbow six on my computer. I think it is one of the greatest games ever. When i picked up the book at the stoor, I began to read it and about 45 minutes later i said to myself,&quot;Its time to leave. I carried that book with me all the way to the cashier and didnt have the money to buy all the stuff in my cart plus the book. I had to put back some of the stuff in my cart and i couldnt get my face out of the book cause it is so great. I didnt even look at how much money i gave the cashier person but i didnt care. This book is worth a million bucks."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Well, I read the Dutch translation of this book and I think TC should have written it in about 500 pages or less. I would have rated this book 5 stars if RB6 couldn't save the world. But then TC had to use his fantasy :) After all I liked this book. But the personality's could have been worked out better. O yeah, one last thing: In my opinion TC used a bit too much repetition."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"I am looking forward for the next novel"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Rainbow Six is not a bad read. In fact, it's pretty entertaining and had plenty of action to keep the story going. The storyline itself, however, is starting to feel tired. It's not up the standards of the earlier Ryan books and I think the characters in this series have run out of things to do. All the components of this story (terrorist attacks, hostage taking, plagues) have been presented numerous times in other stories. After handling the Cold War, Japan, drug lords, and terrorists, is Clancy's Ryan series getting low on ideas? Another sign that the series is too old is Clancy's constant preaching. He's got to use his own political views as a source of energy to complete this book. I'm looking forward to a new series."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"GO AWAY, TOM"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors. I had the misfortune of selecting Clancy's new book for review. I can't tell you what a let down it was. The characters are weak, redundant, and have too much irrelevant background information. The plot is boring, twisted, and has unresolved issues at the end. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Try anything by Connelly."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"From &quot;Hunt for red October&quot; to &quot;Patriot Games&quot; this is by far the best ever!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"My dad had tried to get me to read Clancy for years. I saw the computer game and decided to try the novel. I am hooked! I am currently working my way through the entire Ryan series. When I heard that this wasn't even his best, I couldn't wait to get the others. I gave it 4 stars because it is not his best, but certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"At times it is slow, and you wonder when something will happen. But the one hospital takeover was the best read I've ever had!Other than the short-lived middle draught of &quot;boringness&quot; it is my favorite book. My first Tom Clancy book."},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"This book is a must read! Clancy delivers an edge-of-your-seat thriller. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Rainbow Six","review":"Not up to some of his best but better than most. Pretty straightforward tale of good guys versus bad guys. Some insight into the way special operations operates but I would recommend a couple of other books if you want more accurate views: Andy MCNABB's books about his time in the SAS; Bob MAYER's Special Forces series-- both were in the units they write about.
