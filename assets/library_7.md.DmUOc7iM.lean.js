I discovered CK through listening/reading Bill Simmons, and have enjoyed his take on the random topics they discussed. Needless to say, I had somewhat high hopes for his books and was not disappointed. I was born one year after where CK set his Gen-X cutoff, but I would have to include myself in his targeted demo. Obviously this book is now 8 years old, but I think it holds up well if you consider yourself a Gen-Xer.The book is a collection of essays, some more interesting than others, but overall thought provoking and funny and as random as I expected. I especially enjoyed his SBTB thoughts, the Pam Anderson-as-modern-woman comparison, The Empire Strikes Back as a metaphor for Gen-X, and his description of playing The Sims for the first time. I think SD&CP; was a good starting point, and I look forward to reading all of the other random pop culture/philosophy books CK has churned out over the years."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I don't think I technically belong to Generation X (honestly, I'm not quite sure which generation I belong to, but it's definitely not the Greatest one), so I don't have that in common with Chuck Klosterman, but he and I definitely share a sense of humor. I found myself laughing out loud, a lot, while reading this book.Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs is really a series of short essays. Each essay looks at some piece of pop culture, particularly from Klosterman's youth/college years, and examines its deeper meaning and how it is reflective of real life. Nothing is really off limits and Klosterman finds deeper meaning in things you would never think had anything more than a superficial value. He looks at the Real World and how we now look at the real people in our lives and determine which Real World stereotype they fit instead of the other way around. He explains the two reasons why soccer will never catch in America the way it has in other countries. Klosterman digs into Saved by the Bell and the \\"Tori Paradox\\" only to conclude that the \\"Tori Paradox\\" is no paradox at all. He dissects why Pamela Anderson is the new Marilyn Monroe.Klosterman hits topics from all over the map and he can get down right esoteric in his efforts to peel back the layers of pop culture. In one essay he looks at movies like Memento, The Matrix, and Vanilla Sky and how they're valuable because they try to define or identify reality. Deep stuff, man.Not all of the essays are great - the one about Memento almost read like philosophy and got a little boring. This probably makes the book sound more serious than it is - it's really funny. I was laughing out loud in a number of public places while reading this. The more I read, the more I laughed, and the more I liked it. I ended up tearing through the whole book in just a couple days and I'm planning to read some of his other books as soon as I can.In a nutshell: This is a really funny book - I definitely recommend it. Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"this point of view is so great and i can relate to most of it. a little rambling at times seems like filler but i will definitely be looking for more books from this guy."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Very good and funny at times, very slow and boring at other times.This book is a tribute to older days and in it's own perfect way itis the bipolar teenager it tries to capture.

I'm only halfway through this book, but I am really enjoying it thus far. I agree with a lot of the same things that he says. I'ts funny, entertaining and makes me smile and chuckle a lot. I like the fact that the book is geared toward readers in my age group - 25+. I can't wait to ready his previous books."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The author is very good at provoking thought while being humorous. Most of the pop culture was relatable to me. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman for president. Loved the book loved his crazy ability to connect pop culture to collective societal conciousness that may only exist to Chuck himself. Nevertheless, I found myself agreeing with him alot of times or just going with it. The essay that really stuck out to me as literary genious was the missing sock one. Histerical. The 23 questions? Brilliant! It made up for the sports references and defending country music(why I gave it 4 stars and not 5). I heart this guy."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman is at his absolute best with \\"Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs.\\" I've never been much of a reader. Essentially it has been baseball books, \\"Animal Farm\\" and little else. That all changed when I stumbled across SD&CP. I plowed through this book cover-to-cover, absolutely eating up all of the pop-culture references that--for a change--were the same random references I'd been making for years. How often does a book so appropriately praise \\"Saved by the Bell,\\" \\"Steve Perry & Journey,\\" and \\"Britney Spears\\" all in one fell swoop?! It just doesn't happen. Since SD&CP, I've read the rest of Klosterman's work and a bunch of books from the same \\"genre\\" of modern pop-culture authors. Needless to say this book...in addition to reeking of awesomeness...has opened me up to a whole new world of books. Thanks Chucky K!"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I think what sold me on this book was the reviewer's comments on the back cover which mentioned Klosterman's \\"raw associative powers\\". Klosterman certainly has associative powers in spades (and clubs and aces and diamonds) and he puts them to good use in this collection of essays and critiques of pop culture.I am five years removed from \\"Generation X\\" and while I have many ideas and experiences in common with the author, I tend to think that Klosterman spends way too much time obsessing about things that really don't matter at all. I would advise Chuck to spend a little more time walking in the fresh air and a little less time gazing at the TV, his navel, and his CD collection. But given that Klosterman chooses to spend so much mental effort in navel gazing, he certainly comes up with some interesting and surprising ideas and patterns, and the results can be funny, clever, and revealing.However, his style is so dense and prolix that most readers will be better served simply dipping into the book at random and reading for a few minutes, rather that trying to plow straight through.My chief criterion for whether I enjoy an writer is simply this: whether I agree with him or not, is he capable of making me think about things in a new way without being overly pedantic or strident? Klosterman fills that criterion admirably. I don't know if I will bother to seek out any more of his collections but I will hang onto this one and reread every couple of years until/if I finally get bored."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I usually make note of brilliant and memorable lines from the books I read. In the case of Klostermans manifesto, I'd essentially be photocopying the entire book if I wanted to capture every brilliant insight and hilarious witticism. Klosterman attacks every topic under the sun, and he states his random philosophies as absolute fact. He expounds on subjects endlessly, tying together outrageous theories about every aspect of pop culture.Klosterman as a music and culture critic is entirely love-it or hate-it. Read the first essay before you buy this book, and if it grabs you, you're in for a treat.On p 182 Klosterman discusses hitchhiking. He states he was told never to hitchhike because drivers who pick up hitchikers are serial killers. Then he was told that all hitchhikers were serial killers. \\"According to what I learned in public school, every person on the freeway was trolling for destruction. I used to imagine nomadic, sadistic drifters thumbing rides with bloodthirsty Volkswagen drivers, both desperately waiting for the first opportunity to kill eachother. Hitchiking seemed like an ultraviolent race against time.\\""},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Although he covers wildly varied topics, Chuck Klosterman's lively, stylish collection of essays speaks for and largely to one generation: Gen X. The author focuses not just on pop culture, but instead on pop culture's detritus. He doesn't discuss the best pop culture products. Rather, he covers the random bits and pieces that interest him. Some of these subjects merit his attention, such as popular television shows like The Real World, which have shaped later genres. Some of the other topics to which Klosterman turns his intelligence, ready wit (and occasionally profane tongue) are less obviously relevant - such as the meaning of breakfast cereal ads. He would argue that it doesn't matter, that everything in a society is connected and every part of popular culture tells us something about the way of life that produced it. Even so, you could still debate just what these specific items communicate - and while Klosterman's conclusions are always entertaining, many of them are highly debatable. In the areas such as music and celebrity journalism, where he is deeply experienced, his conclusions are more convincing and his ideas are most interesting. In other areas where he seems to spin positions from a more limited perspective, he is intriguing, but much less convincing. Despite this mixed menu and mixed perspective, we recommend this clever manuscript to pleasure readers who want a fun ride through pop land and to serious readers who are trying to understand the Gen X mindset."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"While this book may not be the \\"best\\" book I have ever read, I would say it was the most entertaining. There is one problem though. To fully enjoy it you must think like the author. Klosterman tackles a different topic in each chapter and looks at it in a humrous light each time. While I personally found it hysterical, I could easily see someone else finding it to be nothing more than a set of annoying journal entries. If you are familiar with Klosterman's work and are a fan of his I would no doubt reccomend this book to you as I have to all my friends already. If you are not sure about him yet however, you may want to pick up a Spin magazine and check him out beforehand."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Now, you and I both know that the phrase 'philosopher' gets thrown around much too much these days. Anyone with an idea about life is instantly branded as such, even though they do not really deserve it, which is not to say that there are less intelligent or skilled, they just are not philosophers, people doing battle with man's very purpose and exsisitence and drive (see KRS-ONE). That said, Chuck Klosterman is a philospher. If Socrates had the question \\"What is justice?\\" then Klosterman has \\"What is coolness?\\" Sure, at first that sounds silly, but think about it: can you actually define coolness? I strongly doubt it (no offense). Is it merely being liked? Is it follwing trends or breaking away from them? Klosterman struggles with these questions, analyzing various aspects of soceity to do so (nothing is too minute or too big for him to take on, be it the Trix Rabbit as a William S. Burroughs/Christ figure, the coolness of born-again Christians, or how the 80's NBA rivalry between the Celtics and the Lakers explains everything that needs explaning). In between each essay (which are, for no stated reason, deemed 'tracks' like they would be on an CD), Klosterman offers little vignettes from his life, some no more than two paragraphs, some a couple pages long. They add to Klosterman's own personal identity. Of course, I've totally ignored his humor up till now. The man is freaking hysterical, no if's and's or but's about it. So in conclusion: but this book. It's the best new writing you'll get your hands on in a while."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"\\"When I get up in the morning nothing seems to make sense. At night everything has meaning and seems to be connected. That's why I hate to go to sleep.\\" That's how Chuck Klosterman introduces his series of essays about popular culture, \\"Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs.\\" He has a real knack of teasing profound meanings out of the seeming trash of pop culture. And unlike a lot of other critics who start out writing about rock, he's not trying to prove he's in the Red Guards. He's a philosophical and temperamental moderate. In fact, his analysis of the 1980's rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the L.A. Lakers says that it was a ideological competition between right-wing individualism (Celtics) and corporate liberalism (Lakers); and he sheepishly confesses he's a Celtics man.He also writes about John Cusack's irresistable attraction for the women of his generation (and how we love the image of romance, not the real thing.) He proclaims Billy Joel's greatness in spite of Joel's lack of \\"coolness.\\" He trashes soccer in a very satisfying way for those of us who hate it. He analyzes the strange mythic appeal of \\"Saved By The Bell\\"; it's the stupid popular kid's dream of what life should be like. He theorizes that the doom and gloom of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" could have influenced the famous pessimism of the entire so-called Generation X. On these many subjects Klosterman isn't quite as funny as Kevin Smith or Quentin Tarantino, but he's more articulate. There's much fun to be had in this book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I heard rave reviews about this book from a large number of people and my roommate had it sitting on his desk so I picked it up and read it. Upon finishing I put it down and thought, \\"wow, that was the most abysmal piece of literature I have ever read.\\" Klosterman is like a 40 year old kid who, quite obviously has no semblence of a life, because not only has seen every episode of every \\"Real World\\" ever not once, but 3 times, and then decided it was worth his time to write an essay on how it has skewed the views of our society. WHAT??!?!!?!? In short Klosterman wastes 253 pages of good trees to tell us his revalatory findings after trying to get laid in the SIMS after sitting in his basement for over a weeks worth of hours playing it and other completely-irrelevent-to-life topics. And then he wonders why he can't get a girlfriend...Go figure."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Generation X: \\"Those born in the Western Hemisphere between 1960 and 1980 who are \`technically' part of the post-WWII baby boomer generation but feel no connections to its cultural icons.\\"This definition should give you pause before picking up Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs, mainly because if you weren't born between 1960 and 1980, much of what is discussed in Chuck Klosterman's book will be lost on you.Publisher's Weekly didn't care for this memoir-turned-manifesto, saying that if you \\"Removed all the dated pop culture analyses, Klosterman's book had enough material for about half a really great memoir.\\" But this completely misses the point of the what the author's trying to get across (leaving me to surmise that the person who reviewed it at Publisher's Weekly might not be a Gen-Xer).What Klosterman's narrative does is fairly extraordinary (more on that in a second) but it also alienates anyone who's not within the age-range specified by the birth years above. My mother is an avid reader, burning through ten or more books a month but I'd never dream of giving her this book to read even though I enjoyed it (mostly).Now, getting back to Publisher's Weekly. You can't remove the pop cultural analyses because that is the foundation upon which the book is built. And since it's a first person, nonfiction narrative, of course it's going to have to cover some memoirs of Klosterman himself. And here's the amazing thing about that: Klosterman isn't that interesting. But his prose is so sharp, witty and meshing, those who are Gen-Xers will probably fall in love with his style.Let me show you what I mean. In chapter 10, Klosterman discusses advertising and it's impact on Gen-X culture: \`...kids don't really understand the nuance of cereal advertising until they reach their twenties; this is when characters like the Trix Rabbit evolve into understated Christ figures. And though the plot is not purposeful on behalf of cereal makers, it's also not accidental. Cereal mascots are generally associated with sugared cereals - while a box of Wheaties might feature anyone from Bruce Jenner to Michelle Kwan, Count Chocula sticks with its mischievous vampire. Super Golden Crisp sells itself with the portrait of a laid-back bear wearing a mock turtleneck; Grape Nuts sells itself with a photograph of Grape Nuts. And this is more proof of cereal's overlooked relationship to American cool: Being cool is mostly ridiculous, and so is sugared cereal. That's why we like it.'This is a single example of how Gen-Xers perceive the world around them and how our icons (yes, I'm a Gen-Xer) don't necessarily match those of our parents'. But that's okay, and Klosterman notes that although things like pop culture mutate from decade to decade, they also stay similar ...with maybe just a few mild changes. Klosterman compares the sex symbology of Marilyn Monroe with that of Pamela Anderson and does so while watching the racy - and pirated - video of Pamela performing oral sex on her then husband, rocker Tommy Lee. Now, most people born before 1960 will probably find this offensive, since Marilyn was the epitome of sex in the post-WWII mind and could never - EVER! - see her executing such a move on President Kennedy or Joe DiMaggio (even though she probably did). But Gen-Xers don't have that affinity for her, and Pamela is the new symbol for sex in the minds of many men (and women). If you find these kinds of comparisons distasteful, then you're probably not a Gen-Xer and shouldn't read this book.I will say that the author lost me in chapter three, though. Never having watched Real World on MTV, these pages fell flat for me because I had no comparisons to draw from whenever Klosterman started in on that irreverent series. But this was the only chapter where that occurred.Everything else - from talking about how Billy Joel \\"is not cool which actually makes him cool\\", to how artless the Left Behind book series are - I followed along eagerly, finishing this 243 page book in a few short days.Gen-Xers, you owe it to yourselves to pick up a copy and gobble down all the sex, drugs and Cocoa Puff comparisons this able author offers up to you."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Manifesto? No. Essay collection? Yes. Can one tread the razor's edge between ironically tragic and tragically ironic, and manage to say something concrete and memorable? Can one deliver profound insight into Life and living by extensive deconstruction of lame TV shows, vapid celebrities, and the way the rest of Idiot America so desperately, needily relates? This seems to be Klosterman's game here, but he doesn't really walk that edge; he just keeps hopping back and forth across it. The conclusion of the foreword clues you in: \\"In and of itself, nothing really matters. What really matters is that nothing is ever \`in and of itself.'\\"Okaaaay, so jump on in.It's something when a book can make me actually laugh out loud, and Klosterman's book did that about a half-dozen times, like when he asks if two titles in the born-again-Christian/Armageddon \\"Left Behind\\" series, The Destroyer is Unleashed and The Beast Takes Possession were Ronnie James Dio albums. I'll give him that much: when he's rolling, he can write some really funny and entertaining stuff, absolutely hilarious. That being said, within a couple of weeks of finishing this book I was struggling to remember what it was all about. I remember an essay aboutThe Sims, ruminations on porn and the Internet, extended dialogs onSaved By the Belland a chance Olympia, Washington (just screaming Sleater-Kinney) encounter with a serial killer, and some stuff about dating and working and scratching a living as a defiant Gen-X slacker, but that's about it.Other reviews have called his essay subjects \\"stupid,\\" but I'd argue that \\"inventive\\" probably would be a more accurate description. He's a serious geek who's totally gay forStar Wars, porn, basketball, reality TV, movies and music, but he's also a guy who doesn't just sit and bob his head; he's got that thinking thing going on, too. That comes through in the rambling and ultimately self-contradictory and confusing--yet thoroughly fun to read--essay on the true musical genius of Billy Joel, where somehowSerpico,Steely Dan, Patrick Henry,the Clash, the suckiness of the Eagles, World War II,the Sex Pistols, the Carter administration's relationship toBorn to Run, Elvis Costello, Randy Newman,Catch-22, and Raymond Carver all orbit cosmically around the Piano Man. And that's just 12 pages of riffing. Later we're informed that Pamela Anderson is the \\"most crucial woman of her generation,\\" and it takes another 12 pages of extended footnoted dissection to attempt to make it all clear.Klosterman is at his best when he lets his own personal details slide into the cultural riffs, when he contextualizes his wide-ranging abstracts with concrete examples of where he's gone, what he's done and seen, and what he truly thinks about the issue at hand. The best parts were his admissions of failure, his admissions of lying and deceit when it comes to women, how most of the pieces he wrote as a movie reviewer were so soundly rejected because they offered insight and analysis, more than a shallow synopsis and a formulaic thumbs up/down. These aren't raw, juicy secrets, just simple personal admissions of failure and disillusion, and I found it to be the most connective writing in the entire book.My absolute favorite part of the book is the list of 23 questions Klosterman has devised to test \\"whether (he) can really love\\" someone. These are great ice-breakers, and good for use in the office as well. They're definitely a way to get to know someone, if they answer truthfully. My only disappointment here was that he offered no answers from either himself or others.There are some little things in this book that did endear Klosterman to me: The table of contents has a credits listing just like album liner notes. He actually uses footnotes for intellectually relevant portions of his discussions, and just for fun, too (man, that comes in handy for that painfulThe Real Worldnarrative). And there's actually an index! This is a brilliant addition, a perfect intellectual counterpoint to the footnotes, but the editorial execution is sloppy; there are tons of names listed in the book which do not make it to the index.Bottom line: If you're older than 45, most likely you're just not going to get it, period. The references that make up Klosterman's cosmology will be a complete mystery. If you're looking for organized, linear, straightforward media and pop-culture analysis, then Klosterman's scattershot, jump-cut, ADHD approach will infuriate you. But, if you're plugged in to TV and music and mainstream American media, and you are able to think past next week's \\"American Idol\\" to questions of what it all means and where all this is headed and what it's doing to us as a society, then this book will resonate with you, and you'll enjoy it, as I did."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Chuck Klosterman's essays strike a chord with me, and most likely with a number of people between the ages of 25-35. He talks about life and the meaning and condition of life as reflected in the various forms of entertainment we have absorbed throughout our lives.There will be something for you to latch onto and other things to disagree with in each essay. Each is similar to topics of conversation at every bar or cocktail party in America. The only frustrating thing is that it's a book, not a dialogue.Because many books of essays are thoroughly new and educational to me, I am content to sit back and read them and let them teach me. But Klosterman's essays are like the conversations I have with people almost on a daily basis. I am not used to having to sit still and listen to someone's theories on the Real World and how it has changed our lives and the way we see ourselves without being able to respond in kind.However, that's also the satisfying thing about these essays. Whether you love Coldplay or hate them, whether you think being a Celtic fan is an expression of your Reagan-era conservatism, or if playing the Sims has ever sparked existential thoughts, or it's just about buying new stuff or torturing your simulated alter ego, in other words, whether you agree with Klosterman's expostulations on his subjects or not, you will at least be sparked to think about these things.By that I mean not just thinking about Saved by the Bell, or Lloyd Dobler or the Real World. I mean thinking about whether in this day and age we can ever be satisfied with a relationship; whether we live our lives in a self-absorbed, self-examining, exhibitionist way as a result of reality shows; and whether people really do drift in and out of our lives without our really noticing, and what that says about our own self-centeredness.It's an interesting book and the only thing I could wish is that it also came with one dinner with the author so that you could reply to him and give commentary on the things he has written."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Klosterman is definitely an intelligent writer, and I enjoyed his style. Some chapters were beyond meaningless-- to the point that I just skipped ahead-- but overall you're bound to learn a thing or two and still be entertained."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I love to read anything Chuck Klosterman writes, even if he can sometimes be inconsistent. That being said, this book is frickin' great and is not the reason I find his writings occassionally inconsistent. I always recommend this to people who enjoy anything about pop culture and or just generally funny reads. So far everyone I have recommended it to has become Chuck fans!"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"As the subtitle implies, Klosterman has spent more time and energy thinking deeply about \\"low culture\\" than most academics have spent studying the so-called \\"important\\" things.This is not an indictment: Pondering things that aren't terribly important -- like what it's like to be in a Guns-N-Roses Tribute Band (for example) -- can be quite refreshing. In fact, I found it to be a welcome diversion from my normal diet of political books.Granted, as a fellow Gen Xer who spent some time in North Dakota, I probably identified with Klosterman more than, say, a 50-year old from New York might. But I figure if every Gen Xer in North Dakota were to purchase this book -- that's at least 250 copies, right there!In all seriousness, I think this book would resonate best with people born between 1968 and 1978."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"In Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs, Chuck Klosterman has collected a series of essays he's written on a myriad of popular culture subjects. From his hatred for John Cusack to his love of \\"The Real World\\", every essay is an absolutely hysterical descent into what made/makes America tick in the late 1990's and early 2000's. Despite my differences with Chuck's views on soccer(football), I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"I loved this book. I disagreed with the author on about a good third of the material, especially his views on Soccer, but we're all entitled to our opinions. I did appreciate reading an opposing point of view that was rarely offensive, except again, in his diatribe against soccer.There really isn't much more I can add to these reviews that others haven't put in already. This was one of the smartest and funniest books I have ever read. Its not for the type of person who accepts the world at face value; instead its for the type of person who questions everything, and can live with an opposing viewpoint without tossing the book down in anger."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"The book is worth a read. Chuck Klosterman's insights on pop culture subjects are fun and interesting, and are reminicent of times spent BS-ing with friends at a bar. But, much like many \\"bar\\" conversations, you gain no insight from all that wasted breath. At the bar you spend a lot of time flapping your gums, trying to be witty and astute, but you just wake up the next morning with a hang-over and a vague memory of all the #$%& you made up. So, if you just want to hear a guy's opinions about some random stuff, this is a fun read, but you will find yourself reading it over again, from time to time, because it's a little insipid."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Sex Drugs and Cocoa Puffs is Klostermans collection of laught out loud prose that anyone who likes or dislikes the state of pop culture should read. Whether Klosterman is ranting on about the Sims,classic rock, or Saved by the Bell, he uses his extensive pop culture knowledge and sharp wit to keep his book in your hands. From chapter to chapter of intelligent prose, Klosterman will make you shake your head at the ridiculous state of our pop culture but appreciate the minutiae the we obsess over."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This is an interesting book for people in their twenties. Though taking pop culture references and tying those to societal behavior is nothing new, Klosterman sometimes intelligently places real and intense thoughts about subjects that weren't meant to be dissected socially. He goes into how the Sims, Saved by the Bell, the 80s Lakers-Celtics rivalry all represent or influence society in one form or another. This book contains 18 disjointed, unrelated chapters explaining Klosterman's view of random popular culture phenomenons.The good part about this book is that at some points it's smart and hilarious at the same time. Klosterman's view on Soccer and why neither he nor America will ever accept is worth the price of the book alone. The first half of the book is far superior in that you'll find yourself laughing at loud (like I did on a plane). If you had part of your life influenced by random and useless things like toys or television shows when you were a kid, then this sort of sheds light on how minute items can influence anyone.There are two bad parts about this book though. Since he devotes a chapter to a random idea based on an aspect of culture, you'd be somewhat interested in that aspect. He went on a giant tirade about how classical country music is better than modern Nashville country music. Not only did I not care about that genre of music, I was unaware of the division of classical and modern country, nor did I really want to know about such a division. The worst part of this book is that he does a lot of useless explaining of random facts in detail that really aren't intriguing, funny or interesting, and doesn't incorporate these long winded details to anything noteworthy. In the chapter where he describes religious fanatics, he gives a boring and long summary of a religious movie for almost no reason. The second half of the book is really chalked full of such useless information and provides nothing interesting, funny or thought provoking at all.By the way, there is hardly any mention of Sex, Drugs, or even Cocoa Puffs in this book.All in all, it's interesting and unique, but the latter chapters were so dull that it left a dull taste in my mouth.

I would say it's one of those that make you wonder what the author was smoking, but he says several times that he was smoking pot. That explains a lot. It was funny in places, but I haven't really watched TV since 2000, and I didn't watch much for about 3 years before that, so even as a Gen-X'er, I couldn't relate to much of what he wrote about. I listen to several genres of music, but I'm not heavily into any (though I know several people who would absolutely love the chapters in which he dissected old rock albums) and I didn't recognize several of the bands he mentioned and very few of the albums.The one thing he wrote with which I can completely relate is something I've wondered about myself. To paraphrase: We shouldn't pick up hitchhikers because all hitchhikers are serial killers and/or rapists. But you shouldn't hitchhike because anyone who would pick up a hitchhiker is a serial killer and/or rapist.

When I first saw this book I thought it would be fantastic to laugh at myself and at recent culture for some of the silly things that we enjoy. Not taking things too seriously can be a very good thing.But I could not come even close to finishing this book. Klosterman thinks he is cynically hilarious and it's just tacky. He goes on and on and on....... about something so that you forget what the main point is. It's not funny at all. He tries way too hard. I tried to pick out things that I could relate to or would find interesting and nothing helped. I felt like he was the awkward kid in the corner who thinks he's cool, trying to say something that will make everyone laugh but that really you feel sorry for, because he's trying so hard, but you can't help but walk away.The book came up in conversation with a friend of mine, and I offered for him to read it to see what he thought.

Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs and Fargo Rock City are 2 of the funniest books I've read in recent years. Fargo is a great read, especially for a reformed metal-head.

Now this doesn't sound like much of a compliment, but in my mind it is. The ability to draw interesting conclusions from the analysis of Billy Joel and Saved By The Bell alone is worthy of appreciation. Although portions of this work are a bit tedious, much (if not most) of it are very worthwhile.My favorite chapter is the one featuring the analysis of the Empire Strikes Back as the basis for the stereotypical Gen-Xer. We are a generation of whiny Lukes, Chuck opines, overeducated idealists who can't seem to shake off their confusion about where their lives are headed. The line: \\"essentially, Luke went to the University of Degobah with a major is Buddhist philosophy and a minor in physical education\\" has to be one of the most hilarious things I have read.The point is, there are pearls of wisdom here, moments that make you (or me at least) sit upright and say \\"yes!! that is so true!\\" What I wonder is whether this book will have much value at all to those who do not have the shared experiences Chuck is describing. In a sense, this \\"manifesto\\" is for insiders only. Sections covering areas of less interest to me (Sims, for example) were harder for me to grasp.But that is small stuff. What we have here is a sharply-written collection of essays finding meaning where none is easily discernable. Genius? No. But for some of us, it's likely to be the most fun book we'll read in years."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"Yes, Chuck Klosterman is a narcissist- he admits as much in this book, using seemingly trivial events from his life to reconstruct an alternate universe, where low culture is dissected and assumes great psychological importance throughout the various essays that comprise Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs.Interestingly, there isn't much about any of the eponymous subjects in the book, yet the tome doesn't suffer for it; indeed, the essays stand out by themselves, yet still forming a satisfying whole and forming some kind of perverse narrative. There's quite a bit of tongue in cheek in the theories that Klosterman espouses throughout, and you'd have to be fairly young and unworldly to take him at his word on everything he says.This is cultural riffing at its most satisfying, and while some articles are culturally relevant (the Sims article being an amusing existential exercise in particular) overall this is a light, fun collection for those whose lives are consumed by low culture."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book is basically for anyone who likes to read about pop culture. When I say pop culture, I don't mean celebrity gossip, I mean random, interesting references to music, movies and books. This book is chock full of the latter. Practically anyone can enjoy Klosterman's takes on \\"coolness\\" and how it relates to sugary cereal, internet porn, serial killers, reality and simulated reality, a Guns N' Roses tribute band, and more. Right now I'm reading this book for the second time in less than 2 weeks. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","review":"This book, and more realistically, the mind who wrote this book offer a no-holds barred look into the culture we find ourselves surrounded by. I cannot believe how many parts of this book resonate with me, and some that obviously do not. But, Klosterman is just honest with where he is coming from and he is dead on in many of his observations, about video games, dating, reality television, the real world, saved by the bell, going to school in North Dakota, etc. This book falls in the same genre as David Egger's \\"A Heartbreaking Work Of Staggering Genius,\\" But is much faster / and put together. Egger's work is good, don't get me wrong, but this book is specifically nailing the GenX postmodern mindset. Chuck just gets it.

In this one, Dr. Geisler goes into the issue of SIN and Salvation. He deals with the nature of the unborn, orinial Sin, atonement, and things like Conditions for faith and the Content of faith. One thing that STICKS out in this text is...his view of free will is pushed to the fore front. If you want something about the issue of free will as well, here it is. This is great book to have for it covers so much. While you may or may not agree with everthing in it, it's great to have in your library. Can't wait for the 4th one coming out next month."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 3: Sin/Salvation","review":"Norman Geisler is a famed apologist and theologian. This is the third of a four-volume series, the other volumes of which areSystematic Theology, Vol. 1: Introduction/Bible, ,Systematic Theology, Vol. 2, God/Creation, andSystematic Theology, Vol. 4: Church/Last Things.He supports traducianism (i.e., that \\"humanlife [soul] can be divided and passed on to others\\"; pg. 33): \\"it is difficult to comprehend how each human being could be born in sin unless fallen souls are generated from parents, for surely God does not create a fallen soul each time a human is conceived.\\" (Pg. 44) He suggests, \\"God is free in the sense of having the power of self-determination, but not in the libertarian sense of having the ability to choose to do other than good. While humans have the ability to choose either good or evil, God, in His very essence, IS all-goodness, and, therefore, He can only DO good, being subject to His own nature.\\" (Pg. 87)He favors the \\"moderate Calvinist\\" view: \\"Moderate Calvinists reject the view that there is security for the elect but no assurance that one IS of the elect unless he endures... moderate Calvinism holds that we can have both present assurance and eternal security.\\" (Pg. 344-345) He asserts, \\"Supralapsarians are HYPER-Calvinists, being double-predestinarians. Infralapsarians are STRONG Calvinists, but are not double-predestinarians. Sublapsarians (Amyraldians) are MODERATE Calvinists, holding to unlimited atonement.\\" (Pg. 185) Later, he adds, \\"If (God has infallible foreknowledge), it seems unreasonable to assume (as Wesleyans do) that God regenerated people He knows will not persevere. The idea that God starts what He does not finish is contrary to His knowable character and recorded works.\\" (Pg. 315)He speculates, \\"So while a free world where no one ever sins is logically possible, it may not be actually possible. Hence, it is possible that God could NOT have created only those who wouldn't sin, since He knew with certainty that in any group He made some would choose evil. For example, it is possible that had God created fewer angels, a third of them would have sinned.\\" (Pg. 157) He concludes, \\"The doctrine of limited atonement claims that all for whom Christ died will be saved. However... Christ DID die for all and NOT all will be saved... Therefore, it obviously follows that not all for whom Christ died will be saved, and the doctrine of limited atonement is apparently contradictory to the teaching of Scripture.\\" (Pg. 359)Geisler's series is one of the outstanding recent contributions to evangelical theology."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 3: Sin/Salvation","review":"The series of books by Dr. Geisler are interesting and he does often refer to the church fathers.

Contrary to widespread opinion, economics is not the dismal science, and neither is it an esoteric exercise that is limited to the likes of Alan Greenspan. Hackett's definition of scarcity is similarly enlightening as his definition of economics - &quot;something is said to be scarce when, at a zero price, more is wanted than is available.&quot; So most things are scarce, and everyone makes economic decisions about allocating scarce resources, whether or not those allocation decisions involve money and market transactions. From those basic definitions and more, Hackett proceeds to explain and expand upon the value systems and the allocation decisions that we make as individuals and as a society. As the title implies, &quot;Environmental and Natural Resource Economics&quot; concentrates on the decisions that are made about the use of natural resources, including wilderness, forests, minerals, and fisheries. He also discusses pollution and the options for controlling pollution, including market mechanisms for pollution reduction. Sustainable development is a major theme of the book and Hackett explains a variety of approaches to sustainability. For anyone who wants more than an emotional opinion on the environment and the choices that society must make in its use of the environment, Steven Hackett provides a readable and valuable introduction to a subject of critical importance."},{"Title":"Environmental and Natural Resources Economics: Theory, Policy, and the Sustainable Society","review":"I am writing to report that I was very satisfied with this company.

It was required reading for one of my classes and I am glad I made the purchase."},{"Title":"Environmental and Natural Resources Economics: Theory, Policy, and the Sustainable Society","review":"Hackett's book does good at introducing microeconomics from an Environmental perspective. The content is not very weighty, and in fact makes for gentle, yet, stimulating reading. He opens by discussing \\"Ethical Systems of thoughts\\" and differentiating between price and value. His book then delves a bit deeper into the actual theory whereupon we are introduced to Marginal Benefits, Marginal Costs, Equilibrium, & Market Failure, which is precursory to Externalities. He's even bold enough to introduce Kantian ethics in his short discourse which also includes deontology and teleology. The book is well structured, and although interspersed with some errors (which Hackett has apparently desisted from communicating with me about) it's a swell book overall.I definitely recommend reading this book alongside Ian Hodge's \\"Environmental Economics\\""},{"Title":"Response to Disaster: Psychosocial, Community, and Ecological Approaches (Series in Clinical and Community Psychology)","review":"This terrific edited book is aimed at a pretty small audience: disaster and trauma professionals. The book's chapters range widely in content and sophistication. The highlights are the chapters of no-holds barred, naming names, well-deserved criticisms of the profit-motivated trauma treatments of the day: EMDR, Field Thought Therapy and Critical Incident Stress Debriefing. These are important views that won't get published in the professional journals. The chapters on trauma theories are less engaging, but largely cutting-edge. Some of the other chapters, such as the one on assessing the impact of trauma in work-related populations, focused more on technical sophistication than on having something meaty to say. If you are a trauma professional, you should find several chapters to justify the purchase price. But this is not a book for a general audience."},{"Title":"Kodansha's Basic English-Japanese Dictionary (Japanese for Busy People)","review":"This is the English-Japanese dictionary I use the most. I own 10 dictionaries and grammer books on the Japanese language and am a beginning-intermediate level student of the language. This one, containing 1500 + pages of extremely helpful guidance on how to correctly use the most &quot;basic&quot; words, is by far the most helpful on a daily basis. Whether for sending e-mail to a Japanese friend or completing a homework assignment for a Japanese language class, this dictionary has no equals in its niche. While modestly claiming to be only a &quot;basic&quot; dictionary, it is much more than that. It is the only book I have found on the market which has taken the time and effort (which must have been considerable) to provide samples sentences in both English and romaji and hiragana/kanji for the many different meanings and applications of about 4,500 basic English words. This book is well worth the investment. I wish all language dictionaries were as helpful as this one."},{"Title":"Kodansha's Basic English-Japanese Dictionary (Japanese for Busy People)","review":"Right now, I'm using the Pimsleur CDs in the car to learn Japanese. However, when I get home, I need to be able to write things down to remember them--so Ifm making a vocabulary list in a spreadsheet, and I also want to make flashcards.One of tough things to get used to in Japanese is the complex writing system--how can I be sure that I'm writing things down correctly? Even if I only use Roomaji, I need to be sure Ifm writing out long vowels versus short correctly. If using real Japanese writing, how will I know if there is a Kanji involved... or if I have made a gspelling mistakeh?Well, this dictionary is the best one I have found to help me write down all Ifm hearing on the Pimsleur CDs (and I have ordered quite a few). True, it does not have a lot of words in it--the preface says it has around 4,500 headwords. However, the real value is that it has many, many complete sentences for each entry along with usage notes. So whenever you look up an English word or concept, you can almost always find the utterance that youfre hearing so you can see how to write it down, and another way to use it. (This is especially useful to see concrete examples of conjugated verbs and conjugated adjectives.) It also shows variants of the same idea...and how the variants are acceptable in some constructions but not others.For instance, if you look up the word \\"fine,\\" you can find the following example of usage:No, this is fine.,,,A,,,{&lt;\\\\/,,/*&lt;C},,B ) [The japanese won't print right]Iie, kore de {kekkoo/ii/*genki} desu.Note: _Kekkoo_ sounds a little more formal than _ii_.So, you've got an English sentence, a real Japanese translation with multiple choices, including one that doesnft work (marked with an asterisk), and a roomaji transliteration. And you also have a valuable note about usage and how the variants come across.Another nice feature is that it clearly delineates where the pitch rises and falls for a given word...which is much easier to contend with than the mere acute accent mark used by many other Romanized dictionaries.And there's a Japanese-English section at the back as well, which gives you a mapping to which entries in the dictionary you can look for a Japanese word under--also quite helpful and surprising. There are also a few appendices including a clear and concise grammar summary, a list of business-related terminology, and a few other tidbits. Overall, I can picture myself using this dictionary constantly throughout my beginning studies...only supplementing it when I need to look up a specific and less common word."},{"Title":"Kodansha's Basic English-Japanese Dictionary (Japanese for Busy People)","review":"This is my first review.

Everything stated below is true, but I'm getting very irritated with this dictionary because often it omits the kanji. If you for instance look at the word \\"good\\" there is not a single kanji only hiragana.-----This is quite a good beginner's dictionary. It contains quite a bit of usage information as well as example sentences. That is what beginners need. Having said that i basically like the book, here are a few things to be aware of:1. I would have liked to have more synonyms for many of the entries. Since there are only 4500 entries that would have been very easy to arrange. The descriptions of the words in very extensive, but, then, if you only provide one translation it kind of defeats the purpose of having a detailed description. For instance: A ladder is a structure consisting of two long pieces of wood/rope/metal with steps inbetween for climbing up or down. This is translated as \\"hashigo\\". I don't think anything is gained by the long definition of what a latter is.2. My impression is that you only get a portion of the \\"approved\\" kanji despite other kanji being in frequent use as well. So there will be quite a bit of kana. For the learner it would have been very simple to also add more kanji. See below for a dictionary that does add more kanji. It seems like the authors have made a conscious decision to keep kanji to a minimum. I wish they would have provided some comments in the introduction.3. The book has a western-mindset tendency, despite its authors being Japanese. Just one example: If you look up \\"cooking\\", you get the Western way of cooking, but you don't get the Japanese cooking methods. This is not a serious problem, but it is an unpleasant tendency if you are working hard to get under the Japanese skin.4. It uses romanji in addition to the Japanese characters. This is not a bit problem in my view, but it is kind of unnecessary.Comparison with some other dictionariesI don't understand why everyone publishes beginner's dictionaries and why nobody does an advanced dictionary for foreigners learning Japanese, but so be it. Here is a comparison with some other English to Japanese dictionaries:1.Kodansha's Communicative English-Japanese Dictionaryis not very good at all (see my review). Too few entries and not many sentence examples.2.Kodansha's Furigana English-Japanese Dictionaryis very good because it also presents a lot of kanji alternatives. That is something which I like. The book states that it includes many kanji that educated Japanese are expected to know. In terms of usage information, this book is not as good.3.Kodansha's Effective Japanese Usage Dictionary: A Concise Explanation of Frequently Confused Words and Phrases. Nothing really wrong with that book consisting of around 700 words. However if you buy the current dictionary you get most of the information about usage anyway. Plus 3800 entries. Off course less detail on the 700 hundred, but you don't need 20 sentence examples, three will do. (But by all means check out author Kakuko Shoji. She has written some useful usage books.)4. Oxford and Random House also has dictionaries but I have only scanned them briefly in the book store. The reason being that they contain very little usage information. So they were off my radar screen5. A college dictionary aimed for the Japanese market. There are loads of them, but not on amazon. I do not recommend any. These books are not recommended as they are written for Japanese. Typically in an English to Japanese dictionary you do not get the kanji for many words. The Japanese already know them so no need to add them in terms of space. And off course whatever explanatory notes are going to be way too difficult to understand.As you might be able to discern my key need is a dictionary which has usage information. If an English word has five translations into Japanese, ideally I would like to have all five explained to me. If I can't have I would like to have at least two-three explained to me. The problem with some beginner's books above is that they only give one translation or two translations but without any or little usage information. Hence my recommendation of the current book. The book is not perfect, but quite okay.If you only have interest or money to buy one English-Japanese dictionary, there is no discussion. You should buyKodansha's Furigana English-Japanese Dictionary. If you want to buy a second English-Japanese dictionary, you should consider the current book. You should then really study the book from the beginning to the end. If that would be too much work for you, do not buy this book. Stick with the Kodansha Furigana."},{"Title":"Kodansha's Basic English-Japanese Dictionary (Japanese for Busy People)","review":"For a dictionary so thick, this one certainly lacks a LOT of very basic words.

This basic plot describes most Tarzan novels starting with the lost Atlantis colony of Opar in &quot;The Return of Tarzan.&quot; What makes &quot;Tarzan and the Lost Empire&quot; rather different from the rest is that the lost city this time around happens to be a couple of outposts from the Roman Empire, still up and running almost two thousand years later.The person who needs to be rescued in this 12th Tarzan novel is Erich von Harben, the son of a German medical missionary who is one of the Ape Man's old friends. Tarzan tracks Erich to a lost valley where he discovers the Roman outposts. Castra Sanguinarius is ruled by Sublatus, the cruel Emperor of the West, while Castrum Mare is ruled by the tyrant Validus Augustus, the Emperor of the East. Of course Tarzan ends up in the arena of Castra Sanguinarius fighting for his life, while young Erich faces a similar fate in the arena of Castrum Mare. the ape-man was seeking to rescue him. This is standard ERB fare but the idea that all Roman outposts set up despotic emperors is laying it on a bit thick. Still, there are a few noble Romans running around for Tarzan to bond with during this adventure.Burroughs did write a few historical adventures along with those set on exotic worlds or lost lands, so it would have been interesting to see him do a tale set in Ancient Rome, but this was as close as he got. As always with these pot-boilers, the principle is that the less of them you have read the more likely you are to be impressed by this one (and visa versa)."},{"Title":"Tarzan & the Lost Empire","review":"This volume in the Tarzan series appealed to me because I've got a soft spot for lost civilization tales.The jungle lord is approached by one of his civilized (European) friends, and asked to search a vast canyon where the guy's son, Erich Von Harben, is believed to have disappeared in search of a \\"lost tribe of Israel.\\" What Von Harben found instead were two rival Roman city-states, perfectly preserved since the canyon was colonized in the 1st Century. Not a bad find, actually, and Von Harben also discovers love at first sight with a noble Roman girl, as can only happen in a classic pulp. But alas, not everything is sunshine and puppies in this anachronistic canyon, and Von Harben finds himself in prison due to corrupt politicians and their paranoia.Tarzan, who entered the other end of the canyon, has also suffered a mishap that landed him in prison in the rival city-state (one is Castra Sanguinarious and one is Castrum Mare). Both Tarzan and Von Harben find allies among the political prisoners in their respective cities, but time is running out for the Ape Man to rescue Von Harben before the tyrannical Caesar has the suspicious outsider killed for sport in the arena.Burroughs was fairly enlightened for the time in which he wrote (the first edition of Lost Empire was printed in the 1920s), but I still cringed a bit at the underlying attitude toward black Africans. You've got to take those factors into account when you read something this old. Something else I struggled with were the names. So many characters had authentic-sounding Roman names my head was swimming trying to keep track of them. Another annoyance was due, I think, to the fact that this book was originally written as serialized pulp--each episode a given length according to the requirements of the periodical it was written for, with a cliffhanger ending to be continued next issue: Tarzan came off almost skitzophrenic due to his changing opinions about whether he could escape and when he should attempt escape, etc. And one final criticism I'll offer is that for a pulp tale about a feral savage raised by gorillas, in an adversarial position vis-a-vis hordes of sword-wielding legionaires, there wasn't nearly as much action as you might expect. And what action there was disappointed me a bit--particularly in the arena.I must give credit where it's due, though: when Tarzan is paired against a gladiator, his goose is cooked until the fortuitous intervention of a newfound Roman friend. Tarzan is a bad dude, but not invincible. He can't match up against a master of single combat who lives or dies by the sword just because he is the hero of the story, knife or no knife; ape-like agility or no ape-like agility. Weapons and all other factors being equal, the only individual who could have stood a chance against an experienced gladiator was another experienced gladiator, and Burroughs knew this. Thank-you, Edgar. No eye-rolling from me on this aspect.This concept had heaps of potential, but fell a bit short in my opinion. I still hope to read Tarzan and the Ant Men some day.Henry Brown is the author of the heroic fantasies Tales of the Honor Triad, as well as the military thriller Hell and Gone.

Chapin systematically showed most of the pieces necessary to put together an extraordinarily complicated musical. I truly had no idea how detailed the involvement of the directors and choreographer are in a show, and how much everyone contributes to getting things right.Parenthetically, although I didn't see the show the book detailed, I did see the recent incarnation of \\"Follies\\" on Broadway and hated the show, but loved the music. No matter what you think of \\"Follies\\", I would strongly recommend this book to anyone involved in theater."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"I was quite happy to receive my copy of EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE from Amazon last week before coming to NYC. The reason is clear - I will be seeing FOLLIES on Friday of this week (front row center) and actually had no idea about the musical - it's history or presentation. I had heard terrific things about this book and was thrilled that it had been reissued in trade paperback. Ted Chapin was a 20-year-old gofer on the rehearsals, Boston tryouts and opening night of the 1971 production of FOLLIES, which he did for college credit, keeping a detailed journal of the technical, personal and emotional aspects of birthing a Broadway musical. The work of directors Hal Prince and Michael Bennett, as well as composer-lyricist Stephen Sondheim, are reported and analyzed. This is not a gotcha book, but a detailed, sometimes overtly procedural day-to-day look at the rehearsal process for a show with over fifty cast members and a demanding technical presence. Sondheim's creation of his signature FOLLIES songs are discussed, with the last minute addition of I'M STILL HERE. The assortment of older actors are deliciously detailed, with Yvonne De Carlo, Dorothy Collins, Alexis Smith, Ethel Shutta and an assortment of former stars all enjoying their return (or debut) in a Broadway musical. The book was written, of course, before the current successful revival with Jane Maxwell and Bernadette Peters (update?). Warning - as much as I loved this book, it will only be enjoyable by theatre fans - this is not for the layman, no matter how attractive the cover is!"},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"Having seen the original cast, as well as the 2001 Broadway revival and a production in Long Beach, this book fascinated me. To read in great detail how this stunning musical production came together is thrilling. I could hardly put the book down once I started it.I am a huge fan of Sondheim, considering him to be one of the all-time great composers of musical theater. I also, at one time in my life, knew several of the performers--not well, but I knew them in by-gone years. So to read about their work ethics and their dedication to this production I also find fascinating.Ted Chapin has done a masterful job of making those days come alive on the page. By the time the show makes it to opening night on Broadway I was rooting for a hit! He made it so engrossing and the details were really interesting.Fifi D'orsey was such an egotist and he presents her just as she truly was. Yvonne DeCarlo was beautiful and every inch the movie star. She was talented and fun. He captures her essence very well. Alexis Smith was also beautiful and much more gifted than the movies allowed her to be. She was very bright and always studying things when she was not working. I thought Chapin nailed each of these ladies right on.The cast of this show was brilliant--Dorothy Collins, Gene Nelson, Ethel Shutta, Mary McCarty, John McMartin and Smith and DeCarlo. The people behind the scenes were the best in each category. Michael Bennett and Hal Prince were at the top of their game. Sondheim wrote a fabulous score--every tune is so well crafted.There are some wonderful photos of all the people involved in making Follies into a Broadway musical. And in addition to all of the marvelous black and white photos there are some tremendous color photos, which include the cover of Time magazine, as well as Alexis Smith, Yvonne DeCarlo, Dorothy Collins and Hal Prince.For anyone who enjoys musical theater this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"Thank you, Ted Chapin. This is a wonderful memoir on the birth of the now legendary, (though not appreciated by everyone at the time), Broadway musical, Follies, as seen through the eyes of young well connected college kid who was lucky enough to work on the production and savvy enough to keep and save all his notes! Whew! Long sentence. Follies is my all time favorite Broadway score and there's a reason for that. Once you get hooked on this musical, its hard to turn away, you'll want all the various recordings. Sadly, though the show ran for over a year, it lost its entire investment, partly due to its huge operating cost and partly because the NY Times critic didnt like it and it lost the Best Musical Tony to an undeserving rival. Over the years and through various revivals the stature of this musical has grown into its own legend. Chapin was there to see its birth and we all should be grateful for this book. From the rehearsals, to its out of town tryout, Broadway opening and beyond, Chapin was there. We get to know many of the principals through his eyes (Alexis, Dorothy, Yvonne) and see how a musical is put together from start to finish. This is must reading for any Broadway fan and fascinating even if you arent much of one. Hopefully, if you havent listened to the score, this will motivate you to go out and buy one of the various recordings (they all have their pluses and minuses, The Paper Mill Playhouse recording is the most complete). Chapin is discrete (Was Yvonne just a pal or a romance?) keeping gossip to a minimum, but the book never loses momentum. A real page turner. I hated to see it end! Bravo!"},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"Ted Chapin's book &quot;Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical 'Follies'&quot; is a insightful and enjoyable look into the creation of musical theatre by one of Broadway's most talented creative team. For those familiar with &quot;Follies&quot; already, it is a wonderful way to see the development of the music and book from frame to finish.To fully appreciate the experience of reading the book, it is helpful to have knowledge of the music, and I suggest listening to the original cast recording as well as Papermill's recent recording, which includes a number of cut songs that are discussed in detail with the book.Like Frank Rich's &quot;Ghost Light,&quot; Chapin's personal exploration into the theatre world gives a sense of energetic focus and perspective to the story unlike many other theatre books which give just chronologies from &quot;page to stage.&quot; This is a wonderful book for fans of Sondheim, Prince and those who belief in the prosperity of original musicals."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"This is one where a reader must take the good with the bad. The good is that Chapin provides an insider's account of the incredibly rich and powerful musical, Follies. His thoughts about the casting, staging, and scoring of this production puts it entirely into context. There is not another work like this.The bad is when Chapin creeps into the narrative. Really, nobody cares (or at least I don't) about what it was like to pick up set designs at various New York apartments or what it was like to run errands. The story is bigger than the author and, occasionally, he seems to forget this.In all, then, this is an important book -- with some faults -- that is critical to understanding one of the greatest achievements in American theater."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"This is honestly a &#34;can't put it down...gotta read it in one sitting&#34; kinda book...fascinating, &#34;insider&#34; details that keep you riveted and urge you to re-read.

Chapin's narrative can't help but be compelling, though it's often helped by what we know now. Unfortunately, it seems Chapin did not go much beyond just putting those notes into book form. Everything receives equal emphasis, as it might in the notebook of a college student who didn't know as he scribbled what would be important and what would not. Also, Chapin rarely goes beyond his 20-year-old point of view. His gofer job and Stephen Sondheim's solitary process meant Chapin had little access to the composer at the time, but Chapin fails to compensate by offering information on Sondheim outside of what he himself could have observed then.Chapin walks on eggs a bit when it comes to portraying the creators and the stars. He does not dish much, nor does he seem, then or now, very opinionated. What he does portray, though with very little comment, is a jaw-dropping lack of professionalism: weeks into the process, in front of paying audiences, there are dropped lines, fudged lyrics, fudged dance steps, off-key singing, often on numbers that have changed little or not at all. Then there is the endless complaining, often from those giving the most unprofessional performances. (One wants to slap Fifi d'Orsay.) Chapin also lets us see, though again without much comment, Michael Bennett's extraordinary professionalism. Bennett is the book's quiet hero, but Chapin never quite puts his finger on why. I disagree with the reviewer who said there is too much of Chapin himself in the book. There may not be enough. Most of the time the author remains invisible, even when going out on the town with Yvonne deCarlo, and he provides little view of life outside the bubble of the show. Except for the fact that he makes mimeographed copies of scripts, there is often little indication that it is 1971.Finally, again probably due to the basis of this book in notes taken 40 years ago, there is an annoying mix of verb tenses. Chapin's point of view is today, but whole passages mix past and present, as though chunks of the notes were dumped into book format without anyone thinking to change \\"she looks\\" to \\"she looked\\" or \\"tomorrow we will\\" to \\"the next day we would.\\" (And I don't mean when the notes are being quoted directly, where keeping present and future tenses make sense.)All in all, a great resource for fans, but lacking a compelling point of view."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"Having seen the original production on tour (in St. Louis), having had one of Boris Aronson's assistants as a stage design professor, and having a friend in the current revival, I am no stranger to FOLLIES.

While trying to remain reasonably objective, his tale is told from an insider's perspective, making it both informative and fun. And, alas: they sure don't make 'em like they used to!

So finally I did, and what a read! I couldn't put it down. As a former actress myself (did a National Tour that opened in Boston at the Wilbur in 1974), I totally identified with all the actors in \\"Follies.\\" And knowing the show, I felt the hair go up on the back of my neck as the head honchos talk to Stephen Sondheim about a song for Carlotta who has been around for a long time but is still performing.

Heartily recommend it!"},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"All I can say is that Ted Chapin must have kept very thorough notes as Everything Was Possible, the Birth of the Musical Follies, feels like it is written about a show that was produced only recently rather than over thirty years ago. All the creators and performers come alive vividly (and lovingly) in this marvelous book. The author traces the entire rehearsal, out-of-town tryout, and preview period of the musical Follies, focusing only on what he himself witnessed and recorded as a twenty year old gofer with the show. What is quite remarkable is his fairness to everyone involved. Even the divaish moments of some are balanced with these very same personalities more human moments at others. Anyone interested in Sondheim, musical theatre, or the art of putting it together will be delighted with this blow-by-blow account (perhaps a tad too much on rare occasions). A delightful book."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"Recommended for fans of the musical is one of the best books you'll see on how major Broadway production was created: Ted Chapin's Everything Was Possible: The Birth Of The Musical Follies.

The next best thing to attending a Broadway musical in production!"},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"I loved this book. I must say that I don't read a whole lot but this book was great especially from a musical actor's point of view. \\"Follies\\" has always been one of my favorite musicals and Ted Chapin captured a rare moment in history that I wish I was old enough to have witnessed. Luckily, this book gives thoughtful descriptions of what was going on in NY and Boston during the rehersal process. Being a fan of the musical I would often go back to listen to the various songs as they were introduced in the book. I wish the book hadn't ended because I was having such a great time reading it. Hat's Off!"},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"Ted Chapin was pretty much there at the birth of the wonderful musical that is Follies. For anyone who loves Follies, this is an excellent book full of little bits of information that you never knew you would one day know. A broad knowledge of the show is very helpful.The book has two major strengths. Firstly, the deep knowledge alluded to above, and secondly, it brings to life all the wonderful characters connected with that first production, both onstage and offstage.Where this book lets itself down is that Ted Chapin has misunderstood the book's appeal. This book is only going to appeal to people who know and love Follies or theatre in general, and I guess those people do not need to have theatrical terms and situations explained to them. At times, these quite lengthy basic explanations detract from the flow of the book.That said, if you are one of those people who know and love Follies, then do not hesitate to read this book, and just bear with the criticism mentioned above."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"Without sounding overly zealous or emotional, I would like to say that I literally could not put this book down. I found it in a local Barnes and Noble, and while I didn't originally intend to buy it, I found while perusing it in the cafe that I didn't have a choice. So I walked out with it, finished the first half that night, and read the other half the next day. Recently, I loaned the book to a friend of mine, and I can't wait until she gives it back, as I would really like to re-read certain parts.As a long-time admirer of the musical &quot;Follies&quot;, I found this account to be perhaps the most fascinating one I've ever read that was connected with any sort of performance or film, and to me, it is comparable only with Aljean Harmetz's &quot;Wizard--The Making of The Wizard of Oz&quot; for its sheer, fact-wealthy, you-are-there quality. As a production assistant/gopher involved with the project, author Chapin took exhaustive notes and kept copious journals which documented everything from start to finish, and it is from these resources that he has produced this tome. It is to his credit that he makes all of this history sound as fresh and exciting and relevant as if it all happened six months ago instead of over thirty years ago.I disagree with other reviewers who carp about the fact that Ted Chapin isn't a writer. Who cares? In an instance like this, it is truly what he says that is important, not how he says it. And much of it he says very well indeed. This is not, as some reviewers have pointed out (and others seem to have lamented) a dishy soap opera meant solely to entertain. It is, instead, a mature, fully-realized, and intelligent recording of the events surrounding the genesis, rehearsal, and performance of a landmark Broadway musical. This is not to say that the prose is short on human interest; on the contrary, it is everywhere in the book. It is contained in such small things as Chapin's recounting of how, in an age without computers readily at one's disposal, he had to type up lyrics on an IBM typewriter using several carbons at a time. On a larger scale, there are practically minute-for-minute reviews of the first performances in Boston and New York, including which actors botched lyrics, lines, and dance steps during those jittery times.As has been mentioned in other reviews of &quot;Everything Was Possible&quot;, all personalities of everyone involved in this show are revealed clearly and honestly, though never cruelly. This is also to Chapin's credit. I must admit that I didn't like everyone he wrote about and neither will most other readers. In particular, I disliked Alexis Smith (she comes across as being as cold and unpersonable, for the most part, as the character she played), Fifi D'Orsay (I've worked in community theatre with prima donnas like her, and they are a pain in the a**), and Michael Bennett (though a brilliant choreographer, he appears to have been more than a little temperamental and arrogant). On the plus side, Dorothy Collins shines warmly as the show's &quot;den mother&quot;, Ethel Shutta amuses as the crusty but decent elderly veteran, and Yvonne DeCarlo is simply unforgettable, whether struggling with a tap number, belting out the irresistable show-stopper &quot;I'm Still Here&quot; (which she had to learn at breakneck speed when it replaced her original solo, &quot;Can That Boy Foxtrot!&quot;)or flirting with young Chapin.Perhaps the most telling evidence of the indelible impact that this book has had on me is that it just makes me want to do what all the creative personnel involved in &quot;Follies&quot; were doing. As an amateur actor/singer, this account was a real treat for me, and I look forward eagerly to my next audition.In conclusion, I highly recommend this book to those with an interest in any type or facet of show business, whether or not they are fans of the musical &quot;Follies&quot; itself. Everyone--actors, writers, directors, choreographers, costume designers--can learn something from this. And in my opinion, they couldn't pick a better model to learn from than this thoroughly well-crafted commemoration of a masterpiece of musical theatre.My deep thanks to everyone who took part in it, and in particular to Mr. Ted Chapin, for taking the time."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"It's hard to put into words how compelling and illuminating this book is. Without ever being dry or dull, Chapin's matter-of-fact retelling of the creation of &quot;Follies&quot; is must read book not only for fans of the show, but any lover of musical theatre. Chapin captures the universal themes of putting on a musical. The sense of family, the backstage drama, the challenges and the triumphs are easily identifiable to anyone who's ever worked on a show, be it on Broadway or a community theater. Beyond that, by following the production from the earliest rehearsals to the closing night, Chapin provides revelatory information about the show: abandoned songs and scenes, casting changes, etc. More importantly Chapin gives a first hand account of the intentions of the creators (Who didn't all see eye to eye) and brings back to light important concepts that have been sadly missing from recent revivals. To top it all off, theater buffs will love the cameo appearences by the likes of Eliane Stritch, Ethel Merman, Jerry Orbach and John Guare. A tome you won't be able to put down, this is the best theater book I have read in years."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this backstage account of a legendary musical.Have seen several productions of FOLLIES except the original Broadway/Tour Cast..wish I had.

The flaw of the book is precisely what Chapin says it will be at the outset: he's presenting only what he saw and heard, and did not--not, that is, until the &quot;call in the critics&quot; finale of the text--attempt a broader perspective in any fashion, including by truly investigating, then or now, what was going on in rooms he wasn't in. The book might have benefited from a stronger editorial hand as well--it's irritatingly repetitive, always introducing information to the reader as if it hasn't been introduced already--but somehow it's eminently readable (I think the &quot;eminently&quot; applies only to those who come to the book with their fascination already built in)."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"Ted Chapin was the luckiest 20 year old whoever lived. As a &quot;production assistant&quot; (unpaid gofer)for the new Broadway musical &quot;Follies&quot;, he had the opportunity and good sense to record the making of one of the greatest musicals of that era. &quot;Everything Was Possible&quot; covers the first rehearsals to the abysmal cast recording to what has happened to the people involved. Starting from pre production on, his narrative never gets stale. He tells of how Hal Prince, Stephen Sondheim and Michael Bennett pulled it all off. It wasn't always fun. They had to deal with a group of aging actors who found negotiating a raked stage dangerous and a lot of their vulnerabilites and insecurities.The book will have significant impact on anyone who saw the show. I did not see it in New York but at the end of its Broadway run it was to go on a national tour starting in Los Angeles. With most of the original cast intact I sat center section at the Shubert Theatre in Los Angeles in September, 1972.It was one of the most emotional roller coasters I have been on in the theatre. The tour ended two weeks later and &quot;Follies&quot; has seldom been revived.All musical theatre afficionados will love Chapin's book. Thank you Ted for letting us see those &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; one more time."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"In 1971 Ted Chapin was a 20-year old college student who found a way to wangle a job as a production assistant (gofer) on FOLLIES and get college credit for it. No doubt, Chapin's family connections helped him a great deal (which he readily admits) and I'm sure that because of it he was treated with far more respect than the average gofer. But connections or not, he was still a kid in love with the theatre. Chapin's youthful enthusiasm and hero worship shine through the book. The part that really melted my heart was when realizes he's the first person to type the lyrics for a new Sondheim song, \\"I'm Still Here.\\" And you realize that even though today Chapin is powerful and successful, he still takes great pride in having been the first person to type the lyrics for \\"I'm Still Here.\\"At the time of FOLLIES it was not unusual for shows to go into rehearsal with large sections of the script (the ending, for example) marked, \\"To Be Written.\\" (Things are not like that today.) There are changes that happen in rehearsals, such as taking away \\"Losing My Mind\\" from Alexis Smith and giving it to Dorothy Collins. (It finally worked!) We see the changes that the show makes in its Boston tryout and the differences they make. There are great photos of the stars in the wigs and costumes that didn't work and were discarded. We read about the dramatic changes that happen when \\"Can That Boy Foxtrot\\" gets replaced by \\"I'm Still Here\\" and \\"Uptown and Downtown\\" gets replaced by \\"Lucy and Jessie.\\" Then there were the trials of Alexis Smith losing her voice and Gene Nelson's son becoming involved in a life-threatening situation on the West Coast. Could the understudies go on? They've had no rehearsal at all! The cast was composed mostly of older people who had difficulty remembering lines and learning dance routines, in addition to being terrified to move on Boris Aronson's severely raked stage.I liked all the detail that Chapin includes in the book, like what the show was like from the orchestra pit, how the lyric sheets were punctuated, visits to the scene and costume workshops, etc. Chapin vividly presents a large cast of characters. I got a kick out of old Ethel Shutta getting off a few zingers at Fifi D'Orsay's expense. Early in rehearsals Yvonne DeCarlo appears to take a shine to young Chapin and he becomes her frequent escort, much to the horror of Hal Prince and Stephen Sondheim. Dorothy Collins supposedly told her to \\"Keep your hands off that nice young man.\\" We see Alexis Smith working with everything she's got to make the show her own, all the while denying that she's put very much effort into her career. There's a cameo by Angela Lansbury (who was trying out PRETTYBELLE in Boston while FOLLIES was there for its tryout). Lansbury asks DeCarlo after seeing a matinee if this was her first time on stage. DeCarlo later explains it by saying that Angie must have been in a state of shock over her own show's premature closing.FOLLIES went on to become a landmark in the American theatre, running nearly two years, despite losing its entire investment. FOLLIES still sparks arguments today. Was it brilliant? Or a pretentious mess? This book is a great addition to the FOLLIES legend. Chapin obviously took great joy in simply being there and that joy shines through the pages of this book. Whether you're a FOLLIES fan or not (and I'm not), this book is a must-read for theatre buffs."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"The book is good, but it is the book of two men, a young and an old, who are not the best of collaborators. I think the young man to whom most of the adventures happen would have been more gossipy and excited about things were he not held in place by the distinguished older gentleman Ted Chapin of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization. For example, if you read between the lines, it seems pretty clear that the young Ted was pretty much crushed out on the glamorous Hollywood hasbeen Yvonne de Carlo, who came to New York City in full glamor mode and took Ted out on a series of dates to the Stork Club et al, and that when she left his life she left a big hole in it. But the older Ted sees ruefully that if it was a romance at all, it was pretty one-sided and potentially embarrassing. So the issue is tabled. I loved hearing all about how Sondheim created the score as the show was in tryouts; when it began only perhaps twenty minutes worth of music was finished, and the rest was created under intense pressure on the road in hotel rooms and coffee shops. I liked hearing about Mathilde Pincus, the music copyist, and the book gave me a new word I had never heard before. \\"She [Pincus] used a flat pen with black ink and wrote on 11\\" by 14\\" sheets of opaque paper called deschon, which had the musical staff lines printed in reverse on one side. Writing with ink on the other side allowed for errors to be erased without affecting the staff lines.\\" I guess I had seen 'deschon\\" but never knew what it was, just like I went to see \\"Follies\\" with De Carlo, Smith, Collins, several times, and never really knew how it came to be created. Thank God for Ted Chapin, the young one and the middle-aged man as well."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"Ted Chapin is well-known figure in the Broadway community, and writes from a vantage point few of us will ever experience. He takes us step-by-step through the trials and tribulations of getting a Broadway musical through the rehearsal process, having obviously kept copious notes throughout. The fact that both Hal Prince and Stephen Sondheim read the manuscript and &quot;...offered helpful corrections and suggestions&quot; adds to the authenticity of the work. He doesn't overly glamorize the people involved, nor is it simply backstage gossip. We are taken through the many steps that are involved in putting up a huge Broadway musical, including helpful details of jobs that many people are not aware of, including music copying, orchestration, set design and construction, lighting, sound, costumes... and the people who try to keep them all together and created the finished masterpiece that is &quot;Follies.&quot; I hate to sound trite, but I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"Ted Chapin was on the premises for this casting-to-opening account of the creation of the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Follies&quot; and those of us who are crazy about the show and that first production are indebted to him for his eye and ear and research. Chapin was a 20-year-old gofer when he was privileged to observe the process that turned a script into one of the great Broadway dazzlers of recent history. He wrote the original text as a college report and the very-detailed examination will be too much for someone who did not see the show or has only marginal interest in Broadway musicals (this reviewer saw the show six times, thanks mainly to the goodness of Producer Hal Prince who offered $2 seats at every performance). Chapin is tireless in descriptions of the way shows are made (everything from union rules to how orchestrations are developed and script changes typed). The big surprise is the total picture of how imagination and inspiration can be whipped into a monumental show."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"The immense immediacy of Ted Chapin's &quot;Follies&quot; memoir puts you right in the middle of a chaotic rehearsal period. Alas, the era Chapin remembers is as far gone to us as the era &quot;Follies&quot; intended to evoke. He rarely pauses for breath as he takes us through the thrilling rehearsal period of a musical with cast that mixed young and old and a range of temperaments. The parts where he talks about Yvonne DeCarlo are both fascinating and a little weird.Unintentionally, Chapin puts his finger on what exactly was wrong with &quot;Follies&quot; 33 years ago -- the creators never seemed to have a clear, hit-your-head-with-a-hammer conception of what it all meant. The musical seemed to create itself, and the result baffled as many people as it pleased. The creators even sought out a Harvard undergrad who had written an essay on the show during its Boston tryout. (Read the book to find out who the undergrad was, but rest assured it wasn't Ted Kaczynski.) I was too young to see it, but I really, really wish I was there.The characters of the actors and creative team come through, with the possible exception of Jim Goldman, who seemed to have distanced himself from the cast. Some surprises: Hal Prince gave line readings to the actors, and even stars making a lot of money for the time could routinely make mistakes. Nevertheless, Chapin has a profound sense of decency and understanding, and he never paints any of these people in an overly negative way.Another thing that comes through in Chapin's memoir is his audacious efficiency. Based on this account, Chapin was a dream gofer, coordinating the demands of a script that just kept spinning out of control. I could never have done it. Hats off.While reading the book, I often found myself singing the &quot;Follies&quot; score aloud; it is brilliant, and I'll never understand why critics of the time dismissed Stephen Sondheim's music. Neither, I suspect, did Chapin. For theater buffs, this book will make you yearn to head to your local little theater group and jump right in."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"There ain't many of us, but there are enough of us to warrant a lengthy and detailed account of how Follies came to be. I'm talking about all of us would-be \\"Broadway babies,\\" who went through college singing the lyrics to songs such as \\"Broadway Baby,\\" \\"Buddy's Blues,\\" \\"I'm Still Here,\\" and sighed some deep ones over \\"Losing My Mind.\\" We were too late to see the original production of Follies but we know all the songs by heart and the names of stars Alexis Smith and Yvonne De Carlo, despite never having seen any films of either Hollywood lady. If you can count yourself in this group of show people for whom Follies is legendary, then this book is for you.To an outsider, it must read like a technical manual on some weird and twisted process. To me, it reads like every theatre production rehearsal period I've ever been through (and I'm not even a pro, so to speak) except that the tunes are being written by Sondheim almost minute to minute, Hal Prince is busting himself to get the nuances to be less subtle and Michael Bennett is try to move the thing along at a trot without giving his \\"older\\" actors heart attacks! Same process, big names, very high stakes.The kid, that is the fly-on-the-wall former Follies gofer turned narrator, is good. Mr. Chapin, as a twenty year old student, worked as the Follies gofer - you think, that could have been me if I had been in the same place at the same time - and kept a journal of everything he saw and heard. The key here is that he heard a lot and jotted it down verbatim. For this he should win a friendly Eve Harrington award because without him we would never know, and come to love, such charming and kooky people like 74 year old Ethel Shutta who immortalized \\"Broadway Baby,\\" Gene Nelson who struggled arduously to get \\"The Right Girl\\" just right, or Fifi D'Orsay who sang \\"Ah, Paree!\\" while irritating her colleagues with her fake French persona. Mr. Chapin, with loving detail, recreates every step of hard work which drove Alexis Smith to a Tony Award winning performance. He etches out an edgy portrait of Yvonne De Carlo, far and away outside our expectations of the actress we used to know only as Lily Munster. By the end of the book, I was moved to read about the deaths of many of the people who created Follies. They are so deeply embedded in theatre history and legend that you do really believe that old saying \\"they don't make 'em like they used to.\\"From the eager rehearsals in faraway downtown New York, to rocky previews in Boston, and finally to its opening at the Winter Garden, this is a story which includes every human foible and triumph, a theatre account worth its hardcover price. The introduction by Frank Rich alone is enough to make you stand up and cheer for what Broadway used to be."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"Not to be greedy, but I wish Ted Chapin had been there at the creation of every important musical. His memoir of having been there at the birth of \\"Follies\\" is rich and delightful. Every person who finds themselves being glib at the expense of a new work in the theatre ought to read this book, because Chapin illuminates the perilous path of collaborative art -- the expense financially, physically, emotionally. In the words of Tommy Tune, \\"Contrary to popular opinion, the theatre is not for sissies.\\" I loved hearing about the extraordinary amount of work that everyone did -- how many fears they had to face, how much was on the line for them. I'm so glad I read this book, and so grateful it exists. It is a wonderful resource for theatre students and young professionals. And it is simply a terrific read for anyone in love with theatre and what makes artists tick."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"If the names of Stephen Sondheim, Hal Prince, and Michael Bennett pique your interest, then this book is for you.Following their collaboration on 'Company', the trio turned their attention to the musical that came to be known as 'Follies.'It's trials and tribulations during its rehearsal and tryout period are here in detail from someone who was there, Ted Chapin wastes no time throwing us into the professional theatre milieu.He has written and fast-paced and informative book. The people that inhabit it are REAL people who happen to be famous. And their determination to make this show work (some still say it didn't) makes for fascinating reading.It is like traveling back in time...and being there."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"What I like the most about this book is that although Follies is an over-the-top piece of musical theater, Chapin takes a journalistic &quot;just the facts, Ma'm&quot; approach. In other hands, the book could have been a scandal sheet of unsubstantiated gossip, screaming arguements, and backstage back-biting. Instead, Chapin gives a fair, neutral, even-handed version of his experience as someone who was there. The disparity of the Amazon reviews is not surprising, as Follies itself divides audiences, usally into camps (pun not intended) who adore the glitzy pastiche numbers and abhor the bad marriage blather, and those who try to accept the work as a whole. If you really love the history of musical theatre and appreciate the indelible influence of Prince, Bennett, and Sondheim, then this book is for you. If you are looking for dish, go elsewhere."},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","review":"Ted Chapin is such a smart and amiable guide through the rehearsal and preview period of one of the (if not THE) greatest musicals ever written and performed, that it's a pity this book about the making of FOLLIES isn't better. Chapin was a keen observer and kept detailed notes on everything he saw and heard. Unfortunately he is not an especially talented writer, and one is aware that he is frequently pulling his punches and drawing a veil over interesting matters that might better have been revealed. Though the bare facts of FOLLIES' evolution are always interesting, there is woefully little good dish here: despite the fact that most of this musical's performers have died, Chapin seems unable or unwilling to give us vivid glimpses of their characters and personalities. What we learn has to be gleaned by reading between the lines or via the odd, gossipy anecdote that actually made it past editor Bob Gottlieb and the Knopf legal department. Chapin is unerringly bland where he should be trenchant and opinionated -- he after all had the benefit of hindsight as well as of his extensive diaries and fresh interviews with Stephen Sondheim and Hal Prince. Perhaps Chapin's prominent position in Manhattan cultural life has made him too cautious. He also should have reprinted all of Frank Rich's student review of FOLLIES in an appendix since he describes it as having a striking effect on the creative team. And though the collection of color stills is an unexpected treat, this book has one of the ugliest designs and layout I have ever seen. FOLLIES deserved a more elegant book and a more challenging, provocative guide through its fascinating gestation."},{"Title":"Broken Nuptials in Shakespeare's Plays","review":"This book seems somewhat dated, but that may be because it has inspired so much research on the importance of marriage and ceremony that the ideas appear familiar. One easily forgets that this is the book that opened the way to new approaches to Shakespeare's plays. When my students want to write about the importance of ceremony or about women or about marriage in Shakespeare's plays, I first send them to *Broken Nuptials*. It's nicely written with no twisted inane jargon to trip up even a novice reader. Most readers, in fact, may end the book thinking &quot;I knew that!&quot; (although they probably didn't know it when they started the book). The insights appear to be so self-evident (and so colored by work done after the book's publication) that I believe readers and scholars, while recognizing the book's importance, have underrated its quality. This book is an excellent tool that stands the test of time."},{"Title":"Java Servlet & JSP Cookbook","review":"The 'cookbook' in the title means that Perry emphasises what he considers to be many common tasks needed to be done by Java Servlets and JSPs, in a J2EE context. Similar in spirit to OReilly's other books like 'eBay Hacks' and 'google Hacks'. In fact, in the 26 chapters of Perry's book, there are on average over 5 tasks in each that he explains, which are akin to the hacks of the other books. Except here, he gives you over 130 hacks.He assumes you know the basics of the subject. Certainly, the book does not claim to be a comprehensive listing of the subject's features. But if you satisfy this requirement, you can dive straight into any section of any chapter. Don't have to read this book linearly.However, if you aren't using Tomcat or BEA WebLogic as containers, then the relevance of the book may, frankly, be more limited. Different containers have slightly different functionalities, and the examples he gives are very specific to those 2 containers. If you are in fact using another, perhaps you can use this book to provide design patterns and inspiration, but not actual code."},{"Title":"Java Servlet & JSP Cookbook","review":"Being an O'Reilly fan it is hard for me to find fault with their no-nonsense approach to technical books, but there is one MAJOR issue I have with this book.As a developer for a major corporation I cannot use custom libraries for my work, especially when the license (http://www.servlets.com/cos/license.html) does not allow for commercial use. Where it would be helpful to see details on creating say, a multipart request class, Bruce Perry instead uses the com.oreilly.servlet.MultipartRequest class to hide much of the functionality (this is just one example).This makes little or no sense. Developers in the real world need real examples. Hiding the implementation of such under the non-commercial license pretty much ruins much of the potential application of an otherwise well written book. If you buy this book realise that only some of it will actually be useful in the real world."},{"Title":"Java Servlet & JSP Cookbook","review":"In the great tradition of cookbooks, O'Reilly has published the Java Servlet and JSP Cookbook. This book, written by Bruce W. Perry is a must-own book for anyone working with web applications in the Java space. I've been a Java developer for almost 8 years now and have been working with Servlets since early 1999 and I've learned quite a few things from this book.The Java Servlet &amp; JSP Cookbook provides more than 200 'recipes' or fully working and documented code snippets that you can directly cut-and-paste in your application. The book starts off with a quick intro to writing servlets and JSP pages. I was very impressed that the first JSP page that you write uses JSTL and is not loaded up with scriptlet code. I am just sick and tired of arguing with people with scriptlets are bad and it's nice to see a book that starts off with JSTL. Kudos Bruce.Once the intro is complete, you move onto writing deployment descriptors, deployment along with a nice little chapter on Ant. One of the most common question after people deploy JSP based application is the idea of precompiling JSPs for performance reasons. The fifth chapter does a great job of suggesting several methods of precompiling JSPs. I should also mention that the book includes how-to guides for Tomcat and WebLogic, which covers a pretty large landscape of web containers. WebSphere, Resin, Jetty are not directly covered.The book then moves on and covers topics such as handling Form data via POST/GET, uploading files, cookies, session tracking and URL rewriting. There is also a chapter on JavaScript and how they use JavaScript with servlets. I don't really understand the point of this chapter as most users just need a few cut-n-paste JavaScript for client-side FORM validation. There is also a chapter on streaming non-HTML content such as PDF, audio/video files and others to the browser.I also liked the chapter of logging in Servlets and JSPs. This chapter includes a nice introduction to Log4j and a nice tag library that uses Log4j under the cover. My favorite chapter in this book was the chapter dealing with authentication. The chapter starts off by talking setting users in Tomcat and then moves into setting up BASIC authentication. The next recipe talks about using Form-based authentication. The chapter is rounded off with a good treatment of the Java Authentication and Authorization service (JAAS). In this chapter, you create your own custom LoginModule and then use JAAS in a servlet and JSP.There is also a chapter about embedding multimedia content inside JSPs. This is not something I'm really interested in and I just glossed over this chapter. The same goes for the next chapter on manipulation of the HttpRequest. The next chapter does a great job of exploring Servlet Filters, which is a great feature introduced in the Servlet 2.3 specification that hasn't really caught on. Filters are great and the book includes some great examples of how best to use them.The next section includes chapters on sending, accessing email from servlets along with database access. Most complex application usually will implement some backend service to access database and separate the business logic from the data and the data from the UI, but the included recipes will help get you up and running for simple application.I really liked the section on custom tag libraries and JSTL. Tag Libraries are a great way to avoid scriptlet code in JSPs. The chapter on JSTL is also fairly comprehensive and includes code snippets for the core, XML, format, and SQL tags. There is also a great section on the Expression Language (EL) which has been migrated from JSTL 1.0 to the JSP 2.0 specification.I could go on about this book but I won't bore you any longer, assuming you are still reading. I highly recommend this book for anyone doing any type of Web development using Servlet and JSPs. I mentioned this earlier, but I've been writing Servlets and JSPs for the past 5 years and I've learned quite a few things from this book. Add this book to your library today. The code for this book is available on O'Reilly dot com"},{"Title":"Java Servlet & JSP Cookbook","review":"Target AudienceWeb developers who are looking for real-life examples of the use of servlets and JSP.ContentsThis is a companion-type book that goes beyond strictly reference material to the use of different servlet and JSP features, along with working examples of code to illustrate the concepts.The book is divided multiple chapters that each cover a different technique or function:Writing Servlets and JSPs; Deploying Servlets and JSPs; Naming Your Servlets; Using Apache Ant; Altering the Format of JSPs; Dynamically Including Content In Servlets and JSPs; Handling Web Form Data in Servlets and JSPs; Uploading Files; Handling Exceptions in Web Applications; Reading And Setting Cookies; Session Tracking; Integrating JavaScript with Servlets And JSPs; Sending Non-HTML Content; Logging Messages from Servlets and JSPs; Authenticating Clients; Binding, Accessing, and Removing Attributes in Web Applications; Embedding Multimedia in JSPs; Working With The Client Request; Filtering Request and Responses; Managing Email In Servlets and JSPs; Accessing Databases; Using Custom Tag Libraries; Using The JSTL; Internationalization; Using JNDI and Enterprise JavaBeans; Harvesting Web Information; Using the Google and Amazon Web APIsReviewI really like the O'Reilly Cookbook series. I read a lot as part of my ongoing study, and often it's easy to understand conceptually what is going on. But making the jump to practical solutions can be difficult at times. The Cookbook series gets plenty of use on my bookshelf as I do my day to day coding. And when it comes to servlet and JSP coding as I continue to learn more about Websphere Application Server, this book will surely become dog-eared like the rest of them. Bruce Perry has done a great job.As with most Cookbook titles, each chapter in the Servlet And JSP Cookbook is made up of a number of Problem/Solution/Discussion groupings. This format proposes a coding problem, states the solution to solve it, and then devotes the necessary space to discuss the solution both with text and code. By using this format, you can think through a working solution and determine how to apply that technique to your own problem. Perry covers a wide range of problems that will help both the beginner and the experienced coder. For beginners, the solutions for setting cookies with servlets and JSPs may be just what you need to get started. Experienced people will find the internationalization and JNDI/Enterprise JavaBeans solutions useful. I appreciate the fact that coders of all experience levels can get something out of this book.The only caveat I have on this book is that it is very focused on the Tomcat and WebLogic web application servers. If that's your platform of choice, you're going to get everything this book has to offer. For me, I'm partial to the WebSphere platform. While I will benefit from a lot of this book, there are chapters that will have no appeal to me, such as using the Ant package. I will also need to pay attention to the coding examples to make sure that the techniques are coded correctly for my platform of choice. Even with that warning, I would still highly recommend this book to all coders working in this area.ConclusionThis is definitely a title that will be useful to you as you learn more about servlet and JSP programming. It will give you the ideas you need to solve real business problems you'll encounter as a developer."},{"Title":"Java Servlet & JSP Cookbook","review":"This book is exactly what it claims to be: a general reference to hundreds of \\"everyday\\" situations Java Web developers face. Just as any cookbook, it doesn't go into the \\"deepest\\" details about every little thing, and it does give examples of ways to not reinvent the wheel. Some reviewers see this as worthy of only 1 star...

This book has it all, written so clearly that you know the author is very familiar with her subject and understands it thouroughly. It was written in 2003 and discusses Tomcat server as release 4.0 but that does not matter one bit. I was truly able to use this book to put together a website. Servlet, jsp, even java script is covered. I found many questions I had assembled reading the other books being answered in this one.Murach's books should be proud of this and I notice that they don't publish a 100 books on a subject; just have a few.

He's the head salesman in the toy department of a big store. His wife sells lingerie in a high-end boutique.Lots of cranks want to see the chief inspector and never get past the door, but it's a slack period in the office, and so Maigret listens, with half an ear, to the curious complaint of Xavier Marton.Later in the day his elegant wife shows up to inquire about her husband's visit. She describes Xavier Marton as an overworked, despondent man who needs psychiatric help.Intrigued, Maigret surreptitiously skims a volume on psychiatry. He goes from neuroses to psychoses to paranoia, finding that the symptoms under any given heading might apply to both husband and wife. The potential victim of their mutual hatred could be either of them!Maigret is admonished by the Public Prosecutor not to waste time on a non-crime. But his scruples will not let him rest.Ultimately who dies, and why, may or may not be a surprise. But it's the contrast between Maigret's loving marriage and the hateful atmosphere of the Marton marriage that makes this book so fascinating.There are subtle touches here that will reward the careful reader. Maigret fans should not miss this one."},{"Title":"Maigret Has Scruples (A Helen and Kurt Wolff Bk.)","review":"A mild-mannered Paris toy salesman seems an unlikely candidate for murder. Nevertheless, he has come to ask Maigret's help -- convinced his wife is planning to poison him with white phosphide. Is he a lunatic, a manipulator -- or a victim? Maigret finds himself pulled into one of the most difficult investigations of his career -- to determine the cause of a murder that has not yet been committed. The counterpoint explores Maigret's own relationship with his wife, his feelings about love and aging, and the scruples that make him unable to turn away from this seemingly minor matter. Simenon's deft handling of events and personalities makes this an exceptionally enjoyable novel. Paris may be half a world away, but visiting a Simenon novel is like dropping into the Taverne Pousset for a extra jeton or two. But like an aperitif -- it is over too quickly. -- JD"},{"Title":"Maigret Has Scruples (A Helen and Kurt Wolff Bk.)","review":"As most of the reviewers have described, this is a mystery about who is going to be killed as much as who is the killer. In an unusual period of calm at the Quai des Orfevres, the reader gets an opportunity to see more of the interactions among its inhabitants against a background of general boredom. It's that boredom that allows Maigret to become involved in the machinations of the Martons, he an expert in electric trains, and she a sales lady of expensive lingerie. Both seem to fear that one of them will be murdered by the other.As is usually the case with Maigret, the psychological interplays are at the core. Maigret and the Martons and her sister, Maigret and the Director, the inspectors and Maigret, and of equal importance, Maigret and Mrs. Maigret. The cast is still rather small, even so. And the contrast in the relationship of the Martons and that of the Maigrets is poignant, indeed.Like nearly all of the Maigret mysteries, Maigret Has Scruples has the same charm and introspection. It is one of the newer novellas, but it is fresh enough to enjoy. Like the Napoleon Bonaparte mysteries by Arthur Upfield, they are always a pleasure to read in spite of their overall age and the somewhat exotic locales."},{"Title":"Maigret Has Scruples (A Helen and Kurt Wolff Bk.)","review":"As one of the later Maigret novels, I think this sometimes gets written off as something Simenon cobbled together hastily. It's more reflective than usual, but the mystery is tight and succinct. The contrasts between Maigret and his wife with the toy salesman and his wife are poignant and revealing. The setup is unusually good - a slow day at the office produces a fine problem. The toy salesman thinks his wife wants to do him in. The wife insists that he's crazy and is trying to harm her. Who to believe?The resulting death I shall let the book reveal, but with such a small cast of suspects, Simenon produces a clever twist that is psychologically and dramatically satisfying. Character and story move forward with Simenon's typically economic style."},{"Title":"Maigret Has Scruples (A Helen and Kurt Wolff Bk.)","review":"Maigret is experiencing a seasonal slowdown in the business of crime, so his attention is diverted by a nervous and mild-mannered Paris electric train salesman who comes to see him about a small matter of domestic discord. It seems this gentleman's wife is planning to kill him via a quick-acting poison, or so he says, but when Maigret is called out of his office for a moment, the caller is gone. Shortly thereafter, the caller's wife herself pays a visit and conveys to Maigret that her husband is a bit of a lunatic, suffering from an inferiority complex and other insecurities which are deluding him into thinking he's being hunted. In spite of himself, and in the absence of any actual crime, Maigret pursues the matter, against the wishes of his own superiors. Along the way, we discover the little but treasured comforts of Maigret's own domestic life as they contrast to the unhappy circumstances of his visitors.This is a quick entertainment, something Simenon probably rattled off in a couple of weeks. Its plot and characters are almost hackneyed at this point, but the irony is that Simenon himself was the original creator of this and many other plots and characters, and to him goes the credit and the glory of creating a formula that many have imitated, but few have advanced the way he did.Overall, for me this work is certainly diverting and enjoyable, but not exceptional."},{"Title":"On the Duties of Brotherhood","review":"...who will re-issue this wonderful sufi book by the great Muslim thinker al-Ghazali?

[Way to go, girl -grin]Hawke Mason is returning to Colorado from Nebraska after attending his brother, Ben's funeral and helping his father,Jeb to settle the affairs of the farm and to take Ben and Sara's children back to his ranch, Hawke's Pride.Oh, you will sense and like the humor in Hawke's meeting of Rue and the misunderstandings that lead up to their marriage.Talk about no communication on the long trip across Colorado. Wow. Rue has this niggling feeling of being watched.Hawke and Rue stop overnight at the mountain man, Adams, cabin on their long trek. I did like this character.Typical of the man, Hawke does not tell Rue that his father, Jeb is arriving with his nephew, Tommy and niece, Susie and that she is expected to care for them.I do think that Hawke got what he deserved for carrying on with the neighbor's wife, Lillie Meyers, and her treatment of Rue when they stopped at the Meyers ranch.Another key character will be Little Star and his grandfather, Native Americans living a few hours away from Hawke's ranch.Ah, then there is Uncle Wolf, brother to Little Star and Tiny Fist's father, he desires Rue for a wife. And what happens to Josh Malone, he falls in love with Rue.When that rascal Adams rescues Rue - she then meets his woman, Rainy, &quot;Rains On The Face&quot; who becomes friendly with Rue.Of course, you will have guessed that Lillie wants to get rid of Rue so that she can have Hawke. chuckle, chuckle! Hawke has already lost his taste for Lillie.EXCELLENT AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- you will love it."},{"Title":"Hawke's Pride (Leisure historical romance)","review":"My first Norah Hess, not my last.

I decide to go ahead and give it 3.5 stars instead of a 3 stars. It could have been a good story, but she left parts of it out she shouldn't have. Hawke and Rue went from arguing and hating each other, to skip forward at least a month and he's been courting her. Then they get together once, and then it skips forward another month. Things are good between them, and Rue gets taken away by force and made to think Hawke is trying to get rid of her. So at least the last quarter of the book they are not even together. So not only did she skip the courting, she skipped any of the part where their marriage was good. There is not really much of any sex in this one. For some reason it just did not grab my attention as well, and was not a quick easy read for me. Not that it was horrible, because it wasn't.

It is a very simple read, yet it is powerful and full of annointed wisdom. Guyon shows that she is one who has experienced God's love throughout her life.Madame Guyon lays out a relational approach to prayer. She doesn't really offer any sound \\"techniques\\" on how to get an answer from God (formulas). She just talks about experiences she has had in her personal prayer life and encourages her reader to experience who she has experienced, God. She does lay out \\"methods,\\" but I would feel more comfortable calling them \\"movements,\\" because they are not formulaic at all. Guyon generally has a beautiful picture of God and she focuses on the idea that God indeed makes us whole through unity with Him. This is a must read and is better than Brother Lawrence's book, \\"The Practice of the Presence of God.\\""},{"Title":"Experiencing God Through Prayer","review":"The language was changed from the original 1984 version. It has lost its poignancy and feeling. It was like reading something a computer wrote."},{"Title":"Experiencing God Through Prayer","review":"Madame Guyon teaches the simple truth. You must learn to pray from your heart not your head. She explains how to sit quitely (while being active) and wait on God. Col. 1:27 &quot;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&quot; As a result of this short book, I could sense the Holy Spirit leading me back to a personal relationship with God - through His Word the Bible. As written on page 88, Romans 8:14 &quot;Follow the example of Paul, allowing yourself to be 'led by the Spirit of God' He will lead you to the ultimate goal of enjoying God forever.....You are called to enjoy God - not only His gifts to you....The whole desire of our heavenly Father is to give Himself to every creature according to the capacity in which we will receive Him.&quot; This book is written for everyone to be able to read and follow."},{"Title":"Experiencing God Through Prayer","review":"Although this book does not speak in the expicit terms of &quot;inner silence&quot; and &quot;monastic silence,&quot; it does speak of these things implicitly (and so at times not as straightforward as she could have), and she does a good job. The author speaks concerning a way of life and prayer which has been lost for the most part in conservative Protestant circles. To explain, and using the terms I've introduced, she speaks of inner silence. This does not mean what is meant by the meditations of eastern religions. Rather, this term refers to an inner lack of struggle---a lack of struggle with numerous voices and desires, because of the absence of the multiplicity of voices calling for one's attention. &quot;Monastic silence&quot; better explains this, for monastic has the form &quot;mono&quot; meaning one. The inner silence to which Guyon speaks is that silence of peace which comes when one is only hearing ONE voice, and that voice is God's.The one who has come to experience what Guyon is speaking of has learned to allow only one voice (God's), and thus there is no competition or multiplicity of voices calling for one's servanthood. In addition, she speaks implicitly of not regretting such a dedication to God. That is to say, one may choose to hear and enjoy only God, but they may wish that they could have some other voices and enjoyments, thus they regret to some extent that God is all they have chosen. Guyon states that when we choose God and God alone as our desire and the voice to whom we listen, and we do not regret what we have abandoned, then we have inner silence, peace within ourselves. Again, this is what others call monastic silence, the silence/lack of struggle with the decision of choosing only one.Luke 11:34 speaks of having a single (literally &quot;unified&quot;) eye for God, and Philippians 3:7 - 15 speaks of this singleness of desire for Christ Jesus as God as the attitude and condition of a mature believer in Christ Jesus. Guyon speaks to this issue and does a fine job, though if she had explained certain things a little more, I would have rated the book with 5 stars.This is an excellent book for learning how to seek the Biblical communion with God that is available to His people, without being superstitious in approach or speaking of weird things. Guyon speaks of going beyond &quot;experiences&quot; (spiritual signs, bells and whistles, ooh's and ah's, if you will) to rather reach the point of simple, intimate fellowship and satisfaction with God (satifaction with the Mono, the One). She speaks of simple abandonment of what perishes in preferment of the One who never perishes. She speaks of focusing on and enjoying the Giver rather than the gifts."},{"Title":"Experiencing God Through Prayer","review":"This is a useful basic book from a woman who understood how to dwell in God's presence and to appreciate that, while we are not God, we do have the kingdom of heaven living inside us in the form of the Holy Spirit if we have accepted Jesus Christ as Lord. However, this is an abridged and highly paraphrased version of the translation which Gene Edwards was the editor of, &lt;i&gt;Experiencing the Depths of Jesus Christ&lt;/i&gt;, so much so that it seems an almost wholly different book at times.

So much so, that in many of the chapters it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to harmonize her text with the Edward text.The best that can be said for &quot;Experiencing the Depths of Jesus Christ&quot; is that it is LOOSELY based upon Madame Guyon's treatise.On a Web site devoted to ancient Christian writings, this note is placed on the page introducing her work: &quot;[Note: A modernized, heavily edited and much changed version of this manuscript is currently in print and being sold under the title, &quot;Experiencing the Depths of Jesus Christ&quot; by SeedSowers Printing.]If anyone wishes to read at least a few things of what she wrote in &quot;A Short and Very Easy Method of Prayer,&quot; then I highly recommend &quot;Experiencing God Through Prayer&quot;--understanding, of course, that is a very abridged version.

Nancy Christie provides a cache of chapters each designed with one tip in mind to positively change your life, but cautions that even the smallest change brings about resistance. Wisdom is knowing when we must change ourselves for the better.In the chapter \\"Betsy's Boots,\\" Nancy Christie describes an incident where a friend gave her a pair of boots that were absolutely not her style. But, she decided to try them on anyway and when she did they suddenly gave her an entirely different perspective on the world. Nancy Christie felt more stylish, bold, and assertive. She uses this story to explain that sometimes we get stuck inside an idea or model we have of ourselves. We lose the ability to stretch outside of our character. She suggests challenging yourself with learning a new language, ballroom dancing, or volunteering in the community. Of course, this may be difficult, but she says don't judge yourself because it's not about succeeding or failing, rather it's about expanding your world.Nancy Christie is the author of more than 150 articles. Though this book can be read in one sitting, The Gifts of Change is a gold mind of tips to revitalize your life. Incorporating one idea at a time to see how they fit, like boots, may empower you to push past the boundaries you've set for yourself, develop new abilities, reflect on your goals, redesign your dreams, and ultimately hone your self-knowledge.-Laura Madeline Wiseman, M.A."},{"Title":"The Gifts Of Change","review":"Nancy Christie's book \\"The Gift of Change\\" should be in the hands of every woman.

I know it was a blessing in my life the day I bought the book. I've read it twice now and will do so again.

I particularly enjoyed the chapter about Betsy's Boots in which the author tells how her friend gave her a pair of boots, which she would never have chosen for herself, but when she tried them on she felt different; more stylish and more confident. The moral of this story (and the book as a whole) is to take chances, learn to love change, because you never know how that change will affect your life.

The book's relevance and value are undeniable--we all must become more resilient and comfortable with change in order to elevate our career effectiveness and life satisfaction.During the introduction, the author encourages the reader to \\"Open your eyes. Open your mind. Open your heart,\\" as the reader journeys through the challenging process of change. Through the eyes of her grandchild, the author recaptures \\"a sense of imagination and wonder\\" in order to lead a more fulfilling life.In chapter five, Ms. Christie urges women to put themselves first periodically and fulfill their dreams by selecting \\"the cup without the chip.\\" Perhaps her best message lies in chapter eight when she says, \\"We are most uniquely ourselves, with gifts and abilities that only we possess and can express. And when we consistently bury these parts of ourselves...we risk suffocating the essence of who we are.\\"This writing style is smooth, entertaining, and enjoyable. Each chapter conveys sound wisdom for handling personal change and transition. Although her stories do not always end happily, the tone is upbeat and optimistic like a comforting friend during tough times--realistic but hopeful.The author clearly has insight into life's common transitions and the challenges inherent within them, whether having a baby and redefining career success, managing financial hardships, losing a loved one, or letting go of unhealthy relationships.In a world where five-year-olds multi-task and productivity is priceless, The Gifts of Change is a welcome reminder that it's acceptable to slow down and reflect on the quality of our lives. The \\"juggling\\" metaphor no longer serves us since the ball we are likely to drop is often ourselves or the people and experiences we treasure most. When we're willing to accept life transitions as opportunities to regain perspective, the gifts of change will become readily available.Armchair Interviews highly recommends this book for anyone experiencing life-changing transitions and looking for solid tips in managing them effectively."},{"Title":"The Gifts Of Change","review":"The Gifts of Change is the type of book you could pick up and begin reading anytime, anyplace.

It is an equally satisfying book to read just for pure enjoyment."},{"Title":"Basic Algebra I (Bk. 1)","review":"I mean it: 5 stars -- I can think of few books I'd rate as highly. But one warning: This book suits my taste for essay-like exposition, an approach diametrically opposed to the more common practice of tables of numbered theorems and symbol-only proofs. If you prefer to think of a module as a homomorphism from a ring into the ring of endomorphisms of an Abelian group, this book is the right approach; if you prefer a list of equations defining a module, then do not use this book as your primary source. Few mathematicians have a good sense of language, but the comma splices, absent articles, poor syntax, near-aphasia, and sentence-fear prevalent in many texts are absent here. If you are writing for human beings, your text need not obey Fortran syntax, as does Hungerford's. Jacobson can write. In English.The chapter on Galois theory covers more finite Galois theory than most algebraists need to know. Jacobson's style of merging the necessary symbolism into an essay-like presentation is strongest in this long chapter, and planted concepts firmly in my mind in the same language that I would use to describe them in conversation.But mathematics is not learned through conversation, and that is the crux of the objections to this book. I'm grateful that my undergraduate professor used this book, but I would not recommend doing so, as some good students do not read it easily. I'd use this as a secondary text, with Hungerford, Fraleigh, or Herstein as the primary source. Mathematical writing would be better if all students saw Jacobson's approach at some point in their careers, Jacobson is the best exponent of terse, clean, textbook-as-essay style. Should you dislike his approach, exposure to his style might still broaden your ideas on mathematical exposition and help you better define your own style; a reaction against his methods can sharpen your own game.A masterful book."},{"Title":"Basic Algebra I (Bk. 1)","review":"This book is by an expert algebraist who has rewritten his earlier introduction to algebra from the experience gained after 20 years as a Yale professor. It contains correct insightful proofs, carefully explained as clearly as possible without compromising their goal of reaching the bottom of each topic.Other books say that one cannot square the circle with ruler and compass because it would require solving an algebraic equation with rational coefficients whose root is pi, and after all pi is a transcendental number. But Jacobson also proves that pi is a transcendental number, so as not to leave a logical gap. Naturally the burden on the student is somewhat higher than if he is merely told this fact without proof.It is true that some other books include many more examples, and discuss them at extreme length, whereas Jacobson's book is less than 500 pages, hence cannot include as many words. But Jacobson's words are sometimes far better chosen, as he clearly understands the material at greater depth than other authors.In his introduction to R modules, he discusses the most natural possible ring that acts on an abelian group: the ring of its endomorphisms. This is the true motivation behind the usefulness of R modules structures but is not even hinted at in most other books.In his treatment of factorization in Noetherian domains, Jacobson carefully proves the existence of a single irredudible factor before proving existence of a complete factorization, thus avoiding perfectly a logical trap that some authors do not even notice.In his discussion of the structure theory of finitely generated modules over a pid, he gives the concrete proof using diagonalization of matrices, that will actually be applied later to linear transformations, rather than some abstract existence proof that will be useless later, as many other authors do.This sort of careful attention to the internal structure of the subject, and expert skill at presenting it correctly and clearly, are possible only to someone like Jacobson who is a true master of his area. I have only recently, as a mature mathematician, become aware of how wonderful his book really is for beginners who want to learn the subject correctly, from the beginning.Some students not used to reading paragraphs, have been frustrated at his style of presentation, without realizing the superiority of his content. I can only recommend that those readers try harder to read his book, as it will repay far more than other sources.Jacobson has made a sincere, and I think very successful effort, to write his 2 volumes on 2 different levels of sophistication, the first being back - bendingly clear and painstakingly organized as to the true logic of the subject.After choosing a different source for my beginning graduate algebra course, I discovered the superiority of Jacobson, and wondered in amazement how such a great work could have been allowed to go out of print. After reading these reviews I understand. The readers who criticize the experts have eventually managed to veto the use of their works in classes. This makes the market share fall, and the books cease to exist. We have been obliged recently to remove Jacobson from our list of PhD references, in spite of its excellence, because it is out of print. This is a real disservice to our PhD students seeking to understand the material they will need to use.Average students, i.e. most of us, have the right to learn a subject, but we should not have the right, and we are unwise to try, to vote the best books out of existence simply because we cannot understand them. Let us aspire to understanding the deeper treatment in Jacobson's book. Let's put our copy of Jacobson away and save it, if we cannot yet read it.Clearly it is not the first book for everyone, but it is still perhaps the best, treatment of the material in existence to my knowledge at the upper undergraduate - graduate level, for the student who aspires to real mastery and understanding. If you want to be mathematician, you should get and read this book above others. Indeed the AMA rates both volumes of Jacobson as \\"essential\\" for every undergraduate library."},{"Title":"Basic Algebra I (Bk. 1)","review":"This book and its sequel BAII form a superb algebra resource that I use constantly. While this book is neither a reference (in the sense of Bourbaki) nor a textbook (its style is far too elegant to be classified as a textbook), it is beautifully written and one can learn a great deal by reading it. A word of warning though: this book presupposes a fair amount of mathematical maturity, so I would not recommend this book as an introduction to abstract algebra. On the other hand, it is a great complement to algebra courses and its originality and the variety of topics covered make it an invaluable resource."},{"Title":"Basic Algebra I (Bk. 1)","review":"I'm truly shocked that this book has received such low reviews. This is not an easy book, but it shouldn't be faulted for that. It's clear and beautifully written, and it's been a pleasure to work through. Additionally, the chapters are divided into sections that are 'bite size' with exercises at the end of each, which has made it well suited for regular daily study. I would highly recommend it to any student with some mathematical maturity who wishes to get a good foundation in the subject."},{"Title":"Basic Algebra I (Bk. 1)","review":"Jacobson's choice of topics is interesting; he does not simply stick to the canonical list of topics that the typical &quot;first course in algebra&quot; book covers, but touches on things like Lie and Jordan algebras, lattices, and the decidability of the first-order theory of the reals. For a budding research mathematician, this is great, since these are currently active areas of research. But for the average student, I would recommend something else. Several important theorems are not labelled theorems or given theorem numbers, e.g., the class equation for a finite group, or the fact that a polynomial equation is solvable in radicals if and only if its Galois group is solvable. That principal ideal domains are assumed to be commutative is not explicitly stated, and the notation &quot;E/F&quot; for &quot;E, a field extension of F&quot; is not explained. The Jordan-Holder theorem is not in the chapter on groups but in the Galois theory chapter. All these make for confusion for the student. I'd recommend Herstein's Topics in Algebra or Fraleigh's A First Course in Abstract Algebra instead for most students."},{"Title":"Basic Algebra I (Bk. 1)","review":"During the lecture on the abstract algebra 1, Jacobson's book was the main textbook. Although his book is regarded as &quot;bible&quot; by some professors, I cannot help confessing thath i need another reference book which explains the material in more detail and more carefully. So I consult Frayleigh's algebra textbook whenever I hit upon something difficult to understand on jacobson's. Frayleigh's book is kinder, not to economize explanations and examples. Jacobson is one of the top-class mathematian, but his fame doesn't assure his book's efficiency. His book is written too abstractively. I don't want to recommend this book to the beginers although it has the title &quot;basic&quot;."},{"Title":"Basic Algebra I (Bk. 1)","review":"I had intended to write a sarcastic condemnation of this so-called classic, but was forced to reconsider upon reading the review from Santa Barbara. Most defenders of the traditional texts tend to justify their favorites with the same old Neanderthal Mathematician argument: &quot;Me mathematician. Me like this book. No words. No pictures. Me very smart.&quot; Hence my surprise at our Santa Barbara reviewer, who offers such effusive and genuine praise of Jacobson's text that I had to stop and wonder &quot;Can we be thinking of the same book? Could I have possibly judged it too harshly?&quot; Yes we are, and no I haven't. In its day, perhaps this was a reasonable textbook. But alas, &quot;Basic Algebra&quot; has remained on the shelves considerably beyond its expiration date - it has long since gone sour, and many of those who are unfortunate enough to drink of it (or more typically, to have it poured down their throats) come to believe that this is the natural taste of algebra, and vow never to touch the stuff again. A pity, since algebra is such a strangely beautiful subject. If this book must stay around, can't we at least have a new edition? The text (including proofs) is laid out in huge paragraphless blocks (perhaps Jacobson was a Samuel Beckett fan?), the index is atrocious, and theorems are only occasionally set off from the main flow. Yet these cosmetic sins I could forgive if the exposition itself was worthy. But no - we are treated to convoluted proofs, awkward notations and terminology, endless discussions about monoids, uninspiring problems, and the overbearing sense of algebra as a great dead mass of formalities. It doesn't have to be this way. There are so many good math textbooks out there, yet we go on diligently suffering through these old dinosaurs just to please our professors who apparently are too lazy to go to the library and examine some alternatives. Here then is the truth... Two excellent textbooks will give you all you need - the first is &quot;Abstract Algebra&quot; by Dummit and Foote. Among the traditional &quot;Groups, Rings, and Fields&quot; books, this one stands tall, featuring well motivated concepts, transparent proofs, and a near-perfect sense of pacing. Its one flaw, however, is that it conveys little sense of algebra's rich history. This, however, you will find in abundance in John Stillwell's &quot;Elements of Algebra,&quot; which is undoubtedly the most fascinating introduction to algebra yet written. (In fact, every book Stillwell has written can reasonably claim to be the best for its subject.) In an ideal world (no algebraic pun intended), one would use Stillwell as an undergaduate and Dummit and Foote as a graduate. Ah, well. Perhaps some day."},{"Title":"Basic Algebra I (Bk. 1)","review":"In order to learn abstract algebra at the graduate level it is important to do involved problems. Jacobson has done an excellent job compiling some great problems for this book. As a pedagogical tool I found the book most useful. As a reference the book does contain a considerable amount of information, however the index is sparse and often in error."},{"Title":"Basic Algebra I (Bk. 1)","review":"I dislike the book for two main reason:1)the author hides information in essay-style paragraphs which usually end in phrases like, &quot;thus, we have proved...&quot;. If you are lucky, he will somewhere state the theorem.2) because of 1) it serves as a poor reference book, which is the main subsequent value of a text after you have taken the course with it.I do share some of the enthusiasm that Richard has for the book, but only for those parts of the book that I already understood from previous work. We actually took the class together at UC Santa Barbara. And from what I remember, Richard was one of the few students who had anything good to say about the book. I think a better graduate text is Hungerford's or Grove's (&quot;Algebra&quot;)."},{"Title":"Basic Algebra I (Bk. 1)","review":"qued&eacute; muy satisfecho con todo el proceso, inicialmente ten&iacute;a desconfinza con lo de la tarjeta de cr&eacute;dito pero me pareci&oacute; muy serio y confiable todo.

A glossary would have been nice. I found myself backtracking several times per section to keep track of the jargon flying around. I recommend Stillwell's undergraduate and Robert Ash's graduate books instead. Ash's book is less elegant than this, but more straightforward and formatted more accessibly. Also, the title may be one of the biggest misnomers in the history of textbooks; \\"Basic Algebra I\\" sounds like the title of a junior high textbook, not a graduate school-level one. I'm guessing that this is a good reference if you already know abstract algebra like the back of your hand; but to learn it, there are many more accessible texts at this level."},{"Title":"Basic Algebra I (Bk. 1)","review":"This is one of the worst undergraduate algebra texts I've ever seen. Although everything Jacobson says in his book is true, his writing style makes the material seem more difficult than it really is. Many results in the book are not numbered or highlighted from the rest of the book, and this makes it virtually impossible to retrieve information when needed. In order to find the result you want you probably need to read the entire section to find it. This book is a counter example to the following conjecture: If a person is a good mathematician, then he writes good mathematics textbooks."},{"Title":"Basic Algebra I (Bk. 1)","review":"This is not an easy book to learn from. The material is there but organized in a very poor way. Important results and theorems are often hidden in the middle of page long paragraphs. The index is so bad they might as well not have included it. The information is all there, but unless you read every word in the text from beginning to end, you just won't be able to get to it. I used Hungerford to get through my first graduate classes in algebra, which is too brief but definitely a step up from this. This is a poorly organized text written by a truly great mathematician."},{"Title":"Basic Algebra I (Bk. 1)","review":"Basic Algebra is not well written. The material here is the same as covered in many other books, such as Hungerford, but Hungerford covers the material in a concise organized manner. Jacobson might be a little more accessible to beginning readers, but is more confusing as well. It hides definitions and important theorems in the middle of paragraphs. The index is horrendous. The examples are mixed in with everything else in a manner which makes it hard to pick anything apart in a chapter. Stick with another graduate Algebra text if you want to learn from the book, as it takes a good professor to make this book work. Jacobson is certainly a great Mathematician, but I do not recommend him as an author for this material."},{"Title":"Basic Algebra I (Bk. 1)","review":"I have recently had the unpleasant experience of finishing a higher course in Algebra which used Jacobson's book. To make a long story short, I never once found myself using this book to solve any problems listed in Jacobson, it is the most unorganized and unconnected book (in terms of it's theorems and results and how they came about) that I have ever attempted to learn from. This book is certainly NOT self-contained, nor does Jacobson explicitely list or even sometimes give results which may help solve his exercises. The material is presented either more confusingly than it has to be, or in such a way that one wonders why it was presented in the first place. I don't understand why any mathematician would recommend this book to use as a primary text in a course."},{"Title":"Stamp Collecting For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I have always thought the Dummies series of books were some of the best-written \\"How To\\" books on the market.

They both land close to the mark."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"In posting this review, I'm also posting a review of a second new edition that is freshly available:The Jefferson Bible, Smithsonian Edition: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth. That special Smithsonian volume is a reasonably priced collector's item, and so is this Tarcher edition.If you've read this far about the book, you probably know something about the so-called Jefferson Bible. First, he never called it that himself. His final 1820 edition was called \\"The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth.\\" I'm not interested in starting a book-review debate about the nature of Jefferson's faith, but this much is true: In his own lifetime, Jefferson did called himself \\"a Christian.\\" It's also true that Jefferson's interest was in the moral teachings of Jesus and his version of the Bible cut out all miraculous details from the Gospels. You'll find that his Bible, nearly two centuries after he created it, still sparks spirited discussion in classes and small groups.Of course, the 1820 Bible was intended for his own reading and for his circle of friends and colleagues, most of whom could appreciate the Greek, Latin and French columns in his pasted-together composite. His original edition remains a major milestone in American religious history and a book that any Bible teacher should have on the shelf. Of course, today, there are lots of free and almost-free editions of this book with more popping up all the time.The Tarcher edition represents a historical milestone, as does the Smithsonian facsimile. First published in 1940, the new Tarcher version includes the original 1940 preface, so readers can look back on American attitudes toward this document just prior to America's involvement in World War II. Plus, frankly, if you want to actually read the whole text of Jefferson's version, this is a much easier book to read than the Smithsonian facsimile. Among other things, Tarcher doesn't bother to publish the Greek, Latin and French columns, just the English in a highly readable typeface.My strong recommendation: Buy both of these books now, while they're still available."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"I was unaware that Jefferson had written this book, and was happy to discover it and add it to my library. His genius astounds and inspires."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"As the person responsible for the Jefferson Bible on the web... , I found the reviews posted here fascinating, including the very negative ones. Apparently, it is easy to miss the point of the Jefferson Bible. It is not a treatise on religious dogma or analysis, but a personal spiritual guide for those unable to stomach all the hocus pocus usually associated with the teachings of Jesus. Whatever one's feeling about the Bible, it is difficult to see how anyone could consider the purified teachings of Jesus as \\"tripe.\\" Jefferson merely selected passages that spoke to his heart and put them all together in a single collection for his own use. Thousands have looked at his collection and determined that it speaks to their heart also."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Thomas Jefferson does the right thing by getting rid of all the dogma and supernatural/superstitious CRAP in the gospels and concentrates on the very human message that Jesus brought to us all - that of empathy and a sense of compassion for other human beings, and that Love is the answer to the problem of human coexistence."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"What a disappointment this is. I'd really been looking forward to reading the Jefferson Bible and I was quite stoked to find it at such a great price! I guess one gets what one pays for however.There's two problems with this download: first, there's no active table of contents. With something like the Bible, even Jefferson's version, this is a requirement.Second, and even more vexing, it's quite clear this text was scanned directly from a book and that causes massive formatting issues, along with displaying page numbers in the text. There's also a message that basically reads like an ad every few pages showing the title and the fact that it's from the sacred-texts website.All in all, I really wanted to enjoy this read, but can't. Very disappointed. If they put out a version that at least has an active table of contents, I might download it again, but otherwise it's off to the bin."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"I find it very interesting that Thomas Jefferson took so much time to distill this book from the Holy Bible. That must have been near blasphemy in the early 1800's. It does make for a short and interesting read however and shows that Jefferson was deeply contemplating the Bible as he read it."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Jefferson accomplished most of what Rudolph Bultmann was attempting to do with his program &#34;to demythologize the New Testament...& to translate it into human language without remainder.&#34; Jefferson's work is astonishingly well done, making the meaning of the Gospels exceptionally clear. Moreover, he sets Jesus free from the strange dictates of the Council of Nicea (e.g., the &#34;Homoousian&#34; argument for the divinity of Jesus vs. the &#34;Arien&#34; argument that Jesus was fully man) & reveals the true depth & humanity of the man, who re-presents what it means to be more truly & fully human. I also purchased an illustrated version of this work for my son, who had studied it in college; this version gives additional insight into the depth & rigor Jefferson employed in an attempt clarify the intent of The Gospels, without myth. &#34;The Morals of Jesus&#34; is an excellent piece of work (from an amazing man & Diest) & a text everyone should take to heart & employ daily."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"I had heard for years about the Jefferson Bible, so I finally ordered it. It's pretty small, but he included more passages in it--if this is exactly it--than I would have thought. Jefferson's introduction is the most revealing part. It's definitely worth having. For some reason, I thought it would be a full-on Bible with lined-out portions that he found suspect. One wonders what he'd think now, after decades of archeological research has taken place. One has to assume it would have some influence. He includes the birth and death stories, and the parables. I was a little disappointed that he did not elede any of that finger-pointing in the death story, being a creature of the Enlightenment as he was. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"The Jefferson Bible is a really interesting writing by a man who was very important to our country.

I found his approach to the Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth a really clever way to structure the teachings of the man many believe is a Messiah clearly and concisely without having to concern myself with what maybe simply propoganda (the miracles) or third or fourth hand renditions given that no portion of the New Testament dates from Jesus time on the earth. I won't be exchanging it for my copy of the KJV but I doubt Jefferson had that in mind when he wrote his book."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Thomas Jefferson was an amazing genius. So when I had a chance to read his view of the New Testament, I grabbed it up. His version of the New Testament, which is devoid of the magic and nonsense, makes for a more intimate understanding of the life of Jesus."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"This is a really great book, which gives a remarkable insight into the mind of one of our founding fathers and who he thopught about the christian religion."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Well, first off, this is the \\"Life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\" its not the \\"Jefferson bible,\\" Jefferson would have been horrified if he learned someone took a book where he compiled the moral philosophy of Jesus and called it his bible. I have heard that according to the original preface, it was suppose to be for the native Indians, though there is no evidence of it reaching them, we have no right to create a new motive for Jefferson.Next, Jefferson cutting from a bible and pasting in another book, is no reason for the delight and glee from secularist and horror from Christians. Think about it, Jefferson didn't have a computer where he could copy and paste the moral philosophy of Christ from the bible into a book, so he did exactly what I would do if I had several bibles. I personally once cut verses from a bible to paste in a painting, I suppose 200 years from now, someone will find the painting and think I was some anti-Christian, irreligious, bible hating deist, because I applied my scissors to the Holy Bible!Now as far as the content, so many of reviews just focus and delight on what is LEFT out and yet don't feel any discomfort about what is there. Though it is obvious that Jefferson didn't allow any of Jesus' miracles to be recorded and he didn't include the resurrection of Christ at the end, it is still rather interesting what he did leave in the so called \\"Jefferson bible.\\" There is much more then moral teachings here.So yeah, for a so called \\"Secular humanist\\" among many atheist and a Deist among \\"Christians,\\" how do they make sense of all Jefferson left in? For I suppose they must assume that Jefferson cut out all the supernatural crap he disagreed with, and what is left in the Jefferson bible is the \\"Diamonds from the dung hill\\". The way some reviewers are acting, I suppose we can say what Jefferson left in the Jefferson Bible, he approved of? So what are these diamonds salvaged from the dung hill?I just read the it and inside the \\"Jefferson bible\\" we find many examples of heaven, the fires of hell and both devils and angels. Also, most of Jesus' mentions of the second coming, the final Judgment, the Kingdom of God, salvation, Jesus' mighty works and that Jesus is the Son of God are all here! Jesus affirms the resurrection, Noah and the flood and Sodom and Gomorrah. Most importantly almost every reference to prayer from Jesus is in the \\"Jefferson bible\\", even God giving the Holy Spirit to all who ask. We also find fulfilled prophesy; Jesus prophesies Peter will deny him 3 times before the cock crows and later we read of this happening. So yeah, there is a lot more, I could make this into an extremely long review and just post example after example directly from the eBook, of all that shouldn't have survived Jefferson's scissors and bible blotter!so yeah for a so called Deist, it sure seems odd he didn't clip out all mentions of prayer, God's activity on the earth, as well as prophesy, the second coming, angels and demons and the Holy Spirit and Jesus being the actual Son of God, the Christ and the King whose Kingdom is not of this earth. It would be nice to find some explanation for all Jefferson left in there, if he really was creating for himself his own bible without the supernatural. Is not the resurrection, the Holy Spirit, prophesy and salvation supernatural? Oh Hitchen's and Dawkin's, how did all this nonsense make it into this book from your secular saint?O.K with all of that aside, i must say i really enjoyed \\"The Life and morals of Jesus.\\" As far as Jesus' life, its extremely brief, the book is primarily the read letters of the bible, Jesus' teachings all put together seamlessly. I am glad Jefferson did this, it was a pleasure to read Jesus' teachings without the constant interruptions of miracles."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"I mainly purchased this book because of the show I watched on the Smithsonian Channel. They talked about how time consuming it was for Mr.Jefferson to cut apart 4 original Bibles and compile them into one, taking out all of what he thought wasn't necessary, mainly the religious Dogmas. It was actually more interesting watching the Smithsonian book experts unbind the entire book, and put it back together, not only to restore it, but to preserve it. I believe it took approximately one year, so I thought I should at least read the book that they felt was important enough to do what they did."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"The book is not what I expected, I thought it had some personal points of view or Jefferson's own opinion in some nonetheless excellent lecture.

In fact, seemingly impossible. I have, however always been facinated by the Bible, it's history and our attraction to it. The Jefferson Bible was perfect for me. His verson of the Gospels excludes the virgin birth, the raising of the dead, the casting out of demons and even the ressurection! Instead it focuses on the TEACHINGS of Jesus... the SPIRIT rather than the LETTER. For those interested in the teachings of Jesus without all the 'fantacy' I suggest this book at all costs."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Very important item.

Its called \\"the Life and Teachings of Jesus a restatement of the gospels\\" and it is written by Preston Thomas. This book was produced and based on and inspired by the Jefferson Bible, and Thomas Preston in his forward to his book,quotes from and also reprints part of the forward from the Jefferson Bible. Thomas Preston stays true to the spirit of the Jefferson Bible and preserves the legacy and the purpose of why Thomas jefferson created his own bible.The Thomas Preston version is really a very wonderful reproduction of the Jefferson Bible. This version is more complete,detailed, and thorough than the Jefferson Bible.It contains perhaps alot of parts which Jefferson never included in his own version. This version includes all the details of the life of Jesus and his teachings,starting from his birth,and follows all the way through to his resurrection and final appearances. The text of this version is very easy to read and is in modern English. Thomas Preston also provides ample and thorough detailed explanations and footnotes on each page. This version also is written in a chronological order of events that happened in the life of Jesus.Each section is concise,short and contains all the information and details that you need to know,without overdoing it with too much information or too many detailsIts a sheer Joy to read and is a wonderful way to end each day as you read some each day before you turn off the light to go to sleep.Please check out this version for yourself and see what you think of it,it's also for sale right here on Amazon \\"The Life and Teachings of Jesus a restatement of the gospels\\" by Thomas Preston"},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"The Essentials in a quickly read format. Thomas Jefferson was obviously a busy individual, proving we don't have a monopoly on productivity, and this little book contains a Universe of knowledge that can be read quickly."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"The Life and Morals but Absolutely NOT the Divinity of Jesus of Nazareth.Note: Amazon has grouped together reviews of several different editions of this book; this review is forThe Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth (Little Books of Wisdom).No critique I've ever read better illustrates the problems with Deism, that halfway house on the road to Atheism that now stands derelict and abandoned, than does this fascinating little book BY a Deist FOR Deists (more accurately for one Deist in particular, the author), this despite the fact that in this edition it is presented without commentary (and associated axe grinding) because the work indicts itself.Thomas Jefferson was by any measure one of the smartest men ever to be President; unfortunately, he knew it. As such, he decided that he was smart enough to discern the \\"real\\" teachings of Jesus (the ones he agreed with) from the \\"false\\" teachings of Jesus (the ones he disagreed with). This small book is the result. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have pointed out, he didn't quite succeed, in fact it is an open question whether anyone COULD \\"succeed\\" at such a task. Though long the unholy grail of Rathernottheists, no \\"original\\" document containing Jesus' teachings before they were allegedly \\"modified\\" by would-be martyrs seeking out a phony cause to die for has ever been discovered, leaving them with the difficult task of sifting through the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The trouble is that as Jefferson apparently found, the task is too great or the cost in banished teachings too high.For example while Jefferson removed MOST of the Gospel references to the miracles of the Old Testament, he left in several of Jesus' references to the Flood of Noah, which reminds would-be secular admirers of Jesus of a big problem: whatever THEY might prefer to believe, according to the only records we have, Jesus DID believe in the miracles of the Old Testament or at least repeatedly and publicly professed to.Other omissions result in unintentional comedy. Jefferson stubbornly refused to include any of Jesus' miracles of healing, but he left in the associated arguments with the Pharisees. Thus, it appears herein that the Pharisees were provoked to homicidal fury by Jesus' stubborn insistence in TALKING about the sick and lame on the Sabbath!One wonders what they'd have done to Him if He'd actually healed somebody!Other problems are caused by the inclusion of at least some of Jesus' teachings about Heaven and Hell and His own impending death, which is rendered purposeless by omitting the resurrection. Worse, this leaves unanswered the obvious question: what exactly transformed the feckless bunch of cowards who so disgraced themselves at His crucifixion into the courageous would-be martyrs who proceeded to shake the world with His teachings? You'll get no answer here.For over a century and a half it was the tradition to give freshman congressmen a copy of this book, printed at government expense. IMHO it might have been more useful to give them a copy of THIS book:The Constitution of the United States of America, but even with its manifest flaws, this book makes for a useful and worthy gift, especially to someone who wouldn't be caught dead reading a Bible or a New Testament. As it says in John 7:46 on page 46 of this edition, \\"Never man spake like this man.\\" Even the allegedly secular teachings of Jesus are so remarkable, so powerful as to produce the desire to learn more, and I don't have to tell you where that can lead!Perhaps God DID and can continue to make good use of the Jefferson Bible after all.Note: One could complain that this book is available online for free. Well, yes, what part of in the public domain do you not understand? However, trying to get away with giving someone a printout as a gift will earn you the nickname of cheapskate.

Jesus' life revolved not around his teachings but his identity.A prime example is the fact that Jefferson's text ends with a dead Jesus laid in a tomb. If Jesus was wrong about being the Son of God (the core of his teachings) and never resurrected, how reliable could his doctrine really be?This edition includes:- Background on Jefferson's text written by Forrest Church.- Few pages of Jefferson's actual cut-and-paste copies [fascinating]- Jefferson's entire carved text- Index of used New Testament extractsRead with caution."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"President Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), a deist, believed in the existence of a single deity who was uninvolved in the daily life of people. He disliked both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament for many reasons, especially because they include unnatural, even impossible events. He felt that some, but not all, of the ethical teachings in the Bibles are worth teaching.He - like Leo Tolstoy in his The Gospel in Brief, and others - decided to cut and paste the New Testament Gospels, with no attempt to retain the order of the Gospel writers, and remove those items that distressed him, including the miraculous birth of Jesus, told with different \\"facts\\" in two of the four Gospels, and all of the other miracles, including the events that occurred after Jesus death. He solved the problem of the frequent differences between the Gospels about what occurred to Jesus at different times - for each Gospel has its own version of the life of Jesus that differs widely with the other three - by selecting passages from each that he thought made sense and blending them together to create what he considered a perfect no longer defective Bible, a Bible that teaches morality.Those who suppose that Jefferson's Bible has any relation to the New Testament are mistaken.Jefferson's well-meant volume is like the work of a foolish scientist who had a lovely wife and three beautiful daughters. He loved them all, but he disliked some physical and mental features in each of them; the eyes in one, the ears in another, the legs in a third and the general approach to life in the fourth. What did he do?As a scientist, he was able to graft the four of them into a single woman, a woman of his dreams, a woman who attracted him physically and intellectually; he had the best of the four people most dear to him. Yet when the new creation was completed, he realized his mistake. His beloved wife was gone. True, her faults were removed, but so too was her personality that was so dear to him. Now she was composed of the best parts of his daughters; and, so, how could he live with her as a man lives with his wife; it would be incest. And he had lost his daughters as well. Now, too late, he realized that despite their human faults, these four meant more to him than any \\"perfect\\" being.Bart D. Ehrman highlights a sample of about a hundred thousand differences between the four gospels in his 2009 book, Jesus, Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible (and Why We Don't Know About Them). He points out that there is something far more significant than these different descriptions of New Testament events; it is the fact that each of the gospel writers wrote his book to offer his readers his unique understanding of Jesus life and mission. These views differ greatly. For example, Mark, writing a little more than several decades after Jesus' traditional date of death, emphasized that Jesus was predicting the advent of a new and better world on earth during the lifetime of those listening to him. In contrast, John, who composed his Gospel decades later, after the death of all of Jesus' contemporaries, stated that Jesus' message was that people should strive to achieve an everlasting life in heaven.Jefferson's perfect Bible retains many \\"flaws\\" that Ehrman disclosed exist in the canonical version, such as the census in its opening verse, which history has shown never occurred, and the curious statement that Joseph had to take his family to Bethlehem because one of his ancestors had lived part-time in this city over a thousand years before he was born.However, more importantly, Jefferson demolished the uniqueness of each of the four gospels. He created a Bible that each of the Gospel writers would reject. He distorted the moral teachings in two ways. First, as we said, he changed the overall focus and intent of the document. Second, by mixing the language of each gospel writer and presenting them in his own chronological order, he perverted the details of the teachings.But the most significant problem with Jefferson's Bible and with Jefferson himself is that despite promising the production of a book of moral teachings, he retained forty episodes in which the Gospel writers insulted Jews. The Gospels were written during a period of strife between the Jews and their sister religion Christianity. Both sides had people who made unfortunate overheated remarks. Many of them made their way into the Gospels.The fact that Jefferson retained forty disparaging remarks in a book touted to be a book containing the best of morality, a small book of only 103 pages, is astonishing and tragic. Such insensitivity reminds us of his similar insensitivity toward his slaves. One wonders how such an intelligent man could make such mistakes. To say that he was influenced by his times is no answer. There were many people of his age and of earlier times who rose above bigotry. Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910), in his The Gospel in Brief, wrote his version of the Gospels with the same intent as Jefferson, but his work does not have these statements.Most striking is that Jefferson included the following statement from John 7:1, \\"After these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he would not walk in Jewry because the Jews sought to kill him.\\" This is remarkable because the statement stands alone. There is no connection whatsoever with what proceeds or follows it in Jefferson's Bible. It is gratuitous. If Jefferson could cut miracles and the supernatural from his Bible, why leave this sentence, a sentence that is not connected in any way to morality?While insisting that he would include the ethical teachings of the Gospels, Jefferson violated one of the five basic ethical commands of Jesus, mentioned in Matthew, not to distinguish between people, to treat friends and enemies alike, to love your neighbor as yourself. In fact, Jesus said that this is the principal command.In short, Jefferson saw himself as more able than those people who preceded him in deciding what it is proper for a good person to read. He failed because he distorted what he intended to improve and he created a work that is an embarrassment to thinking and considerate people and a violation of the basic teaching of Jesus."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"\\"And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.\\" (Revelation 22:19)The Jefferson Bible is a book that I read not in search of redemption but out of curiosity. I am a Christian and have been for over eight years. For some time, I revolted against all atheism, and refused to read any literatures against Christianity. But I had discovered as I matured more, that different opinions and beliefs are vital to one's life. I read several books and they were okay, but then I picked up The Jefferson Bible to see what our third President had to offer. I read it open-mindedly; willing to see my convictions changed, as from what I had seen, Jefferson was a brilliant man with much knowledge. The preface provoked me to further curiosity; I found it a bit dry, but it interested me, because of this man's apparent change in life because of this book. As I read \\"The Gospel According to Thomas Jefferson\\" (Forrest Church), I found his history appealing, although a bit confusing. I had always come to the conclusion John Adams had been a Christian, and yet he encouraged Jefferson's efforts in placing \\"the character of Jesus in its true and high light.\\" Jefferson had many encouragers of whom I have never heard of too that were not religious, but materialists, socialists, atheists, etc.Anyways, after concluding that the men of the time of Jefferson were more intent on philosophy that spiritualism, I continued on my research. I studied Jefferson efforts, as he, \\"razor in hand, ... sat editing the Gospels during February, 1804\\" to make Jesus more of a philosopher than a Redeemer. I found that Jefferson's efforts were poor and very disappointingly researched. Jesus, without His leading us to eternal life, has nothing to offer. He had a very few good morals to teach, but each was linked to the Way, and there was no way Jefferson could have depicted them to fit his intentions. I found that Jefferson's Jesus lacked the ingenuity and flowing of readability. Jefferson attempted to only include Jesus' morals and philosophies, but also included several of Jesus claims to being the Son of God, that I would have assumed he would omit. The main catch was that he allowed the verse where Pilate puts up the sign \\"JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS\\" in Jesus' crucifixion, and that he left several mentions of the resurrection. I found that without Jesus Christ's teaching of eternal life, that this work of Jefferson has no authority or reference. It leaves Jesus as more of a heretic than anything else. He refers to God as His Father, and this book portrays Him as one who taught well but lost His mind before His death. It is sad that many consider Jefferson's work a masterpiece. I think Jefferson did his best to portray Jesus in the way he wished (as one who was a great philosopher), but failed.I believe that the only reason for men deeming this as truthful is because they are attacking the truth of Jesus, and will resort to any other than the one truth: that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and He holds to Way to eternal life. It is sad to know how Jefferson and many of his contemporaries end up in the end, condemned to eternal death. For there is no way to Life other than through the Son of God ~ not through \\"Jesus the philosopher\\".I would recommend this book to those curious about Jefferson's beliefs, as they are ingeniously portrayed throughout. But if you are looking to see \\"the true Jesus\\", I am afraid you will be disappointed. Many atheists will do there best to get the most out of it (after blocking from their minds the mention of Jesus' Father and the resurrection as Jefferson did, because He failed to omit it; the Gospels mean nothing without the Truth.), but there is nothing to learn other that Jefferson was lost and so were the others mentioned in the forward, afterward, etc. Jefferson tried to get rid of all that \\"supernatural stuff\\", and though he tried, he only got everything confused. The stuff other than Jefferson's \\"cuttings\\" were well written although a little mislead, so I give it three stars (though if I were going by how much I enjoyed and learned from it, it would be one or two). Does it deserve it? Read it and find out. Good luck.\\"We cannot separate His demands from His love. We cannot dissect Jesus and relate only to the parts we like.\\" --Rebecca Manley Pippert"},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Thomas Jefferson was a man of the (self-described) Enlightenment. Not knowing anything about Christianity, he hated it. He disbelieved in all of its central tenets -- that Christ was Christ, not simply a &quot;moral teacher&quot;; that He was born of a virgin; that he rose on the third day according to the Scriptures; that He ascended into the Heavens; and that he will come again in glory, to judge the living and the dead, among others.Yet, Jefferson called Jesus Christ &quot;the greatest moral teacher.&quot; How could he avoid concluding that He was simply a liar or a lunatic, in light of His claims to be the &quot;Son of Man&quot; and &quot;the Way, the Truth, and the Light&quot;? Simply, he argued that His Apostles had &quot;made it all up.&quot; The Scriptures, if Jefferson was right, were just one big lie.Pity Jefferson. Having no familiarity whatsoever with the writings of the Church Fathers (knowledge of the works of St. Ignatius of Antioch, St. John the Theologian's student at the end of the first century and author of several surviving epistles mandating obedience to one's bishop, might have spared Jefferson the writing of his tres embarrassing &quot;Notes on Episcopacy&quot;), he dared to declare the Church a cabal for &quot;priestcraft's&quot; sake.Silly idea, that hundreds of thousands of people would conspire to become monks in the deserts of Egypt (routinely 120 degrees in the shade), Palestine, etc. Crazy of Saul of Tarsus to give up a position of esteem among his own people for the life of a peripatetic outcast. The only explanation of these phenomena I can arrive at is that these people thought what they were doing was based on Truth.One can grant Jefferson a little wiggle room, in light of his assumption that Roman Catholicism was the oldest variant of Christianity still extant. Yet, others in his day (including other members of the Virginia elite) knew the history of the Church well enough to be familiar with Greek Orthodoxy. (Why did Jefferson insist on equating papal abuses with &quot;Christianity&quot;?) They, unlike Jefferson, did not have a pathological (&quot;sinful&quot;?) aversion to the idea that anyone knew more than they, that their minds were the limit of wisdom. They didn't live the life of Epicurus on a mountaintop like this red-headed prodigal, supported in luxury by their slaves. They had not all bought into Satan's sin.Jefferson didn't know, as we have seen in the last 8 years, that there is a surviving manuscript in Greek from the first century of a large portion of the Gospel of Matthew JUST AS WE HAVE IT, in biblical Greek. So much for the grand conspiracy to make &quot;Jesus&quot; into God. I guess He was God.

Although the government long supported Christian activity among Indians,[12][13] and in Notes on the State of Virginia Jefferson supported \\"a perpetual mission among the Indian tribes,\\" at least in the interest of anthropology,[14] and as President gave financial support for a priest and church for the Kaskaskia Indians, [15] Jefferson did not make these works public. Instead, he acknowledged \\"The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\" existence only to a few friends, saying that he read it before retiring at night, as he found this project intensely personal and private.[16] It is understood by some historians that he composed it for his own satisfaction, supporting the Christian faith as he saw it.

This is a classic work on freedom of religion and US history."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"This book is historically important, and used in US military schools as a template of good values.This book is merely a cut an paste of most of the \\"interesting values\\" in some of the gospels accepted and selected by the church.I do wish that Thomas Jefferson could include the recently discovered gospel of Judas, and also the gospel of Marie.This book should in my view be seen in the historical context of the late 18th century: the Christian church was much discredited by the abuses of the inquisition, and large use of abuse, torture and killing of opponents which were really political opponents.A few examples: In England John Tyndale (his only crime was to translate the bible in english, re-edited by his friend Cannondale, it became, with political help from the king, the \\"King James Bible\\") was burned at the stacke, in France Calas was executed for just not align themselves with the official (and very lucrative) policies of the catholic church.In my view, again, a good book in the historical context.From a theological point of view, unless I missed something, there is nothing really new, just an attempt to create a simple short document, much easier to read than the whole set of the gospels.Here Thomas Jefferson makes the case, that religion without ethical values is mere superstition.But if you wish to know much more about Thomas Jefferson on religious issues, suggest that you also read his writings: many letters including to members of the church will clarify his strictly monotheist, unitarian christian point of view.So byzantine discussions about the theological value of this book, seems to me un-necessary and vaines: christianism like most large religions has many schools of thought, and when disagreement are non violent, then, they are acceptable ones...But the extreme violence that the Christian church unleashed against any unorthodox theologic view, from the twelve century (first crusade 1095) to the present times, must make dissenters cautious.Suggested related reading: (beside the Torah and some accepted version of \\"the new testament\\" (there are many, the ones translated from the Greek language are usually accepted from being of better quality...).1) The Writing of Thomas Jefferson.2) \\"The book of sins\\".3) \\"Misquoting Jesus\\".4) The Gospel of Judas.5) The Gospel of Mary.6) The Chouraqui Bible (In French, my Andre Chouraqui, mayor of Jerusalem).7) \\"The decline and fall of the Roman empire\\" by Edwards Gibbons."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"The best study of the \\"social & moral\\" teachings of Jesusis this version of the Jefferson Bible.It has red-letter text for the quotations of Jesus,and cites the NT passages from which they are taken.It is in the King James version,so you may want to use [...]for the modern English translations of the Jesus quotations,which will give the poetry of the KJV new life.Taking out all the Theology & Eschatologywas a brilliant inovation by Thomas Jefferson."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"God Bless Mr.Jefferson for making this bible;ALL FACTS & NO FICTION.

According to the original preface, it was suppose to be for the native Indians, though there is no evidence of it reaching them, we have no right to create a new motive for Jefferson.Next, Jefferson cutting from a bible and pasting in another book, is no reason for the delight and glee from secularist and horror from Christians. Think about it, Jefferson didn't have a computer where he could copy and paste the moral philosophy of Christ from the bible into a book, so he did exactly what I would do if I had several bibles. I personally once cut verses from a bible to paste in a painting, I suppose 200 years from now, someone will find the painting and think I was some anti-Christian, irreligious, bible hating deist, because I cut and pasted from the bible!Now as far as the content, so many of reviews just focus and delight on what is LEFT out and yet don't feel any discomfort about what is there. Though it is obvious that Jefferson didn't allow any of Jesus' miracles to be recorded and he didn't include the resurrection of Christ at the end, it is still rather interesting what he did leave in the so called \\"Jefferson bible\\"So yeah, for a so called \\"Secular humanist\\" among many atheist and a Deist among \\"Christians,\\" how do they make sense of all Jefferson left in? For I suppose they must assume that Jefferson cut out all the supernatural crap he disagreed with, and what is left in the Jefferson bible is the \\"Diamonds from the dung hill\\". The way some reviewers are acting, I suppose we can say what Jefferson left in the Jefferson Bible, he approved of? So what are these diamonds salvaged from the dung hill?I just read the it and inside the \\"Jefferson bible\\" we find many examples of heaven, the fires of hell and both devils and angels. Also, most of Jesus' mentions of the second coming, the final Judgment, the Kingdom of God, salvation, Jesus' mighty works and that Jesus is the Son of God are included. Jesus affirms the resurrection, Noah and the flood and Sodom and Gomorrah. Most importantly almost every reference to prayer from Jesus is in the \\"Jefferson bible\\", even God giving the Holy Spirit to all who ask. We also find fulfilled prophesy, Jesus prophesies Peter will deny him 3 times before the cock crows and later we read of this happening. So yeah, there is a lot more, I could make this into an extremely long review and just post example after example directly from the eBook, of all that shouldn't have survived Jefferson's scissors!so yeah for a so called Deist, it sure seems Odd he didn't clip out all mentions of prayer, God's activity on the earth, as well as prophesy, the second coming, angels and demons and the Holy Spirit and Jesus being the actual Son of God, the Christ and the King whose Kingdom is not of this earth. It would be nice to find some explanation for all Jefferson left in there, if he really was creating for himself his own bible without the supernatural. Is not the resurrection, the Holy Spirit, prophesy and salvation supernatural? Oh Hitchen's and Dawkin's, how did all this nonsense make it into this book from your secular saint?O.K with all of that aside, i must say i really enjoyed \\"The Life and morals of Jesus.\\" As far as Jesus' life, its extremely brief, the book is primarily the read letters of the bible, Jesus' teachings all put together seamlessly.

He did admire Jesus, saying, \\"Among the sayings and discourses imputed to him by his biographers, I find many passages of fine imagination, correct morality, and of the most lovely benevolence; and others again of so much ignorance, so much absurdity, so much untruth, charlatanism, and imposture, as to pronounce it impossible that such contradictions should have proceeded from the same being.\\" It was Jefferson's view that he himself could sort the truth from the imposture, for he felt that the real words applicable to Jesus were \\"as distinguishable as diamonds in a dunghill.\\" He thought about the process of doing so for many years, did a quick job around 1800 and did a thorough one in 1820. His purpose was to make his own version of the gospels, an extraction that would summarize Jesus's life and morals, for \\"I hold the precepts of Jesus, as delivered by himself, to be the most pure, benevolent, and sublime which have ever been preached to man. I adhere to the principles of the first age; and consider all subsequent innovations as corruptions of his religion, having no foundation in what came from him.\\"It was not enough for the polyglot Jefferson to make such a distillation from the King James Version; he also bought a couple of Greek, French, and Latin versions to use, two volumes of each, for his plan was to cut and paste the parts that he found useful into one volume, but using all four languages. The resultant volume is called The Jefferson Bible, although his own handwritten title page gives \\"The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth, Extracted textually from the Gospels in Greek, Latin, French & English.\\" He apparently studied the volume of his own manufacture nightly before going to bed, but he was horrified at the idea that it be published, feeling that his political enemies would use his ideas against him (his lofty Deism had produced against him charges of atheism) and that this product of his own conscience was his own comfort. His descendants did not know that the volume existed until after his death.The English extracts of the book were printed by the Government Printing Office in 1904 in a small booklet, and a tradition began of having the book be presented to newly sworn in congressmen. Currently in print is an edition from the Beacon Press in Boston, which is entirely fitting, as this is the printing house for the Unitarian Universalist Church.Naturally it is fascinating to go through the little volume and to see what was important to the genius of Jefferson and what was not. He left out all the Old Testament, of course, and all of Paul's additions (he felt that Paul was the \\"first corruptor of the doctrines of Jesus\\"); the Apocalypse, upon which so much of current prophetic beliefs are founded, he said was \\"merely the ravings of a maniac.\\" He must have felt that only the life of Jesus was worthy of study.But even the life does not start out in the way in which we are familiar. The first sentences of Jefferson's Bible have to do with Joseph and Mary going to Bethlehem to be taxed. There is no Annunciation, indeed, no implication that Jesus had any sort of miraculous birth; Jefferson distrusted miracles. Having seen the beginning, I turned to the final pages; I knew how the story turned out, you see, so I did not really risk ruining it for myself. The end is just as worldly; \\"They rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.\\" (Matthew 27:60) There is no magical resurrection in this version. The life and teachings were apparently enough.There is a similar lack of miracles throughout. The story in the ninth chapter of John is cut short, when being presented with a blind man and asked who had sinned, he or his parents, to bring on the blindness, Jesus only gives the comment, \\"Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.\\" This sounds a bit enigmatic to me, and although the blind man may have taken comfort that his condition was not the product of sin..., I cannot think he would be happy at being a display for the works of God. A sighted man would be a better display. Anyway, the episode does not climax with Jesus making mud with his spittle and putting it on the blind man's eyes to bring him vision. One looks in vain in this volume for healed lepers, risen corpses, strolls on the waters, or renewed wine cellars. Such stories were not important to Jefferson; only the life and teachings were.And those teachings, though familiar, are magnificent. Jesus causing the mob self-examination when it was about to stone an adultress is one of my favorites, and of course it is here. There are higher values than obedience to old laws, he makes plain. The widow still gives everything she has, thus giving more than the large sums from the rich. Jesus encouraged love of others, as much as we love ourselves; the love extended to those who have no love for us. The beseechings to do good make me painfully aware that I fall short of the sort of ideal Jesus would want: \\"When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors; lest they also bid thee again and a recompense be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.\\" Surely he was being hyperbolic, but even so, I don't come close.I think the exaggeration does not serve him in many cases. \\"Take no thought for tomorrow\\" I think of as exceedingly bad advice. I hold that there is much to be said for thinking about the here and now, but only a fool never plans for the future. Similarly, the enjoinings to abandon one's family or to give away everything one has to the poor are so far removed from the way my world works (and surely from the way the Nazarene's did, as well) that such exhortation is not only futile but argues against itself.Jefferson has eliminated some of the verses that gave me ammunition against Biblical literalists. He includes the story about Peter denying Christ three times before the cock crows, but omits the pesky Mark 14:66-68 which shows Peter got only one denial in before the crowing. He leaves out the Holy Spirit or any verse that would show Jesus to be divine. He does not include any verses that show Jesus speaking with a short temper to his mother, as at Cana. Jesus certainly does not invite anyone to eat his flesh.I was disappointed at some of the inclusions. It is surprising that the naturalist Jefferson allowed Jesus to go on saying that the mustard seed is the biggest of all seeds and that it grows into a plant bigger than all other herbs. Jefferson had no misgivings over having Jesus speak of a literal Noah: \\"Noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.\\" Not only does this seem to countenance a holocaust worse than any subsequent one (and against a world of poor animals, too), it makes clear that Jesus took the Old Testament myths literally.The biggest disappointment is that although Jefferson saw fit to cut the story before any ascendancy of Jesus into heaven, he retains many of Jesus's parables of what the afterlife is like. This is not so bad in the descriptions of heaven, but also included are Jesus's warnings about hell... It is indeed a shame that Jefferson's admiration for the ethical system proposed by Jesus includes all of his verses that warn about being burned or tortured forever. Jesus's words make clear he countenances such a system. That's not morals, it's monstrosity.I did like the Jefferson Bible, though, for its brief summation of the stories that have changed the world. I like most of all the idea of Thomas Jefferson with scissors and paste finding what was meaningful for himself in the gospels and cutting out his own version. This was the Jefferson who encouraged, \\"Question with boldness even the existence of a god; because if there be one he must approve of the homage of reason more than that of blindfolded fear.\\" His Bible was an act of audacious redaction: he refused to accept the book as divinely inspired holy writ, and determined that he would examine it carefully to see in it what his own conscience and reason showed was good, and follow that good, and ignore the rest. Would that others would do the same."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Thomas Jefferson didn't necessarily believe in miracles. But he certainly believed in morals, ethics, and character. His detractors on the Sally Hemmings farce, like author Joseph Ellis, have since been proven to be all wet. Like the other book of the same name, I enjoyed the book, Jefferson Bible, very much. But, it's only half the story, unfortunately. The other half involves Jefferson's values from the secular point of view. The best, perhaps only, book to read for that is (and don't be misled by the title), West Point: Thomas Jefferson: Character Leadership Education, by Norman Thomas Remick. It perfectly compliments Jefferson Bible. In any event, This book by Forrest Church is well presented and certainly well worth reading. It's a great read on TJ's religious beliefs, and a five-star effort."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"How many of us have read the Bible in its entirety? I dare say, not many of us. Imagine how serious a thinker Jefferson must have been for him to make the effort to do that. On the other hand, imagine how objective a thinker he must have been to fashion, straight from the Bible, the world's first ever bible of morals, ethics, and character. That is one of his little known, most important contributions to humanity. No less than that, my dear fellow Americans, is the true enormity of his Biblical analysis and editing. The only other book I have ever found that recognizes Jefferson as the first to &quot;write&quot; a book on morals, ethics, and character, and in that sense a pioneer itself, is &quot;West Point&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick. To gain more insight into the religious/philosophical side of Jefferson, I recommend you go on to reading that book after reading the &quot;Jefferson Bible&quot;."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Did you ever wonder what the Gospels would be like without all that supernatural stuff? Thomas Jefferson did, and he found out [in around 1820] by using multiple copies of the Bible and a razor blade. The result was The Life and Morals Of Jesus of Nazareth in four languages. The Jefferson Bible reprints the english version of The Life And Morals along with an excellent introductory essay by Forrest Church, Unitarian minister and son of Senator Frank Church, and a decent closing essay by Jaroslav Pelikan. I have known about the Jefferson Bible for years, but finally read it this year on Easter [it seemed like a good thing for an atheist and rationalist to do]. Jesus said some pretty cool things [and some pretty spacey things], and the force of the teachings come out more when divorced from everything else that appears with them in the New Testament. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the teachings of Jesus, or the mind and the religion of the writer of the Declaration of Independence. And if your neighbor starts telling you that the public schools should start teaching the religion of the Founding Fathers, you can give them a copy of the Jefferson Bible."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"\\"The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth; The Jefferson Bible\\" is Thomas Jefferson's Unitarian idea of what Jesus said and believed. Jefferson's idea was simple, but deeply meaningful. Unitarians believe there is one God and that the notion of a 'Trinity' is mistaken. As a Unitarian, Jefferson had the idea of taking the four Gospels, as they were, and cutting out all mention of miracles or of Jesus being God. Jeferson bought two copies of the four Gospels and cut out and pasted together only those passages that quoted Jesus and showed his life and he discarded any direct mention of Jesus as God or anything about miracles. There was no mention of virgin birth or of resurection. Jefferson rearranged the passages, keeping similar themes together, in a logical fashion. What emerged was a book of sayings from a man, who was a philosopher and a teacher and who spoke to everyone about belief in God and moral behavior.If one reads this short book, one finds, as Jefferson did, the teachings of Jesus, stripped of most of the ideas of others. Jefferson's idea had been very simple. However, the book is a wonderful teaching tool, that focuses on Jesus, separate from all that was not important to Jesus, the philosopher and teacher.I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in what Jesus taught, rather than what the various Christian churches teach, today. If you are a Trinitarian Christian (Roman Catholic, Orthodox Christian, or Protestant), I believe that this book will not discourage your own faith, but will help you to understand Jesus and his own teachings."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Thomas Jefferson (TJ) thought very highly of Jesus as a philosopher but he had no use for the dogma of Christianity as developed by those evangelists (as epitomized by Paul) who followed Jesus. He believed the writers of the New Testament to be uneducated; delivering word of mouth, fabricated and exaggerated information decades after the fact, and did not consider any of it to be inspired by God. With encouragement from others, including John Adams, he decided to \\"reorganize\\" the New Testament, deleting the objectionable parts, leaving only the teachings of Jesus.TJ did this twice - once when he was in the White House, spending only 2 or 3 nights on it after doing his routine daily correspondence - and the more definitive version which we have here, when he was 76, about 1820. Since TJ considered anyone's faith to be a private affair, it's not clear whether he ever expected publication. There are hints that he went to some efforts to avoid public knowledge of at least the first version, probably because the more vocal of his opponents already reviled him as an infidel too impious to be president, and a theological heretic.TJ's Bible, only 46 pages, ended up being a rearrangement of the gospels only, excluding any parts he didn't like - virgin birth, miracles, resurrection, and dogma developed by first century Christians. TJ, in a letter to Benjamin Rush describing his planned redaction of the Gospels, said only, \\"I have a view of the subject which ought to displease neither the rational Christian nor Deist.\\" While contemplating his redaction, he wrote, \\"There will be found remaining the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man. I have performed this operation for my own use, by cutting verse by verse out of the printed book, and by arranging the matter which is evidently his, and which is as distinguishable as diamonds in a dunghill.\\"In the second century, Titian wrote the \\"Diatessaron,\\" an attempt to combine and harmonize the four gospels. It enjoyed semi-canonical standing in the Syriac Christian church for centuries. Thomas Friedman has written two books about the Documentary Hypothesis, making the Torah (first five books of the Old Testament) a redaction of several ancient writers. TJ was not the first to attempt improvements on either Testament of the Bible.Careful review of TJ's Bible reveals that it was difficult for him to get rid of all he despised and yet keep all that he liked. Good works were so interspersed with miracles that one could not get rid of the miracle without lessening the value of the moral lesson.To quote from the book, \\"Like other Enlightenment rationalists, TJ was convinced that the real villain in the Christian story was the apostle Paul, who had corrupted the religion OF Jesus into a religion ABOUT Jesus, which thus had, in combination with the otherworldly outlook of the 4rth gospel, produced the monstrosities of dogma, superstition, and priestcraft which were the essence of Christian orthodoxy. The essence of authentic religion, and therefore of the only kind of Christianity in which TJ was interested, needed to be rescued from these distortions, so that the true person and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth might rise from the dead page - the only kind of resurrection TJ was prepared to accept.\\"If this book is to be believed, at least between 1904 and 1956, a copy of the Jefferson Bible was given to each US Senator upon inauguration. As much as TJ believed in separation of church and state, I wonder what he would have thought of this practice.I can highly recommend this little book. It has not only a readable version of the gospels (uniquely shuffled), but a pre-commentary and post-commentary which give a superb view of TJ's religious views."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"The brilliant statesman who drafted the Declaration of Independence and served as America's third president boldly separated himself from the established churches of his day. Regarding Jesus as a great moral guide but not a divine figure, and believing that Jesus' message had been distorted by Christian prelates, Jefferson discarded the Old Testament and the works of Paul, and extracted from the Gospels the basic story and teachings of Jesus to compile what is called The Jefferson Bible. This new Noontide edition of a long-suppressed work is set in large type for easy reading. In an enlightening introduction, Biblical- and religious scholar Dr. Martin Larson explains the deist outlook of Jefferson and some of America's other founding fathers"},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"THE JEFFERSON BIBLE is an interesting historical source by one of America's brilliant \\"Founding Fathers.\\" Many know Jefferson as the author (co-author) of The Declaration of Independence, third US President, architect, etc. What many readers may not know is that Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826)was an accomplished violinist, a brilliant mathematician (he knew calculus which was know as \\"fluctions\\"),and someathing of an expert on the Bible. Jefferson was obviously not a \\"mainline\\" Christian, but he knew the Bible much better than many self proclaimed Christians.As readers may know Jefferson titled his \\"bible\\" THE LIFE AND MORALS OF JESUS OF NAZARETH. As mentioned in other reviews, Jefferson accepted much of Christ's social teachings, but he did not believe in the miracle stories which he thought were exploited to enhance supersition at the expense of moral conduct.Another interesting feature of Jefferson's \\"Bible\\" is that he wrote this source in parallel columes in English, Greek, Latin, and French. This arrangement was designed to help his children to learn these languages. Such work also demonstrates Jefferson's knowledge of fogeign languages.Some editions of THE JEFFERSON BIBLE have photoplates of these translations which would appeal to those who know these languages.Some editions of THE JEFFERSON BIBLE has essays and comments by Jefferson who passionately believed in freedom of religion. Recent \\"critics\\" have attempted to distort Jefferson's passionate defense of religious freedom by claiming he did not claim such freedom. Essays and anecdotes refute such distortions. For example, some have denied that Jefferson used the phrase Separation of Church and State. It was Jefferson who used the phrase that there was a wall of separation between Church and State. Jefferson argued that only error needed defense of the government and that different views should be brought to the bar reason. Truth would stand on her own. One must reaalize Jefferson's time. Terrible religious persecutions in Europe and colonial America were recent history during Jefferson's lifetime. One must remember that the Salem Witchcraft trials occured between 1692-1693.Jefferson accepted reason as an adequet guide to find truth as mentioned above. Some editions of JEFFERSON'S BIBLE have a well written, well reasoned essay of Jefferson's scathing denounciation of John Calvin. This essay is not only penetrating criticism of Calvin, but Jefferson effectively denounces religious persecution in this particular essay.Thomas Jefferson was a brilliantly talented indivudual. His intelligence is reflected in his constitutional thought, mathematics (mentioned above), etc. Supposedly the late US President John F. Kennedy reflected that when there was never so much intellect who sat at the White House dinner table as when Jefferson sat there alone.

Jefferson was earlier in his life leaning more toward Deism and toward the end of his life best described as a Unitarian in the sense that the word was used in that day. In an effort to paint their positions, camps from both sides fail to account for the fact that Jefferson was human and his journey through life developed his thinking in these areas and he showed progression and modification of his positions as learning and experience tempered them.Jefferson clearly rejected Trinitarian theology and believed the gospel narratives to be tarnished with later redaction by the early Church. His \\"Bible\\" as such was an attempt to cull out those redactions and isolate those words and teachings of Christ that reflect the moral code of Jesus Christ that Jefferson held to be the highest such teaching known to man. He was in effect trying to identify that theoretical \\"Q document\\" that Biblical Scholars from Jefferson's day until now believe existed which had only the words of Christ as he spoke them recorded.Jefferson's Bible demonstrates both Jefferson's judgement as to what true Christianity (by his definition) entailed, and also what was baggage and needed to be removed. Jefferson revered Christ's moral code and teachings, even as he rejected his deity. This is eminently clear in Jefferson's writings, especially in his lengthy, latter year correspondence with John Adams.Those who try and demonstrate Jefferson as to one side or the other demonstrate their own bias and need for Jefferson to be cast into their own camp.Don't make the same mistake.

A country founded not on the premise of religious freedom, but more correctly, on the premise of freedom from religion. It is amazing how when the sauce is removedthe size of the meat is quite small. Yet, the original taste comes through like never before. This book was given to every legislator upon arrival to Washington for many years. For some strange reason that has stopped.The ignorant quote and refer to our Founding Fathers like never before, yet they really have no clue as to what their beliefs were. This book could help."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"For those who continually aspire to know Jefferson, it comes as know surprise that his vanity led him to rewrite the bible to suit his own religiosity. Rewrite is a strong phrase really. Jefferson worked over many years (perhaps for only a few hours a week) to put together this final version of the bible. At one level this is simply a cut and paste project. Portions of the bible, those that reflect the morality and courage of Jesus the teacher, have been pieced together and presented as a fairly smooth story. The result is a masterful work which pierces through religious dogma (and, to be honest, anything requiring &quot;great faith&quot;) and brings the essence of Christ's work to the forefront. What was so astounding about this work, besides its readability, was its simplicity. While a cut and paste job for sure, this was not a haphazard project (although the end of the text seems hastened). This is a must read for every student of history, and is strongly recommended for those who desire to come to a fuller understanding of two great minds."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Many Christian fundamentalists would argue that if Jesus was not what mainstream Christian theology says he is, then either he was a liar or a madman. That assumption is based of course on the idea that everything in the New Testament gospels must be taken as if it literally happened, as if the Gospel writers were able to accurately write what Jesus said and did in the same way a reporter could today. Balderdash. ....&quot;Jefferson's Bible&quot; is an attempt--a labor of love--by one incredibly brilliant man to create a gospel that made sense, building on the writings of the original gospel writers (who he unfairly detested but had no choice to rely upon). Was he successful? That's for each person to determine for himself or herself. But whether you are a pure Unitarian (as Jefferson was) or a traditional Christian, or none of the above, the value of his work is in the way he reminds us of the truly wonderful morals that Jesus preached, many of which are overlooked in the lavish doctrinal attention paid to the Resurrection."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"This work condenses the scattered faith documents that are the &quot;Gospels&quot; into a kernel of real truth. It is a truly remarkable piece of work for those of us who believe Christ is more than the charicature that many zealots paint him as today. Jefferson deduced the real message in the New Testament, which was a call to live a better, more ethical life. He saw through the amalgam of Greek mythology, cynic-style homilies, and cosmic-battle cultic material that was mish-mashed together by 2nd century apologists to create a life for a man whose very existence is debatable. Christ is a concept and a model, not a god! Jefferson indeed created a bible that can be used as a life tool, not a tool of oppression and coersion with which one can be saved or damned."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Perhaps the best review is to let Jefferson speak for himself: &quot;To the corruptions of Christianity I am indeed opposed, but not to the genuine precepts of Jesus himself. I am a Christian in the only sense in which he wished anyone to be: sincerely attached to his doctrines in preference to all others and ascribing to him every human excellence, believing he never claimed any other&quot; (from a letter to Dr. Benjamin Rush, April 21, 1803)."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"My earliest impression, carefully molded by my old american historyteacher, was that Tom Jefferson was a red-headed heretic who deniedthe existrence of God.

The revelation came as a shock to this 90-year old Methodist, who still cannot comprehend why a work of thisvalue went unnoticed for so long.Only one greater question remains: Why has the original wisdom ofJesus been so foolishly ignored- for so very long. And, to paraphrase Rabbi Hillel, \\"If not now. when?\\" Yhe indisputable wisdom of the Rule of Reciprocity has been the foundation of ethical codesfrom the beginning of recorded history. Now,I can comprehend G.B.Shaw's comment: \\"the only thing wrong with Chritianity is that it has never been practiced!\\"I have enjoyed giving this work to many of my freinds who have never known of this inspiring work.

And yet he wished for every freshman member of Congress to have in their possession the words of Christ. What does that say about the original intent of what Jefferson himself coined as 'the separation of church and state' in 1802?Please, I would urge all Americans not only to read this brilliant collection, edited by Jefferson himself, but also the complete, original, unabridged writings of one of our most profound, brilliant, intelligent, and spiritual founding fathers and former presidents, Thomas Jefferson. So many questions about our country today, so many questions about the original intent upon the founding of our republic, can be answered by reading his original words.

I am begrudgingly giving the book 5 stars rather than 4 because I want to support and encourage this type of thing, however I found quite a few typographical errors in the beginning of the book and they used a quote from Wikipedia which makes my skin crawl as I have a particular loathing towards it when it's cited as a legitimate source. However, this is my own bias getting in the way and I didn't want it to reflect on the actual content of the book. It's a great book to read, reflecting on the human side of Jesus and not on the 'miraculous' side, a word I am using quite literally.Forgotten Books offers free, online versions of their books.

I would have preferred an explanatory introduction, but the Wikipedia article is just fine too. And, some reviewers of other editions differed with the introductions of those editions. So, the reader of this volume is free to seek out an explanation elsewhere that suits him.Apparently, Pastepot Thomas razored out the portions of the gospels he approved of, consolidated them in more or less chronological order, and excised the mystical/miraculous portions leaving, as he said, the life and morals of Jesus of Nazarus apparently portraying a mere mortal, albeit of gigantic stature.This, to me, provides insight both into the mind of our third President and contemporary political action groups who wish to return America to the Christian nation under God which would actually restrict religious freedom, a premise probably contradictory to our founding fathers, many of whom may have been deists and who did believe in more profound religious freedom.Had President Jefferson completed his \\"gospel\\" 1900 years ago, it might had fit into the concept of midrash mentioned by Earl Doherty in \\"The Jesus Puzzle.\\"An interesting and thoughtful read."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"This book can be used with bible study groups as an opposing viewpoint- Jesus is viewed by Thomas Jefferson as a person who had high morals.

Jefferson examine the writings of Mark/Luke/etc and realized that the only thing that can be trusted, are when the three of them testify to the SAME effect (i.e. the resurrection section and immaculate birth are not taughted by Jesus himself, and they vary between the three accounts). He also points out the main issue: Jesus did not write his own teachings down, and unlike Plato, etc. much of the things we have today in the Bible are written years later, from HUMAN memory. He also points out the paganistic nature of Christianity, which derives from Judaism -- and in order to convert pagans to Christianity, it must have paganistic characteristics, such as supernatural events that Paul and others later added to the bible and thus, corrupted what Jesus taught."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Depending upon their theological positions, people will have different reactions to the selections Jefferson chose to include in his Bible.

I think that distilling the ethicalmessage of Christianity from its mythical elements was certainly a foremost concern of his. Today, we cansee that the ethical teachings of the man Jesus, are not so different from the ethical teachings of mostmajor religious philosophies. I do not think that the Jefferson Bible was a plug for orthodox Christianitybut rather a call for a religious universalism that had yet to be developed.It is also interesting that the Jefferson Bible is published by Beacon Press, the Unitarian-Universalist publishingarm. That denomination itself is moving away from its Christian roots to a more comfortable interdenominational-humaniststance."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"It is interesting that any religious writing that is capable of being used in some way to detract from the \\"authority\\" of the church is so often the object of great discussion. Jefferson's Bible provides such an occasion, for no doubt Jefferson questioned some of the claims of the church that he felt to be unreasonable. That's the bind. We are attracted to Jesus but often repulsed by the Church. It is only fitting that we reclaim Jesus in any way that we can. Jesus is the chief metaphor revealing humanity at its best. Through this metaphor we learn of redemptive love. Jefferson found his lens by which to connect with Jesus. The rest of us must find our own lense--and one way we can do this, perhaps, is by trying to understand what others have done. Jefferson has left us a personal \\"testament\\" by having extracted those parts of the New Testament that spoke to him. Those parts of the Scripture are for him now \\"framed and on the wall\\", so to speak, and because the book has been published, his favorite Scripture portions are spotlighted for us in this book. I'm not sure he meant his special portions of the Scripture to be on public display. Perhaps each of us who are interested might find our own set of very special parts of the Bible? If we ourselves were to do this, that would probably have pleased Jefferson, in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"I have always been interested in Thomas Jefferson. He is one of the most enigmatic of American heroes. All the ambiguity of Jefferson is well documented so I will not go into that here. I also have to state that I have a curiosity about religion and spirituality without embracing any denomination or sect. This made the Jefferson Bible doubly appealing to me. It was an opportunity to get a glimpse of Jeffersons thoughts and beliefs as well as seeing Jesus in a different light. I greatly appreciate being able to read about Jesus removed from the rest of the Bible. This secularizing of Jesus will probably be viewed as blasphemous by some Christians but I found it to be most rewarding. It was great to just view Jesus as the wonderful moral teacher that he was without having some overbearing, self righteous religious fanatic screaming and ranting incoherently. This book brought me closer to Jesus simply by not having to listen to all the negatives trappings many of his so-called followers have tacked on to his message. This is a valuable book on both the philosophical and historical level. It should be read in colleges around the country. I gained a greater appreciation of both Jesus and Jefferson through reading this book."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"If you want to see Jesus in his own words.

He deleted the miracles, resurrection and any strange theological statements he felt was placed in Jesus's mouth at a later date. He was like the Jesus Seminar of the 1800's. I have nothing but respect for Jefferson on having the guts in his time to think for himself and see the logical fallacies in believing in the super natural aspects of the gospels. In reading this I see a lot of similarities to the Gospel of Thomas found at Nag Hammadi in 1946. Jefferson would have been pleased. He searched the Gospels for the \\"GEMS\\" the real Jesus spoke and found them."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Thomas Jefferson, The Life and Morals of Jesus Christ (Beacon Press, 1820)In 1804, Thomas Jefferson, both a rationalist and a deist, decided to sit down with a copy of the Bible (four of them, actually; the original text of this book had parallel columns with English, French, Latin, and Greek texts), excise the best bits of the Gospels, and turn them into a book that Christianity could embrace, casting off all the dogma and silliness that, Jefferson believed, stemmed from Paul (whom Jefferson called \\"the first corrupter of the doctrines of Jesus\\"). He didn't realize at the time that this project would take him, on and off, sixteen years.In 1820, however, Jefferson finished, and the book has been in print ever since (though for most of its twentieth-century existence, only available for purchase at Monticello). Recent years have seen a groundswell of interest in the Jefferson Bible,\\" as it is known, and a number of new editions have appeared. Mine has an introduction by Forrest Church and an afterward by Jaroslav Pelikan. I mention this because, in fact, there's no real reason to review the text of the book itself; if you've read the Bible, you've read this (although reading this may put some of the Gospels in an entirely new light for you).Church's introduction is a wonderful, wonderful thing. He recounts much of the history of Jefferson's project, and some of the cultural influences that caused him to abandon it and take it up again later, in the process painting a picture of a few of our founding fathers. It's wonderfully readable, not nearly the dry, boring text one so often finds in introductory pieces, and it alone is worth the price of admission here.Pelikan's afterword, while not quite as fascinating as the introduction, is also quite valuable. Whereas Church focuses on the construction of the document, Pelikan addresses its theology, specifically in comparison with authors contemporary to Jefferson. Church puts the book into context with American culture, Pelikan with European.It's fantastic stuff. Highly recommended. ****"},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"First, and foremost from my perspective, I liked that Jefferson focused on the man Jesus and what He taught.As I travel my spiritual path, my focus is also on the man Jesus, what He taught, how He lived and most of all how He treated others.

Very interesting and attractive book"},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Thomas Jefferson's \`wee-little book' as he called it, is dense with meaning and reflection. It reflects a couple of core matters. First, it is the picture of Jesus as Thomas Jefferson viewed and admired him; one of history's greatest teachers of ethics & morality. Jefferson seemed fully impressed by Jesus' not yet fully developed ethical system because it demonstrated his moral genius as a reformer in Judaism and, because his teachings exceeded religion, philosophy in general.There was one problem for Mr. Jefferson. Jesus' moral genius lay encumbered between the pages of a large book filled with, to Jefferson's eyes, primitive stories of miracles, healings, and divine proclamations which were anathema and completely irrational to the Enlightenment mind. So called divine revelation was abhorrent and out of the touch to evident natural design uncovered by the emerging sciences. Deism, which viewed God as setting the laws of nature in order or tuning them up, and then stepping back, was the outlook for many at the time.So that Jesus, the great moral reformer, might be gleaned clearly, Jefferson took two sets of Gospels and, with scissors and glue, cut out those verses from the Gospels expressing, what was best and, for him, true of Jesus' teachings. That meant, no miracles or talk of divinity on Jesus' part. Instead, the focus was on living an ethical life and our simple duties to God, and others. The task was, for Jefferson, as easy as separating diamonds from a dunghill, to paraphrase a statement of his. As with any portrait of Jesus, this portrait also mirrors the portrayer; and is good insight into Mr. Jefferson's ideals.First, how does this version of Jesus fare? I can speak only for myself, but for me Jesus loses nothing. He comes across just as charismatic as the Young Reformer and willing to intellectually tangle with the religious authorities of his times. In fact, having isolated the other qualities, Jesus' skill as a teacher and teller of parables may be better able to shine through; which was Jefferson's hope and goal for himself.As intriguing and practical as this Jesus may at first sound, be warned in advance that Jefferson does not omit, but in fact, includes many of the \`hard sayings' of Jesus. In fact, stripping his Teacher Jesus of Divine Entitlements and demanding belief as the gateway to salvation, he is now more concerned with people's moral behavior and how they treat others, specifically, the poor. And, those tied to their wealth, or blind to the plight of others, face being \`cast into outer darkness.' Of course, the Jesus in the full Canonical Gospels made these statements (as, again, that's where Thomas Jefferson retrieved his material), but now such statements may stand in greater resonance so isolated.At the beginning and sometimes end of many editions, there is a preface and introduction regarding the history of the Jefferson Bible and what steps led Thomas Jefferson to edit his own version which is enjoyable and insightful. All, no matter their beliefs or backgrounds, should read this book as a reflection on the thoughts of one of America's Founding Fathers, and, of course, author of the Declaration of Independence."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Cannot believe the reviews that claim this book 'proves' that Jefferson was a Christian (apparently in today's conservative terms). Jefferson was a Deist. This book was created by him, for him. He used inspiration from Jesus' words to guide his daily life; a moral compass. Jefferson believed in a 'Supreme (or Great) Architect of the Universe', and that being set things in motion, leaving man to finish them on his own. To Jefferson, the book he created was his intimate guidebook when he was in a moral quandary. It was not his intention for it to be mass produced.

I have learned that there is some controversy about this book. Most importantly, the book we read is NOT what Jefferson wrote; there are no surviving, complete copies of what Jefferson produced. Someone found the bible from which he cut Jesus' words and fashioned what we know as the Jefferson Bible from what was missing. The only thing that survives of what Jefferson made is the first page...so, pretty much nothing. Secondly, he produced the book to remove the miraculous, but to provide non-Christians with an overview of Jesus' words. Rumor is he made if for distribution among the American Indians.

Much of the editing of the Gospels involved first reviewing its contents in ancient Greek & medieval Latin, then, comparing these to modern (18th Century) King James English & French versions). Jefferson produced this condensed & rational version over many years, including editing in evenings at the White House, after his official duties were complete. I think of it as 'Mr. Jefferson's self-therapy' that kept him sane enough to cope with the pressures of the Presidency. In effect, Jefferson took the 'supernatural & superstitious fundamentalism' out of the gospels while preserving the common decency and ethical content which he considered to be Jesus' virtue as a human spiritual model."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"I am a former Christian-Baptist turned rationalist (some people refer to us as athiests).

His faith was so strong in the Lord that he was one of the founders of the Virginia Bible Society. In December of 1801 after the Capital was built, President Jefferson made a proclamation to have Sunday services held in the Capital building in which Jefferson attended every Sunday until the end of his presidentcy. The Capital held services until the end of the 19th century. Jefferson wrote \\"The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazarath,\\" to be a missionary tool to help in evanglizing the Indians. Reading the Words of Jesus Christ without the regular commentary from the Bible was revolutionary in itself but made it easier for the Missionaries to use so that the Indians could get to know who Jesus was. This is an excellent book for all Americans to have."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"Don't listen to the re-written nonsense history about how Jefferson created this bible so he could pick and choose what he believed for himself. No, the historical truth is this:This abridged compact version of the bible was created by Thomas Jefferson specifically for use by ***Christian missionaries to the Native Americans.***Around 1803 a Scottish minister pointed out the impracticalities of having to print and lug around the entire bible, most of which you can't really understand until after you've been a Christian for many years. He suggested that if the missionaries were going to be successful then they needed a compact version of the scriptures.So! Jefferson created this compact abridged version for simplicity of transport and ease of understanding the life, the miracles, and the teachings of Jesus Christ ***for missionaries to the Native Americans*** ~ and this ingenious volume transmits a basic working knowledge of the Christian Faith for beginners.It really is that simple. I read these other reviews and want to crack up laughing: what a bunch of nonsense, lies, and re-writing of history. Seriously, people! America's founding fathers WERE Christians and this country WAS built on Judeo-Christian morals and beliefs and... the Bible. Deal with it lol!Oh, and another thing of note: Thomas Jefferson ***continued*** his missionary activities to the Native Americans even after becoming President, going so far as to authorise the use of federal funds to finance missionaries to the \\"Indians\\" and the building of churches for the \\"Indians.\\"This abridged \\"missionary bible\\" is still a good idea for any new Christian or anyone that is curious about the Christian faith but does not want to slog through the entire library of sacred books that make up the entire bible.Avoid the Smithsonian version of the Jefferson bible: they skillfully pick-and-choose from his 19,000 different letters, isolating text and stitching together a false image and understanding of Jefferson.

As Howard Simpson demonstrates in his book, a bad rash of typhus or yellow fever can cause the best-laid plans of mice and men to disintegrate into a hospital ward filled with disabled or dying soldiers.The book covers the early colonial periods to the Spanish American War, when progress finally started being made in controlling epidemic disease amongst soldiers in armies. Along the way, Simpson entertains us with one tale after another of military campaigns that collapse along with the sometimes thousands of soldiers, dying at a frightening pace from various epidemics. Particularly important, in my view, is the utterly disastrous attempt by Napol&eacute;on to re-conquer the rebellious island of Haiti. Although his troops easily rout the forces of the Haitians, they are quickly destroyed, by the tens of thousands, by yellow fever. Napol&eacute;on's own brother-in-law numbers among the dead. Napol&eacute;on had been planning to make Haiti his base for the re-establishment of a French colonial empire in the New World. The catastrophic losses he experienced in Haiti convinced the emperor that the cost of the New World was too high, and he set in motion the events that would lead to the Louisiana Purchase.Simpson is truly entertaining to read. He has a good writing style, and a rather warped sense of humor, which makes reading even a grisly subject such as this a pleasure. Don't miss his comments about the Indian tribe that throws dead animals and skins into a stream...upstream from an encampment of British troops that subsequently becomes mighty sick. My wife and I laughed quite a bit over that section.This book is both enjoyable and informative. I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Invisible Armies: The Impact of Disease on American History","review":"This book is about the influence of disease on American History. It treats this subject in the broadest possible context, covering events that occurred beyond the borders of the United States, but whose history impacted that of the US. Thus, it covers disease in Panama, the site of the canal that the US was to build and Haiti, in so far as this caused Napoleon to abandon the French dream of an American empire and sell his Louisiana territories to the US. Except for a few paragraphs on the Spanish-American War and some discussion of Cholera and Typhoid in the latter half of the 19th century, the text ends with an interesting chapter on the Civil War. There is no discussion of WWI or WWII. Overall, the writing is entertaining, non-pedantic and very suitable for a general audience. While I feel that little new material was presented, the author did a good job of describing the impact of disease on American History in a manner that highly accessible and entertaining for the general reader. However, experts in American History will likely feel that there is little new here.While I liked this book, I do not feel that it is up to my criteria for five stars. It does not contain any maps, which I feel is a must for any history book. Strangely enough, given that the author is a medical doctor, it also lacks any biological discussion of the diseases covered, which I feel also reduced the utility of the text. For instance, malaria is discussed, but there is no discussion of the organism that causes it, or of the types of malaria and their relative mortality.All in all, a solid 4 stars - a good choice for the general reader, but somewhat less so for those with more background in American History."},{"Title":"Wolf-Woman","review":"It has been many years since Tanith, the woman of the wolves, has lived with the wolves' clan.

However, soon Tanith sees that there is, for the first time since Nolwynn died, someone in the human clan who wants her - the youth Gibran. Tanith is forced to make a painful decision between living with the humans and living with the wolves. Tanith is an unusual story set in ancient times combining the feelings of love,hate, betrayal, and the animal kingdom."},{"Title":"Wolf-Woman","review":"Wolf Woman was about a girl who had lived with wolves for about two years and was found by a man called Ahearn and when he took her back she was treated badly by Ahearn's clan. Here is a bit about the book.In the beginning Tanith was rescued from the wolves. Tanith was then officially made the Chieftian's adopted daughter. She was treated fairly and kindly by the Chieftain and his wife but she was treated with prejudice by the clan of Ahearn (the Chieftan). After that her adoptive mother Nollwyn passed away and Tanith was devastated. Ahearn then remarried and Tanith was seen as a burden on the clan and was treated even worse. Ahearn was then injured and Tanith was EXPELLED from Ahearn's house and went and lived with the wolves. She loved to live with the wolves."},{"Title":"Wolf-Woman","review":"Tanith is an enjoyable book with sad, happy and emotional parts. Sherryl writes enthusiastically with a lot expression. When I read the book in my head I could feel what the characters felt, I could see what the characters saw and what the characters did. I could picture the story clearly in my head.Tanith lived with Aherns people for 13 summers but still had memories of the wolves. I like the book because of the wolves. I think the book always kept you on the edge of your seat with, what is going to happen next? In the book there were a lot of ups and downs."},{"Title":"Wolf-Woman","review":"I think Tanith is a great book. It has something that I find in no other book. Maybe it is the characters' personalities. I do not know. But I do know that Sherryle Jordan is a talented author. Tanith has to be the best book I have read for ages. Tanith is not a book that does not help you imagine. It really takes you along for a ride. You always know what is happening and sometimes you feel just like Tanith walking with the wolves and living with a tormenting clan. You can really be anyone you want to be. Tanith covers all the emotions like love, sadness, surprise, boredom, happiness and regret. It is a very powerful book and I know almost every one who has read it in my class would love it if there was a sequel. The main characters in Tanith are of course Tanith,Ahearn, Nolwynn, Morag, Hrothi, Tallil, Sabra, Gibran, Gibran's Father &amp; the rest of his clan and Ahearn's clan. They are all human characters but there is another cast of characters which you come to love and know nearly as much as Tanith. They are The Wolves. Their names are: Ashok, Shula, Kalasin, Raida, Zaal and Zeki and the black wolf. I have told you the names of the characters but if you want to find out the characters' personalities and places in the book you will have to read it yourself."},{"Title":"Wolf-Woman","review":"Little is known of feral children, yet Sherryl Jordan describes a very real scenario in this book.

The Indians had put her with wolves to be found by someone else. Ahearn, the leader of a village, found Tanith. Ahearn's village was not an Indian village. Tanith is brought to live in the house of Ahearn. Ahearn's wife, Nolwynn, is happy to adopt Tanith because she had lost her own child.Later on, Nolwynn dies. Everyone was sad for a few weeks. Then Ahearn got remarried to a woman named Morag. Morag and Tanith don't get along. So Morag sends her on a task. While Tanith is gone, Morag tells Ahearn she ran away. When Tanith returned, Ahearn sends her away. She returns again later and she discovers that when Ahearn had been looking for her, a bear had attacked him.Tanith is given a medicine in the village to make her think wolves are bad when it is discovered that Tanith has been visiting the wolves again.She falls in love with a man the same age named Gibran. Tanith goes with Gibran to a village where he was born. When they get there, they are given gifts and presents and have a big feast for Gibran's return. While visiting Gibran's village, Tanith starts to see things and when she recovers she sees that Gibran had a cut on his face, and realizes that she has done it.She runs back to her former village and finds that four of the wolves that she had known and loved are lying dead on the ground in front of the village. Tanith runs into the forest to the fifth wolf that has not been killed. She finds out that the wolf has mated with another female wolf and that they have wolf cubs.My favorite character was Tanith because she can understand the wolves, is friends with them, and was living happily with the wolves. Tanith has to choose which cry to answer: the wavering, longing bellow of the human or the steady, beating call of the wolf. I also like Gibran because he is strong, brave, kind, fierce, and soothing to Tanith, and he just seems like a really nice, caring guy. I also like him because it does not seem to bother him that he is not Indian and Tanith is an Indian.I recommend the book because it is an exciting story. It is an adventure that makes you want to know what is going to happen next. There is sadness and anger in the book but I liked that because it made the story seem realistic. There is also happiness because Tanith gets to be with the wolves again.My opinion of the book is a 9 out of 10 because they don't explain a few things very well such as not saying from what tribe Tanith comes. I wish they had a sequel for the book."},{"Title":"Wolf-Woman","review":"It held my attention through out the book, it was so realistic and it moved me in so many ways, I think it was just so well-written and it's a real favorite.."},{"Title":"Wolf-Woman","review":"This book is just that, with a little bit of everything. Set in a prehistoric setting in first person, the reader can really connect with every one of Tanith's (the main character) thoughts. Tanith lived with wolves as a small child before the tribe of Ahear came to kill the wolves and return her to human society, treating her as nothing more than a slave. Soon she begins to long to return to the wolves, who treated her more kindly than any human ever did. But a young man from a neighboring tribe inevitably falls in love with her and offers her a home with his less savage clan. Tanith is left to chose between the worlds of wolves and humans. It's actually something like Julie of the Wolves, but far more detailed in plot and character, and worthy of a wider range of audiences. I've read it at least ten times over since the age of nine, and I'm still not tired of it. I'd reccommend this to anyone, whether they are friends of wolves or not."},{"Title":"Wolf-Woman","review":"Wolf Woman is a powerful novel written through Tanith's eyes. In the book you feel all Tanith's feelings, her thoughts. I think that Tanith is physically human, but mentally wolf. She is calm, carefree and happy when she is with the wolves, and, although when she is with her \`human friend' Gibran [whom she loves] she is happy, most of her other feelings with humans have been worry, confusion, sadness. Her clan hates the wolves, so when the two worlds clash, her feelings turn to confusion, grief, hatred. Tanith has many different emotions rolled into one, which creates one of the best and most powerful book I have ever, ever, read! I think that the book is good because it is not too unrealistic, like some fairy tales where the good characters never die, the bad guys always die, etc, etc, etc. Tanith is such a realistic book you feel like you're living in the time of Tanith, Woman of the Wolves."},{"Title":"Wolf-Woman","review":"Tanith is a novel by Sherryl Jordan and is an extremely good novel, too. It is set thousands of years ago, in South America and the main character is well, guess... Tanith. A quick summary of the start: Tanith was born and taken into a wolf clan as a young baby, there she stayed for 5 seasons until adopted by a small clan with a chieftain called Ahearn. Tanith has trouble being in Ahearns clan, because she loves the wolves and wants to go back to see them, but her clan's biggest enemies are the wolves and so she becomes hurt by the clan's insults and warnings about the wolves. A few words to describe the novel: Definitely educational, unique, romantic, enjoyable and unusual. Glossary: *Clan = another word for a tribe; *Tribe = a group of animals\\\\people who live together and follow the same religion or god\\\\s; *Seasons = an old word for years; *Chieftain = the person [used to nearly always be men] who is in-charge of the clan and who sets orders and things;"},{"Title":"Wolf-Woman","review":"Wolf Woman is an exciting story I read.

It by far one of the best I've ever read.P.S. There is one thing I'd like to point out that none of the other reviewers seem to have gotten right: the book takes place somewhere in Europe shortly after the first century A.D. Not in South America, and certainly not in prehistoric times, because there is mention of the Lion and the Lamb which is Jesus Christ, and traveling storytellers are only called bards in certain places in Europe."},{"Title":"Wolf-Woman","review":"This is such a beautifully written book That I read it in one day and now I wish there was another....I love wolf/malamute books but even though Wolf-Woman didn't have that much on the wolves it was Really GOOD....I highly reccommend this book!!!!"},{"Title":"Wolf-Woman","review":"I love wolves and nature and I could not put this book down!!!!

After a victorious win, Ahern, a chieftain of a blond haired clan finds her. Tanith learns to live with the clan and Ahern and his first wife - Nolwyn. Then Nolwyn dies and the only thing Ahern has left to keep is Tanith. Ahern starts living with his second wife. She wants to keep Ahern all to herself and soon enough the whole clan is against Tanith. Beneath her heart, Tanith is craving for the wolves but Gibran, a pledge son is holding her back from going with them. How can Tanith live through this type of mockery and evil? But how can she leave Gibran, who wants to marry her? She only has five days to decide where her love will stay and whether peace can be with her once again. Troubled, puzzled and totally losing her mind Tanith has to think fast before her time is up. Trapped between the two worlds in her heart, Tanith is forced to choice between them. So she runs away to the wolves. The thing I liked most about this book is that this story is actually telling you that wolves and humans are equivalent in the ways you would least expect. When I say this I mean that wolves are a clan and people are a clan, and that wolves can respect you and people can respect you but, in their own type of way. In reading this book, I learnt allot about the habits and behaviour of wolves. The thing I liked most about the main character - Tanith was that even though Tanith was a female, she still was independent and strong against male.Lauren Bamford Age, 11"},{"Title":"Rhapsody","review":"Adult Black and white graphic novel/collection of stories.Rhapsody is a collection of five story sections.The first section is titled \\"Rhapsody of a Brother and Sister\\" and includes four stories (\\"volumes\\"). The first story involves the brother mooning over a girl, and the sister that is jealousy. The sister has taken care of the brother since their parents died, and, as she notes: \\"[y]ou need no one but me.\\" The brother and sister have a very close relationship. Too close. The second story involves the brother and sister being too close some more, and a memory of when they found out that their parents had died. The third story involves the girl the brother likes stopping by the apartment. The girl and the brother go up to the brother's room, and then the sister calls the brother downstairs, tells him to stay down there and the sister heads to his room. When the girl refuses to leave the brother alone, the sister sexually attacks the girl: \\"I'll make it so you never show your face in front of my brother again.\\" The last story follows directly on the third. After the rape, the brother (so far unaware of what really happened), confronts his sister while she is in the shower. The sister tries to go down on the brother, but he pushes her away. But that doesn't last. The artwork in these stories is good, nothing is censored, but the subject matter is off-putting.The second story section involves a one part story called \\"Our Relationship.\\" This story involves a very smart, beautiful high school girl, named Saeki, and the girl, named Ryoko, that she \\"stalks.\\" After learning that Ryoko needs to take a make-up test, Saeki invites herself to become Ryoko's tutor. Ryoko's nervous about the situation. Then she learns that Saeki, the girl that could get into any university, is intentionally failing her tests so that she could remain in the school with Ryoko. One thing does not lead to another, as there is no sex and no nudity.The third story section involves another one part story, this one called \\"A World of Beautiful Women.\\" This story involves a school club that needs one more member to stay open. A strange all-female \\"Conjuring Tricks Club,\\" involving bondage. A woman is stripped, bond and made to join the club (oh, and all this nudity and bondage is occurring outdoors, on what might be school grounds). Good artwork, good story.The fourth story section is yet another one part story, this one called \\"Got Milk?\\" This story involves a man and woman that have been going out for a week. When the man finds and reads the woman's planner, he finds out that the woman goes out with other men. The woman spots him reading the planner and begs him to not leave her, and that she will do anything to keep him. The man asks for milk, the woman brings it, and then an odd sequence of events unfold. The man shoves the woman over, shoves the milk into one of her holes in her lower body, and basically attacks her. Interesting little odd story.The last story section is yet another one parter, and a return to incest, in the story titled \\"Little Sister's Feelings.\\" Yet again, the brother wants to break off the relationship, and the sister doesn't want to do that (difference being that this time it is an older brother/young sister relationship). The brother says that he likes one of his sister's girlfriends. The sister \\"make[s] [his] wish come true.\\" The brother and the girlfriend enjoy each other while the sister watches.Overall, the subject matter was a little too off-putting.

It follows with equally erotic and taboo stories about lesbian stalking, group bondage sex, and non-tradiational toys."},{"Title":"Rhapsody","review":"Some of the reviews for this book are from people complaining about the subject matter. Well, the books cover clearly states that its contents are \\"taboo\\" and \\"incest\\", so if that turns you off, just buy something else.If, however, you can enjoy a fantasy of sex between a brother and sister, which is what most of this (pretty thick for what it is) hentai is about, then you're likely to love this.Theres a bunch of short stories of an incestious relationship between the same brother and sister, a not very graphic story about two schoolgirls where one has the hots for the other, a story about a girl that gets tied up and \\"raped\\" (in a very friendly way) as a sort of sorority initiation, and some other stuff I haven't read yet.The drawings are very nice in my opinion, and the storylines and ideas are, although fit for hentai and not much more, pretty good. And you get more pages than usual for the money.Like someone else wrote though: The pages do fall out really easily, so it's kind of tricky to read.Hentai is an excellent place to submerge yourself in forbidden fantasies and surreal situations. Not necessarily things you would like to experience in real life, but excellent eroticism nonetheless. This book presents some quite raunchy and forbidden scenarios, of the kind you might think about when you're 14 and 15 and then forget about or learn to shun. It's a great book to spice up your imagination a little. Everything goes in hentai, that's one of the things that are so cool about it. And you don't have to worry about any negative consequences that might arise in real life.Of course, if the mere thought of a brother having sex with his sister is a huge turnoff for you, this might not be your cup of tea. But if not, just relax and enter the fantasy, it's a good book."},{"Title":"Naturally Intelligent Systems","review":"It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words. Well, this book chose the thousand-word route in most cases. Neural nets are ideal candidates for illustrations. So, why they decided to use endless descriptions is beyond me. It is like giving directions over the phone when a map would get to the point much faster.It also needed to explain more conceptually how neural nets actually work, not just how they are arranged. Examples where the net matches one-to-one with an actual image or pattern are easy to follow, but how they recognize different variations of patterns (variety) I never got a good feel for from this book. However, the description of an Adeline node was pretty good."},{"Title":"Naturally Intelligent Systems","review":"This book walks through practical examples of various neural network designs and their relationships among eachother."},{"Title":"Naturally Intelligent Systems","review":"The book is a very inspiring introduction to artificial neural computing.

This book along with a mathematical rigourous book can provide a very good understanding on the modern neural network research."},{"Title":"Naturally Intelligent Systems","review":"It jumped from super-trivial to complex too fast for me, becoming a mere catalog of techniques instead of an explainer of them. For example, I got a feel for how basic image recognition can work, but not for say identifying image patterns of different orientation (rotated) or scalings. I think it should have focused more on making sure the reader had a feel for how neural nets work using basic networks first rather than being so eager to try to cover all the variety of nets there are. More step-by-step state diagrams would have been helpful. Though, the explanation of the Adaline wasn't bad."},{"Title":"Rommel Plot (#81250)","review":"This convoluted and tepid WWII thriller takes place in 1942 after the D-Day landings at Normandy but before the Allied breakout. There are actually multiple plots, one is by a group of German army officers seeking to blow up Hitler and install Rommel as the president of a Germany that would then come to terms with the Allies and concentrate on fighting Stalin. The main plot however, concentrates on a British spy who comes up with a workable plan for assassinating Rommel as he partakes of his weekly hunting session. Although he never gets the go-ahead, he decides to pursue the plan while on the run. Two killers are dispatched from England to stop him, and they work with the French to track him down. There are far too many players, none of whom rises beyond cardboard characterization. The ending culminates in a series of silly predictable (especially if you know how Rommel really died) ironic reversals.

The nuances I did not understand as a youngster meant so much more to me now. I must say I did not enjoy this author's other book (The Fortune Hunter.) However, it is a real loss that the author passed away so early in life. Based on The Rake and the Rebel), I know we would have had many more great books from her.The book is set in Regency Russia. It is the story of a young girl who grows into womanhood. She lives with the family of the \\"Rake\\" of the book.

The book is set in 1811 Russia and is very difficult to set down once opened.I actually obtained my copy from my city library after it was retired from circulation, but I highly recommend that folks who love a good romance told with style, wit and attention to detail to obtain a copy of this book."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"This book was written in 1952, just after Queen Elizabeth took the throne, and is an odd look at what Nevil thought would happen to the British Commonwealth, and specifically to the concept of Royalty, under the influence of post-WWII economic and political pressures, over a period of 30 years from the time of the book's writing. As is typical for Nevil, the book has no bad guys, no sharp dramatic tension, but rather some fine character portraits, a properly told love story, and some very exacting insights into social and political structures.The book is actually told in two separate pieces. One is a framing story of an elderly Church of England pastor newly assigned to a rather remote area of the Australian outback and his efforts to minister to a flock that is literally spread over an area larger than many states. Nevil's description of the area and people in this area both during the dry season and 'in the wet' is startlingly full of life, a fine portrait that does much to illustrate some of Nevil's social commentary, which creeps in almost from the side, rarely directly presented. But from this everyday world, we move to a totally different one as our priest, suffering from malaria induced fevers and hallucinations, is forced by circumstance to minister to an old, dying drunkard, Stevie. In trying to learn about Stevie's past, we enter the world of the future, as Stevie's half-incoherent words combine with the priest's inner hallucinations to form the story of David Anderson, an Australian pilot chosen to fly the personal aircraft of the Queen.This vision of the future shows an England of near total socialism, sadly depopulated by emigration to other Commonwealth countries, poorly ruled and near bankrupt, questioning the value of supporting the royal family. Opposing this are the pictures of Canada and Australia as vibrant, growing economies, and where one of the key differences in government is the idea of individuals being able to earn more than the basic one vote, available to everyone, by education, military service, public service, travel, and by special dispensation (i.e. 'The Queen's Favor). Supposedly this form of enfranchisement has led to better, more efficient government - whether it really would is an obvious topic for debate.What is intriguing about this is just where Nevil got events right and where his vision diverged from what really happened. Little things like his prediction that Christmas Island would be turned over to Australian governance in 1961 (actual was 1958) and his portrait of a middle-aged Queen Elizabeth (startlingly accurate) and major things like his prediction of England's economic sharp decline and turn towards socialism show just how in tune with the times Nevil was. At the same time, his predictions on technology were sadly off the mark, the 'security' procedures surrounding the Queen are almost laughably inadequate when seen from today's viewpoint, and he took the problems of England too far, not foreseeing its eventual recovery from losing its empire.Lying atop all of this is a finely told love story between David and Rosemary, a secretary to the Queen. Nevil's characterization is always very strong, and his ability to show a slowly developing attraction is highly realistic and satisfying. And just under the surface is some commentary on issues of race, as David is one-quarter abo, and commonly goes by his nickname of 'Nigger'. Nevil is clearly pointing out the invalidity of judging people by race, and by extension he makes the point that all 'class' distinctions are artificial and, in the long run, detrimental. In presenting this point, he shows some of the treatment of the 'servant' class in ways that may offend some modern sensibilities, but his portrayal is very accurate for the times.The last portion of the book gets into a metaphysics where all religions have a validity and circles back to the book's starting point, providing much food for thought well beyond the parameters of his envisioned future.Each of the above items adds to the total of this very strong book, a book that has been sadly neglected and out of print for a long time. It is very encouraging to see most of Nevil's works being brought back into print in the last couple of years, as almost all of his works are deserving of a read, this one especially so."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Nevil Shute captured some wonderful ideas about balancing the power of governance. In his new utopian community, created as a result of the horrific expense of maintaining the &quot;royals and their lifestyle&quot; should be explored for implementation in the U.S. By Shute's plan every man and woman received a birthright vote. However, you could add votes, up to a maximum of 4 (total votes to be cast = 5) by the following: (1) if you owned property -- I believe this was a requirement in early history. (2) If you completed a certain level of education -- presumably public high school (3) If you served your country in the Armed Forces, and (4) reserved for very special situations, like the Congressional Medal of Honor or the Nobel Peace Prize. With all of our computer technology this seems to make great sense to vest the governance of our country with those who have, mostly by their own efforts, contributed more than just being born and having a birthright vote."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Nevil Shute has the most emotionally compelling writing styles I've ever encountered. &quot;In the Wet&quot; is a odd and lovely example of this. Without ever being maudling, in a quiet, understated way Shute weaves a beautiful combination of feeling and character.&quot;In the Wet&quot; takes place in the Australian Outback. One can feel the heat, the dust, then the rain and the mud, as well as vividly seeing and being part of the scenery. The story is that of a Church of England parson well past his prime running a church in a very remote and widespread area. He's a practical man, acknowledging that &quot;wrong isn't always wrong&quot; in the Outback. He encounters a dying man who takes him on a trip through reincarnation, telling the tale of the life the man will live his next time around.As science fiction the book is severely outdated, yet--I've found this works well with the bomb classics like Shute's &quot;On the Beach&quot;--if you read it more as alternate history rather than a look to the future (the 'future' is the 1970s in this case) you'll be able to enjoy the wonderful writing, well-rounded characters, and the solidly crafted plot."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"As a dying man drifts towards death in the Australian Outback (it takes place in the rainy season, thus, \\"In the Wet.\\"), he tells an odd tale to a Church of England clergyman, of a pilot in 1980's Britain (the novel, written in 1952, is set in 1952) The story: David Anderson, a quarter-Aboriginal Australian pilot, is selected to fly for Queen Elizabeth, in a world where a sizable portion of the British people has emigrated, primarily to Canada and Australia. The remaining British have become \\"red\\",....Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the novel is the \\"multiple vote\\", which, when it was mentioned at the last SF convention I attended, immediately provoked a half-hour debate. Democracy has been modified, leading to the possibility of earning additional votes in elections...OK, so Shute didn't forsee the rise of republicanism in Australia and the Parti Quebecois in Canada. And television is mentioned exactly once, there's no satellite transmissions, and a lot of other similar difficulties. All the same, Shute provides an interesting political novel/love story for us.I withhold a fifth star on this one because I don't find the character of David Anderson believable. This guy's supposed to be a quarter-Abo born in a ditch who came up through the ranks. He talks like an Oxford grad, and knows a fair number of polysyllables. Not only this, the quarter-Abo, discussing how the Queen should allocate her time if all was fair, discusses the proportion based on the overall population of the Commonwealth, and based on the white (!) population. Shute should have avoided these obvious howlers."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"This is definitely one of Shute's best novels, His accurate portrayal of post war Britain to his vision of the British Commonwealth was excellent. He made the the characters and the country of Austrialia come alive and like most of his books I had a hard time putting it down. In The Wet was the the first Shute book I read and it is still one of my favourites."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"This is a wonderful book; it has instantly joined my personal top ten. Beautifully written, in the straightforward enconomical storytelling style which Shute mastered, it is several stories within a story, with wonderful historical accents, delicate interplay between Australian and English culture, a spicy dose of politics, a tender love story, and even some farsighted future gazing (the story was written in 1952)."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Although some of Nevil Shute's work is created using a fairly large canvas (one thinks of \\"A Town Like Alice,\\" more than any other), most of his novels are simple tales about everyday life. The trick, or real art, which they demonstrate, is in showing us a slice of that ordinary world we think we all know, as though it were the most normal thing in the world, and then bringing out the oddity that is never far below the surface. So \\"In the Wet,\\" one of his more imaginative novels, takes us bit by bit into the remote parts of tropical northern Australia, building up tiny details from characters and race days and scraps of conversation, until the real story, hidden just below the surface, begins to emerge. Shute, whose background is very much that of an experimental scientist with oil on his hands, is never more impressive than when he leads the unsuspecting reader through the mundane material world that we think we see, onto another plane altogether. Not afraid in the least of exploring spirituality, Shute acts as an intelligent, well-informed guide for the reader on a voyage of discovery. Never intruding on the narrative, yet masterfully keeping it in rein, he is an author whose novels have long been considered merely \\"popular,\\" when in fact they are often penetrating inquiries into the meaning of life.One other characteristic of Shute's writing that is perhaps more apparent today than it was in the fifties and sixties is that his work is always set in the contemporary period of a world undergoing vast change. He lived and served and worked through two world wars and the effects of these cataclysmic events were such as to shake up the foundations of the very science which had made so many people feel so secure for a time. Therefore, his texts today also provide interesting excursions into that world, from 1920 to 1960, which was not only metamorphosing into the more colourful world of the Beatles, Vietnam and Tricky Dicky Nixon, but which has since very completely disappeared from the ken of anyone much under fifty. Of course, if all you are after is a good story told by a competent storyteller, you won't be disappointed either."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"This is another of Nevil Shute's great stories of Australia. The frame of the story is really what is so marvellous. Shute is excellent in capturing the point of view of an elderly Church of England priest out in the sparsely-populated outback of the late 1940s. The futuristic body of the story is touching, to contrast Shute's projection of the British Royal family with the way that they have behaved in reality. But the voice of that old priest is what one simply cannot forget. It's similar, but even better, than the frame narrator of the old solicitor in &quot;A Town Like Alice.&quot;"},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"One of Shute's strengths is his ability to brilliantly project into a reasonable future, reasonable in view of the world as he knew it. His best known novel, On The Beach, is set in the future, as is this novel. Here the future takes form in the malaria-induced dream of an Australian bush-brother, stricken with a bout while tending a sick man during the Australian rainy season. From the small study in which he wrote, Shute gave his readers a prescient look at the English monarchy and race relations in the context of his usual fine tale. And, as is typical for this author, we are all ennobled in the reading. After the final page you too will wish to be worthy of the seventh vote...."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Nevil Shute was a sturdily competent author. His plots are as well constructed as his planes probably were. Solid, orthodox in design and execution, no unnecessary frills - the embodiment of the stiff upper lip of the Englishman. This is no exception as it artfully tells a future tale of an England riven by an envy-based Socialism (that its author had recently escaped from)that is rapidly destroying those few institutions remaining. It has a solid emotional connection to present-day 'utopian' Australia (as wonderfully observed from the point of view of one who lived there as, say, Orwell's 'Burmese Days').Hmmm...author wishes to tell of past or future and make politicised point therefrom. Problem - how to do this without breaking the emotional connection to the narrative of the present? Solution - make a character have a 'dream' of some kind.I rolled my eyes - this device was becoming hackneyed (cf.'An Old Captivity', 'The Rainbow &amp; The Rose' etc.) and one might have expected Shute to be a little more inventive with his literary devices. Nevertheless, it works and functions adequately as a means of establishing and maintaining a fluid connection between the two.Well done, sir!"},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"The author's tale is built on the British economic decline that has followed that nation's descent into socialism. Mr. Shute was in at the start of the decline, and like all good story teller's explains his idea of what happened in an intriguing tale."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Absolutely wonderful, one of Nevil Shute's best novels.

Introducing Sociolinguistics by Mesthrie et al. fits the bill better than any other books I've seen or used for advanced undergraduate or beginning sociolinguistic courses. I like it because it covers an impressively wide range of topics and because it has an open format, with lots of maps and/or diagrams that make the text easy to follow. But it isn't just a a picture book. The book treats its subject in sufficient depth for the levels of students I've cited. I've just started to use it as a textbook myself."},{"Title":"Introducing Sociolinguistics","review":"The book seems to cover the appropriate information well enough, but I wish the authors were American rather than English.

Supports of both Charles Murray and Christopher Jencks will find materials in here that support and challenge their views. There are a few methodological problems with this book, however. Because the authors rely on word-of-mouth for their data sample, they over-sample those poor mothers who have social ties, and this probably skews their sample away from society's most *truly* destitude. Nonetheless, this remains an essential read given the extreme weakness of other data on the subject."},{"Title":"Making Ends Meet: How Single Mothers Survive Welfare and Low-Wage Work","review":"Bill Clinton ran for President campaigning to end \\"welfare as we know it\\" and Republicans cheered him on, arguing that welfare mothers (since America's only real welfare program -- Aid to Families with Dependent Children or AFDC -- goes to single mothers raising children) were simply being lazy and had to be forced to work. The TV pundits and the politicians argued about this perhaps, but nobody challenged the fundamental premises.Edin and Lein decided to do something different. Instead of squabbling about politics, they went out into the field and actually interviewed mothers on welfare. Their study was as rigorous as can be imagined -- they visited four cities, talked to dozens of mothers, and went over the books with them until all the numbers balanced out, finding exactly where they got their money and what they spent it on.What they found was shocking. Far from being lazy, mothers on welfare in fact all worked. In addition to putting in time raising their children (or getting neighborhood women to do it, since expensive daycare was out of the question), they worked serious jobs under-the-table. There simply was no other way to make ends meet. In their entire study, Edin and Lein only found one mother who didn't work any other jobs -- and the neighbors called social services on her because she looked so bad.After looking at this evidence, it's hard to think of the politicians who cut AFDC in an attempt to move welfare mothers into the workforce they already clung to for survival as anything other than heartless monsters. And their number is well-represented in the introduction by Harvard professor Christopher Jencks, who diddles away the facts in an attempt to avoid seeming partisan, and has cautiously endorsed welfare reform in other forums.Anyone who wants to be taken seriously on the topic of welfare must read this book and understand the realities of the subject they're discussing."},{"Title":"Making Ends Meet: How Single Mothers Survive Welfare and Low-Wage Work","review":"This book is a year late to influence the Congressional welfare reform debate.It is on time for the state level debate and policy development that must follow federal reform.This book acts as a smart bomb to mythic misconceptions, nostalgia and ideology surrounding welfare reform.Edin's research and writing were formerly available through the Wisconsin based Institute for Research on Poverty. Her work proved a significant resource in my advocacy for effective and compassionate welfare reform in Tennessee. You will encounter the real world of American poverty in this book.The President and Congress should read it with regret for their actions and Governors should read it for courage as they bear the weight of devolved welfare responsibility. Advocates and policy wonks should read it as essential."},{"Title":"Making Ends Meet: How Single Mothers Survive Welfare and Low-Wage Work","review":"Researched before but published just after the 1996 welfare reform (when Bill Clinton made good on his promise to \\"End welfare as we know it\\"), \\"Making Ends Meet\\" by Edin and Lein made quite a splash among social scientists and other who were interested in the economic facts of life for welfare recipients. This is the first study to look in detail at the monthly budgets of welfare recipients. The authors show that welfare payments consistently fall short of the monthly needs of mothers and their children, with the shortfalls being worst among employed mothers (because of the additional expenses incurred for clothes, transportation, child care, and the reductions in benefits associated with work). They show that mothers use a variety of strategies to \\"make ends meet,\\" combining various alternate sources of income, including unreported gifts from boyfriends and childrens' fathers; unreported income from informal jobs like babysitting and housecleaning; and illegal income from criminal activities like occasional prostitution and drug dealing. The authors highlight the (then-current) welfare rules that made it extremely difficult to get by without breaking the rules or the law, and they neither endorse nor condemn these activities, but they do make a number of policy suggestions.Welfare rules have changed considerably over the past 15 years, rendering \\"Making Ends Meet\\" somewhat out of date. The changes that most affect the ability of recipients to make ends meet are those that reduce the costs and benefits of employment by subsidizing child care, health care, transportation and clothes, and by reducing the proportion of wages that employed recipients must pay back to the welfare agency. Still, most of the difficulties of survival on welfare likely remain much the same as they were in the mid-1990s."},{"Title":"Making Ends Meet: How Single Mothers Survive Welfare and Low-Wage Work","review":"3 1/2 starsDuring the early 1980s, social scientists noticed that welfare mothers were spending three to six times their official incomes.

How sad.Originally published in Chronicles: A Magazine of American Culture, February, 1998."},{"Title":"Kinds of Power","review":"James Hillman is often thought of as a demanding and difficult writer -- in need of being \\"popularized\\" by someone like Thomas Moore (\\"Care of the Soul\\") to reach a wider audience. And there may be some truth to this, but Hillman can also be remarkably accessible, as in this thought-provoking book on the \\"intelligent uses\\" of power.We may think that power needs no explanation. It is what it is. But, as Hillman points out, that belief gives it unconscoius power over us. Never examining power, we do not see the many ways it permeates our daily lives, influencing our behavior and our choices. If we think of power as \\"force,\\" we do not appreciate its subtler uses, e.g., influence, authority, or energy, and we do not see that problems about power may have a wide array of solutions.Hillman is fascinated by words, because words represent ideas; embedded in words are the entire histories of ideas. He is also fascinated by the process of \\"entertaining\\" ideas, and this book is a record of one brilliant and mercurial mind entertaining the idea of power, examining the many ways we can look at it (he devotes a chapter to each of 24 \\"kinds of power\\"), as well as the way its various meanings govern how we see the world around us. For instance, ideas about power lead individuals or groups of people to regard themselves as disempowered (victims); ideas about power may underlie the desire to own guns.Because economic power rules the lives of almost everyone (yet another idea about power), Hillman directs his book to anyone involved with businesss. And he means business in the broadest sense of that word -- anyone whose life is structured by the getting and spending of money. Looking into mythology for insights into the psychology of power, he opens up this subject as therapist and patient might do in a series of 50-minute sessions. It's not a how-to book, but rather a journey, taking the reader across a landscape (both personal and collective) that offers many new and freeing perspectives."},{"Title":"Kinds of Power","review":"Other reviewers have touched on the positive aspects of Hillman's book. It is a nice study of power and its intricacies from a depth-psychological, multidisciplinary, poetic perspective. A reader new to Hillman won't find this work as technical as others (e.g., Re-Visioning Psychology).As someone who worked in Corporate America for 15 years, I feel uncomfortable with psychologizing repetition, control, leadership, etc. without giving due emphasis to the enormously widespread pain and suffering these cause to those of us subjected to them by bosses who belong in daily therapy but are too narcissistic to ever go there. It's very nice to link up repetition with a deep need to polish, or to give a nod to the &quot;born&quot; leader--but unless we also emphasize the shadow side of these states and qualities, they all get taken right to the bank. I must say I'm glad that some of the people I've had to report to never came across this book; they'd have used it as an excuse to be MORE controlling, intrusive, demanding, and downright tyrannical.I can't quite figure out why Hillman wrote this book. His nod to people in business, maybe? An attempt to explain a bit of psychology to them? Surprising to see the Nietzsche of depth psychology offering so many of what look like justifications for precisely the kind of corporate behavior that drives people into stress disabilities and two of my own colleagues into suicide."},{"Title":"Kinds of Power","review":"Hillman contends that power is not a single entity. There are many forms of power. Hillman describes a wide variety of powers, such as control, ambition, leadership, charisma, tyranny and many more. Hillman gives the reader a different perspective on each form of power. He does not judge certain types of power as being good or bad. He helps us see each kind in a new light. It is Hillman's premise that power resides in our ideas about power. We are ruled by the power of ideas. If we are to become more effective as leaders and managers, we must become aware of how we think about power. No one definition of power is adequate. We must recognize that power is multifaceted and we must be prepared to exercise power in its many forms if we are to succeed."},{"Title":"Kinds of Power","review":"James Hillman's book Kinds of Power, srikes a chord of resonance at every root &quot;chakra&quot; in the human body. Two dozen associates under the rubric of &quot;power&quot; are brought to bear upon the reader. Hillman appears to &quot;make up&quot; his analysis as he goes along, but, with his intellect and breadth of pedantic knowledge, he stays a steady course from start to finish. Hillman is convincing, forever analytical and sufficiently critical. He does have a way of getting off the path at times and entertains his way through some tough issues by employing a bit of sophism. Nonetheless, overall, a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Kinds of Power","review":"I have read several Hilliman books and this is by far the worst in my opinion.

Power, and its specific types, are concepts that all of us are very familiar with, and have to be. Verbalizing those concepts and their intricacies makes for clearer thought and more powerful action. The author writes very clearly and simply.My caveat comes from my background of believing in evolution and sociobiology. There are parts of the book that the author deals with what he calls 'archetypology', which is basically an attempt to explain power at a more profound level of abstraction. His archetypology uses the pre-Christian, Greek gods and goddesses. I would archetype things myself differently, and thus found that part of the book not very useful.Five stars nonetheless, for the pros heavily outweigh the cons. Great work!"},{"Title":"Kinds of Power","review":"One my most-recommended books whenever discussions about \\"leadership\\" or \\"control\\" go sideways.

I was even brought close to tears reading the bravery of the Jesus family members in the face of torture, unfair treatment and even imprisonment. The members from the 'Jesus family' proved without any doubt that what the Communists tried to achieve in a hundred years, the Jesus family members had already attained example- people shared their land willingly, production increased, leaders took up the most menial work. Some of the humble communists even sent people to learn from the 'Jesus family'. It is worthy to note that no force or guilt-trip was used to attain the sharing of tools and products.There is also humour in it as you see how the strange circumstances help the Christians escape some of the torment e.g. how paying for an egg laid by a noisy hen can save a woman's husband from imprisonment or instead of confessing that an executioner is God but saying he is the devil led to deliverance from death.If you want to find prosperity in the midst of poverty and hope in the midst of suffering, read this book."},{"Title":"The 'Jesus Family' in Communist China","review":"This is a story of a British medical doctor who went to China years before the communists took over China, so had experience both with what China was like before 1949 and for two years after. The final chapter has a couple of stories from later when he had a clinic in Hong Kong.The story starts with Dr. Rees on his way to a village run by the \\"Jesus Family\\", a Christian group that was independent of any mission effort from other countries. This was after the communists had taken over, and Dr. Rees was exiled to a small, rural village. What follows are a series of observations of life in the Jesus Family. This included several flashbacks to what life was like before the communists took over, as a theme to show how certain practices were developed among the members of the group. Some of the flashbacks give information as to how Chinese society in his area was set up both before and after the communist revolution.One striking picture is when communist forces came to the village to announce their victory: the officer in charge read a proclamation, only to have a man in the simple garb of a coolie correct the language of the proclamation. That coolie was a graduate of Oxford. The communist officer then asked to see the headman of the village. Background: the headmen of the villages mostly oppressed their villages, so the communists found that by executing him, the farmers then happily supported the communists. The coolies around the officer stalled, as they saw their headman approaching. Another coolie came by pushing a wheelbarrow load of manure to the field, whereupon he was introduced as the village head. The amazed communist asked why he as the headman of the village was doing the lowest of jobs, only to get the answer that the Bible teaches that if one wants to be the leader, he must be the servant of all. That meant the the headman got the privilege of doing the least liked jobs in the village. This is just one of many examples of how these people lived the teachings of the Bible.The Jesus Family was a stark contrast, both to the pre-communist China, and to the communist rule. Dr. Rees observed that the reason the pre-communist China was so backward was not because Chinese people are lazy or mentally deficient, rather it was because of their morality. Europe and the U.S. owed their superiority to China and other lesser developed countries to the teachings of the Bible and to no other source. The same thing worked in China, where the Jesus Family were advanced over their neighbors because of how they put Biblical teachings into practice.I was amazed and humbled by how these people lived Christianity. This review would have to include the whole book to give an adequate picture, but that is not practical. I highly recommend reading the book."},{"Title":"Open-Source Robotics and Process Control Cookbook: Designing and Building Robust, Dependable Real-time Systems","review":"Edwards claims that his book is the first on using open source software to build robotic systems. The aim is to reduce the cost, as compared with using a commercial real time operating system. Hitherto, the latter has been the choice of many robotics designs.He puts a lot of detail into the text, of how to use linux as the embedded operating system in the robot. To address the issue of whether linux is up to the demands of real time running. The ideal reader should be proficient both in linux device drivers and in constructing robots. The text is probably not ideal for someone new to either field.To motivate the reader, Edwards provides several examples of functionalities to be built into the robots. Like being able to use GPS, which sounds quite neat."},{"Title":"Open-Source Robotics and Process Control Cookbook: Designing and Building Robust, Dependable Real-time Systems","review":"Edwards does the reader a great service by going into why decisions are made.

Not only does it offer delicious recipes that we've come to expect from Bon Appetit but it organizes them in such a way that your menu and time easily managed.There are three sections which are themed around a particular type of event: Occasions, Instant Entertaining, and Get-Togethers. Within each section, there are menus for specific functions (Celebration Dinner, Elegant Shower, Romantic Dinner, Kid's Birthday Party, Big Anniversary, Potluck Housewarming Party, etc . . .)The feature I like the most is the timeline for each function's menus. For example, for the Kid's Birthday Party, send out invitations, shop for nonperishable food items and paper goods, decorations, and candles three weeks ahead. Two weeks ahead, bake and freeze cake layers for birthday cake, etc . . . .One other item to mention is there are pictures of every recipe (something I find very useful).I recommend this book wholeheartedly.

The book carefully explains what the culture is (something that those who participate in it are often at a loss to describe), how it unintentionally excludes many of those whom individuals would probably approve of and relate to, and suggests alternative paths to creating a racially cohesive society. I highly recommend the book to anyone who wants to reach out to participate in the many rich cultures that our country provides.If you are like me, you've wondered what &quot;white culture&quot; studies are all about. Are they a closet attempt to re-establish &quot;white supremacy&quot; beliefs? In Lifting the White Veil, I found out that white culture studies are really about creating a more effective multiracial society that will benefit everyone.Although I felt like I had a good background in race-based sociology (having taken courses in the subject in both college and graduate school . . . and having been informed by many friends from other cultures about my cultural biases and limitations), I learned a lot . . . and was glad that I did.What the title refers to is that a dominant culture is usually invisible to those who participate in it, and limits their vision of what is going on around them. All such cultures are constricting though to other contiguous cultures, and we cannot understand those constrictions without understanding more about all cultures . . . including the dominant one.The author argues for a future in which white culture continues, but is no longer the dominant one that all others must kowtow to. Instead, he hopes that a multiracial culture will develop that will be superior to any existing culture.Jeff Hitchcock is the co-founder and executive director of the Center for the Study of White American Culture, a multiracial organization. As a self-described &quot;white American,&quot; he brings his own experiences to this study . . . which include being married to Ms. Charley Flint, a black feminist sociologist and raising their two children of color. The book's greatest strength for me was that Mr. Hitchcook openly describes the evolution of his own &quot;white&quot; and &quot;multiracial&quot; awarenesses while sharing some of the experiences that his multiracial family has had in the &quot;white&quot; culture.We are headed to a more multiracial society in the future as the percentage of those who are born from &quot;nonwhite&quot; races grows. It would make a lot of sense to know how to make the most of this experience. My own epiphany on the subject came when I took my sons to a Los Angeles Dodger game some years ago on &quot;Hispanic Day&quot; and found ourselves in the middle of enthusiastic Spanish-speaking fans in the left field bleachers. We had a wonderful time, and found it interesting to be in the minority in a large crowd for the first time in our lives. That epiphany is repeated whenever we are in Hawaii where people of many races live together without any one group being the majority. Most recently I was reminded of my epiphany at my father's funeral where most of his mourners were people from &quot;nonwhite&quot; communities . . . something that would have pleased him.For those who are not familiar with the history of racial culture in the United States, the book has a good summary description of how our concepts of race have changed over time. The book goes on to describe the latest sociological research and thinking on the subject of how to create a more just and engaged multiracial society.Be forewarned, however, that the book starts with a &quot;tough love&quot; lesson that will drive off casual readers. The book is much friendlier after that . . . if you don't mind finding out that you don't really have much multiracial experience.As I finished the book, I came away with a desire to know the other cultures in America much better. I'm sure you will have the same reaction."},{"Title":"Lifting the White Veil: An Exploration of White American Culture in a Multiracial Context","review":"I love the way this book calls on white people to celebrate their accomplishments while becoming aware of the way the game is rigged in their favor. The book seems gentle while revealing hard facts of racial life in America. I say it \\"seems gentle\\" because, as an African American woman, I can't judge for white people whether something is harsh or not; I can only look at the skill, minute detail and care with which Jeff Hitchcock builds the case and admire the way he takes baby steps toward a monumental conclusion.I hope many, many people in America read this book, especially white people. I have assigned parts of the book to be read by my class at Northwest Indian College. I think the book sheds light on the backlash we see to the Obama presidency. White guilt runs deep and makes for irrational, sometimes violent, behavior.I pray that whites will confront their own guilt and deal with it carefully and gently as Hitchcock does so that we can live together as a more peaceful multiracial society."},{"Title":"Lifting the White Veil: An Exploration of White American Culture in a Multiracial Context","review":"This book really does lift the white veil for any reading willing to admit that there is one--that the way whitefolks see the world is very filtered by white privilege, the idea that we are at the center. Hitchcock's analysis and insights are strinkingly original, while drawing upon studies and classic texts. He intersperses the analytical writing with real-life stories, some from his own experience, some observed. An important well-written book."},{"Title":"Lifting the White Veil: An Exploration of White American Culture in a Multiracial Context","review":"This book is fantastic! Jeff Hitchcock does indeed lift the \\"white veil\\" which surrounds many of us each and every day. White privilege is similar to the air that we breathe in that, it is invisible and can be taken for granted. The problem is that the air, or privilege in this case, is not evenly distributed throughout our society and it takes a lot of courage to face up and question the unequal distribution. Jeff Hitchcock has that courage and you see it on every page of this book. He points out the countless areas of our lives where we have a gentle breeze helping to move us along throughout life. A breeze that people from other diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds do not have access to. He also provides a look at some of our history that many of us would prefer to not be associated with. He demonstrates how we all need to play a part in evening out the playing field of oppression if we want things to change. This book is a masterpiece and should be required reading in every high school throughout America."},{"Title":"Lifting the White Veil: An Exploration of White American Culture in a Multiracial Context","review":"This book is a must-read for persons who really want to understand diversity fully. The author makes visible what is usually hidden or misunderstood in conversations about intergroup relations--white culture and its immense impact on individuals and society. I particularly liked the book because it written intelligently (lots of facts, references and insights), but it is not too technical for the everyday reader. This is a gem that should be useful for both individual who are looking for insights into diversity and college students too."},{"Title":"Lifting the White Veil: An Exploration of White American Culture in a Multiracial Context","review":"Typical of books of this type, it refuses to look at the growing non-white racial privledge. At the university setting, every other ethnic groups enjoys classes which explicity support their cultural biases and whitewash their histories. This used to be true of Euroamericans not that long ago, but now \\"whitewashing\\" is the province of non-whites. Most great civilzations practiced \\"supremicist\\" behaviors for their dominant groups (read older collections of primary documents from east Asia, the Middle East and Egypt sometime--and you will be shocked to see what is left out of the new \\"multicultural\\" history books.) Also, anyone non-white can freely use racial slurs and hate crimes are treated far less seriously when non-whites commit them.The inherent contradiction in such \\"whiteness\\" books is that they want to turn white people into just another ethnic group instead of a dominant one which considers itself the norm, yet they abhor any white seperatist or pride groups. If they (white people) are to be reduced to just another ethnic group they should have the same privledges."},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"I've had William Dean Howells' &quot;A Modern Instance&quot; and &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham,&quot; like many, many other books on my bookshelf for a long time. A recent meeting of a reading group of mine finally allowed me to make the time to read Howells' 1885 work, &quot;Silas Lapham&quot;. I am extraordinarily glad I did. From the start of the novel, we are drawn into the world of late 19th century Boston, post-Reconstruction America, where newly rich industrialists attempt to enter the society life of old money. Howells crafts an extraordinarily realistic look at the American Dream gone awry.&quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; begins with an interview that a local newspaperman is doing of Colonel Silas Lapham, a mineral paint tycoon. Lapham's account of his rise from the backwoods of Vermont to his marriage, to service in the Civil War, to his propagation of a successful mineral paint business is chronicled and gives us a taste of the effort and perseverance necessary for his rise, as well indicating the possibility of some potential failings, especially with regard to his one-time partner, Milton Rogers. We soon learn that Mrs. Persis Lapham aided a society woman in distress the year before, and the return of her son, Tom Corey, from Texas, signals another sort of ambition on the part of the Lapham daughters, Irene and her older sister Penelope. The rest of the novel plays out the ways in which the Laphams try to parley their financial success into social status - and how the Laphams are affected by the gambit.Howells explores a number of significant cultural issues in &quot;Silas Lapham&quot;: isolationism, social adaptability, economic solvency among all classes, personal integrity and familial ties, and the relationship between literature and life. The fact that the story is set about 20 or so years after the end of the American Civil War sets an important and subtle context that runs throughout the novel and inflects all of the thematic elements. The ways that the characters interact, the way that the society functions, even though the majority of the novel takes place in Boston, is importantly affected by the fact that Reconstruction is drawing to a close, Manifest Destiny is in full swing, and ultimately, America was at a point of still putting itself together and trying to view itself as the &quot;United&quot; States.Howells' treatment of the social interactions between the industrially rich Laphams and the old moneyed Coreys underscores the difficulty in creating and maintaining a national identity, especially when the people even in one northern city seem so essentially different. The romance story involving the Laphams and Tom Corey is obviously an important element of the story, and Howells does an amazing job of not allowing the romance plot to become as overblown and ludicrously sentimental as the works of fiction he critiques in discussions of novels throughout his own work. &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; questions the nature of relationships, how they begin, how they endure - the contrast between the married lives of the Coreys and the Laphams is worth noting, as is the family dynamic in both instances.I'm very pleased to have gotten a chance to read this novel. Generally when I say an author or a work has been neglected, I mean that it's been neglected primarily by me. Having turned an eye now to Howells, I am very impressed with the depth of his characterization, the ways he puts scenery and backdrop to work for him, the scope of his literary allusions, and his historical consciousness. This is certainly a great American novel that more people should read. It may not be exciting, but it is involving, and that is always an excellent recommendation."},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"William Dean Howells's &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; is one of the earliest American novels about a businessman, and that qualification alone makes it a literary curiosity, but what is most remarkable about it is what its title character is not, rather than what he is. Silas Lapham is not a ruthless, villainously greedy tycoon who bullies his employees and relishes destroying the careers of his competitors and enemies, but a conscientious, likeable man to whom misfortune happens because of his gullibility and sense of guilt rather than hubris.Lapham is a human emblem of the new American industrial economy of the 1870s. A self-made millionaire in the paint business, he is now one of the richest men in Boston and is radiantly proud of the fact that he has earned every dollar. Having grown up poor and undereducated in Vermont, he still speaks in a rustic vernacular and has yet to understand the rationale behind the rules of high society, let alone assimilate them. A simple, practical man with a sense of duty, he even put aside his business to serve in the Civil War, in which he was seriously wounded and achieved the rank of colonel. He can be boastful and garrulous, but he is not arrogant or overbearing.Lapham is dearly devoted to his wife Persis, who in turn has supported him through thick and thin, and his two daughters. Penelope, the older girl, is relatively plain but witty and sardonic and, at least in the first half of the novel, never seems to take anything seriously; her sister Irene is the more beautiful but vapid and superficial. Irene falls for Tom Corey, the young man who comes to work for her father as a foreign sales representative, but Tom and Penelope have a mutual attraction that, Penelope fears, could break Irene's heart. This romantic subplot allows Howells to contrast Tom's family, part of the old Boston aristocracy, with the even wealthier but socially crude Laphams with whose daughter Tom's mother has snobbish doubts about his possible union.The novel has almost the air of Greek tragedy in that Lapham is a man of stature who has fatal flaws that threaten to destroy him. He is a teetotaller, and when he does take the liberty of trying some wine at a dinner party, he embarrasses himself and his family by talking too much. He abstains from gambling, but, instigated by his former business partner and current gadfly Milton Rogers, he gets into financial trouble when he stakes money on bad property and bad stocks. And, to compensate for a traumatic event in his past, he is charitable almost to a fault to a pretty girl whom he employs as a typist in his office.The style of &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; is a dramatic realism similar to that found in the novels of Howells's contemporaries Frank Norris and Theodore Dreiser; the structure is straightforward, and the dialogue cuts to the core in laying bare the characters' sentiments and unfolding the plot. It may fall short of being a &quot;great&quot; novel, but for its candid portrayal of a specimen of the nouveau riche, it can be considered a minor monument of nineteenth century American literature."},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"These days Howells is usually overlooked in favor of the more overtly urbane Henry James or the grittier Stephen Crane or Theodore Dreiser. That's a shame, since Howells at his best is a more varied and thought-provoking author than any of them. The Rise of Silas Lapham is Howells at his best. The title is quite ironic, of course, but ultimately spot-on, as Howells' nouveau-riche bumpkin is redeemed only in losing it all. Lapham is keenly drawn, alternately frustrating in his bluster and affected pompousness and endearing in his genuine (if sometimes poorly expressed) love for his family. Other characters are not so fortunate; one of his daughters remains mostly a cipher, and both Mrs. Lapham and Bromfield Corey, the rich scion of society whose favor Lapham so earnestly covets, are dangerously close to stock characters. Howells excels at elaborate descriptive prose focused on intricate detail, sometimes to the point of exhaustion. Some elements of the plot may seem quaint to modern readers, but Howells does not treat them with condescension. The Rise of Silas Lapham is definitely a book of its time. Perhaps it is so rewarding because his time and ours are not necessarily so different as we think."},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"The photographs of Alfred Stieglitz still look modern and talented today, but it's nearly impossible to imagine how they would have looked to viewers in the 1890s, when they were taken. They were revolutionary, amazing, radically avant-garde. In a similar vein, the first novel about an American industrialist---a novel first printed in 1885---cannot seem so new, so fresh to our 21st century eyes. This theme startles nobody anymore. But in tracing the ups and downs of Silas Lapham, late of a Vermont village, a Civil War veteran, and founder of a fortune in 1870s Boston, Howells produced a highly original novel for his day. Lapham, his plain-spoken wife Persis, and two daughters live in luxury, thanks to the successful paint manufacturing business whose ubiquitous ads disfigured large portions of the New England countryside. Puffed up with success and not averse to considerable bragging, Lapham decides to build a sumptuous mansion on the water side of Beacon Street in the then-new district of Back Bay. At the same time, the Laphams come into contact with a family from the old Boston Brahmin elite, a family whose son falls in love with a Lapham daughter. The reaction of both families to this potential liaison, the love affair itself, and the fate of the Lapham fortune form the subject of this solid novel.William Dean Howells was and is known as one of the early American \\"realists\\", as opposed to the more romantic style that dominated most of 19th century English language literature. Not being a person well-versed in the \\"accepted wisdom\\" of literary criticism and history, I can only say that compared to later writers, for example, Crane, Norris, Dreiser, and Sinclair, to be followed later by Anderson and Lewis, I find that Howells' work still retains plenty of the more romantic elements even while he does portray the life and business of a paint tycoon with considerable accuracy and empathy. No snobbish repudiator of nouveaux riches gaucheries, Howells. This book is not a sarcastic look at the \\"ridiculous efforts of a bourgeois to climb above his station\\". Lapham may have his faults, but he is essentially a good, likeable man. If you have an interest in Boston history or in knowing what Boston life was like in the 1870s, I believe you will certainly enjoy reading THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM. The story is a little artificial, the language a bit outdated, I felt, though in comparison to the horrors and perversities that throng some modern works, the novel might fill a few winter afternoons with a quiet pleasure. Certain stylistic oddities surprised me, such as the sudden appearance of a narrative \\"I\\" after over 200 pages ! Howells has been quite neglected in recent times: for sure, he may not be a Dostoevsky, Balzac, or Faulkner, but don't brush him off."},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"William Dean Howells is an unjustly neglected American Renaissance author; his prose is more readable today than Clemmens, Hawthorne or Melville. His background as a journalist no doubt helps. The Lapham family is a delight to spend a couple of hundred pages with, as they interact and ultimately fall prey to Boston brahmin society. Silas Lapham is a self-made man who scores a killing in paint from his dad's farm; he becomes a self-unmade man. You get absorbed in the world Howells describes. Especially good reading on a plane."},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"This book blew my mind! I found it absolutely engaging and the character of Silas Lapham was endearing to the point of surprise. This book says a lot about a class conscious America and even more about how \\"mom and pop\\" capitalism gets pushed aside to make way for impersonal mega corporations.Silas Lapham is a good-hearted, yet rugged individualist who pulled himself up by the bootstraps to make a giant fortune. Once he succeeds however, there is a whole group of people at the top of the ladder ready to push him onto his face, along with his whole \\"wretched family.\\" No matter what he does to fit in with the \\"old money\\" he just can't seem to fit in and the more he works to fit the millionaire mold, the more he compromises his own values.What's best though is that we see him and his family through good times as well as through the downward spiral after his business crashes, and while it is sad, we see that they return willingly to what once was without coming out any worse.This book made me smile because the characters, especially Silas Lapham, are realistically flawed and human. I recommend this highly."},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"To the page, this book is symmetrical in its structure. It opens with a public confession (to a reporter) and ends with a private one (to a priest). In the exact center comes Lapham's moment of realization when he is drunk at a party. There is more to the structure, but that should be enough to get you going.A reviewer below calls Lapham a 'mogul with a conscience' which is accurate. The true core of this book is the way Howells carefully built it, though. Considering it comes from an age before modernism, it certainly feels quite modern. Give it a shot."},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"Well, I can not say that W.D. Howells was another Nathaniel Hawthorne. But what I can say is that his &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; is A LOT better than some books that were made famous (probably for political reasons). Do not expect the superb images and construction of Hawthorne. But what we CAN expect is a timeless message about society. At first Silas is a rich money grubbing monster. (Just think of Dickens' Scrooge.) He finds ways to cut his friends out of deals, alienates his family with the want of more money, and even gets his wife upset. Ah, but later things go bad, and he starts losing money. This is when the human side of him begins to show and he becomes a very sympathetic character. In my opinion, to enjoy this even more, you must assume that before the book opens, he WAS a good and decent man. Once he ran into immense wealth, he grew detestable. So while, this is not exactly a masterpiece, the degeneration of Silas and his return to humanity is ample material to carry this book and place it in the American Museum of Literature."},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"This is a must read book and provides a glimpse of business morals in the nineteenth century. Read first, Mark Twain's &quot;The Gilded Age&quot; and Charles Dickens' &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;. Silas' 'rise' is not ironic unless accumulation of wealth is your only value. While his monetary assets may shrink, his family 'prospers' in many ways. Clearly, Howells makes the point that honest work can bridge the gap of old rich and new. Commerce is not inherently bad, but it does ask the question, how far should one go in disclosure and protecting others from their potential investment folly."},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"You might be able to take a man of humble beginnings and make him a rich man, but can he ever cross the line into Society? Silas Lapham becomes rich from paint that he sells, but fails totally in his attempt to become an accepted member of the upper class. The book also concerns a misunderstood love interest by one of Lapham's daughters: the young man is actually in love with his other daughter. Lapham's business fails at the end, but he doesn't sacrifice his integrity. Which is why it is only the \\"rise\\" of Silas Lapham and not the \\"rise and fall.\\" This is among Howells's best novels."},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"While the by-line is admirably short, the text actually comes off quite linguistically, given all the maladroit proclivities that might have prevented a lesser author from treading so smoothly on wings of bread and slurry. William, whose middle name - as we are to believe - is Dean, ends his saga with the name Howells. Some may enjoy this chicanery, but I, for one, was enormously displeased. For instance, why all that talk about trade agreements in the preface yet no listing for either &quot;trade&quot; or &quot;agreement&quot; in the index? And, I must ask, why was there no index at all? One is left to wonder what other key concepts and biographical references were left un-indexed. Is there any value in such a text? The answer, quite simply, is also not available in the index. Why? I became very angry by the end. All indexed. Why? The answer, quite simply, is given five sentences before this one.

It is the story of the title character: a Vermont-born Civil War veteran who rises from humble beginnings to make a huge fortune in the paint business. With his wife and two daughters, Lapham lives in Boston. Despite his wealth, he is keenly aware of the gulf that exists between him and the city's aristocratic \\"old rich.\\"The book has a quality that seems to anticipate the TV soap operas that became popular in the 20th century: it is a story of intertwined romantic and financial intrigue. Howells pays particular attention to people's attitudes about social manners.Overall, this is an entertaining and interesting evocation of a time of growth and change in the United States. The characters are well-drawn, and Howells keeps the plot moving along. There is an interesting continuing theme of the relationship between \\"real\\" life and novels; for example, George Eliot's \\"Middlemarch\\" is cited a number of times by characters in the book. For an interesting complementary text to \\"Silas Lapham,\\" try Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle.\\""},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"This edition reads like a photocopy of an early print edition.

Silas Lapham is a character that Howells' created so that every individual may relate to. And if you can not relate with Silas, try some of the other cast of characters. Overall this was a decent read and a wonderful addition to a collection."},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"\\"The Rise of Silas Lapham\\" by William Dean Howells, is definitely misnamed, since at the start of the novel, the main character has already risen in terms of money and prominence, two things he is at risk of losing over the course of the novel. Howells' work is credited with being the first impotant novel that truly focused on an American businessman, a man who came from nothing to become someone to contend with, but a man who still couldn't fit into the gentile Boston society because he was noveau riche and not from old money. There are some interesting things about the plotline of this novel and even some humorous moments, but \\"The Rise of Silas Lapham\\" is ploddingly told and seems dated in comparison with contempoary novels of its time.\\"The Rise of Silas Lapham\\" begins with a newspaper interview in which the reader automatically learns Silas's hard luck background and his success in the paint business, success that has allowed him to build a mansion in the Back Bay area of Boston among the most elite townspeople. His wife and two daughters, Penelope and Irene, want for nothing, but unknowingly remain outcasts in the society. When a young man name Tom Corey (from old money) takes an interest in Laphams's business as well as in one of his daughers, Lapham sees it as a way to truly take his place among the society he so desperately wants to impress and be accepted by. However, incidents and mistakes from Lapham's past show up just as his star is on its meteoric rise, forcing him to change hiw ways, for better or for worse.Some of the standout elements of \\"The Rise of Silas Lapham\\" is the love triangle between the Lapham daughters and Tom Corey, as well as the Corey family's reaction to Tom's interest in one of the girls. Penelope Lapham is a clever and comic likable character, and there are moments when even Silas and his wife Persis are easy to identify with. However, Howells spent too much time telling the story and did not allow his characters room to breathe and exist by themselves in the minds of the readers. While not an overly long novel, I found it a difficult read because much of the story is either boring or told in a boring manner. I wish Howells had dedicated more time to the intriguing aspects of his character's life instead of on the mundane and annoying."},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"I was assigned to read \\"The Rise of Silas Lapham\\" as part of my Gilded Age class. The novel follows the rise (and fall of the titular character). Lapham made his money from mineral paint and as part of the new-rich he seeks to raise his social status by building his dream house in Beacon Hill, Boston.To complicate matters there is a suitor for one of his daughters who comes from an old-money family. Their is a supper party that is filled with gaffs as the \\"country-bumpkin\\" Laphams try to make their way through \\"high society\\". Including a scene of the normally prohibitionist Silas getting rip roaring drunk.There is a fall and a redemption in this book. William Dan Howells wrote this book as an antidote towards the more sentimentalist novels that were produced at the time. Though the dialogue to a modern audience can seem stiff at times, you must realize he was trying to move towards a more neo-realist form of fiction.This novel is highly recommended for class assignments for: The Gilded Age, Post Civil War America, Capitalism, and Social Class Divisions, and Comedy. The forward was well written, and the included extra material of \\"racist\\" language which was toned down between when this books was published in serial form in the \\"Century\\" Magazine was most enlightening."},{"Title":"The rise of Silas Lapham (The Prose and poetry individualized program [The novel]))","review":"Silas Lapham is a self-made man who despite having a fourtune is unable to break into the upper-crust of Society.

Then, when he sleeps, his Hun travels to China to tell his mother. A heart-tugging story of the sacrifice made by a Chinese boy to help his family during hard times.The cut paper drawings, by illustrator Aki Sogabe, beautifully compliment this story.

As a historian I found Wartime Shipyard to be a valuable benchmark with which to measure social change and progress since 1945. I am not surprised to find that enormous changes have taken place during the last half century, especially in race relations. But I was surprised to learn how much has not changed. For example, during WWII there was a widespread attitude that politicians and big business did pretty much what they wanted without regard to the common person's welfare. The average shipyard worker believed that greed in the form of reelection, power and wealth determined how the politicians and industrialists ran-or manipulated--the country. As a result, most shipyard workers saw little value in voting, since their individual vote had no effect on how things were done. Closely associated with those beliefs was a general distrust of all large organizations, from the Federal government to the local labor union. In every case, the leadership of a large organization was suspected of being self-serving and corrupt. Advances in general education have done little to change those attitudes over the last half century. Despite widespread cynicism, the shipyard workers were optimistic about their futures and were generally satisfied with their lot in life. They practiced charity within their peer groups but were reluctant to donate to charitable organizations, including the government's War Chest drives. Draft-dodging was as common during WWII as it was during the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The only major difference was that draft age men were able to avoid the draft by finding work in essential industries. For those who enjoyed exempt status, the periodic reviews of their essential classification was a time of stress and concern, and they did all in their power to insure that the draft board's decision was favorable. Katherine Archibald was a prewar academician-a traditional liberal--who took a job in the Moore Drydock Company in Oakland, California in 1942. She said of her experience, \\"For the first time in my adult life, I was brought actually into contact with the working masses of America, the vast group to which I had long since given my theoretical sympathies....When I stepped from the world of theory into the wider world of fact, it was as if I had suddenly passed from the dimness of a monastic cell into the glare of an outdoor noon.\\" This is an excellent book, very readable and as useful today as it was when it was first published nearly fifty years ago.

Despite these handicaps, Wiebe and Dyck produced a translation that is both readable and true to Epp's account.The book is Claas Epp's vision of the End Times and the place of refuge for the true church. It is a product of the radical Pietism that swept through the Russian Mennonite community in the latter half of the nineteenth century, and a reaction against modernity itself. Epp taught that the Second Coming of Christ would happen in the khanates of Central Asia, and that the Bride Community would find their place of refuge in a province of Bukhara called Shar-i-Sabs. His book only hints at later claims by Epp that we was one of the Two Witnesses described in the book of Revelation. It was written long before Epp believed himself to be a member of ther Godhead - the most controversial claim of his career.Unfortunately, a copy of this translation is nearly impossible to find. However, the bookPilgrims on the Silk Road: A Muslim-Christian Encounter in Khivaby Walter R. Ratliff delves deeply into Epp's career and the lives of those who followed him to Central Asia in the 1880's. The Mennonite Great Trek to Khiva, in which Epp played a key role, spawned a unique episode in the history of Muslim-Christian relations.Pilgrims on the Silk Road: A Muslim-Christian Encounter in Khivatells the full story, and offers insight into Epp's life well beyond his own book.Also, the documentary DVD,Through the Desert Goes Our Journeyfollows Epp's descendants, along with other American descendants of the Great Trek, as they retrace the migration from Ukraine to Uzbekistan.

I dock one star for each.Keith D. is a good Star Trek writer. Here tho, if you are only reading the Gateways series, a lot is referred to in this book from previous DS9 books that you won't really ever catch up to in this book. Incidents are just referred to and then left to hang, for the most part. Also, the book does not end in this volume, but like all of this series, the reader is held hostage to buy an unneeded \\"Book 7\\" to get the endings to the other books. This damages an otherwise interesting and exciting story, but to be honest, so do some elements of the story that DO exist in the book.First, an ancient race suddenly shows back up to offer their series of Gateways for sale to the highest bidder. Although there is some mystery involved in this, not nearly enough is made of it. It is as if the book looks at this aspect of its own plot through a keyhole, and much more is really required in order to do the sub-plot the justice the reader deserves.Second, another major sub-plot is to evacuate 3 million colonists from an endangered planet. The number of ships described as being involved in the rescue effort and the provisions being made for their emergency housing elsewhere do not add up to 3 million. This is especially vexing because as the author is in total control here, all he has to do is some simple math, and then use the right numbers in the book for this sub-plot to make any sense at all.A sub-plot involving an Andorran ambassador and her Star Fleet committed son is started and then left completely hanging.A dead character suddenly appears elsewhere with no explanation given as to how that occurred. The manner described for his death defies an easy escape ... something should have been included here to explain it.Sometimes I wonder if in the current cycle of authorship the art of sensible plotting has been completely lost. Even otherwise fine authors make rookie mistakes in this regard, and it is actually contemptible that they a) do so themselves, and b) are allowed by their editors to get away with it. The only explanations are laziness and a rush to publish, and neither of those are acceptable excuses for bad plotting.Still, I found this book to hang together somewhat better than the first three books in the Gateways series, and if you can overlook plot holes and numerical impossibilities, you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Gateways, Book 4)","review":"Fine action, good suspense, good (but not great) characterization, nothing much deeper than that, and the book suffers from being a middle book in a couple of different ongoing sequences, so if you haven't kept up with ALL of the preceding \\"Trek\\" books, you'll be coming in in mid-plot on several subplots. Nothing that can't be pieced together with a bit of general Star Trek background and a bit of intuition or insight, and if one really WANTS to read this as a stand-alone, it isn't impossible to simply assume that there are things going on in the backstory that we aren't told (although, lacking an ending, it definitely can't be read as a true stand-alone unless one doesn't mind not finding out what happens to the major character, but that was a danger coming in; this entire series is like that.)"},{"Title":"Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Gateways, Book 4)","review":"The main plot revolves around a story to save an entire population of a planet from destruction due to theta radiation poisoning. The entire planet must be evacuated and its inhabitants must be treated. This places an enormous strain on DS9 and Starfleet. The theta radiation came from a Malon freighter that got into a firefight with a Hirogen starship. Coincidentaly, the gateways were activated recently which caused the deadly theta radiation to be dispersed into different areas. Another problem with the gateways is that they drain energy from planets, so they must be shut down somehow.Meanwhile, Quark is up to his usual self. He just can't seem to stay out of trouble, or is it that trouble aways seems to find him? One of the other plots revolve around Quark negotiating with the Iconians on behalf of the Orion Syndicate. The Iconians control the gateways and are in the process of auctioning them off. Negotiating with the Iconians on behalf of the Orions however is the least of Quark's problems.There aren't any dull moments in this entire book. Every chapter keeps our attention to the very end and encourages us to read other books in the series."},{"Title":"Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Gateways, Book 4)","review":"Wow! What a book! deCandido is my new favorite DS9 author. This book took me under two days to read because it was so amazingly written and developed. I then got the sequel \\"Horn and Ivory\\" and read that immediately.This story is excellently written. I had no problems visualizing any of it. The way the novel is broken down by chapter into different settings is ideal. The characterization once again is spot on perfect. I especially loved Quark's typical scheming role in everything... and how about that lovely Dabo girl of his, she was quite a surprise to me!I really enjoyed the simplicity of the plot. There is some great continuity with the Orion Malic first seen in \\"Abyss\\" proposing a deal to Quark. Turns out Quark is the negotiator for the Orion Syndicate. The Iconian gateways are opening throughout the galaxy, and radioactive refuse from the Delta Quadrant finds its way to a human colony of 3 million inhabitants. Thus, Starfleet and the Bajoran fleet set out on a rescue mission. Europa Nova, the colony, is where the bulk of the action is, and I must say I was very impressed with the storytelling. Never before had I read of such a complex evacuation. Seeing a Federation evac was just awesome! I never thought it could be so exciting, but I found it very captivating.What I loved about this book is how every character has something to do which is fitting to their character.Kira takes command of the rescue mission. Vaughn&#65533;ha! ch'Thane and Nog (who have taken over for Jadzia and O'Brien) are trying to scientifically deduce info about the Gateways. Bashir does an excellent job as the doctor. Ezri stays behind on DS9 to command it (she dropped her Blue for Red a few books ago and is starting to come into the command role more and more). And then there's Taran'atar who accompanies Kira. I love this Jem'Hadar so much! What a great idea for a new character.So what's bad? Lacking info about the Iconians is explained in the other Gateway books. It&#65533;s recommended to read all of them so that you have a solid conclusion. But, as a stand-alone DS9 Relaunch novel I found the few holes that are apparent are not that big to deter from the overall strength of this book. This book can be read without having read the other Gateway books. Kira&#65533;s conclusion lies in the seventh Gateway book, \\"What Lay Beyond\\". Those reading my review will now have the opportunity to buy the paperback version rather than succumb to the evil Ferengi scheme of getting the hardcover.What did I like? Wow! There&#65533;s a lot!-Ro and Quark's relationship is just super! It&#65533;s reminiscent of Odo and Quark, yet different enough to be fun in a unique way. I highly enjoy their interplay... Ro is like a sexy yet stern version of Odo. She's just as on top of things as Odo was, and lets Quark know she's on to his schemes...yet she has a soft spot for his Ferengi charm and cuz he saved her life. Gaila makes an important appearance, tying up questions about his past. [It also explains what happened to the warring factions in a previous episode.] I love how Quark is still the same Ferengi. He even ponders the question as to whether he's just soft in his heart or whether he's been corrupted by Federation ideas... a question I always wondered about him myself!-It's great to see Kira really becoming familiar with command. \\"Horn and Ivory\\" really sets in stone her command desires and her determination to do a good job.-ch'Thane and Nog both have influential parents and their interplay is wonderful to watch. It's great to see Nog has found a new friend (Starfleet too!) during Jake's continued absence. We also learn more about ch'Thane's family role.-Seeing Ezri in command of DS9 and personally dealing with some trivial problems of refugees was wonderful.-The Starfleet relief effort for a non-Federation world was just awesome to witness. I loved all of it. The president of Europa Nova was great too.-Setting up Quark's for a holo-meeting for Starfleet was cool. We get brief encounters with Picard and Calloun.-Gul Macet! His resemblance to Dukat is well explained and caused me to laugh at how well the writers skirted the fact that the same actor played Dukat and Macet.- Quark&#65533;s typical scheming.Best parts!-Kira's insights. She gets almost nostalgic for the days of the Resistance (a theme that dominates the \\"Horn and Ivory\\" sequel). More and more I'm surprised by how much I love her character. She's completely grown on me since her angry first season.-A new continuing character is brought on, an Orion female slave named Treir!-Vaughn and the hostage situation. Classic. Love that guy.-The Hirogen are in the book, and it's awesome! You get to go inside the mind of this Hunter and that's a reason why I love DeCandido. You get insights into all the characters.-Taran'atar. Getting inside HIS head was brilliant. Learning more about his beliefs via his relation to the Founders is great. Him and Kira make an interesting team.-GARAK!!! whoooooa! His very brief appearance is something to clap for!The single best part of the book, which is reason to buy it alone, is the confrontation between Taran'atar and the Hirogen hunter. Wow! Classic! I could completely visualize the scene with all the fumes in the air and bodies lying around as they fought each other. Great scene.What impressed me most about the DS9 Relaunch books is how they manage to continue the development of past characters, while at the same time being accessible as stand alone books. This book is such an achievement. One does not need to read the previous books to like this one, but it is highly recommended. This book also tempts one to buy the other coinciding Gateway novels."},{"Title":"Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Gateways, Book 4)","review":"The series started out slowly fell off in the 2nd but the 3rd and now the 4th one have been very good. This one beats out the previous one but not by much. It contiues the Gateway series obviously but also continue the story from the Avatar books and from the Section 31 edition. The story is excellent and the characters very interesting. To me it had some nice surprises and they continue to show more of Vaughn and Shar's trouble.

I agree with some that it seems fragmented, but that can be a good change of pace. I often like well done stories that cover a series of sub-plots simultaneously. This is one.Be forewarned. You must get a hardback book 7 (at least at this time)in order to know how things turn out. The plot is left very much hanging. (See my review of One Small Step for my feelings on that.) Apparently, the first 6 books of the series don't interact much, but the seventh apparently concludes them all (haven't gotten that one yet). There is some continuation of DS9 plot lines, especially concerning Shar. Not much about Jake."},{"Title":"Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Gateways, Book 4)","review":"I picked this up quickly as some light reading from a local library. It has an intriguing premise which isn't fully developed. I wish the author had spent more time describing who the aliens masquerading as Iconians really are. You have to be a hard core &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan to enjoy his descriptions of the characters. Alas, I did not find this nearly as memorable as the best books in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series written by Peter David and Diane Carey."},{"Title":"Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Gateways, Book 4)","review":"I've been following the books that continue the story of DS9 past the point of the final episode in the TV Series, and I've been really enjoying them. For one, there's the more &quot;Serial&quot; nature to them: the new DS9 books don't always end with everything wrapped up that was introduced (indeed, Jake has been missing somewhere inside the wormhole for a few books now). For another, there's the lack of &quot;reset&quot; to the books: most of the Star Trek books can't change anything major, as the characters would show these changes thereafter in the series, whereas with the DS9 books, now that the series is over, this isn't the case.All of that said, the plot in this book was very fragmented. I realize it is one of the books in a series, but standing alone, parts of it didn't even make sense: The Iconians have come back, is the premise, and they've opened up all their old doorways in space as almost an example to the quadrant over what they're selling to the highest bidder, but some Malon antimatter waste is coming through one of those gateways, ruining a planet nearby DS9.So, the story is basically a rescue attempt from DS9. Unfortunately, the other plot wrinkles all suffer from a stutter: you have a lot of cliffhangers in the end of this book, and yet nearly nothing is resolved at all. I don't mind a &quot;serial,&quot; but to give me nothing completed is something else. Also, given that a lot of the readers of the DS9 books aren't going to go pick up five other books just so that the DS9 book in this series makes sense, and you've got a problem with this one.There was quite a bit of merit in the book: the exploration of what's going on with Dax was interesting, and you get quite a bit more character development from Shar, the new ensign science officer for DS9. Still, both of these didn't quite save the book entirely for me, and I was let down. If you do want to keep reading the DS9 books that are set after the series, this one is necessary, as Dax and Shar have some important revelations, but in and of itself, the novel doesn't stand alone, and you may find that to really enjoy it, you'll need the other books in the &quot;Gateways&quot; series.'Nathan"},{"Title":"Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Gateways, Book 4)","review":"Warning. Once you pick up this book you will find it hard to put down. Exciting, fast moving with wonderful characterizations and a fantastic story. Definately the stand out in the Gateways series so far. And if you are not reading the others you can still enjoy this great DS9 adventure. For those who've been reading the relaunch novels this story follows right on the heels of &quot;Abyss&quot; Been wondering what's up with Shar? Been anxious to learn more about Vaughn? Well &quot;Demons of Air and Darkness&quot; fills in more of the pieces and does a great job of advancing all the characters while still telling a great stand alone story. The book is full of surprises that I don't want to give away but for anyone looking for a great read full of adventure and great characters I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Gateways, Book 4)","review":"The previous reviews did excellent jobs in covering the plot of this novel. I want to point out some things about the writing, though.DeCandido is a good Star Trek writer. But he falls into the same trap that many other (and more mediocre) Trek novelists fall into -- making the characters little more than 20th century people living in the 23rd/24th centuries.Trek novelists can produce great works -- witness Andrew Robinson's great \\"A Stitch In Time,\\" or some of Diane Carey's books. They are true to the Trek universe without taking shortcuts in writing.In \\"Demons,\\" DeCandido takes the easy way out in writing much of the character's speech. For example, three pages in, the Malon, about whom little has been written or seen in previous Trek incarnations, and about whom much new thought could be given, speak like they are just a bunch of current-day (20th century) humans. Would they really say \\"dam*it?\\" And couldn't DeCandido come up with anything more novel than that?Would an Orion slavegirl say \\"harebrained scheme?\\" Would she even know what a \\"hare\\" is?Would a Starship captain refer to her ship as \\"wicked efficient?\\" She would if she grew up where I grew up, south of Boston, in the late 20th century. But I doubt that she did.These are just three top-of-mind examples. Listen. The book was okay -- nothing spectacular, just typical Trek \\"these 12 characters that you all know and love are going to save the universe -- yes, the universe -- yet again.\\" It's written like an extended DS:9 episode. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.I just wish that DeCandido -- and other many Trek authors -- would put a little more thought into how the characters speak in the books, and not try to make them little more than a bunch of 20th century stereotypes. The Trek novel universe would be better for it."},{"Title":"Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Gateways, Book 4)","review":"This was the best of the books in the Gateways series so far. The first one was okay, but the next two seemed choppy and did not engage me. Plus each author seems to treat the nature of the gateways differently. You'd think they could have made some effort at consistency.That said, I think this book outshines the others. The characterizations are true to life and the plot is well paced and kept my interest. I found a few things stretched believability, but no more than the series did. (They moved how many people how fast with how many ships? And the speeds they traveled--Voyager should have made it home in three months.)I also enjoyed the interactions of the new characters with the old, but my favorite so far is Taran'atar. He is a complex character, elevating the Jem'Hadar above robotic beings into the people that were only hinted at in DS9.It's unfortunate that you have to slog through the other books of the series to get to this one, but it's worth it."},{"Title":"Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Gateways, Book 4)","review":"Would someone just bang me in the eye when I start griping about the Trek &quot;series&quot; books *before* I even crack one cover? I've got to say without doubt the &quot;Gateways&quot; series has been the best so far.While it's not *that* important for you to read them in the order they are numbered, I have found doing so could help to keep sense of the goings-on. However, since I am *not* reading them in order, I have also found you can still make sense of things, especially if you're familiar with the Big Picture That Is Star Trek.But if you've been needing lessons on how to keep a thousand plot threads in the air at the same time, just ask Keith R.A. DeCandido! Thanks to the Gateways and a boatload of cleverness, he's all over the galaxy in this novel, and it's a good thing the chapters tell the locations, or otherwise you'd need to make notes.This novel abounds with fine characterizations of the people we love the most (Kira, Nog, Quark, Bashir, Dax, Laren, Yates), a few new ones (Shar, Vaughn, Taran'atar), several we love to hate (Hirogen, Orion, Malon), and a whole host of people on the outside edges that I hope we'll learn more about.Grand adventure awaits, with some mystery and downright confusion thrown in for good measure. Read the book.One daring aside: If you're *really* interested in the re-launch of DS9, don't start with this book. Go back and start with the two &quot;Avatar&quot; books, then read the DS9 installment of the Section 31 series, titled &quot;Abyss,&quot; and THEN read this one. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Gateways, Book 4)","review":"If you have read any of my previous DS9 reborn reviews, you know that I have read all four of the new DS9 books.In this episode, Antimatter waste has started polluting and poisoning the Human colony Europa Nova, A colony that has been in place for over 100 years. It's colonists have survived, flourished, even fended off the Dominion during the war, without the help of the Federation or any other government. The closest ships are at DS9.Kira, Bashir, and new characters Commander Vaughn and Jem'Hadar Taran'atar, accompanied by dozens of Starfleet, Bajoran, and civilian ships set out to evacuate the entire planet's population. In doing so, they discover the pollution's source, an Iconian \\"Gateway\\"(TNG:EPISODE:\\"Contagion\\")being used as an apparent dumping ground from the Delta Quadrant. Meanwhile, Quark is negotiating a deal for the Orion Syndicate for possession of the Gateway network from the Iconians.Author Keith R.A. DeCandido has created a story better written than much of the series. Rather than merely assign lines to characters, DeCandido further expands our knowledge and understanding of Taran'atar and Elias Vaughn and the rest of the cast. We learn more of Ensign Ch'thane's secret, Kira strands herself in the Delta quadrant(permanently?)to keep her oath to Europa Nova's President. You will be left on the edge of your seat at the conclusion of each chapter, and he has formed suspenseful, exciting scenes that are easy to visualize.

Little did Sisko know that Jake would serve as the conduit through which his own values would rub off on Nog. We got our first evidence of that from Quark's frequent complaints to his nephew that he was &quot;thinking more like a hew-mon every day&quot;. In the current Deep Space Nine timeline, Nog commands a runabout on a scouting mission in a way that will pave the way for future Ferengi serving in Starfleet--after all, look at the mark Worf made. But by and large, this story is about a culture which reactivates ancient technology to sell to the highest bidder. The dilemma is fairly obvious--everybody knows that no one culture should possess these Gateways--it's equivalent to rogue nations in the real world possessing nukes. But what about Kira? You'll have to see the book itself for that."},{"Title":"Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Gateways, Book 4)","review":"I really hate the words &quot;to be continued&quot;!But I can handle them in a great series like this!I remember the Iconians from the Original Star Trek, but never imagined they would turn up again in this way.

In this series we learn about the &quot;Iconions&quot; and their gate-way technology for moving from one part of the universe to another, and posibily thru time as well.I very much enjoyed learning the reason Quark took a dabo girl with him to a degotiation, and the Jem-Hadar fight was great and well staged.Of course, the big question that will not be answered for awhile...&quot;Where is Kira?&quot;............"},{"Title":"Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Gateways, Book 4)","review":"I look forward to every new DS9 book because of the new characters - so far they have not only had great character development, but also great stories (too bad no one has breathed new life into the Next Generation books also!)This book does not disappoint.

If you have read the other 3 books, then here you learn a bit more about the Iconians. It's a solid storyline, and worthy of your time. Now, just a moment to whine - Star Trek editors, please, please have more books that don't involve part twos, threes, fives, sevens, etc - I'm getting &quot;to be continued&quot; to death!"},{"Title":"Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Gateways, Book 4)","review":"Demons of Air and Darkness is another adventure in the continuing saga of Star Trek: Deep Space 9. After the TV series ended, Pocket Books decided to continue the adventures of the station and some of its crew (other crewmembers had moved on in the final episode). The first two books (Avatar books one and two) were a wonderful beginning. I haven't read Section 31: Abyss yet, but I found this one in the library and decided to check it out. While not being as good as Avatar, it's still up there. It's well written, with just a bit too much Trek continuity for my taste to mar the quality.Sounds a bit convoluted, doesn't it? Thankfully, Candido does a good job of juggling all of the different storylines. First, I should tell you that this book is actually Book 4 in the Gateways 7-part series that goes through all of the Trek book series. However, you do not need to have read any of the other books to know what's going on. All of the books are designed to stand on their own two feet, and this one does, except that you have to read book 7 to find out what ultimately happens to Kira. That was a bit annoying, since I now have to track that book down. But it is manageable.Overall, this is another winner in the DS9 series. The characters are well-defined, with all of them getting their moment in the spotlight. The cool thing about a continuing series is that the characterization can be carried through subsequent books, and this one is no exception. Ever since Avatar, we have known that there is some tension between Ensign ch'Thane and his \\"mother\\" (for lack of a better term). This storyline is touched upon in this novel as well. Ch'Thane is a very interesting character, and the Andorian race (which ch'Thane is one) is fleshed out from what we have seen in the TV series. Evidently, the race is dying out, and his mother is very upset that he won't come home and start a family on Andor. He is, however, very happy in Starfleet and has no desire to go home. It doesn't make matters any easier that she is on the Federation council. It is all very interestingly done, and I look forward to further exploration of this fascinating species.The bad thing, of course, about continuing series is that the characterization can be carried through to subsequent books. Thankfully, this doesn't become a problem in this one. The previous book was about Doctor Bashir and involved the Jem'Hadar named Taran'atar. He evidently learned a lot about humans and the Federation in that book, but anything important is summarized in this book, so it's not a problem. He's also an interesting character given a lot to do, especially when he joins Kira in the Delta Quadrant. He ends up getting into the fight of his life. Candido portrays all of this well, including the inner conflict that Taran'atar has during the fight. He is torn between protecting Kira and the joy of conflict. It was nice having the needed information from Abyss given in this one, so you don't have to track down the other one unless you truly want to.The rest of the characters are excellently done as well. The writers and editors of this series have taken some of the best characters from the TV show, expanded on their characters, and added a host of new characters who you like to read about. The cast is perfectly done, and I can honestly say that there isn't a boring person in the bunch (though Dax comes close). Each person gets some good \\"screen time\\" in this novel, with only Ro Laren getting short shrift in the beginning (though she makes up for it in the end). They are all three-dimensional, and play their parts to the hilt.Candido handles the multiple storylines very well. He cuts away at just the right moments, making all of the disparate stories interesting. You are never reading one section and saying to yourself \\"I wish he'd leave these losers and go back to Kira\\" or something like that. The only shortfall in this book is the abundance of continuity references to previous Trek television shows. I suppose that's par for the course in a sub-series of books which is about something that comes out of the TV series (like the Gateways concept is), but it still started to become annoying. There were references to many of the televised episodes, some of them that didn't really need referencing. Gul Macet from one of the Next Generation episodes, is in the book for no real reason, as it could have been any other Cardassian. At times, the book makes the Star Trek universe seem very small, though it's not nearly as bad as some other Trek books.Still, if that's the only strike against this book, that's saying a lot. I'm really enjoying these post-television Deep Space 9 stories, and I plan on tracking down as many of them as I can. With an interesting cast of characters, intriguing plots and an ongoing storyline, you can't go wrong. Demons of Air and Darkness is yet another winner.David Roy"},{"Title":"Renaissance costuming for festival participants","review":"A decent reference given as a photocopied handout to new entertainers at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival.

I first read \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" (\\"'''' '''' ''''''\\") during my military service and I recall it making a great impression on me. Reading it now, more than twenty years later, it is still a remarkably moving and impressive book (especially given how short it is).In concise and somewhat dry prose, without resorting to over dramatisation, Frankl describes his personal experiences as a Holocaust survivor. He asks a basic question: how can the concentration camp experience help explain why people hang on to life. Frankl uses the experiences from the concentration camps, perhaps the worst possible place for a human being to believe and hang on to life, in order to formulate a psychotherapeutic method in finding a reason to live (Logotherapy). He describes the three stages a typical concentration camp prisoner goes through - shock, apathy and disillusionment - and concludes that regardless of the hardships every person finds a reason to live. For one person it might be God or religion; for another it might be a beloved one waiting for him on the outside; for yet another it might be some personal goal that still needs to be accomplished. Whatever the reason, humans find a way to hang on to life in the worst possible circumstances.Frankl's basic conclusion is that basic tenement of Jewish faith: freedom of choice (although Frankl did not frame his theory in any religious terms). Ultimately, regardless of the conditions of life, freedom of choice remains the one determining factor of how a person will live. And Frankl says that the right choice to make in order to have a meaningful life is to help others find their meaning of life, to be a decent person, a mentsch.

I'd never read a book about that, so I was interested to see how he would describe his experiences. In the next part, he talks about his psychiatric method Logotherapy which is a very interesting subject itself.Honestly, it wasn't so much the experiences he talked about that made me stop and think; not the inhumanity, or the excessive strain the camp victims were put under. It was his view and analysis of the circumstances he and his camp mates found themselves in which made me put the book down on more than one occasion and to think deeply about what he had to say. This happened constantly throughout the book, and it made me reflect on the suffering that I have gone through throughout my lifetime.As a final note, there is a part in the book where he talks about paradoxical intention. I have found it to be a great way to break the old habit of freezing up in the urinal when another person is standing next to me. I've also used it with great success in helping me fall asleep when I start to worry that I'm not going to be able to fall asleep.Man's Search for Meaning is certainly a book worth reading by everyone, and especially by people who have undergone an incredible amount of suffering in their lifetimes."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Wonderful book frankl demonstrates great insight into his struggles to stay alive during his horrific experiences in Auschwitz.

Viktor Frankl's accounts are intense and disturbing, but only by description in service of his supporting how finding purpose in the darkest circumstances can for for the human spirit, and ultimately survival. It is not a book about the suffering and the horror. In fact, his writing about his years in the camps offers a perspective that few could ever come to on their own. His conviction that a fulfilled life comes from finding meaning in what one does, day to day, is convincing and I have seen it played out in my life, with my friends, and in my work time and time again. It is not a treatise on finding an overarching meaning for one's life as a whole &#8211; that would be overwhelming &#8211; and he insists not possible until our death.

He explains his experiences in a concentration camp. In his book he explains the experiences which led to his discovery of logotherapy and his main premise details why life holds a potential meaning under any condition. The main premises and conclusions are:* Do not aim at success the more you aim at it and make if a target the more you are going to miss it* Three things prisoners felt upon entering concentration camps shock, apathy, and delusion* When they say a prisoner smoking his own cigarettes they knew he had given up on faith* Frankl wasn't one of those whom shock of admission greatly depressed. He smiled at a prisoner who told him he was in danger* Dreams were more of a regression at retreat to a more primitive form of mental life. His wishes and desires became obvious in his dreams* Sensitive people were able to retreat from their terrible surroundings to a life of inner riches and spiritual freedom and survived better than those of robust native* He understood how a man who has nothing left still may know bliss be it only for a brief moment in the contemplation of his beloved* He says love goes beyond physical person it finds its deepest meaning in spiritual being his innerself, whether or not their alive is of no importance. Fate was one's master and that one must not try to influence it in any way* They did not bare their sufferings with a genuine achievement. There is one thing I dread not to be worthy of my sufferings* It is this spiritual freedom which can not be taken away that makes life meaningful and purposefully correct* A man who could not see the end of his provisional existence was not able to aim at an ultimate goal in life. Therefore his inner life changed regarding our provisional existence as unreal was in itself an important factor in causing prisoners to lose their hold on life* Emotion ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it* He who has a why to live can bear any how* If someone knows why they want to live you will be able to deal with whatever if takes to live* Life ultimately means taking responsibility to find right answers to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which if constantly sets for each individual* For tears bare witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer* He talks about commonplace truth no one has right to do wrong not even if wrong has been done to them* Person whose memory alone had given him courage in camp did not exist anymore when the day of his dreams finally came he found it so different from all he had longed for* How do we examine what we think what are we trying to unmask in concentration camp the people became who they were deep down there is a way in which we as people are unmasking certain opinion* Bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph to turn one's predicament into a human achievement* Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now* Just because life has no meaning we do not sit back and do nothing the fact that we are in the world serves no purpose* Human being is not in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to become happy and through actualizing the potential meaning inherent dormant in a given situation* Emotion are meaningful reasonable or unreasonable as they conform to reason or fail to conform. Heart never takes place of head but should obey itI believe all of his arguments are good however he does make a few mistakes. Frankl talks about determinism and how man needs this, but determinism is self refuting that's how it falls on this principal. He also say how the heart should never take place of head but if it didn't he would not have made it through those camps He uses the emotions as a way for man to deal with the hard life of the concentration camps. Frankl commits no fallacy but points one out about two wrongs not making it right as a way to compensate for what has happen to the prisoners. I think he is very fair in the since that he does not talk bad about the abuse nor does he present his argument as a person who has been brutally beaten in a concentration camp.When I first read this book I was a little upset because I felt like the voices of the people who died and suffered in these camps were not heard. Later as I went through to evaluate the argument I realized how important it was to understand it like Frankl had mention He uses strong ideas when dealing with difficult situations and I believe this as well. In conclusion I feel Frankl did a good job in his arguments for logotherapy and survival in the words of C. S. Lewis either the premise is already concealed in the imperative or conclusion is the indicative."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Surely topics and questions that have not been sufficiently answered since time began (whenever that was).My paperback copy was swiped off the shelf of my maternal grandmother's; no telling how much she payed for it at the time,(25 cents maybe for a 1960's copy?).I loved this book, even though it deals with horrific realities in a concentration camp.Victor Frankl's experiences in the camp at Aushwitz are herein related. Also, threaded within that account are his reflections on the human psyche's response to such horrifying treatment which gave credence and further insight into his own developing system of psychotherapy, later termed logotherapy. His life's work was hidden within his coat, but the Nazi's confiscated and destroyed his manuscript upon arrival at the camp. He would spend whatever precious moments of personal freedom to scribble his thoughts on whatever he could find to keep those thoughts alive.What made the most lasting impression on me was his describing that first day at Aushwitz when the Nazi's, from a sick and twisted interpretation/understanding of Matthew 25:33, divided all of the arrivals into two groups, one to be gassed and the other to survive and go through a hellish ordeal at the unmerciful mercy of their captors. My thoughts on the Nazi's action in that instance is that they must not have read in their Bibles where God says \\"Vengeance is mine says the Lord, I will repay\\" which is found in both the Old and New Testaments, and to Abraham and his descendants \\"I will curse those who curse thee\\" Genesis 12:3.Frankl's Logotherapy has benefitted such groups of people suffering from depression and other severe forms of mental disturbances."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Seriously? I enjoyed the book but it is so outrageously over-hyped I have to wonder what a spoiled pack of brats the people who consider this book to be life changing are.Quick summation of the book.

If you don't have something outside of your immediate circumstances to look forward to you will be broken.Enjoyable read, ridiculously over-hyped."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I was anticipating this read so much that when I finally started reading it, it was a slow and drawn out first section of the book. There are basically two parts to the book: one is Viktor's experience in the Nazi camps and the other is his examination of the effects on him and others he observed. The first part of the book is what \\"killed\\" it for me. Too much detail and just too long for what he's trying to get to. The second part of the book is much better, but not what I thought it would be. Overall, this book is highly raved about by speakers, leaders, etc but I think it's just because the overall them of the book, not because the book is so great."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"As many stories introduce themselves, there are many times a main character who plays a strong influence in the books' effect on the person reading it. The reader will often be able to connect to the main character through similarities that they share. It could also be the willpower or determined personality that lure the reader closer to the main character. In the case of Man's Search for Meaning, this was exactly what happened to me. I was hooked by the first page. The author really allowed me to think about for who and what I am living for. If I were to put myself in his optimistic shoes, I would realize that there is no way I could have gone through what he did with the positive attitude that he had. Not only were his personality traits shining through the cover of the book into my mind, but alson adding to the books' real meaning.My favorite personality trait would be Viktor's inspirational glow on life. His powerful quotes fill the magical pages with truth and acceptance to his new life in the camps. He teaches us that we need to sit back and just think about the true meaning in our lives. He is sure that he will get out of the camps alive and be able to share his story with the world. He overall just believed in what he said and was confident that everything would turn out okay.Throughout Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor's personality traits shined out to me like a lightning bug in a dark night sky. In the camps he had a way of helping other prisoners get their hopes up and many others to find their meaning in life. It was his personality that pulled him through all his hardships."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"If your looking for an alternative theory to Freudians, this books is great!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have been to the concentration camp at Munich, Germany.

Even in those conditions, those who found meaning and future in their suffering were able to live. I like how he puts it, If you break your neck, don't let it break you.CASE FOR: I was very impressed with a lot of the information he provided, my favorite is on success. The whole book unfolds beautifully. He touches up fear, love, sexuality and clears up some of the distorted views, explaining why we miss certain targets in life.CASE AGAINST: his answer to man's meaning is no true meaning at all. He provided example of a man who thought he was going to be released on a certain date, and so he lived for that date. But when it didn't happen, he got sick and died. So he was saying how we need a meaning, a goal in life. He was pointing how we each have an earthly meaning to fulfill. But that example contradicts him and proves how foolish it is to put a meaning in earthly things, here today and gone tomorrow. And when they disappear, so does your meaning to life.

In \\"Man's Search For Meaning,\\" he tells readers about his experiences in Auschwitz concentration camp, and how he discovered logotherapy by going through this horrible experience. In case you are wondering, the object and challenge and challenge of logotherapy is to put together ties of meaning and responsibility in people's lives, and actually make themselves feel important.Dr. Viktor E. Frankl was a long time prisoner in various concentration camps. There he was stripped of his feeling of existence. His mother, father, brother, and wife were sent to gas chambers and killed. Everyone in his family, except his sister, unfortunately died in these concentration camps. He went many days without eating or sleeping, in brutally freezing temperatures. Knowing that every single day he was on the brink of extermination, how did he still find life worth living? That is what this book really sums up in one word, logotherapy.All of Frankl's stories in this book ring true to anyone that suffered the tortures of these concentration camps. He views the human spirit with compassion and truth. It really makes his experiences worth listening to. Even though I, certainly, have never been in a concentration camp I felt that Frankl's words and feelings were shown greatly in his writing. It is definitely not a cakewalk to talk about your past when it has such a difficult history. This really shows that you do not have to be quiet about dark emotions. Do not feel burdened to be silent when you know you were the one who experienced such tragedies.I have never liked reading about the concentration camps in Europe, because those thoughts are not comforting to someone who does not want to face the reality of it. This was very detailed and specific on all the accounts in the camps. Although, it also was very clear on logotherapy, so needless to say it was very dry. The message that the book made obvious to me was that we cannot forget the past, but cannot dwell on it either. The grass is always greener on the other side, and we always must move on no matter where life takes us."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book shook me to the core.I had a huge breakthrough.I read it six times and will probably read it six more.Buy it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"i rate high because the book was exlent to read.i like this book, and I will recomend the mean's searching for a menaing if you like the why of everything.enjjoy reading and relax."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I liked the first part of the book describing some of the author's experience in the WWII concentration camps.

I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE TO ADD TO THEIR COLLECTION"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I realize that this book probably has historical significance for the field of psychotherapy. Parts One (Concentration Camp) and Two (Logotherapy) were originally published in Austria in 1946. The author, apparently a distinguished psychiatrist, spent three years in Nazi concentration camps when he was in his late 30s. His education was circa 1920s-30s, at the University of Vienna (Freudian influences certainly abounded at that time.)From a 2003 (and a layperson's) perspective, this book touches upon many ideas, and not in a particularly concise or unified way. These ideas, from my perspective, are often the embryonic stages and \\"seeds\\" of thought often more specifically and fully expressed in future and current psychology. Interestingly, he questions pure Freudian theory--maybe this was fairly novel in 1946. Self actualization, self-transcendence, finding an authentic self are ideas later espoused by Maslow, Dr. Phil MacGraw, and other psychologists. Perhaps the book would have been more effective for me if I had read it in 1946, but I wasn't born yet. I believe the best audience for it in 2003 are psychologists/psychiatrists--there are ideas/\\"seeds\\" for graduate students to expound upon and develop.I much prefer The Diary of Ann Frank, or The Pianist, in terms of artfulness and my developing empathy for the characters, than Frankl's somewhat detached professional espousal of Holocaust atrocities. A dated, sometimes rambling discourse. The 1984 postscript seems \\"cobbled onto\\" the original. There are 40 pages of bibliography that append the book-is this included for hisprofessional audience? Not uninteresting, but not worth revisiting."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I ordered this book for myself after one of the other women on the tour suggested it. I've only read a few chapters. It's not a book you can't put down. I haven't had any free time to go back and read more of it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Reading this book was largely a waste of my time. Frankel does not set forth a literary experiment in an attempt to prove a hypothesis. Rather, he gives the hypothesis and then assumes the hypothesis to prove his beliefs. Frankel commits the cardinal sin of writing a persuasive work: he assumes his theory is correct instead of proving it. He never even attempts to prove it. This man needs to learn the scientific method. As a persuasive work, this volume is woefully inadequate."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Looking, for the moment, beyond the glaring and obvious problems with the supposed philsophy Mr. Frankl provides in this book and getting to the, in this case, much more important issue, which is the overall negative effect and even immense pain that this writing not only already has caused but continues to cause persons, well, I both feel and think it important to state that this is the most reprehensible book I have ever read. His opinions when it comes to therapy are unhealthy to say the least and his entire theory is groundless and irrational.In this book, Mr. Frankl admits to telling a man that the meaning to that man's life since the death of his beloved wife was to feel pain! Mr. Frankl even went on to tell that poor man whom for whatever reason bought into his proprietary brand of crazy, termed \\"logotherapy,\\" that he should embrace the pain and even nurture the pain so as to be able to feel it more fully. What??? Therapy??? Psychosis?Viktor Frankl is, in my opinion, a mentally-ill person whose book has caught on for some reason yet unknown to me. There is no meaning to be found anywhere around this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book was required reading in college and now 20 years later it seems to take on a different kind of meaning for me. The second read was so much more than I expected. The book helped me be more appreciative, less judgmental of others and gave me insight into life and how to deal better with what life throws at me. We do have choices about how we think."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I'm surprised there aren't a lot more reviews on this book. It might just be the best book I've ever read (and it's really short and easy to read).Viktor Frankl is an amazing man- a psychiatrist who lived in the concentration camps during WWII, and not only made it through and came out alive, but went on to touch many people's lives.The first half of the book, Viktor takes you through his experiences as a prisoner of the concentration camps. It's a unique perspective because he's really getting into what happens mentally to the prisoners and guards. Why do some continue to have the will to live despite everything? Why do others give up and let themselves die? Why do some prisoners show incredible cruelness toward their fellow prisoners, while some of the guards show compassion and kindness? Everything seems to hint to the fact that we are not just a product of our experiences. Even in a concentration camp where it seems like every freedom is stripped of the prisoner, the prisoner is still free on some level to make choices about his own will to live and his own character. So what is it that causes different men in the same situation to make different choices?The second part of the book delves into the answers he came to for all of those questions, as Viktor explains his psychotherapy (or \\"logotherapy\\"). I'm not going to get into all of it now, because I'd rather just recommend you read it yourself. I am sure you will not be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I had to read the first half of this book for a college class (\\"Great Human Questions\\"), but I continued the book to its end because I was amazed by Frankl's life, thoughts, and insights. Although a psychiatrist, much of his method of helping patients came from existential philosophy rather than abstract psychological theories.The first half of the book details how he came to write the book through witnessing events in various Nazi concentration camps, and how he felt he survived when others didn't because he had found a reason for living while others had given up. The second half of the book discusses and tries to explain his theory of logotherapy, which I am still not sure I understand.Man's Search for Meaning is probably a book I will read over and over again throughout my life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"A Man's Search for Meaning is definitely worth reading. The first half of the book is an easy 5 stars but the second half not so much. The entire book is good and I would suggest it to anyone. I would especially recommend it to anyone interested in psychology."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor E. Frankl is a famous Austrian psychiatrist well known for the invention of a new way of treating psychiatric ailments called logotherapy. Logotherapy strives to make the patient understand the purpose and meaning of his/her life. The meaning may differ from one person to another. It differs from the previous popular psychiatric theories based on the pleasure of sex by Freud and the urge for power by Adler. \\"Man's search for meaning\\" is a book which explains how Fankl survived concentration camps which lead to the eventual development of logotherapy.I read this book a few weeks back. This book is effectively divided into three parts. First part explains the tough conditions faced by Frankl in the Nazi concentration camps in Auschwitz and Dachau. Second part provides the realizations of Frankl through his experiences in extreme conditions of concentration camps. It provides in a nutshell the treatment of basic psychic ailments through logotherapy. Frankl and his students have treated millions of people using logotherapy and some of the instants are narrated in this part. Third part of the book includes a lecture given by Frankl which got appended to the book later as an overview of logotherapy.This book though a bit too hectic read to start with, poses some of the vital questions. How to find meaning of one's life even in highly improbable extreme situations? How to keep faith on oneself that the suffering would soon end, even if the conditions do not seem so? Why did not all the members of the concentration camp commit suicide? What impulse drove them to survive unrecoverable tortures imposed on them by the Nazis? How could the inmates of concentration camp cope up with the fear of being put in a gas chamber any moment? All these questions are elegantly answered in this wonderful book through search for meaning.Frankl gives instances how he helped the inmates of the camp even when he was suffering himself. Frankl also provides glimpses of the later treatments he provided to some of his patients which directed them to realize the real meaning of their life. Frankl makes it very clear that there is no such thing called universal meaning for every one's life. The meaning of life differs from one individual to another. The meaning can be anything like one's love for parents, affinity towards some God, completion of professional duty, etc. While in the camp, Frankl was driven by his love for wife and the psychotherapy book which was incomplete. Logotherapy can just direct one towards identifying that meaning of his/her life. It is for the individual to take the lead and live to fulfill that meaning.Though I have heard about the theories of Freud and Adler, I have not read their works. But after reading this book, I felt Frankl's logotherapy to be much more effective in facing life's challenges. The very fact that Frankl lived for more than 90 years even after going through the tortures of Nazi concentration camp, supports his theory quite well. The book is lucidly written though not much coherent. However, this book is highly recommended as it provides a detailed account of one of the foremost technique in psychotherapy and makes it accessible to any common man. I am sure every reader will get some different insight on life after completing this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl's classic book, \\"Man's Search For Meaning\\", resonates with significance and purpose. After reading the book, you should be able to find true purpose and real meaning in your life. You should be able to be directed in the right course and direction.The book is divided into two parts. The first part recounts Frankl's experience during World War II at the concentration camps. He recounts on how he was able to survive. It boils down to purpose and meaning. Those who had a purpose and meaning to live had better odds of surviving the concentration camps. The second part discusses logotherapy.How do you find significance and meaning in your own life? Well, it is important to go through the process and understand and experience life. By serving others and helping others find their significance, you will find your significance and meaning in life.JR FelisildaAuthor of the book,\\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning is probably one of the most impacting books I have ever read. The first part of his story, about his times in the concentration camps, manages to wrench the heart while still steering away from actively striving to highlight the suffering Frankl witnessed daily. Rather, his matter-of-fact tone and reserved yet descriptive telling of his stories in the concentration camps only serve to heighten the sense the reader gets of the trials he endured. But the most poignant part of the novel wasn't, for me, his stories but rather his overall message: that our greatest trait, and our greatest means of freedom, is the freedom to control our attitude towards any situation, no matter how horrendous (and here is where his experience in the concentration camps really serve to emphasize his point as well as his suffering and the suffering of others).The second part of the book, logotherapy, appealed to me almost more than the first portion did. Logotherapy focuses primarily on the goal of finding meaning in one's life. Upon reading the definition I thought, skeptic that I am, that sure--this is a great goal, but perchance all hot air. It wasn't until I read the rest of Frankl's portion on logotherapy, read as he related it to problems across all fields, from dissatisfaction at work to a loss of faith in one's own capabilities, and it wasn't until I went back and related these techniques that I realized how revolutionary Frankl's theories are.Of course logotherapy doesn't work for everyone and of course everyone will not agree with it, but believer in logotherapy or psychology or not, it would be a grievous error not to peruse Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning. It is a book that will change the way you look at the world, whether you take the psychology into consideration or not."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning is a fantastic read. Half of the book is about his struggles in concentration camps, but I particularly enjoyed the second half about logotherapy. The idea that you can survive anything by keeping a will to live is a simple, yet extraordinary idea. Frankl mentioned how the first people to die were the ones that had lost a purpose in their life. They did not imagine a goal, and were left to die in the concentration camps.My favorite quote from the book is \\"Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now.\\" In other words, do something wrong that you know how to do right. You only have one life, don't waste it. Obviously people don't always know what the best decision at every given moment, but this is about controlling that which you have control over. Take advantage of the life you are giving, don't throw it away because there is always someone else who would do anything to have your life.Originally, I thought that this book applied only to the bigger issues in life; that it is about you life as a whole. While that does seem to hold true, the idea of meaning can be applied to all aspect of one's life. Whether it is something menial or something life threatening, having that goal or purpose leads to you putting forth a constant effort. That effort can change someone's life, just like this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning is one of those stories that remains in your mind for years after having read it. The stories duel nature, the first half of the book recounting his experiences in Nazi concentration camps and the second half explaining the essence of logotheraphy, instills a hope in the reader that allows one to find meaning in the struggles of life. Viktor Frankl's explanation of finding meaning in ones life is from trite. The practice of logotheraphy presents itself as real and difficult yet obtainable. In using his own story he does not glorify his triumph in overcoming the brutality of the camps, yet he recapitulates his experience for the purpose of presenting an example to demonstrate how even after the roughest of situations hope can be found. His story instilled the feeling of strength and power within myself and I can almost guarantee these same feelings will be found in every reader."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I found this book to be incredibly good. It's one of only a couple books I've found myself reading without any knowledge of the time that's gone by. It's a small book but has great spiritual, emotional, and moral qualities. It helped me understand some of my own emotions I felt, when realizing how to many, human life was insignificant while being in prison. The way he described his release was also similar to my own experiences. Although the comparison is no where equal. I believe there are many similarities. I recommend this book for everyone. It will keep you entertained from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I was reading a counseling book on the \\"Search for Meaning\\" and in the introduction Dr. Gary Collins stated, 'For a number of years Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning was required reading for all incoming freshmen at a Christian Liberal Arts college where I taught.' The statistics showed that students who read this book upon entering college did better in their academic life because it helped prepare them to understand what their true desire in life was.So, before I finished that book I purchased this book and read it. I was amazed at all of the lessons that are taught, all of the theories that made sense and the purpose that it gives towards the work of a counselor that was so practical.The first half of the book talks about Fankl's time spent in a Nazi prison camp. He talked about how there was only a 1 in 28 chance that the prisoner would survive the camp. Most either died from disease or malnutrition or they were sent to the ovens where they died. Many more died by their own hand. Their lack of hope for a future drove them to suicide.Frankl took his observations of human nature and the experience in the war camps to think through the best way to provide counseling for people who are stressed, anxious, depressed, etc. The counseling he came up with is called 'Logotherapy.' He states that \\"Logo\\" is a Greek word which denotes, \\"meaning,\\" and therapy is the method used to help people learn to deal with their neuroses.So, 'Logotherapy' focuses on the future, that is to say, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in his future. In other words, what is the meaning of life for the individual that is being counseled. As a counselor you must remember that the meaning of life for each of your patients will differ. There is not one easy answer that works for everyone. Each person is different. One of Frankl's favorite quotes is from Nietzche and it is, \\"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.\\" The point of that statement is that people can endure any suffering, any disease, any hard life lesson if they know that they have a reason to live for.This is why a patient with cancer may beat all the odds, in other words, he is told he has only two months to live, but because he desires to see his child graduate from college he might actually live for 9 more months until that accomplishment is fulfilled and then the person takes a turn for the worse and dies. There was meaning for life, so life was lived.The second half of Fankl's book expresses his thoughts on why Man's Search For Meaning is so powerful and so necessary for each person. The subject is not fully discussed, this is a summary of his overall therapy method and learning. But it gives you a great introduction to what he believes is a good therapy format.After reading through this short book I can see why Dr. Collins and others felt that this was a good book for college freshman to read. The statistics gathered by George Barna were that upon entering college when asked what they hoped to accomplish, students answered 84% of the time that they wanted to find the meaning for their lives. The other 16% stated they wanted to gain a degree to earn more money and satisfy their desires.So, let's help our students and others learn more about the meaning for their lives. From a Pastor's point of view I was amazed at how well Viktor Frankl's thoughts weave right into Holy Scripture and are so pertinent.I think all serious students will gain much insight from this short work.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I was given this book by my psychotherapist while I was suffering a deep and long-term depression. I cannot understate just how crucial this book was in helping overcome that depression. I realize that not everybody will have the same reaction to this book as I had, but I do sincerely believe that everyone's life can become at least slightly better after having read it. Dr. Frankl is not your average psychotherapist. In the book, he tries to explain the \\"existential vacuum\\" that he believes is the ultimate underlying cause of our mental neuroses. Frankl argues that the human creature needs a purpose or a meaning for which to live, otherwise he sinks into a deeply nihilistic, life-denying depression. This purpose or meaning is unique for each individual, and it can even change over time. Frankl believed that life was full of suffering and pain, and that quite often there is very little we can do to alleviate it - except to find a meaning or purpose that can help us to overcome it. Without a meaning or purpose in life, the individual would have little reason to get out of bed to face each day's challenges. Meaning overcomes suffering. Meaning defeats nihilism. That is the core message of Dr. Frankl's book. It is a message that I myself need to hear and learn in order to win the battle against my depression. It is also a message that I believe that many, many modern people need to hear and understand because we live in a world that is increasingly dominated by depression, apathy, and nihilism. \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" teaches us that we can create our own meaning in life - a meaning that is uniquely situated to us and the suffering that we individually struggle against. Out of the empty vacuum of existential nothingness, the human being can create his own meaning or purpose in life. Just because the universe or life itself may have no inherent meaning, we can still create meaning on our own. Indeed, Dr. Frankl says that this is the highest achievement to which the human being can aspire - to create his or her own meaning in life despite the suffering and emptiness of existence. Dr. Frankl's own life proves that this is so: he managed to create his own meaning in the death and concentration camps of the Holocaust. If the human being can create meaning there, then it is possible to do so anywhere. Dr. Frankl's own life experiences serve as evidence and testament to the truth of his ideas. The human being can create meaning and purpose no matter the suffering and torment that the universe throws at him. This is a very powerful and compelling message, in my opinion. But, do not take my word for it, read the book for yourself!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I was given this book by my psychotherapist while I was suffering a deep and long-term depression.

The author survived Auschwitz during the Second World War. He emerged from the death camp having lost everything that mattered to him. His beloved wife was dead, his family was dead, almost all of his friends or acquaintances were dead or dying. He himself was nothing more than a bag of bones, barely clinging to life. In addition he had lost the manuscript of the book he had been writing, the work of his life. He saw no future for himself, and his past contained only suffering and death.In the days after the end of the war when his camp had been liberated by the Allied armies, Frankl said, he\\"...walked through the country past flowering meadows, for miles and miles, toward the market town near the camp. Larks rose to the sky and I could hear their joyous song. There was no one to be seen for miles around; there was nothing but the wide earth and sky and the lark's jubilation and the freedom of space. I stopped, looked around, and up to the sky - and then I went down on my knees. At that moment there was very little I knew of myself or of the world - I had but one sentence in mind - always the same: \`I called to the Lord from my narrow prison and he answered me in the freedom of space.' How long I knelt there and repeated the sentence memory can no longer recall. But I know that on that day, in that hour, my new life started. Step by step I progressed, until I again became a human being.\\"He had felt, for the first time, a spark of hope. That was all he needed to begin living again. He had found a subtle meaning in the beauty of the world and he could use his new consciousness and connection to that beauty as a reason to go on living.Frankl's little book was one of the most important books I've read in my life. When I was eighteen I understood only a bit of what he was trying to say, but it was enough to provide a frame that allowed me to continue my life and to continue learning.We all make meaning from the fragments of our lives, said Frankl, from the beauty of the world around us, from the fragile connections we have with each other. We construct a narrative that allows us to survive because it tells us who we are and what it is we love.The Sword of the Lord: The Roots of Fundamentalism in an American Family"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"If you have a heart, read this book.If you have a mind, read this book.If you are human, read this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I read this book for extra credit in a psychology class and it's now among my favorites!

It's important to read the first part which details how Dr. Frankel was able to find meaning in the most difficult of all circumstances, as a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp.However, the real impact is the modern day applications of his theory of Logotherapy, and he brilliantly outlines how his timeless principles are applicable even in 2010!

Having just finished this book I really wish I would have made the time earlier. The lessons within could have easily been applied earlier and with great results. This book is simply remarkable. At 165 pages, \\"Man's Search For Meaning\\" is lightweight compared to some of my other reads, but this book took me some time to read, not because the subject matter was difficult, but because it really caused me to stop and reflect many a time.

In \\"A Whole New Mind\\" the author, Daniel Pink, has come up with six senses that are important to develop one's mind in a Conceptual Age and \\"meaning\\" is one of the them. The idea that we have to read a book to realize that we have to develop meaning in our lives seems pathetic. But nevertheless, I was intrigued by Pink's description of \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" and read it immediately after reading \\"A Whole New Mind\\". Surprisingly I had never heard of \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" nor its author Victor Frankl even though its afterword states that it has sold 12 million copies in 24 languages and in a 1991 \\"Book of the Month\\" survey was voted among the 10 most influential books by readers.The book is the story of Frankl's experience as a prisoner in various concentration camps during World War II. Before being arrested, he was working on a manuscript about his psychological theories (he had been a practicing psychiatrist in Vienna). Though his wife sewed the manuscript in his coat, it was soon confiscated in the camp; he proceeded to practice his theory of searching for meaning despite his bleak situation and he also tried to recreate the manuscript on scraps of paper. Despite the grim and horrible scenes described by Frankl, you will be amazed by his outlook on life and how he just kept going. There is no doubt that his survival was aided by his firm belief in the importance of finding meaning in life (in ANY situation). He was also lucky and resourceful. When he was liberated from camp, he wrote the entire book in 9 days.At the end of the book is an essay on his theory of logotherapy which is a very practical outlook on addressing many psychological problems. He states that \\"man's main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life.\\" He says that life has no inherent meaning but rather a unique meaning exists for each person which he has a responsibility to discover. The meaning can be discovered in 3 ways:1) By creating a work or doing a deed2) By experiencing something or encountering someone3) By the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering (though suffering is NOT a prerequisite for discovering meaning)His theory is much more than a theory since it was so effectively put into practice by him and the people he counseled. His theory is given much more weight by his life story (he lost both his parents and his pregnant wife in the camps).

Perhaps the perfect blend of circumstances-a trained psychologist subjected to the horrifying human laboratory of Nazi concentration camps, has produced a work of notable impact. Part biography, part diary, part lab notes, Frankl analyzes his circumstances, his captors, fellow captives, and the human condition with clinical precision and gifted insight. I found myself enthralled with the descriptive skill and hard-won conclusions the author shares such as: love is the highest aspiration of human kind, life requires meaning, that nobility cannot be taken from the truly noble among us.

Heard about it many years ago and always wanted to read it. I HIGHLY recommend that everyone read this. It's a very interesting psychological look at the people who survived the Nazi death camps in particular, but in general, is a good resource for anyone going through a hard time. It looks at the coping mechanisms of those who survived, and the mindset of those who gave up, and reminds us all that even when everything including our very identity is taken away, we still have something that NO ONE can take unless we let them - how we will deal with our challenges. Will we give up and give in, defeated; or will we choose to look past the bad stuff at the sunset, the puppy's eyes, the pretty flowers and see that there is still good stuff in the world.This book, along withAwakening Joy: 10 Steps That Will Put You on the Road to Real HappinessandHow We Choose to Be Happy: The 9 Choices of Extremely Happy People--Their Secrets, Their Storiesare excellent textbooks on how to bring more joy back into your life.Do yourself a favor and buy all three."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I am in no position to comment on this book, except to suggest others read it.

I have read the second half of the book twice. Victor Frankl's logotherapy makes perfect sense to me. I have been reading many books lately that talk about finding meaning and purpose in life. This is the book that puts the icing on the cake as far as believing that having a purpose is the link to survival as well as day to day happiness. As Dr. Frankl states \\"Happiness is not something to be pursued\\" it is a byproduct of living a life of meaning and purpose. I would also recommend logo-therapy as the place to start if you are struggling with any type of mental illness or depression. This book is a excellent read and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning is an interesting and inspirational book that asks the question, what motivates the human race to survive? After surviving the hardships faced during his 3 years in four different concentration camps, Viktor Frankl created a theory known as Logotherapy. From \\"Logos\\" the Greek word for Meaning. During his time in the camps Frankl attempted to rewrite his life's achievement his manuscript. It was taken from him when he first arrived in Auschwitz. Whenever he found a small scrap piece of paper he would write down what he could. Frankl believes that the rewriting of his manusript is what allowed him to survive. In the second section of the book entitled \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\", Frankl describes his theory of man's primary motivation being his meaning of life. Throught this section of the book he describes where you may find this meaning and how to go about searching for it. I personally have always shown a deep interest in concentration camps and the Holocaust. Therefore it was very easy for me to deeply enjoy this book. I found it interesting and unique that he wrote this book not about the tragic events of WWII but his personal experience. This book inspired me to search for the meaning of my own life and look more deeply into the strength and power of the human mind. In my favorite quote from the book, Frankl describes how not only is he a professor of two sciences, but also is a survivor of four concentration camps who has seen the bravery and strength of the human mind and body."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl developed his theory during thehorrifying experiences he had while being imprisoned in thenazi death camps.

She said it was one of the books that she was required to read in med school. I can understand why this book was chosen. The book delves into one man's reaction to suffering and humiliation while be brutally abused by the Nazis. It is hard to believe that anyone can recover from that ordeal and still be sane!!!Victor Frankl is truly a genious and his positivity during the horrors of Nazi death camp suffering is nothing less than a miracle. His frame of mind is what kept him alive despite the abuse and suffering. He was able to compartmentalize and logically follow steps to avoid death during this period. He theorized how to use this strategy in events of every day life. He is truly a genious in psychiatry."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Even in the harshest of conditions, such as is the case with concentration camps during WWII, the human spirit can prevail, by having something to hold on to to motivate it. This, in essence is the core of the message that Austrian psychiatrist, Viktor E. Frankl conveys in his book &quot;Man's Search for Meaning.&quot; I first learned about it from reading Stephen Covey's &quot;Seven Habits...&quot; Get your copy of this book. It doesn't take too much to read, and you'll find his message deeply rewarding and stimulating."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I've read this book at least three times and still feel it's worth reading again.

The answer is simply yes. The author paints a remarkable picture. The first half of the book recounts his experiences in Nazi concentration camps. The fact that he survived at all is nothing less than miraculous. In the second half, Dr. Frankl writes of logotherapy. Different from other better known forms of therapy, logotherapy focuses on meaning in one's life. It is this which he believes is what deep down we all strive for more, far more, than anything else. There are intriguing concepts such as paradoxical thinking, etc. A remarkable book written by a truly remarkable man.

This book is the great cure for our modern malaise."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl was a distinguished neurologist and psychiatrist and the founder of logotherapy. He was also the 32 books which were published in 32 languages-After three horrific years at Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps , Dr Frankl gained his freedom only to learn that his entire family had been murdered. But during , the terrible suffering and degradation of those grim years , he developed his theory of logotherapy.The first half of the book delves into his experiences in the concentration camps.The author analyses the character of the Capo-prisoners chosen to be trustees and guards of the other inmates- usually because of their brutality and meanness.Frankl observes that 'the best of us did not return'from the concentration camps.He examines three phases of the inmates mental reaction to concentration camp life-the period following his admission ; the period when he is well entrenched in camp routine; and the period following his release and liberation\\".Ultimately in recounting the horrors and dehuminization of concentration camp existance , of being continually stalked by death , , Frankl explains how he survived , and kept his humanity at the same time. The author explains how every moment in the camps offered the opportunity to make decisions about whether or not to submit to the powers which \\"threatened to rob you of your inner self , your inner freedom.\\"The point made was that ultimately the type of person the prisoner would become , was the result of an inner decision , and not of camp influences alone.Frankl refers to the martyrs whose behaviour in the camp , whose suffering and death , demonstrated the fact that their last inner freedom could not be lost.\\"It can be said that they where worthy of their suffering ; the way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievment. It is this spiritual freedom which cannot be taken away- that makes life meaningful and purposeful.\\"Frabkl speaks of the dream which kept him alive in the camp , of lecturing and practising psychiatry- that is essentially G-D's commission to Frankl. The prisoner who lost faith in his future was doomed.The prisoners said to each other that no earthly happyness could alleviate the suffering they had experienced in the camps , but Frankl writes that \\"The crowning experience of all , for the homecoming man is the wonderful feeling that , afetr all he has suffered , there is nothing he need fear anymore-except for G-D\\".The second part of the book explains Frankl's theory of psychology known as logotherapy.\\"According to logotherapy , the striving to find a meaning in one's life is the primary motivational force in man\\".Frankl deals with the universality of values. He notes that in the Nazi concentration camps those who knew that their was a task waiting for them to be fulfilled where more likely to survive\\".On the meaning of life one cannot live for some general goal alone. That goal must be meaningfully present in every moment to make the moment alive in terms of it's destination and future.The meaning of life is that G-d asks every person to answer for his or her life i.e \\"What will you make of your life , my child\\".Only personal choices are authentic choices . Life in it's ultimate meaning confronts us with other people whose lives we influence by the way we are towards them.\\"A human being is not one thing among others , things determine each other , but man is ultimately self-determining\\"."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Simply put, Frankly draws on his experiences in a death camp during WWII to introduce exstentialism into the field of psychiatry. Running contrary to the major 'isms' of the day, fulfillment/meaning is not to be found in the state(Communisms), the people (Fascism), or in free trade (Liberalism). Fullfilment is to be found in whatever an individual chooses, and once that 'topic of meaning' has been chosen, must be daily reaffirmed while protecting the negative liberties of all."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl Wrote this book based on his experiences in a Nazi concentration camp. Through his experience, Frankl used a psychotherapeutic method as a way to survive. This method later became existential therapy. The benefits of Man's Search for Meaning are twofold: creating an additional therapy for man to survive extraordinary situations and the exposing the horrors of Nazi concentration camps. Man's Search for Meaning should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Man's Search for meaning\\" by Viktor E. Frankl is very interesting and inspiring.Most books focusing on the Holocaust mainly state facts, but in \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" Frankl talks about his personal experiences he encountered while being in concentration camps. I can't say I can relate to what his been through because I've never been in such a messed up situations, but this book made me think about a lot of situations differently. Frankl made it clear to me that there is nothing wrong with \\"suffering\\" suffering is a part of life. In the first part of the book Frankl talks about all of the struggling he went through in concentration camps, but what's makes it interesting is how he hardly ever gave up and how he used humor and imagination to survive. He made hisself believe that he was going to get through it all.Frankl stressed the importance of inner decisions in the first part of the book as well. The main question Frankl had was is there still meaning of life after experiencing what he and others went through in concentration camps? How do one start life after experience such brutal treatment?In the second part of the book, which is divided into two sections: the first section called \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\" and the second section called \\"The Case for Tragic Optimism\\" Frankl answer the questions that he had in the first part of the book. He creates logotherapy which helps him find the meaning of life. He used logotherapy to help other prisioners find meaning of life as well. Frankl stated that a man is driven by his search for a meaning in life, which he states in his part about how to conduct logotherapy.After reading Frankl's book I strongly believe that his agruement is good. Frank used his personal expericences to help explain his argument that man's deepest desire is to find meaning and purpose in life. Logotherapy is a logical and realistic way to help humans get through any trials and tribulations.Through all he went through in concentration camps, his inner freedom couldn't be lost. Frankl's lets it be known that there is nothing wrong with suffering,all that matters is that you make inner decisions.One of his biggiest fears was not to be worthy of his suffering.Although things are bad on the outside doesn't mean that the internal part of self should be sour. Man makes his own decisions in life. He lets it be known that human dignity can be retained in concentration camps. I love the book and I recommend everyone take time out to read it. There's a lot not being mention in the reviews, so check it out!!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search For Meaning is a touching account of Viktor E. Frankl's experiences in several concentration camps during World War II. He relates his experiences to his discovery of the meaning of life. His book is a terrifying story of his survival in the concentration camps. He realized that the human spirit is capable of overcoming even the most dire circumstances.Frankl steps out of his own memories and analyzes the psychological consequences of the ongoing torture he is enduring. He describles the differences between those prisoners who had the will to survive to those who gave up. He concluded that major difference was having something to live for. Hope for the future was often what kept a prisoner alive. Despite how hopeless life might seem, it is important to find some good in it. This was his reason to endure each horrible day. The future seemed to make a difference, it was a light at the end of the tunnel.The prisoner defined their existance as not being defeated by their current circumstances, and keeping their thoughts on their future by envisioning their survival. Frankl and many other prisoners realized they could still have control over their inner selves. They realized that man could have everything taken from him except his soul. If you have a positive outlook it helps the world look like a better place. Frankl kenw that he did not have control over what happened to him in the camp, but he did have control of how he reacted to each situation.He invented a new type of therapy that was conceived while he was in the concentration camps called logotherapy. In order to really do something with your life, you cannot sit around and do nothing. You have to go out and try to achieve your goals. Frankl's theory states that man defines his own life by the choices he makes. The way each individual goes about their daily tasks and over comes the barriers that are placed in their way gives their life meaning. This manner of thought can be applied universally because it is not specific to one race or religion. Most prisoners in the camps became aware that there is a higher power. Each choice they made could have an enormous impact on their lives. Frankl took a horrible situation and turned it into a opportunity for growth and self understanding.There is another way to look at logotherapy. You could also interpret it as the individual, alone, makes their own choices in their life. There isn't a higher power that has any impact on them. Frankl's message encourages a person to achieve, and have hope for the future."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Please consider Viktor Frankl and his wonderful books with me for a few moments in time.

It is rare to find an author who gets right to the heart of what it means to be human. Viktor Frankl does this with a well-reasoned theory of human motivation and an intensely powerful life story.Frankl's main idea, namely that man's primary motivational force is his search for meaning in life, is so simple and yet so profound. Through his gripping account of his experience in the Nazi concentration camps, he describes how all the prisoners responded differently than others to the torture and abuses that they faced. Some behaved like animals, while others literally gave their last crumb of bread to a fellow prisoner even though they were all equally hungry. From this experience he developed the notion of what he calls the last human freedom - the ability to choose one's response to any given set of circumstances. And he concludes that in order to endure the horrors of the concentration camps, it was necessary to always have a sense of a future life purpose - a believe that there was some reason to keep on living.Viktor Frankl's book should be considered essential reading for anyone with an interest in psychotherapy or personal leadership. It is one of the few works of non-fiction that I have come across that has virtually universal appeal and applicability."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl is my new hero. Reading this book has truly changed the way I view the world and the people in it, including myself. I bought several copies to give as Christmas presents this year.The first part of the book is Frankl's account of his three years in concentration camps and how he was able to find meaning in his suffering and support for his existential theory for treating individuals' mental health issues. If you read only this part, your life will be changed. But for mental health practitioners and those interested in understanding what makes themselves and others tick, his explanation of Logotherapy is like the meaning of life and existence neatly summed up in a few pages.

Inspirational, Insightful, Touching and Breath-taking."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book describes Frankl's experience in a concentration camp during WWII. I read it for a course I took. I expected a self-help book, but what I got was a life changing work, one of the most inspiring books I've ever read.This powerful book is a firsthand account from a Holocaust survivor about how even prisoners at Auschwitz could still find hope amidst the horrors within the walls of that concentration camp. The experience of those prisoners showed that even the deepest suffering can be turned into something positive.The first half describes Frankl's experiences and observations of life in the camps from 1942-1945, like a Reader's Digest condensed version of Solzhenitsyn's \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch.\\" But Frankl is also a psychiatrist, and his insights into the human behavior he saw are particularly interesting and detailed. He explains some of the coping mechanisms that people used and discusses why some defense mechanisms were more effective than others. Given the title, it's not surprising that the concept of \\"meaning\\" plays a key role.The second half of the book is about how Frankl took the concepts he learned in the concentration camps and applied it to his work as a psychotherapist. Frankl's approach to psychotherapy is called Logotherapy. Logotherapy \\"confronts\\" patients to help them find, recognize, and reorient themselves toward the true, vital meaning of their own lives. Frankl talks about people living in an \\"existential vacuum\\" and proposes a technique or approach through which people can find meaning in work, love, or by responding in a healthy way to difficult circumstances.The book is full of interesting ideas about human behavior and emotions. And of course, the historical context of Frankl's observations and insights makes them that much more powerful. One interesting idea is the concept of \\"paradoxical intention,\\" which implies that people frequently end up doing pretty much exactly the opposite of what they actually intended to do. That may help explain why people who go on a diet frequently end up gaining weight, why people who resolve to quit drinking frequently go back to the bottle, and similar, puzzling behaviors. Frankl describes a number of ways in which understanding the concept of paradoxical intention can help people overcome certain types of seemingly uncontrollable behavior problems.But the key insight of course is the concept of \\"meaning,\\" the idea that it is up to each person to recognize that even if they lose everything, their family, their freedom, their rights, even their very identity, nevertheless there is still one thing that no one can take from them, and that is their ability to choose how to respond to adversity. People who realize that have an incredibly valuable tool for making sense of life, even in the most dire circumstances. The realization that there is a higher purpose, even amidst such circumstances, can be a powerful tool to help one find a way through adversity. That's an awesome thing.This was a very inspirational book. I recommend it to anyone, especially those who may be experiencing something of an \\"existential vacuum\\" in their own lives."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is one of those books that once you start reading you don't want to put it down. It is inspirational from cover to cover. The descriptions of events will paint a clear picture for anyone. This book will really get you thinking about all aspects of your life. Frankl does a marvelous job providing specific examples for every important point of \\"logotherapy\\" he wants his readers to fully comprehend.Frankl talks about his experience in the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz. The description of the dichotomy of man is amazing yet simplistic. To understand that MAN created such an evil thing like a gas chamber, yet no matter how horrible the situation is, MAN always has the freedom to choose how he will react. This freedom can never be taken away, even in the darkest of places...Frankl lived to tell about it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Say yes to life, nevertheless!\\" is the original title in the German mother tongue of Frankl He was a philosopher, doctor, physiotherapist and founder of the Logotherapy (not to be mixed with Logopedics). This is a medical science which emphasises the openness and the chances of a situation and of life, with the aim of encouragement. The pastoral help consists according to Frankl in the dedication to a thing, to another people, in the memory of fortunate moments, in the hope, in humour and in prayer. And even when the whole thing is limitless and inevitable, there is still meaning: to endure sufferings in dignity and with courage.Frankl, a Jew, survived the Nazi concentration camps. His parents, his wife, his brother did not. Shortly after his deliverance he wrote this book with the programmatic title. He depicts herein the life in the camp with the point of view of a participating observer. This relativization helps him to keep distance to the frightful events. At the same time he receives hope in an almost dead-end situation. He advices the desperate people around him for a more biblical attitude of \\"Nevertheless!\\" and to acquire the consciousness that even the desperation of their fight cannot harm the meaning and dignity as long as the courage is preserved.In accordance with that Frankl tried to be an encouraging example. He told them that he himself never thought of losing hope and lived to that. \\"No man knows the future!\\" Not only hope is for Frankl a worthy power for survival, but also love - and this is also something he experiences together with his co-prisoners.For the novelist Basil Hume Frankl\`s narrative of his day-dreams in the middle of a cruel camp-reality where he speaks in thoughts with his also imprisoned wife is one of the most moving reports about human love, that he ever read. In this text Frankl also shows in which respect man is more than just a \\"psychologic organism\\" what he was for Sigmund Freud. He is rather a spiritual being, an eternal creature. In this dimension man is not vulnerable and cannot get sick.After his release Frankl developed his Logotherapy which is taught all over the world. Frankl held several professorships in the USA. He married again. At the age of 70 he acquired his pilot license with the reasoning that he need not acquiesce in everything from himself. He meant his fear of a comedown. For somebody who teaches always to stand up, a consecutive effort."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I'm an actor. You've never heard of me.

I don't complain about not getting work or having to eat pancakes (lie, i eat very well) everyday. I don't complain about being lost in life.This book is magnificent because it doesn't get into the horrid details that we all have heard before. But it gives you the mindset.How can someone watch others, friends and family die. How does it feel. What pulls you through.Read the book.It's a perfect account of a bad situation."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This small volume is a priceless addition to any collection of humanitarian ideas. Its subtext makes several interrelated existential points about human suffering and human meaning; points that only those who have known extreme suffering could make with the kind of conviction and eloquence that Dr. Frankel has made here: That while pain and suffering may be relative, even \\"chosen,\\" the infliction of gratuitous cruelty -- insults, indignities and debasement are absolutes, and is an unforgivable but universal currency applied by all totalitarian systems.Social and political tyrannies, whether soft or hard, are just opposite sides of the same coin of cultural and existential emptiness. They begin first by destroying the most precious of freedoms, the freedom of thought: effectively creating a \\"concentration camp of the mind\\" through social stratification, willful (or benign) neglect, obscene discrepancies in wealth and wellbeing, and by twisted race-based ideologies and other forms of \\"groupthink\\" consensus-based political and social orthodoxies. Then come the politics of exclusion, followed by social death - ghettoes and segregation; and then the final stop: unjust physical imprisonment and eventually removal to concentration camps. It is a gradient that leads progressively to walls of hopelessness and despair and that at each step of the way is every bit as cruel in their cumulative emotional and psychological effects as the electrified fences that enclosed the prisoners of Auschwitz.The existential challenge for the suffer has been put best by Professor Cornel West of Princeton University, who as a self-described \\"Chekhovian Christian\\" sees the challenge as follows: \\"... Being a Chekhovian Christian is refusing to be imprisoned and walled-in by intentionally inflicted misery. It is to wake up each day with a new strategy for survival.\\"That is exactly what Dr. Frankel did in repeatedly facing-down certain death at the hands of the Nazi war-machine. This book and the Logo-therapy that it gave rise to are fitting living tributes to all of those who died in the European holocaust."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This should be required reading in all college programs before students begin their course specific courses. The second half is worth much thought. He is not into any specific religious belief, just spiritual and honest....and insightful."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I had been meaning for several years to read this seminal work but had two reservations in doing so: first, with images of the Holocaust already seared in my mind from films and documentaries, I was hesitant to read what I assumed would be even more graphic descriptions of life in a concentration camp; second, even accepting that Frankl's first-person narrative of life in the camps is important both in historical and moral terms, I had planned to read Part I and dispense with the section describing Logotherapy, believing it would be too inaccessible to the lay person.I was absolutely wrong on both counts.As one trained in probing the psyche, it is understandable that Frankl's account of Auschwitz and Dachau would focus on prisoners' mindsets and reactions to the extreme multiple pressures that they faced. It was surprising, however, to see the degree to which he refrained from employing more vivid descriptions of the state of human anatomy, rank brutality, personal weakness, etc. This is especially interesting given the fact that Frankl set down his thoughts not in hindsight, but initially while still impounded. By emphasizing the actions and reactions of the camps' internees while describing the despicable acts of their captors in the most basic terms, Frankl actually produces an even more gripping and insightful narrative.Having completed Part I, I moved immediately to Part II on Logotherapy, anxious to see how Frankl would construct a new framework of professional analysis based on the numbing, near-shattering environment that he had survived. Eventually I found that I had been informally using some aspects of Logotherapy in reviewing the course of my own life from time to time and that his three-part framework for living - discerning meaning in productivity, meaning in relations with others and striving for a consistent sense of dignity when experiencing unavoidable suffering - resonated loudly in me. Frankl connects the dots between his camp experiences and observations and the development and implementation of Logotherapy quite well, with very limited jargon, and with a stark conclusion.I hesitated before embracing this work. Don't."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I read this book during the weekend. I had to write a report on it for psychology class in college, and the book was presented in such a way that I could not put it down. It's a good book for detailed account and experience for one person at the concentration camp, and it also helps teach that at some point no matter how bad an experience one undergoes, you have to learn from it and move on. I have to admit that I think this book changed me since the time I read it 10 years ago. I have become more adaptive to negative and extreneous situations. It's the only book in college that I really completely read and enjoyed.I commend Dr. Frankl for writting this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I wish I read this 20 years ago, it would have created a whole new perspective on my life. I won't repeat what many of the other fine reviewers have mentioned, but will add the following:According to Frankl, man's search for meaning is his primary motivation for life, not a secondary rationalization.Existential Vacuum, in today's Modern Society, we all have basic food, and shelter, we all can survive (thank goodness we don't have to endure what Frankl had to), we are all comfortable in our existence, and yet this comfort creates boredom, and therefore, our search for meaning is even more compounded. Thus is what Frankl refers to as existential vacuum, we exist today day to day, but do so in a vacuum of existence, until we know our meaning.Man should not ask what is the meaning of life, but rather BE asked. In response, man must answer in his responsible, to whom is he responsible to, to what, to whom?True meaning is discovered in the world, not within man himself. Seek out your experiences, the meaning is out there in the world, not within yourself.You cannot avoid untentional suffering, but you can change your attitude towards it, to give suffering a meaning to you.Live your life as though you were living it the second time. View life as a series of movie frames, the ending and meaning may not be apparent until the very end of the movie, and yet, each of the hundreds of individual frames has meaning within the context of the whole movie.View your life from your funeral, looking back at your life experiences, what have you accomplished? what would you have wanted to accomplish but didn't? what were the happy moments? what were the sad? what would you do again, and what you wouldn't?A must read for anyone searching for a deeper meaning in life. The book won't give you the meaning, only you can, but it will certainly help you get started."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Have you ever wondered what your purpose is? I picked up this book after two speakers referred to it as a must read book. One was a Vietnam POW the other a top producing salesman. I was impressed by both of them and wanted to know what they found in this book that helped them. I wasn't disappointed.Instead of me telling you about the book, I'd recommend getting and reading it. It's fairly short and not as difficult to read as some have suggested. I think you'll be better off. I liked it so much I bought 10 of them and hand them out to people I think need some inspiration."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I got this book as a gift and had no idea what to expect. However after reading it, I have nothing but good things to say. The first part of the book details the author's experiences in several concentration camps during WWII. These experiences are sometimes painful to read but don't go into such a level of depth as to be excrutiating. Also, the experiences are used to make points, not just for the sake of showing how bad these camps were.The second half is used to describe the author's brand of psychotherapy called logotherapy--used to help a patient find a meaning to life. The author is fond of quoting Nietzche &quot;A man who has a why to live can bear with any how,&quot; which is the heart of his theory.Overall, this book is suprisingly uplifting and contains several very positive messages which anyoone can put to use in their own lives. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book portrays the incredible journey of Dr. Viktor Frankl. He survived the horrors of Auschwitz and Dachau, but his brutal experience ironically served as the basis for his life's work. He created a branch of psychiatry called logotherapy, which signifies, \\"therapy of meaning.\\" The work is compelling, candid, motivating, and at times, humorous. Dr. Frankl has an uplifting writing style, and is an excellent observer of events that most people would banish forever from their memories. His unselfish desire to tell his story, despite the painful reminders, should be appreciated by all who cherish human dignity.Dr. Frankl had a rare perspective. A trained medical doctor with a specialty in psychiatry, he was placed in a unique situation. He was able to observe his own reactions to the daily rigors of a concentration camp, along with the behavior of his captors and fellow prisoners from the eyes of a psychiatrist. He chronicles the cruelty not only of the Nazis, but also from some of the other prisoners. Yet throughout his brutal experience, he was able to find meaning in his own suffering. Unlike most of us, he was able to translate his own suffering to help his fellow man.Upon his arrival at Auschwitz, a manuscript containing his life's work was taken from him. From that point on, he relinquished his former life. Very few people learned that he was a doctor, although there were times when he volunteered his services to care for typhus patients. It is ironic that the lost manuscript, his \\"mental child,\\" did not force him to lose all hope. If anything, the reader sees that Dr. Frankl's loss became his meaning for life. His documented experience is now the world's collective gain. This book is a tremendous work of one man's search for meaning, his survival against all odds, along with the triumphant victory of his human spirit.In a time when many of us question the meaning of life after the terrorist bombings, Dr. Frankl's lucid commentary provides a welcome elixir. His message provides hope, courage, and inspiration. Two quotes stand out: \\"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms, to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\" And the second. \\"Live as if you were living for the second time, and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now.\\"Thank you for the opportunity to review this inspirational story."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a lovely book. The ideas are innovative & thought provoking and probably worthy of 5 stars. But I think Frankl would respect reviewers who don't give him 5 stars because he is not intent on getting everyone to believe in one set of ideas or one way of interpreting the world. He wants each person to consider creating their own philosophies and meanings. He was not primarily a student of one previously existing psychological discipline; instead, he set out to take the best parts of the ideas he learned and observed, and he created his own psychological theories. This book is worth consideration, even if you find yourself disagreeing with him regularly. I encourage you to make your own evauations of the things he has to say.I disagree with his position that happiness and success \\"cannot be pursued\\"; especially given that his Logotherapy is \\"not pessimistic but rather activistic.\\" In the same way that his Logotherapy does not consider the \\"will to meaning\\" as a secondary drive to either the will to power or pleasure, I do not consider the will to happiness or will to success to be secondary or passive byproducts to other \\"primary\\" pursuits. He asserts happiness & success only ensue \\"as the unintended side-effect of one's dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it . . . success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.\\" I respectfully disagree. When I read this, alarms go off in my head, like when I hear that G n' R song that suggests \\"patience\\" is the solution to whatever the problem was. Or when I hear people say, \\"There's nothing anyone can do, so just give it to God.\\" Or \\"That's just the way it is and some things will never change.\\" Oh, don't you believe them. As Frankl may tell you in his recounting of the vacuum of morality & humanity in the concentration camps - when God doesn't address problems in a healthy, ethical or timely manner, sometimes the existential response is to ask God to give the problems back to you so you can try to fix them sooner.Another criticism of his happiness and success theories is that they seem to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Yes, he doesn't believe the self interested drives to power and pleasure are dominant or primary. But he goes further to suggest that happiness & success are primarily achieved through \\"surrender\\" to another person or external cause. Yes, Freudian psychoanalysis can lead to neuroses by focusing too much on oneself. But I think better therapeutic solutions are found by giving value and acknowledgement to BOTH self interests AND the interests of others. To exclude either can lead to dishonest, inconsiderate, or harmful results. Frankl sometimes frames options as needing to choose one OR the other (too often mutually exclusive), and I think he does not consider the option of doing BOTH at key times. Also, he sometimes concedes to an acceptance of suffering more often than I would encourage.I agree with Frankl that we are not only defined by the circumstances that occur to us. We are defined by how we interpret them and how we respond to them. Whether a person believes in Logotherapy or any other therapy, I think Frankl, in his examples of his therapeutic work with patients, does a good job of getting across the concept that positive changes can occur when people consider alternate ways of perceiving the actions and behaviors happening around them, and consider new ways of responding to them.Any therapy can be tough, because most therapeutic processes involve losses of pride. They often involve a person making concessions - concessions about their long held, immutable or fundamental core defining beliefs and perspectives. They often involve considering foreign, and previously personally taboo perspectives. And it takes powerful forces sometimes to get some people to consider making such hard concessions - forces such as: potentially losing a loved one, or losing both the House & the Senate and realizing different \\"mighty mandates\\" are in town. (Thank God for democracy and free speech because even when they don't always lead to better policies, they at least promote change.)The Nazis believed that not everyone can or should be allowed to succeed because of their race, religion, status, or philosophies. Frankl's response to the cruel world the Nazis created was to suggest that each individual should be judged by the conduct of their character - by how they responded each day to each hand they were dealt. \\"Former prisoners, when writing or relating their experiences, agree that the most depressing influence of all was that a prisoner could not know how long his term of imprisonment would be. He had been given no date for his release.\\" Yet each day, prisoners like Frankl chose to respond in the best ways they could under the circumstances. I don't think Frankl wrote primarily because he wanted to become your therapist. I think he wrote to inspire each individual to become so well read and diversely read on religion, ethics, and psychological theories that they become one of their own best therapists. And I thank him for his contributions to encourage each of us in that pursuit.I started this review by mentioning Frankl set out to take the best parts of the ideas he learned and observed, and he created his own psychological theories. And I finish this review by thanking an old friend, a woman who chose to fight me tooth and nail to encourage me to start to do the same."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a great book written by the worlds greatest psychiatrist since Sigmund Freud...

I can't begin to describe how great this book is! I had the unique chance of reading this book from a friend and it truly is a work of art in itself. Frankl's story of the horrors of the concentration camp is truly frightening, but out this experience that would give many a legitimate reason to give up, he finds the strength, courage and yes, compassion to go on. Why suffer through anything? Why stick with something when it seems almost hopeless? The true lesson of this book is : Through your suffering, you have the chance to touch the future. Frankl reminds us always that no matter what trials we suffer through, our ability to find a meaning in our suffering, to make sure that someone, somewhere learns from it and makes an impact in their life, is truly one of the greatest lessons of all. For such a small price I can't even fathome how useful this lesson is. Everyone who reads this book is a better person at the end. I am...for now I remember that no matter what I go through, I will touch a life, somewhere, somehow."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have an natural aversion to psychology books. I was recommended this book and when I first time I picked up I made it to the title page and lost interest after seeing the subtitle: an introduction to logotherapy. A while late the book was again recommended to me, this time by another person, and I became determined to read past the subtitle.Although this is &quot;An introduction to Logotherapy&quot; the implications of this book are much more profound then simply a psychology text-book or a do-it-yourself self-help book. This book does not play the part of creating a sugared life, denying that real struggles, real trials, and real pain do exist. But in acknowledging suffering, this book does not attach meaninglessness to life, which is so easy to do when a person does profoundly suffer. Instead Frankl asserts a beauty to life that is inclusive of both suffering and meaning.In one of the many beautiful passages in the book, Frankl states that, &quot;What is demanded of man is not, as some existential philosophers teach, to endure the meaninglessness of life; but rather to bear his incapacity to grasp its unconditional meaningfulness in rational terms.&quot;This book manages to transcend psychology and the usual &quot;self-help&quot; books to express in sincere and honest terms that life is worth living.

A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"A short read, recommended for everyone to read.A concentration camp survivor's tale. Frankl is a psychologist when he's imprisoned and writes the book from the perspective of a scientist. He details the impact of torture on a prisoner's mind: his as well as his comrades. While the book does not avoid the grim reality and fate of Hitler's victims, its strength rides on the tail of its psychological insights and conclusions. Frankl surmises that one's life has meaning, whether one is experiencing happiness or suffering. Most would agree that many people don't have the inner strength or spiritual maturity to grow through such atrocity, let alone survive it.That's why a book like Frankl's is so life affirming, that there were people, in the midst of unthinkable suffering, could still offer their meager chunk of bread to another in need. In this day and age, it's wonderful to see that the human race can rise to such heights while, at the same time, sinking to such depths. There is hope, after all."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Just finished reading Viktor E. Frankl's book Man's Search for Meaning. Along with over 12 million other readers I have found it a classic book and is a sobering look at life from an altogether profoundly realistic perspective. I have to say this was a long overdue book for me to read and it has left a profound effect on my view on life, my life and those of my fellow human beings."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is an astonishing book that I strongly recommend. Victor Frankl was a Jewish Austrian Psychiatrist imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps including Auschwitz during the Second World War.The book begins with the remarkable biographical story of life in the concentration camp in conditions that are scarcely imaginable and where the prospects for survival were bleak. The second half of the book takes these experiences and their understanding as the basis for development of what Frankl called Logotherapy. At its heart is a belief that striving to find a meaning to ones life is the primary motivational force within people. This may be contrasted with striving for pleasure, or striving for power which are respectively at the heart of Freudian and Adlerian psychology.The description of life in the concentration camp is chilling in what it describes but this appears multiplied by the manner of the description. The narrative is largely free of gruesome details and uses simple matter of fact language to convey and amplify the all enveloping abject awfulness of the situation faced by those imprisoned. They are described as having been transported into an incredible and inexplicable world where every normality is replaced by ever present abnormality. Yet in this utterly abnormal world we see there is space for the acts of saints as well as demons.It is a book which provides insights into the nature of life and meaning and thus should be read by all. If its relevance to those involved in change needs to be stated, for me it is captured in clear imagery that life in the concentration camp which removed so much from the inmates, was denied removing one crucial thing, described thus:-\\"In the concentration camp every circumstances conspires to make the prisoner lose his hold. All the familiar goals in life are snatched away. What alone remains is \\"the last of human freedoms\\" - the ability to choose one's attitude in a given set of circumstances\\".It is this choosing of attitude that sits at the heart of the inmate's ability to survive, for those that did survive are characterised by having a clear vision, a clear imperative that they must survive for they have work yet to be done.When so much effort directed at change focuses on what to do and how, Frankl powerfully quotes the words of Nietzsche\`He who has a why to live, can bear with almost any how'.I highly recommend this book as one that will change your perspective on what people and organisations can achieve and the incredible importance of establishing meaning; of answering the question \`why?'"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The first part of the book is the story of the author's life as a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp. The best words I can come up with to describe his story are \\"incredibly inspiring\\". It's amazing to me to read the authors application of a nearly unbiased scientific psychoanalysis of his fellow prisons, and sometimes the guards. That does not mean that this is a boring scientific read. It a gripping human drama.The second part of the book is a brief description of school of psychology that the author initially drafted before the war and refined in the cruel crucible of his imprisonment. This presentation can be a bit dry and technical but is worth the effort to study. Reading this, I felt as though a Jewish prisoner in Nazi Germany came to discover Buddhism through the transformation of his suffering - in his own words - \\"In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering the moment it finds meaning...\\". I also find it in the Zen-like observation - \\"Don't aim at success - the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it.\\"I leave this review with what seems to be the authors favorite quote: \\"He who has a Why can bear almost any How.\\" -- Nietzsche"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I had mixed reactions to this book that I've been meaning to read for years. If I understand the therapy correctly, Frankly advocates for the importance of meaning in each individual's life and that most pyschological illness comes from a lack of meaning (or meaningful meaning). Logotherapy, Frankl's approach and known as the third Vienna school of Psychotherapy--after Freud and Adler) focuses on approaching meaning in the client's life. One of the main ways meaning is expressed is through our suffering. Suffering, from Frankl's perspective is a \\"good\\" thing, or, at the least, necessary. I do kind of agree with this, not that it provides \\"meaning\\" necessarily, but that life is not really lived without some suffering (which seems counter to the Buddhist stuff, which I kind of agree with too--I guess they can be combined with the idea of acceptance of suffering . . .).The first part of the book is focused on Frankl's horrific experiences in the concentration camps and how those that survived did so by accepting their suffering and seeing how the suffering itself provided their existence with meaning (this part of the book is not really convincing to me. I see how Frankl has interpreted the world this way, but I don't see that this is a universal theory). The second half is somewhat more interesting, exploring what it does mean for people to suffer. One therapeutic approach is facing that which you fear which is a fairly common approach to fears."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The book is one of the most important and significant works of the past millennium. The book is a story of Victor Franklin survival in the concentration camps and the lessons he picked up during his stay. There are two parts to the book, part 1 consists of his experiences, part 2 consists of his description of Logotherapy which he strongly advocated as a cure for many of the mental issues which people suffer from. The book presses the notion that a surge in various mental illness is due to the lack of any objective for our survival. We live empty lives, which are primarily in materialistic pursuits. The author cites Friedrich Nietzsche, \\"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how\\", to promote the idea. While all of this may sound very superficial, philosophical, in all honesty, if you really have a mission to live for, and it matters a lot to you, the question of existence rarely arises. We make our mission as the meaning. This was in a way the tactics, Dr.Franklin used for survival in the camps. He made his mission helping the other patients, spreading the lessons he had learnt and so on. He was very strongly driven by his objectives, and its no surprise that he survived the camps and went on to live till 1997.I must confess, I enjoyed the first part of the book more than the second part, as it was primarily based on his experiences and observations. The 2nd part is a little tricky to follow if you are reading the book as a reader. You many find it more intuitive if you are professional trained for mental health and counseling.Nevertheless, if you want to read a book which tries to give you correct hints at the path you should be taking in life, this is the perfect book. Its tries to offer a meaningful objective to your life, without pushing you towards any religion/faith."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"To detach yourself from such extreme adversities, misery and death all around you, a seemingly hopeless future (actually, death) and to attempt to use that as a research environment to further understand human psychology - that is a contribution of monumental proportions.

It's a short book; definitely go for it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"After describing his concentration camp experiences in the first half of the book, Frankl argues that one of man's greatest needs is for purpose and meaning. This purpose is not and cannot be the same for everyone. For some, it is a cause; for others, the meaning is experiencing something or someone (e.g. the love of a person); for others, just accepting suffering with dignity. Frankl suggests that in the absence of such meaning. people lose their will to live in bad times, and engage in self-destructive behavior out of boredom during prosperous times.Frankl uses his concentration camp life as an example. While others lost their will to live, Frankl apparently did not. Why? Partially because of his desire to complete unfinished work, partially because of his love for his wife. (None of which guaranteed that he did live of course; he is quite eager to emphasize that even with all the will to live in the world, the odds were not on his side.)Frankl emphasizes that there is no abstract meaning of life generally (at least none that he knows of); rather, each person's life has a different meaning, and perhaps a different meaning at different times."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This was an awesome book!

Frankl splits the book into two separate parts; beginning with his firsthand stories of the Holocaust and his imprisonments in Auschwitz and other concentration camps. He then talks about his many struggles that he endured along the way with inside himself and with others. Within this section he really focuses on how all of the people, including himself, react to what is going on around them within the camps. He writes about the psychological effects of everything that is going on. Whether it be never really knowing if your loved ones are alive, how long you will be able to survive or how long you will be imprisoned. The main question that Frankl raised in the first section was whether or not life was still worth living and how you could still find a meaning in life.The second part of the book which is split into two sections; one called \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\" and the other \\"The Case for Tragic Optimism\\" really answered the question from the first section. It talked about his own feelings of how to conduct therapy. This therapy being logotherapy, which states that man is driven by his own search for meaning and purpose. Frankl used this Logotherapy to help other prisoners and even himself. He talked to people and helped them to realize what their purpose was and how to change their outlook on life.This book is probably one of the most influential stories that I have ever read. I believe that this book is so powerful because for once you, in a way, get to see firsthand of what went on in concentration camps. The way Frankl writes of his experiences almost makes it seem like you are there witnessing it yourself. This book is very powerful and teaches a lot about life and makes you realize what your real meaning in life is. This book is very interesting and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Most books written about the Holocaust are factual books that give us insight on the concentration camps. Viktor E. Frankl gives us an autobiographical account of his personal experiences in Auschwitz and other concentration camps. This book is very powerful in a sense that it is ones own personal thoughts and feelings. He goes into great detail on the hardships and struggles the prisioners had to face in this period of their life. They constantly dealt with the stuggle of whether or not they would one day be free again. Dr. Frankl spent much time trying to figure out the meaning of life and his reason for living. He believed that this is what got him through those 5 years of his life. He also helped other people with their struggles to keep on living. He thought that when the prisoners lost the will to go on that they had stopped searching for the meaning of their life. Through his experience in the concentration camps, he developed a form of psychotherapy called Logotherapy. Logotherapy focuses more on the meaning of life and the future. He believes that man's desire in life is to find a meaning and purpose to life.In the second half of Dr. Frankl's book, Logotherapy in a Nutshell, he expands on the meaning of life and how it is not general but different for every individual. This means that our meaning of life can change at any minute. In this part of the book, he argues that man must search for meaning and not just be given an answer to the question, \\"What is the meaning or purpose of my life\\"? He also gives instances where people have come to him about problems in their lives and how they find meaning in their life.Personally, I enjoyed this book because it seemed so real. It is easy to follow and it truely makes you think about the hardships people went through during the Holocaust. Dr. Frankl uses Logotherapy to help people find meaning in their lives. As you read this book it really makes you stop and think about the meaning and purpose of your life. Viktor E. Frankl used a quote that is very powerful, \\"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how\\". This goes to show that where there is a will, they is a way and therefore we should never give up hope! This is a very inspirational book and I highly recommend reading it!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Everyone goes through obstacles in their life. Whether they are good or bad, it is how we individually deal with them that makes us who we are and what we will become. Not everyone in their lifetime is able to realize what their meaning in life is, but with Viktor Frankl's approach to psychotherapy known as logotherapy, maybe we all can.\\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" by Viktor E. Frankl is an inspiring and breathtaking book definitely worth reading. In this book, he explains about his experience in concentration camps which led to his discovery of logotherapy. Frankl talks about Auschwitz, along with many other camps where he overcame many hardships. He had to learn what a human being does when he suddenly has nothing to lose. Frankl talks about different situations he experienced, where he explains through his logotherapy how someone should get through such situations and how himself or others dealt with it. This book not only talks about his experiences in concentration camps but goes into great detail about his logotherapy approach and how it is used. He talks about some of his patients experiences and how he worked with them to help change the way they may have been thinking and gave them a better understanding and meaning to what they were feeling.Throughout his hard times, Viktor tried to stay strong, not only using his logotherapy for himself but also as a supprot system for others in the concentration camps. He talked of taking one day at a time, hour by hour, minute by minute as if forgetting about the future and living in the present as best as you could. He found himself at times day dreaming about where he used to live, his family, freinds, and food. He also found himslef, as well as with many others humoring one other to take thier minds off the dreadful weather or the hard work they had to endure.After reading this book I was fascinated with how someone could take such a horrible experience from their life like living in a concentration camp and turn it into something good and meaningful in their life. It amazed me how he was able to use his logotherapy to help forget and reassure himself everyday he was there. Its hard to imagine what that would be like, but remarkable how he got through it.Dr. Frankl clearly explained his views in such a meaningful way throughout the entire book. I think that this book was extremely well-written and very easy to understand. I feel that everyone should read this book in order to get a better understanding of why we need meaning in our lives. This book was very interesting to me and made me realize how important it is to have meaning in my life. I feel we all need to realize what our meaning in life is, it will not only help us get through each day but defines why we are here in the first place. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The book \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" by Viktor E. Frankl is a very captivating and inspiring book. In this book, Dr. Frankl shares his experiences of the holocaust through the eyes of a prisoner in Jewish concentration camps. This is unique, because most books written about the Holocaust are based on facts and events rather than personal experience. I believe this is what makes this book more captivating, because you can relate and empathize with Dr. Frankl. The book begins with personal accounts of his 5 years in Auschwitz and other Jewish concentration camps. In this portion of the book, Dr. Frankl talks a lot about his struggle during those years to find reasons to live. He discusses that none of those men ever knew if they would ever make it out alive. During these trying times, he thought a great deal about what was important in his life, and he allowed us to experience what he went through during those years. This posed one main question: How can one begin their life again after such a tragic and horrifying experience?The answer to this question is what Dr. Frankl tried to argue throughout the book. He believed that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose. The second half of his book consisted of two parts: \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\" and \\"The Case for Tragic Optimism\\". These parts explain that through his awful experiences throughout the Holocaust, he found that his solution to fighting tragedy is the will to find meaning, and through this he created logotherapy, in order to help other people find meaning in their life. He also explains how to conduct logtherapy, and tells us that a man is driven by his search for a meaning in life, which is much different than Freud's outlook on life.I believe Dr. Frankl's argument is very good and convincing. I think logotherapy and man's search for meaning and purpose in life are very fair, complete, and logical points. Dr. Frankl told his story about his experiences during the Holocaust, and based on his experiences he explained his argument that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose. His explanation makes perfect sense. We face tragedy, obstacles, and struggles in all our lives, but in order to survive and be happy, we must find meaning and purpose. Dr. Frankl finds a very logical and realistic way to help people survive and prosper in life. This book is interesting, captivating, and inspiring, and it is worth taking the time to read. I'll leave you with a quote from the book that sums up Dr. Frankl's argument-\\"To live is to suffer, but to survive is to find meaning in the suffering.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"At times this book can be a little dry, but when you look at the book as a whole its a amazing book.The book in part one covers Frankl's experiences in a concentration camp. This part forms the base of the ideas of logothearpy. It's a great story and very interesting to see how person takes to such a horrible event.Second part of the book is on his theory of logothearpy. Very interesting idealogy. Covers some cases in it. The basic idea being that each person creates his own reality and meaning, whatever meaning a person finds in his/her life is the right one.third part is a update taken from a lecture he gave.

I bought it when I was trying to support a friend who was enduring one of life's random tragedies. I do not believe in a god who never sends us more than we can bear. In fact, I don't believe God sends us good or ill events, and Frankl's work supports my view. What he does show is that under the most heinous of circumstances, humans have the ability to make moral choices, and that is powerful information.Frankl-- who survived when his pregnant wife, parents and other relatives did not-- went on to show that not all prisoners were moral and all guards immoral. Within extremely narrow parameters, both had the freedom to embrace life and to aid others. He was also insightful about what signaled impending death. I guess I should not be surprised that after the war, Frankl opposed the theory of collective guilt; he was loathe to condemn whole societies, which is what makes him out of step with many Holocaust scholars and (in my reading) with other prominent moral teachers of his era.The last part of the book sets out his theories of logotherapy in which he held that the purpose of psychotherapy is to help patients make meaning of their lives rather than find happiness or resolve various complexes. It's interesting that logotherapy is almost unknown today, although some of his ideas seem to bubble up in existential therapies. As it turns out, Man's Search is condensed from longer writings he produced after liberation. The book in English is so lucid that I forgot that he lived all this experience \\"in German.\\" Unlike many psychological writings, this one does not suffer from the restriction of categories that don't quite translate.

He spent the next three years being moved around four concentration camps. During that time he studied himself and his fellow prisoners, looking at the factors that helped people survive such brutal conditions. He was already advocating a practice of logotherapy; people need to feel a purpose to their lives in order to overcome grief, guilt, and death. Through this lens he writes about his imprisonment and the importance of finding meaning to get through the experience.Frankl asserts that people can find meaning in three places; through some great work or achievement, in the love they hold for another person, and through suffering for a purpose. The first half of his book narrates his experiences in the concentration camps, while the second half details his his work and advocation of logotherapy as a &#34;humanized psychotherapy.&#34; I found both parts of the book to be intriguing."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"An amazing account of human strengths and weaknesses.

In fact, it was first published in 1946 as \\"A Psychologist Experiences the Concentration Camp\\", a much more descriptive title. While it may seem Frank's manifesto was born of his imprisonment during middle age, by his late teens he had already begun formulating a thesis that the quest for meaning is the key to mental health. Ironically, his horrific experience in the camps offered him the opportunity to test his hypothesis.The book was disappointing in its presentation. The text was relatively short at 165 pages, but it was not an easy read. The first part, which focused on Frankl's experience in concentration camps, was approximately 100 pages with no chapters or headers or organization in the narrative itself. The second part was Frankl's introduction to his \\"logotherapy\\" derivative of psychotherapy, and it is very academic in nature. A postscript and afterward follow. There was some notable redundancy throughout, and one might imagine the four sections were pulled from four separate sources.But the unique observations expressed here belie the presentation. In a sad, evil place where \\"reality dimmed and all efforts and emotions were centered on one task: preserving one's own life\\" and the best inhabitants could hope for was \\"negative happiness-freedom from suffering\\", Frankl models the behavior of himself, his peers, and his captors.Amid the pain, squalor, and certainty of death (Frankl stated his chances of survival at 1 in 28) in the prisons, Frankl adopted and articulated a stoic pride and respect for his predicament. For \\"without suffering and death, human life cannot be complete\\". He states that man must come to understand that \\"no one can relieve him of suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way he bears his burden\\". He wrote \\"Suffering became a task on which we did not want to turn our backs. We realized its hidden opportunities for achievement\\". For \\"everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms-to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way\\".For Frankl and his companions in the throes of despair, the search for the meaning of life became singular. Frankl's answer, poignant if not hopeful: \\"We needed to stop asking ourselves the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life - daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and right conduct\\".Happiness cannot be achieved, it can only ensue. \\"One must have a reason to \`be happy'\\", and then they can achieve optimism despite the \\"Tragic Triad\\" of suffering, guilt, and death. Frankl frequently refers to Nietzsche's philosophy of \\"He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How\\".In \\"Meaning\\", readers will find some unique aphorisms and behavioral theories validated by the most rigorous testing imaginable. \\"In the concentration camps...in this living laboratory and testing ground, we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behaved like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself; which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions\\"."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"how have i lived for 33 years without reading this book?the ideas are inspiring by their merit, and even more so in response to the indescribable horror of the holocaustand it's short, viktor frankl wrote it in just 9 days. you can read it in a few hours and start finding more meaning in your lifeone paragraph on page 108 summarizes frankl's overall approach very nicely ->\\"i doubt whether a doctor can answer [the meaning of life] question in general terms. for the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. what matters, therefore, is not the meaning of a person's life at a given moment. to put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: 'tell me, master, what is the best move in the world?' there simply is no such thing as the best or even a good move apart from a particular situation in a game and the particular personality of one's opponent. the same holds for human existence. one should not search for an abstract meaning of life. everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. thus, everyone's task is as unique as his specific opportunity to implement it.\\"if you are intrigued by the ideas in this paragraph, i highly recommend reading the book. frankl offers us compelling and concrete suggestions along with extraordinary examples of people creatively, lovingly and responsibly finding meaning in their \\"very real and concrete\\" lives"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is an very intense book about life and the human spirit.

He encourages his patients and readers to live a full life by looking to the future rather than reliving the past.Quotation: \\"Self-transcendence of human existence: Being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself - be it a meaning to fulfil or another human being to encounter.

In particular his perspective as a psychologist living through this time is extremely insightful. I have suggested this book to a few people now; a definite for those needing stories of resilience."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Dr. Frankl was already a psychiatrist at the time that he was a prisoner in Auschwitz, and some other camps, during WWII. It's the most interesting description of concentration life I've heard that I found bearable to listen to. He's very good at describing how being in a concentration camp affected the minds of the prisoners and also the guards and others who were in charge. The prisoners were all different psychologically. Some of them were destroyed mentally by the prison life. I common trait was becoming absorbed in the past to escape the unbearable present. Of course, I've seen this happen in everyday life with people who were not in concentration camps, which I think the main value of this book. His discription of psychology under these horrible conditions, one can recognize in the psychology of men one meets and knows in everyday life. He describes, too, how people acted when they were released, which was for many as difficult or even more so than adjusting to life in the camp. People often seemed indifferent to what the prisoner had just gone through, which affected different released prisoners in different ways. The strong men, like Dr. Frankl, used the concentration camp experience to grow spiritually and psychologically, but those kinds of men are few and far between.After the War, Dr. Frankl became a practicing psychiatrist, and developed something he calls logotherapy. It's based on his idea that he developed while in the camps that man is searching for meaning in life above everything else. The men who could find some meaning in their concentration camp experience survived the best.This book is especially wonderful if you are really interested in psychology and how people react under the most sever of circumstances, which, according to Dr. Frankil, is ever which way."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Just in case, if one wants to ascertain the level of endurance human beings possess, he needs to go no further than read through the experiences at concentration camps as recalled by a survivor - Viktor Frankl - in this book.And considering that a will to survive does not manifest only in situations where life is at stake, physically, but at various stages in life, where even smallest of problems can seem mammoth and wreck havoc in making life miserable at psychological level, the lessons contained in this book have vast practical applications, when it comes to understanding our survival instinct.The basic principle which differentiates a survivor from a loser is well highlighted by the following quote, which is often cited by the author in the book - 'The one who has a why to live can bear almost any how.'I would highly recommend this book and would suggest re-reading it a few times because it would better enable on to grasp and internalize the importance of the subject addressed in this book and appreciate the viewpoint of the author."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I first read this book in college many years ago as I was working on my degree in psychology. An excerpt from it is in John McCain's autobiographical book,Faith of My Fathers: A Family Memoir. I was glad to be reminded of this book which I had not read in years. I found my old copy on the shelf but I am also glad to learn it is still available.The comparison between Frankl and McCain as prisoners is striking. Both of them emphasize the basic human need for meaning and purpose. Both share incredible horrors of prison camp as well as the human ability to look beyond present circumstances, to keep the horrid memories from continuing as sources of torture years after the actual experiences.We can apply this ability to many of the unfortunate experiences in our lives. It is not only an attitude of forgive and forget, it is the need to keep the horrors or smaller angers from continuing to torment us.It is more than a little frightening that there are people who deny that the Holocaust even happened.

I enjoyed this book very much and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is an excellent book and everyone should read and then read it again, as it will change your life.However, when I ordered two copies recently, one was for myself and the other as a gift, I was very surprised and disappointed to see that the front cover had been bent back during the packing process on one of the two copies. Naturally I gave the perfect copy as the gift, and kept the damaged front cover copy for myself. I was really surprised, as normally everything that comes from Amazon is very well-packed and protected.Nevertheless, I have just ordered quite a few more copies to give as gifts, as did my friend who was received the book from me, and so I am hopeful that better care will be given this time. Happy Holidays to everyone!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The first section of this book (which makes up over half of the text) consist of Victor Frankl's account of his experiences in the concentration camp. This section seems unique among the Holocaust accounts that I've seen and read because Dr. Frankl approaches the topic from a psychological perspective. He discusses the ways in which the different prisoners react to their (note: men and women were seperated at the camps, so Frankl is mainly disscussing his experiences with the men in Auschwitz) imprissonment. He writes about the psychological effects of being completely dehumanized; of losing even your name, and becoming simply a number. Also he disscusses the effects of not being able to contact loved ones, or even know is they are still living. Another issue that Dr. Frankl talks about in this book is the idea that none of the prisoners of the concentration camp had an idea as to when there imprissonment would end (if ever). Thus, they were faced with the thought of living the rest of their lives as workers at the camps. Dr. Frankl discusses how people can find meaning to life in these conditions. He also describes how finding meaning in life, or a reason to live, was extraordinarilly important to surviving the camp.One of the most interesting, and disturbing, issues in the book was the idea of the Capo. These were were people put in charge of their fellow prisoners, in order to keep them in line. Dr. Frankl describes these people as, often, being more harsh than the actual guards. This seems to be a disturbing lesson in the abuse of power. This also goes along with Dr. Frankl's discussion of how the camps brought out the true personality of the people within it (after all the social trapping had been stripped away): The cretins, the saints, and all of those in between.The second half of the book is made up of two sections &quot;Logotherapy in a Nutshell,&quot; and &quot;The Case for Tragic Optimsism.&quot; These two sections basically describe Dr. Frankl's theory on as to how to conduct therapy (Logotherapy). The idea behind this therapy is that man is driven by his search for a meaning in life. This differs from the psychoanalysis perspective (driven, at this time, by the ideas of Sigmund Freud) in that the psychoanalytic school believed that humans were driven by their unconscious desires. For Frankl, the need for meaning seems to outway the unconscious. In fact, he goes into detail about the negative effects that the abscence of meaning, or what he calls the &quot;existential Vacuum,&quot; has on people. To illustrate many ideas, he often uses his experiences in the concentration camps, as well as various cases for treatment (which help to solidify his view of life, and therapy).I would recomend this book to almost anybody. I feel that it's interesting, and worthwhile. I would especially recomend this to people interested in psychology, as well as those who wish to learn something about the experiences within the concentration camps."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Dr. Frankl's logotherapy is straightforward and easy to understand. It is also a useful antidote to the rather frightening drift in psychology during the past two decades toward strict biological determinism.This particular work is one I keep at hand and re-read on a regular basis. I read it for the first time a few months after I started medical treatment and therapy for life-long depression. I get more from it each time I go back to it.Logotherapy manages an incredible balance. It does not put man himself at the center of the universe, thus avoiding the kind of narcissistic self-reflection common to much of the therapeutic literature today. Yet, it does not sweep man aside as irrelevant. Instead, Frankl argues that we have an incredible power to shape our attitudes and responses to the challenges life presents us and that we inevitably grow thanks to these challenges.This is a quick read and could conceivably change your life. Man is more than the sum of his biology and his environment. We inevitably choose to be who we are. Frankl's argument is that, if we choose wisely, we can triumph even in tragedy. It's a truth many of us have lost sight of in our cynicism."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl, who survived the concentration camps, writes that suffering is inevitable and that avoiding suffering is futile. Rather, one should be worthy of one's suffering and make meaning of it instead of surrendering to nihilism, bitterness and despair. He uses poetic, moving anecdotes from the concentration camps to illustrate those souls who find a deeper humanity from their suffering or who become animals relegated to nothing more than teeth-clenched self-preservation. Though not specifically religious, this masterpiece has a religious purpose--to help us find meaning. This book succeeds immeasurably.*** Why no voting buttons?

I was finding it hard to find something to hold on to after getting the news. This book has helped put the cancer in perspective and is giving me the courage and encouragement to keep on living...no matter what. And if I die, then there has to be meaning in my life before then. I am now beginning to understand that I should not ask what can I get out of life, but what does life expect from me.This is a WONDERFUL and INSPIRATIONAL book that I recommend for anyone suffering from any tragic cirucmstance...cancer, death in the family, divorce, etc. All of the phsychiatric nonsense might help (I doubt it), but this book will get you on the right road."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Several years ago a friend had an operation for a cancerous growth behind his eye yet today is well and tells of the importance of the right mental attitude when facing adversity. Another friend faces a similar experience but appears to be in the process of succumbing in ignorance of the importance of mental attitude. Seeking guidance as to what I might do to help, I turned to this book.After recounting the horrors of everyday life in a work camp - the initial selection process in which 90% were sent to the gas chambers while 10% were kept to extract the last ounce of work as slaves for construction firms; the Capos selected from the most brutal who had lost all scruples in order to save their life; how everything was subservient to keeping oneself and one's closest friends alive - Viktor Frankl tells of the psychological problems they met.The most important seems to be the hope of release as shown by the very high death rate in his camp in the week between Christmas 1944 and new year 1945 which had no explanation in food, treatment, weather, disease or working conditions; it was that the majority had lived in the nave hope that they would be home again by Christmas. In the absence of encouraging news, the prisoners lost courage; disappointment overcame them and their powers of resistance dropped. Frankl noticed that it was the men who comforted others, who gave away their last piece of bread who survived longest and who offered proof that everything can be taken but one thing - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.In the camp every decision determined whether or not you would submit to loss of inner freedom. The sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not of camp influences alone. It is this spiritual freedom which cannot be taken away which makes life meaningful and purposeful. Only those who allowed their inner hold on their moral and spiritual selves to subside eventually fell victim to the camp's degenerating influences. Most inmates believed that the real opportunities of life had passed. In reality, however, one could make a victory of those experiences, turning them into an inner triumph.Frankl saw himself giving a lecture on the psychology of the concentration camp, living Spinoza's observation that \\"Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.\\" Armed with the insight that any attempt to restore man's inner strength had first to succeed in showing him some future goal he tried to help would-be suicides to realize that life was still expecting something from them - a loving son awaiting his return, an unfinished work to complete. When the impossibility of replacing you is realized it is impossible to throw your life away. When you know the why of your existence you will be able to bear almost any how.Frankl had to learn and then teach that it really did not matter what we expect from life but rather what life expects from us. The answer lies in right action and in right conduct; life ultimately means taking responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill tasks that it constantly sets for each individual. These tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differ from man to man and from moment to moment, making it impossible to define in general terms or in sweeping statements. No man and no destiny can be compared to any other man or destiny. It may require a man to shape his own fate, contemplate or accept his fate. There is only one right answer to the situation at hand.When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his single, unique task. His unique opportunity lies in the way he bears his burden. Once the meaning of suffering has been revealed, suffering has hidden opportunities for achievement. When he had the opportunity to address a group of prisoners his purpose was to help each man to find a full meaning to their life in that practically hopeless situation by pointing out the joys each had experienced in the past and that no one had suffered irreplaceable losses. Whoever was still alive had reason for hope; health, family, happiness, professional abilities, fortune, position in society, could all be restored. Life never ceases to have meaning and this infinite meaning includes suffering and dying, privation and death. God or someone alive or dead would hope to find them suffering proudly.After the war, Frankl introduced Logotherapy, which focuses on the meanings of life to be fulfilled by the patient in the future. The patient is confronted with the meaning of his life. The meaning of human existence as well as man's search for such a meaning is unique and specific and can be fulfilled by him alone. He is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values. The more that you forget yourself by giving to a cause or serving in love, the more you actualize yourself. We can discover meaning in three ways - creating a work or doing a deed; by experiencing something or encountering someone; and by the attitude we take to unavoidable suffering.When we are no longer able to change a situation such as inoperable cancer we have to change our attitude. He asks his patients to project themselves forward to their deathbed and look back on the meaningful things in their lives. Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be; he has control over what he will become in the next moment.This book has certainly provided much food for thought!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"&quot;Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done, and of love loved but of sufferings bravely suffered.&quot; (p. 123)My connection to Viktor Frankl dates back to a Hannukah party in which I found myself conversing with a baker who used to deliver his bread. It took me a few more years to discover this absolute gem of a book, itself both bread for the soul and leaven for the mind.The first half of this book consists of Frankl's reflection on his time in a Nazi concentration camp. &quot;An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior,&quot; (p. 18) he notices, &quot;Yet it is possible to practice the art of living even in a concentration camp, although suffering is omnipresent.&quot; (p. 43) Distilling the essence of his experience at the hands of the Nazis and the resilience of his soul, he states, &quot;If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering.&quot; (p. 67) Finally, he notes that &quot;Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms--to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.&quot; (p. 65)He segues into the second part of the book, a description of &quot;logotherapy,&quot; based on the challenge learned behind barbed wire, downwind from the ovens &quot;Whenever there was an opportunity for it, one had to give them a why--an aim--for their lives, in order to strengthen them to bear the terrible _how_ of their existence.&quot; (p. 76)Frankl states that &quot;Man's search for meaning is a primary force in his life and not a 'secondary rationalization' of instinctual drives.&quot; (p. 99) He finds this meaning specific &amp; unique to each individual. Logotherapy focuses on the future, the assignments and meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in _his_ future, breaking up the self-centeredness of the neurotic instead of fostering and reinforcing it.He believes that &quot;the meaning of our existence is not invented by ourselves, but rather detected,&quot; (p. 101) that &quot;_logos_, or 'meaning', is not only an emerging from existence itself but rather something confronting existence.&quot; (p. 100) This _logos_ frustrates by not being available to finite minds, but nevertheless continues to confront man. In wrestling with this confrontation, each individual enacts their &quot;will to meaning,&quot; defining a &quot;meaning of life [that] differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment.&quot; (p. 110) Logotherapy sees responsibility as the very essence of human existence: &quot;each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by _answering_ _for_ his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.&quot; (p. 111) Thus, the &quot;categorical imperative&quot; of logotherapy is &quot;Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!&quot; (p. 111)Beyond the philosophy of logotherapy, Frankl discusses technique briefly, addressing anticipatory anxiety, &quot;it characteristic of this fear that it produces precisely that of which the patient is afraid.&quot; (p. 123) The mechanism for this is &quot;hyper-intention,&quot; which, by focusing on the problem, magnifies the problem. He confronts this with &quot;paradoxical intention,&quot; suggesting that the insomniac try to stay awake and that the phobic patient &quot;intend, if only for a moment, precisely that which he fears.&quot; (p. 125)He concludes the book with &quot;Our generation is realistic for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who has invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who has entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.&quot; (p. 136)I find this short book incredibly full of life and meaning; it's one of the most powerful I've ever read. The act of creating a philosophy and psychology of life out of the horrors of Auschwitz confronts my own whinings about the discomforts I find in life. I find courage here, not just Dr. Frankl's courage, but an inspiration to my own courage, and a challenge to live more fully, to create more meaning, instead of simply accepting the meanings thrust upon me by TV sitcoms, billboards, and internet banality.The epitome of a five star book. Worthy of more if Amazon would allow it.(If you'd like to dialogue about this book, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link &amp; drop me an email. Thanks!)"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I originally bought this book knowing nothing about Frankl, his experiences, or psychological theories. I simply read the description and a few of the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Amazon and decided that it sounded interesting. What a life-changing book. Merely reading it at any given time has a marked positive influence on my attitude towards life.What's most interesting about it, as Frankl says himself, is that what he's propounding are not abstract ideas developed by some academic at a university or in some research laboratory. He uses his direct experience in one of the most adverse circumstances possible--a Nazi concentration camp--to relate the ideas of logotherapy (his own school of psychotherapy) to the reader.In a nutshell, the three most important tenets of logotherapy are as follows: (1) Life has meaning under all circumstances--even the most miserable ones; (2) Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life; and (3) We have the freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stand we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering. These principles are put directly to the test, and Frankl demonstrates their validity in a way that no social scientist has conceived of (or been able to) ever before.From the afterword:\\"Frankl was once asked to express in one sentence the meaning of his own life. He wrote the response on paper and asked his students to guess what he had written. After some moments of quiet reflection, a student surprised Frankl by saying, 'The meaning of your life is to help others find the meaning of theirs.''That was it, exactly,' Frankl said. 'Those are the very words I had written.'\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is a true classic in that it speaks to every generation. Even though it was written in the immediate post-Holocaust period and was one of the first personal accounts of the Nazi death camps, Frankl's brief account has new meaning today. In today's world, many people are constantly pursuing pleasure in the form of wealth, success, or sexual fulfillment. Although there is nothing intrinsically wrong with these, Frankl's point is that life must have meaning. A person can inject meaning into even the most degraded life conditions by clinging to his values. But without meaning, life can drag on, seemingly without end. The \\"purpose-driven life\\" is the only life that leads to true fulfillment."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"There is something to be said of a person who can go through a horrific journey such as the atrocities of Auschwitz and recall it with such clarity in order to help others. I was completely emotionally overwhelmed by the first half of the book-which is a narrative of what he experienced and fascinated with the next half which is an explanation of logotherapy.This is not an overly long or hard book to read in spite of some of the subject matter. My version was a thin paperback that I finished in a few days. It took me longer to fully appreciate because I hung onto each page and felt a responsibility to make sure I understood his journey and how he came to his conclusions.I recommend this book for anyone."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"An American doctor once asked Viktor Frankl to explain the difference between conventional psychoanalysis and logotherapy. Before answering, Frankl asked the doctor for his definition of psychoanalysis. The man said, &quot;During psychoanalysis, the patient must lie down on a couch and tell you things which sometimes are very disagreeable to tell.&quot; Frankl immediately replied by saying: &quot;Now, in logotherapy the patient may remain sitting erect but he must hear things which sometimes are very disagreeable to hear.&quot; By this he meant that in logotherapy the patient is actually confronted with and reoriented toward the MEANING of his life. The role of the therapist, then, is to help the patient discover a purposefulness in his life. Frankl's theory is that man's search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a &quot;secondary rationalization&quot; of instinctual drives. Whereas Freudian psychoanalysis focuses on the &quot;will to pleasure&quot; and Adlerian psychology focuses on the &quot;will to power&quot; it can be said that Frankl's logotherapy focuses on the &quot;will to meaning.&quot; Does man give in to to conditions or stand up to them? According to Frankl, the strength of a person's sense of meaning, responsibility, and purpose is the greatest determining factor in how that question will be answered. He believed that &quot;man is ultimately self-determining&quot; and as such, &quot;does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.&quot;The first (and largest) section of this book is the searing autobiographical account of the author's experience as a longtime prisoner in a concentration camp. These camps claimed the lives of his father, mother, brother, and wife. Frankl's survival and the subsequent miracle of this book are a testimony to man's capacity to rise above his outward fate. As Gordon W. Allport states in the preface, &quot;A psychiatrist who personally has faced such extremity is a psychiatrist worth listening to.&quot;I agree, and highly reccommend this book. As the sub-title says, it is an &quot;introduction&quot; to logotherapy, and anyone who wants to go deeper into the principles and practical application of Frankl's existential psychiatry should go to his excellent &quot;The Doctor And The Soul&quot;.Frankl was fond of quoting Nietzsche's dictum...&quot;He who has a WHY to live can bear with almost any HOW.&quot;"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Good stuff. The first half of the book, which deals with his personal experience in the concentration camps, is extremely fascinating. The second half, which I'm not finished with yet, is also very valuable--it takes longer to read due to the complexity, but it's a very different approach to psychology than I've heard in the past. Basically it says (as far as I understand) \\"Who cares what your dad and mom did to you when you were young. You need to find out what is the meaning of your life. Until you do that, you won't be happy.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I'm surprised there aren't a lot more reviews on this book. It might just be the best book I've ever read (and it's really short and easy to read).Viktor Frankl is an amazing man- a psychiatrist who lived in the concentration camps during WWII, and not only made it through and came out alive, but went on to touch many people's lives.The first half of the book, Viktor takes you through his experiences as a prisoner of the concentration camps. It's a unique perspective because he's really getting into what happens mentally to the prisoners and guards. Why do some continue to have the will to live despite everything? Why do others give up and let themselves die? Why do some prisoners show incredible cruelness toward their fellow prisoners, while some of the guards show compassion and kindness? Everything seems to hint to the fact that we are not just a product of our experiences. Even in a concentration camp where it seems like every freedom is stripped of the prisoner, the prisoner is still free on some level to make choices about his own will to live and his own character. So what is it that causes different men in the same situation to make different choices?The second part of the book delves into the answers he came to for all of those questions, as Viktor explains his psychotherapy (or \\"logotherapy\\"). I'm not going to get into all of it now, because I'd rather just recommend you read it yourself. I am sure you will not be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl uses his hellish experience in the concentration camps of World War II to illustrate how one must be pushed to the limit of their being to find out what they are truly capable of. He turns one of the darkest episodes in the history of the world into a strangely uplifting experience for the reader. Through the objective look at the behavior of man suffering the negative sublime, he is able to guide an individual to find the meaning to their own lives. Logotherapy is a key point in this book. Explained thoroughly in the book, logotherapy can be applied to everyone. This book helped me to understand my life in a way which I had not thought about before. I would highly recommend Man's Search for Meaning to anyone, especially those feeling like they need some kind of purpose in their lives."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a beautiful, wonderful book about the salvation of man. A while ago I had done much research into the holocaust, and I find it very unfortunate I did not find this book then. Viktor Frankl was a man to whom life was beloved. He found meaning in his darkest hour, and lived to teach the world a great lesson. It is a novel about death and suffering, and those souls who decided to shine in a sea of darkness. It should be a mandatory read in our high schools, for all our youth, so that they may learn respect and be left amazed by a great man. A man by the name of Viktor Frankl."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I had the good fortune of knowing my great-grandfather, may he rest in peace, for the first ten years of my life. Being a Holocaust survivor, my great-grandfather always had a story or piece of wisdom to share with my family when we visited. He gave my father Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl as a gift and it remains one of my father's favorite books to this day. Although I was too young to read the book at the time, I know now that it rings truth in a new perspective on the Holocaust. My ancestors survived the horrors that the Nazis inflicted upon them, and they lived to tell me the tale. In an engaging and fascinating way, Frankl sheds some light as to how exactly people made it out of the concentration camps alive, with a will to live and with hope for the future.In the first part of the book, Frankl describes his personal experiences as a prisoner in the Nazi concentration camps. He traces the mental state of an average prisoner in the camps, beginning upon arrival, and through liberation. Frankl writes that after the initial shock of reaching the infamous camp, a prisoner would be overcome by a \\"delusion of reprieve\\", an irrational feeling of hope that his situation would somehow be changed for the better. However, after being separated from loved ones in the dreaded selections, and watching them walk towards the gas chambers to their deaths, the reality and horrification of it all dawned upon the prisoner. Frankl describes the next emotional stage as \\"relative apathy\\", which was a complete weakening of the prisoner's senses and feelings, leaving a body merely going through the motions of everyday camp routine rather than a person. According to Frankl, apathy was essential for the preservation of a prisoner's life, because it channeled every emotion he had towards the goal of making it through the day alive. The third and final stage that a prisoner experienced was the complete inability to grasp the meaning of freedom. Following this the prisoner would have to re-learn what emotions such as joy and pleasure meant. Throughout this development, there still remains the question: what were the thoughts that gave a prisoner the drive to live, completely necessary for the conservation of his life? Frankl provides answers to this question in the second section of the book.Throughout the book, Frankl often quotes Nietzsche: \\"He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.\\" In the second section, Frankl elaborates on how this phrase sums up, in a nutshell, the mentality with which he survived the war. Having a purpose in life, writes Frankl, is the key to withstanding almost any suffering. Frankl named his theory \\"logotherapy\\", since logos is Greek for meaning. A method employed in psychology, \\"logotherapy\\" causes a patient to pinpoint and become familiar with the meaning of his life, which according to Frankl is the patient's will to strive, succeed, and to live. Frankl goes on to suggest three ways in which one can strive for meaning. The first one, understandably, is to accomplish something. Additionally, meaning can be found by loving another. Finally, man can find meaning by suffering. When one is faced with suffering, and there is nothing he can do to change his predicament, the only remaining option is for him to change his perspective, to change the way in which he views the situation. An example that Frankl gives is of a story of a grieving widower who had lost his wife. The man came to Frankl to ask for advice. Frankl asked the man, \\"What would have happened...if you had died first and your wife would have had to survive without you?\\" Through this question, the suffering the man was enduring gained a new purpose, he was mourning, but his wife would not have to mourn him. This story illustrates the usage of \\"logotherapy\\", and how by using it, one can utilize his suffering and find meaning through it.The Holocaust and World War II is a time in world history that has been studied and pondered by many scholars. There are volumes upon volumes written about this dark time in history. Man's Search for Meaning is unique because Frankl focuses on the psychology of it all. He brings proofs to back up his claim that man's search for meaning is, in and of itself, a will to live. Through starvation, sickness, torture and brutality, surrounded by death and despair, man can endure it all, he can even gain something from it, so long as he has a reason to keep going. Each individual has a different source of meaning, yet no matter what the cause, the meaning alone is what gives that man the drive to wake up each morning and endure whatever life sends his way. Even when faced with death itself, man can survive if he has a reason to.This book was written specifically about the Holocaust and the concentration camps. Nonetheless, there is a life-changing lesson that one can learn from reading the book, no matter what his life circumstances may be. Life is full of challenges, but those challenges eventually cause a person to question who he is and what he stands for, thereby forcing him to determine the meaning in his life. No matter where a person comes from, and no matter where he is headed, he must have a purpose in his life in order to move forward, and to be able to look back at the end of his life and feel proud of all that he accomplished. In a brilliant and insightful way, Victor Frankl has ultimately handed his readers the key to success and happiness, and the answer to many questions; he has affirmed that above all, meaning is what makes life worth living."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In his Foreword to MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING, Rabbi Harold Kushner writes: \\"If a book has one passage, one idea with the power to change a personal life that alone justifies reading it.\\" I read this book in 1961, reread in 1991 and I have just finished reading it again to get a better understanding of it. At the age of 85, I am searching for the meaning for my actual survival of five Nazi camps. I bore witness how people were capable to brave the worst conceivable conditions. I do not recall many nihilists among us prisoners, predominantly pious Jews; our omnipresent suffering had meaning. For most of us, zest for life and trust in God didn't diminish. We were daydreamers of pleasant happenings in the past and wishful happenings in the future. Frankl believes that neither pleasure nor power, but the quest for meaning in life is essential. He quotes Nietzsche's maxim \\"He who has a WHY to live, can bear with almost any HOW.\\"I shared my life story, mainly my predicament during the Holocaust, with over 700 audiences. I deem it to be my mission; it gives a meaning to my suffering. While my story is primarily about suffering and losses, Victor Frankl's first part of the book is primarily about his strength and will to survive. I have often been asked:\\"What kept you going? Why did you strive to stay alive? How could you survive when so many others haven't?\\" I have no clear cut answer; it might have been a combination of factors and luck was perhaps one of them. I do know that despite the suffering I strove to survive. The desire and hope to be reunited with my family gave me the courage to suffer.Frankl, an accomplished psychiatrist before the war, seems to have psychiatric mediums. His therapeutic doctrine known as logotherapy (Logo\\" from the Greek denotes, \\"meaning,\\" and therapy is helping people with their neuroses) implies that it is imperative to find meaning for life. He believed that people cannot avoid suffering but they can choose how to cope with it and to find meaning in it. Hope should never be given up; Frankl quotes Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898) \\"Life is like being at the dentist. You always think that the worst is still to come, and yet it is over already.\\" Frankl survived Auschwitz, and three other concentration camps; this was a miracle and a blessing to us. In this book written six months after liberation Frankl writes: \\"The condemned man, immediately before his execution, gets the illusion that he might be reprieved at the very last minute. We, too, clung to shred of hope (p.10).\\"During the Holocaust, I had been subjected to unimaginable acts of extreme wickedness, as reflected in my autobiography From a Name to A Number. I thought that I have seen it all, apparently not. Frankl's book brings to light horrific situations that I have not heard of or read about. His story contributes to the grand, but incomplete, mosaic of Holocaust history. There are still stories to be told, to be written. Once we Holocaust survivors are no longer among the living, our stories, the importance of their intrinsic lessons, should be read and reread. Man's Search for Meaning is a contribution of monumental proportions to the Holocaust legacy. I am grateful to Frankl for enlightening me and others, who have read the 12 million copies, in twenty-four languages, of this book.Frankl had an option, in 1942, to emigrate to the U.S. and thus save his and his wife's life. He had chosen to let his visa lapse, because he didn't want to leave his aging parents in Austria. Consequently, his parents and his wife perished in the Holocaust while incarcerated Viktor Frankl suffered. He found meaning in his suffering. Abiding by the fifth Commandment Honor your Father and Mother was meaningful to Frankl. It is indicative how Frankl's character and compassionate soul enveloped his philosophy."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning, FranklAn engaging story from the first page, in which Frankl interweaves psychological implications with personal experience. It is a book that is filled with wisdom and an irreplaceable perspective, namely that of one who has been through hell and lived to tell the tale. Several thoughts jumped out at me as I read.First, on p. 19 Frankl reveals an unsettling, yet profound, truth regarding the survivors and more importantly, those who did not survive. \\"On the average, only those prisoners could keep alive who, after years of trekking from camp to camp, had lost all scruples in their fight for existence; they were prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise, even brutal force, theft, and betrayal of their friends, in order to save themselves. We who have come back, by the aid of many lucky chances or miracles - whatever one may choose to call them - we know: the best of us did not return.\\"What a sobering thought! What a world that must have been, where humans were reduced to the very basest of existence. Frankl later raises the question of whether or not we have any choice of how we will respond in our circumstances. Are we simply a product of our circumstances, and any human would respond in the same, or similar, fashion? Or do we have freedom of choice in facing our circumstances, no matter what they are? Frankl answers that yes, we do have a choice.The second part is an introduction to logotherapy. He describes the technique of logotherapy as a meaning-based and future-oriented system. He wants people to find meaning in their situation, especially as it relates to the living of their life with their desired future in mind. He rejects the notion that our past controls us, and wishes people to realize their own responsibiltiy to make choices and to determine their own future.The final section of the book is an essay that Frankl wrote called \\"The Case for a Tragic Optimism. This short essay is rife with pearls of wisdom.First, Frankl begins with what he calls the 'tragic triad' - those aspects of human existence that can be circumscribed by pain, guilt, or death.Second, he does give a three-fold answer to the question of what gives life meaning. These are: 1 - Creating a work or doing a deed; 2 - experiencing something or encountering someone; and 3 - Turning a tragedy into a triumph, ie: finding meaning in suffering.Frankl ends with a discussion on not just the meaning in every life no matter what the circumstances, but also the value of every life no matter what the circumstances. He contrasts our society's focus on youth and usefulness with a focus on the elderly and their dignity. Youth have possibilities, the elderly have a store of actualities. I love the way Frankl describes our past as a repository, or storehouse, of all that we have done and experienced. Rather than saying the past is irretrievably lost, he looks at the past as being irrevocably stored and treasured. This is an interesting way to look at life, and puts a new perspective on our past. Rather than try to bury it, or to relive it, we need to recognize that it is safely lived and is to be treasured and learned from.Overall, this book is one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read. I am fascinated by the concepts of logotherapy, and am challenged to think in terms of my own future and what I hope for, as well as to see the meaning in my past and present as well. Additionally, I believe this perspective will help me as I counsel others. While Frankl does not touch much on faith and theology, this book definitely does impact the way I look at human nature, at suffering, and at what it means to live a life that has meaning."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Man can endure any how as long as he has a why ...\\" To me, this is the essential take-away of this clear, moving essay by concentration camp survivor Viktor Frankl.

Even if you don't like it, I promise you'll never forget it. I'll admit that I've only read the first half of the book, dealing with Frankl's experiences in the Nazi concentration camps, but the book still changed the way I think about life's challenges.Essentially, Frankl tells readers that depite their physical situation, they still have the power to control their minds and emotions. So basically, even when Nazis are kicking you in the head, you can choose to be happy. It sounds crazy, but Frankl is living proof that man can triumph over misery if he simply chooses to do so. Although I'm not a stranger to the historical accounts of the Holocaust (did I spell that right?), this book really opened my eyes as to what it was really like. After reading about Frankl's experiences, suddenly your own problems won't seem half as bad. This is one of those books that should be required reading for the entire human race. Just the first half of the book hammers the point home really well. If you want to explore the theoretical and psychoanalytical aspects of Frankl's beliefs, then read the second half too. But the first half is what will change you the most. There's powerful stuff here. Use it wisely."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Are human beings solely the product of conditional and environmental factors - biological, psychological and sociological - a predetermined being in every respect? Conversely, does the human being ultimately have freedom of choice? Can she/he, then, transcend these so-called deterministic factors, choose how to respond to the world and live with imposed suffering? In the end, is it conceivably possible to find \\"meaning\\" in our suffering?In this book, Dr. Frankl addresses these important questions, illustrating his terrible experiences as an inmate of the Nazi concentration camps, leading to his discovery of \\"Logotherapy\\" - a revolutionary approach to psychotherapy, that places emphasis on the human being's \\"will-to-meaning\\".The unmentionable atrocities in the Nazi concentration camps of WWII have been well documented. However, Dr. Frankl does not focus on the atrocities themselves, but the numerous ways his fellow inmates \\"responded\\" to the suffering inflicted upon them by their captors. Frankl emphasises that the prisoners of these camps must not be viewed as mere expressions of certain physical and sociological conditions, he writes,\\"Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influence alone. Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him - mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp.\\" (P.87)The inmates' survival and sanity depended upon a fundamental inner decision, a choice, in terms of how they responded, mentally and spiritually, to these indignities. From Frankl's observations of his fellow prisoners and his own experiences, brought him to conclude, that,\\"We have stated that that which was, ultimately responsible for the state of the prisoner's inner self was not so much the enumerated psychophysical causes as it was the result of a free decision.\\" (P.90)Those individuals who discovered meaning in their suffering and a faith in the future, maintained an attitude of survival, and had a better chance at staying alive.\\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is a powerful text, which explores issues of profound significance, with clarity and humaneness. This is also a highly credible book, because it is written by a man who experienced first hand man's inhumanity to man, and from these unspeakable indignities, discovered a psychology of hope, which can be applied across the entire spectrum of the human condition."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is a must read for anyone interested in self-improvement, anyone with an optimistic outlook that seeks validation, anyone in a down turn that needs a spirit uplift, well -- anyone in general.

In addition, very few people can transcend their personal agony, grief, and pain and turn it into wisdom for everyone to share. Victor Frankl did just that. He took his experiences in the Nazi concentration camps during World War II and used them as a sharpening stone to develop a revolutionary approach to understanding the psyche of humankind.Although the large majority of this book is about his concentration camp experiences, this book is about hope and meaning. Frankl shows humankind how to approach life in a positive way and to use life to its fullest to not only find meaning, but to create meaning.This book doesn't belong only in the psychiatry section, it proves its worth by belonging in the philosophy section as well. If you're looking for a shining beacon of hope in a dark world, this book may help you create a spark. If you already have meaning, this book is fuel for your flame and clarity for your vision. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"For those struggling to find meaning in life, suffering seems like an unlikely source of inspiration. Frankl uses his own experiences in Nazi concentration camps to develop his theory of logotherapy. His theory describes how human beings have a basic need to find meaning in life that should not be underestimated in its importance. Frankl argues that many pschycologists dismiss this need as trivial, but he feels it must be met before a person can resolve many of the psychological issues for which they seek treatment. By describing his own experiences of the horrors of the Holocaust, he provides convincing evidence for his theory of logotherapy.Unlike Frued's psychoanalysis, logotherapy focuses on using difficult experiences as learning opportunities rather than traumas resulting in neurosis. The first half of his book sets the stage for his learning by recounting his years in the Nazi camps and his attitude of wanting to survive in order to pass on his life's work. The second half of the book explains logotherapy, and is also his testament to how his attitude helped him survive.Frankl's argument for logotherapy is convincing as he describes how many who lost the will to live did indeed die. While I'm sure some survivors can attribute their survival to simply being at the right place at the right time, their attitudes toward their fate certainly played a role in their survival. The importance of what he calls this \\"will to meaning\\" is carried over to his treatment of patients after the war. He describes how patients who may be considered \\"ill\\" by some doctors simply lacked a focus for their lives. Once they were able to find focus, their conditions were much improved.The result of Frankl's account is an uplifting, thought provoking book that reaffirms the importance of finding meaning in life in order to deal with it's ups and downs."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Man's Search for Meaning,\\" by Viktor Frankl is an extremely well-written book that is hard to put down. Throughout the book Frankl talks about his accounts in the Nazi death camps which led him to the discovery of his theory of logotherapy. He feels that man can surpass suffering and find a meaning to life, regardless of the circumstances he is in. After reading this book, I have began to look at life differently because I know that the only way to find the true meaning of my life is through experience, by creating a work or deed, and by the attitude I take towards suffering.In this book, Frankl begins with an account of his experiences in four different Nazi death camps, including Auschwitz. In the next section of his book, Frankl discusses the theory of logotherapy and makes clear arguments on how to search for the real meaning of life.Frankl argues that the meaning of life in general is not what really matters, but rather the meaning of a person's life at a specific moment. According to his theory of logotherapy, the meaning can be discovered by creating a work or a deed, experiencing something or encountering someone, and by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.When Frankl is telling of his experience in Nazi death camps, we are told about his first manuscript being taken as he entered Auschwitz. He found meaning his life to keep going so that he could rewrite this manuscript when he was liberated. While still in the camp he would write down bits of the manuscript on scraps of paper and he laid suffering from typhus fever. Keeping his mind on his work ultimately helped him survive throughout the camps.Another important argument that Frankl talks about is the ability to find meaning in spite of the suffering that may be encountered. He feels that by changing your attitude toward your \\"unalterable fate\\", you can at least see the meaning in your suffering. As stated in logotherapy, man's main concern in life is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain, but rather to see a meaning in life.I believe that the arguments made by Frankl were very good arguments. His claims were logically consistent, the premises true, and his ideas were expressed clearly and precisely.I think that this is a great book for anyone to read in order to get a new outlook on life. Frankl's ideas are extraordinary and relates to everyone in some way. He believes that the meaning to life is different for everyone, but that there are several ways to attain it. \\"It does not matter really what we expect from life, but rather what life expects from us.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Man's Search for Meaning,\\" by Viktor Frankl was by far the best book that I have read since I entered college. After reading it I felt that I had been presented with a new way to deal with suffering. Although I have been given ways in the past to deal with suffering in life, they were never given to me in such a compelling manner.The first part of the book discusses Frankl's experience in a Nazi concentration camp. In the second part of the book, Frankl discusses basic concepts of logotherapy and he makes a number of arguments concerning the meaning of suffering and life.When talking about the liberated prisoner, Frankl contends that suffering has no limits. Even a man who endured the unimaginable suffering in a concentration camp has not reached the limit of possible suffering. To support this, Frankl speaks about the negative response that a prisoner would often receive when he returned to his home town as if empathy were too much to ask for, and years spent in misery weren't long enough. This is a strong argument because the premises contend that even after a prisoner had suffered in a concentration camp, he still faced more suffering when he returned to his normal life.Frankl believes that man is never driven to behave morally. Instead, man decides to behave morally. He supports this by stating that man behaves morally for the sake of a cause that he is committed to, someone he loves, or for the sake of his god. He also offers reasons for why man does not behave morally (to fulfill a moral drive or to have a good conscience). If a man behaved morally to have a good conscience, \\"he would become a Pharisee and cease to be a truly moral person.\\" Because that doesn't mean that you are necessarily a Pharisee (only in terms of the Jewish religion I suppose) this isn't a very strong or fair argument.Frankl says that there is nothing that would help a person survive the worst conditions, more than the knowledge that there is meaning for one's life. He corroborates this by referring to the concentration camps. Those prisoners who knew there was a duty waiting for them to complete were the most likely to survive. There is another instance in the book where Frankl uses the death of one of his \\"comrades\\" to illustrate that those who had given up hope, were almost sure to die.He goes on to say that the meaning of life in general doesn't matter. What does matter is the meaning of one's life at a given moment. This is because the meaning of life varies amongst people and over time.He says that, \\"One should not search for an abstract meaning of life.\\" In life, everyone has their own mission or vocation and must accomplish their task. This is, in part, what Frankl feels a patient should be told if they ask, \\"What is the meaning of life?\\" Because the premises follow necessarily from the conclusion this is a good argument.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever searched for the reason for suffering. This book informs the reader of an alternative way to view suffering: as a part of life. It teaches the reader to understand that in the same way that suffering has a meaning, life has a meaning; and determining what the meaning is can aid you through the most dire and tough circumstances."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"For me, an incredibly useful perspective on suffering.

I felt my painful experiences far exceeded anybody else's. Who could relate with me? I'll tell you who. This man here: Viktor Frankl. He invented logotherapy which is far more effective than psychotherapy. It deals with the meaning in our Lives rather than the problems with our brains. I thought that I had lived a hard one until I read this book. A concentration camp during the holocaust was no joke, the epitomy of suffering. Yet, there is meaning behind everything in Life, even times of great distress. This book awoke me from my slumber!! If you think that your Life is hopeless and not worth living .... please READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I came back to this book after some 30 years and found much deeper value. Frankl's thesis is that the ultimate freedom we have is to choose our response to whatever befalls us and that it remains for us to find the meaning of it -- as evidenced in our response. This would sound like so much emotional candy for people without significant problems except that he has a strong moral position to say this: 5 years in Nazi concentration camps. As he speaks of prisoners finding dignity in simple acts like giving away their ration of food or facing their death bullet with poise, I see how instead of crumpling from the weight of my misfortunes, I can use them to become stronger and reach past myself to help others.One of my grandmothers, several generations back, crossed the plains as a Mormon pioneer when she was a child. Her journal tells of their persecutions in England, burying her mother on the trail with a few stones over the shallow grave to ward off wolves, and losing her husband to a snowslide in Utah. The faith, dignity, and bouyancy emanating from her narrative, and old-timers in the family told me from her character, would seem strange without the lesson of Frankl's book: these challenges gave her the opportunity to choose to whether to follow a higher or a lower path. I can see how her response was a determined choice not to let these events deprive her of happiness.After re-reading this book, it is easier in my life to maintain calm when talking with angry people. I can choose not to become caught up in their anger. Instead, my calm response can be my strong statement that \\"I choose not for us to be at war. I choose to remain at peace and to try to share that peace with you.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"IntroductionA very well writen book by a man that has had to endure a tremendous amount of physical and emotional punishment. Frankel's main argument is that a human being can overcome almost anytihng in life if they can find their meaning for living. By using some of his own perosnal experiences and others' as well, he is able to illustrate that his argument of meaning is true. By using his personal experiences and observatoins it is very clear to see that his argument that by finding a true meaning or desire a human being can hold on for what they believe in.Argument summaryFrankel's main premises in the first half of the book are that even under the most extreme circumstances, as in Frankel's time in a Nazi concentration camp, a person who has something to live for can and will survive. For Frankel it was his wife that he constantly thought about and strived to live for. He had observations of people emotionaly giving up, which led to sickness and death. The conclusions of his arguments are that if a person finds their meaning for life, in Frankel's case his wife, and they never give up hope for them then a person can overcome almost anything as long as you don't give up.Critical EvaluationFrankel's arguments are of good reasoning and deductively valid. If a person has nothing to live for, nothing to strive for, then that person is not going to live or strive for anything. It is this very simple yet very strong emotion that makes it possible for people to go on and continue. If a person finds true meaning for their life then that person will do everything in their power to keep that meaning and that meaning will keep them striving forward. His arguments do not seem to contain any fallacies. In fact if you look at the fallacy of look who's talking, Frankel is doing exactly the opposite. He is practicing what he preaches if you want to put it that way. Not only is he arguing that if you find a means of continuance then it is possible to go on, but he also has personal experience with this. His times in the concentration camps and not giving up on hope and having his wife as a means of continuance prove that he is not commiting such a fallacy for example. The only negative I have to say against Frankel's arguments are that once he makes one, as in his argument that logotherapy is the meaning of life and existence, he seems to ramble and lead to something a little of course. Besides this, I find his arguments to be stellar and in my mind prove to be a very heartfilled and emotionally lifting read.ConclusionFrankel's experiences not only prove that the human soul is very powerful as long as you give yourself a means to go on, to strive for what not only what you believe, but prove that almost anything is possible. Using his own personal experiences and observations amongst others, he not only proves these arguments but lets you into his life of meaning. Throughout the book Frankel is numerously quoting Nietzsche which is a strong support for his argument that human beings need to find meaning in order to survive. I am going to leave you with the quote that is most often quoted, \\"He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how\\"."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book should be required reading in highschool.. it's insight to the human experince and the inside of a Nazi death camp, are eye opening"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book helped me to find my meaning or I should say my purpose of living.

He admits that someone who wasn't there can't give a very detailed or personal account, but a person who WAS there can't give a detached account because they were emotionally involved. I think he did an excellent job of viewing the situation with detachment, considering the situation. This was a really interesting little memoir. The second half of the book introduces his theory of psychoanalysis: logotherapy. Logotherapy is focused on man's search for meaning; in contrast to Freudian theory focusing on man's search for pleasure and Adlerian theory focusing on man's search for power. I think Logotherapy is the most sensible form of psychotherapy I've ever heard of. How can I argue that our happiness depends on our perceiving our own purpose? I admit I felt a little skepticism when he kept bringing up examples of how he'd \\"cured\\" someone after only one session--he must have been a particularly clever person to manage that so often.

Reading this short book carefully is a life changer."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I recently completed a master's in counseling and guidance and have been reading to find a set of books that will best address some of the disorders in the DSM-IV. Following is a list I have put together from my reading so far, and these are books that I would HIGHLY recommend. I would like to say up front that the DSM-IV is full of very normal behaviors that for some reason have become magnified or exaggerated in an individual to the point of causing a negative impact in their daily lives. Take OCD for example, it is quite normal and even preferable (from a safety perspective) to check and be sure that one has turned off all the burners on the stove after cooking, or to be sure the back door is locked before going to bed. But to continue checking time and again would be problematic and can lead to problems in an individual's life. Something is diagnosed as a disorder when it moves from being a \\"normal\\" activity to being something that causes dysfunction in daily living. So, one may read the DSM-IV and see themselves reflected in many of the disorders. The question is always: is this behavior negatively impacting my life? If so then that is when it crosses the line of normal and needs to be treated.Depression; I believe there are two sources for depression: one source is our own minds, we think ourselves into the depression - at least in this case we know where it is coming from and we should be able to step behind our thoughts and help ourselves move in a better direction. The other source seemingly comes from nowhere; one minute we are okay and the next we are thrown into the depths* Book = \\"Transforming Depression: Healing the Soul Through Creativity\\"- David H. Rosen\\"o I would recommend reading this at least through chapter 4, going further than that delves into some deep Jungian psychology which will not likely appeal to everyone. I certainly enjoy Jungian psychology and believe that Jung's work will become more and more important and critical to our understanding as we move forward in this field of psychology. Jung's psychology is really on the borderland between spirit/soul and the science of psychology and it is Jung's work that brought me into this field. However it is quite complex/deep/different and may lose some readers. For a very good intro to Jung's work, I would recommend \\"The Essential Jung\\" by Anthony Storr, but this is not light reading as is composed of excerpts from Jung's collected works.* Book = \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" - Viktor Franklo I would recommend this book for two primary reasons: one is it pushes very strongly the message that meaning is essential in our lives - as shown through Victor Frankl's imprisonment in Nazi concentration camps. Frankl comments on how he observed the individuals who gave up the fight and died, and the individuals who persevered - and most importantly what it was that he believes made the difference. The other reason I recommend this book is that it helps the individuals whose thoughts may have led them to depression to realize that things could be worse. Of course there are devastations we may face that can truly be to us, just as bad as a Nazi concentration camps, but for the most part, we often push ourselves into depression for reasons that are somewhat superficial compared to other realities.Depersonalization Disorder - essentially feeling like you are not really there* Book = \\"Feeling Unreal: Depersonalization Disorder and the Loss of the Self\\" - Daphne Simeon and Jeffrey Abugelo Excellent book which will help folks understand this disorder. This is for me a very interesting disorder, I think this is one disorder where the connection between our ego consciousness and perhaps what we are at a much deeper level is challenged. Normally we are locked into full belief in our reality - we believe we are very much a part of it and that we \\"are\\" the body in which we reside. This disorder forces us to question if we are the body we think we are. It would appear that whatever piece of our mind is keeping us in full belief is breaking down a bit, leaving us a bit outside of the \\"normal\\" feeling of being the body. Folks with this disorder can actually worry that they do not have control of their body and that this body may do something they do not want it to do. Driving a car for example can be quite traumatic if you think your body may be acting without your input.Bipolar disorder - the book I am recommending is focused on Bipolar II disorder - essentially swinging from manic (very happy and carefree) to severe depression. This book was actually required reading during the Masters program* Book = \\"An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness\\" by Kay Redfield Jamisono Excellent book written by a psychologist who suffers from this disorder. This book helps to understand the importance of medication for this disorder, as well as the path of destruction that can easily be paved during carefree, manic episodes.ADHD (attention deficit disorder)* Book = \\"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It\\" - Gabor Mateo This is not just a great book for folks with ADHD, but for everyone - as many of the lessons here translate to all of us. This is an extremely excellent book on ADHD and living in general.OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder)* Book = \\"Tormenting Thoughts and Secret Rituals: The Hidden Epidemic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\\" - Ian Osborno Excellent book on OCD - this book will help individuals with OCD as well as those who know someone with the disorder - to understand what is happening in the mind of a person with this disorder. This book will also help OCD folks realize that they are not alone and that many of the rituals or compulsions are shared by other folks with OCD.That is all for now, but I am still reading"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"nt: \\"This book was recommended to me, by a man that I respect.

Dr. Frankl writes: \\"From all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these two--the \\"race\\" of the decent man and the \\"race\\" of the indecent man\\". I am so glad that I read this book.A professor asked our class asked who each would be more inclined to follow Sigmund Freud, or, Abraham Maslow. Thinking out-loud, I suggested Viktor E. Frankl. The professor however stated, that he was out of scope of that particular assignment. Whereas I am a layman at best, and to be frank, I have great respect for Maslow's Hierarchy of needs, I am just not a fan of Freud. As for Viktor E. Frankl? G-d love the man. Well, really, with the forward looking Logotherapy, G-d love the man.Dr. Frankl writes: \\"It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life - daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct.

So anything I have to say on the subject would mostly be conjecture. And then it dawned on me.

It is however interesting that Frankl's account is somewhat contradicted by the experience of another of the 'survivors' Primo Levi. For Levi survival depended a great deal on one's good luck, regardless of one's attitude or virtue. I think in general that those like Frankl and Levi who survived the ' worse horror ' have a kind of authenticity as witnesses which obliges us to give what they say, special attention and consideration.In this sense I think too that Frankl's central insight about our being moral creatures, who can help make meaning in our lives even in the most extreme circumstances is a very significant one."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This may be instrumental for those who wish to understand the greater purpose behind their suffering. The author describes enduring many horrific experiences of the Holocaust while discovering a greater meaning along the way.Viktor Frankl believes there is a deeper meaning behind the suffering many experience. He believes it's a individual's challenge to discover the purpose concealed within their pain. He's non-judgmental on human suffering, seeing one's pain as a potential source of strength rather than as a sign of weakness.This book offers insights to those who seek a greater meaning within their suffering. While much of his story takes place during the Holocaust, the lessons learned are universal to anyone who's endured great difficulty."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In a world filled with paradoxes and contradictions, Frankl's work reaches across almost forty years and not only touches the heart but brings conviction. There is purpose in life, in suffering, indeed there is meaning in individual existence!!! I would reccommend this book to anyone on their own personal journey towards living life to its full, regardless of individual circumstance."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"For those who have ever pondered the meaning of life, this book provides an interesting insight. In the book, Frankl, tells his story of life in a Nazi concentration camp but rather than focusing mainly on the horrors of camp life, he uses specific examples of mundane life in order to support his main purpose of demonstrating that even in the worst circumstances there can be a meaning for life.A recurring idea is \\"He who has a 'why' to live for can bear with almost any 'how'.\\" (Friedrich Nietszche) This sentence has the utmost importance for Frankl because a man without purpose cannot and does not live in a concentration camp. Repeatedly Frankl describes those who had given up hope on ever getting anything better out of life and then articulates, \\"...it did not really matter what we expected from life but rather what life expected from us.\\" His idea is that meaning in life does not come from the \\"active creation of something of value\\" but rather in how we handle life, the decisions we make in the best and worst of circumstances in response to the tasks that life has given us.It only takes a few hours to read but still has a lasting effect on the reader well after finishing. One may not agree with his view but in my opinion it is an understanding worth considering."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I choose this book to review as part of an academic assignment and found it to be an uplifting spiritual journey, rather than an ardous academic task! Dr. Frankl's story of survival midst the unimaginable human suffering in the Death camps of WW11 is a truly moving account of the indomitable nature of the human spirit. In many ways it is the same courageous, inspirationl spirit which I have the privilege to encounter through my work ( i.e. working with people who have cancer). People have an enormous capacity to cope with suffering as evidenced by Dr. Frankl's testimony -the power to do so is within all of us, deep within our core, our very being. This book is not alone inspirational, it is also powerfully liberating; a liberation which emanates from Dr. Frankl's truism -- our one true freedom is our infinite freedom to choose our attitude, regardless of the circumstances. Our search or spiritual quest for meaning is as unique and individual as we are, and the meaning we eventually attribute to our inevitable human suffering is also unique. This book focuses the mind on the truly important things in life, our relationships, our loved ones, etc. My perspective on life and living has not only broadened but has deepened also. The philosophy/theory espoused by Viktor Frankl in this masterpiece has \\"grounded\\" me in a very real sense.The world is a lesser place without Dr. Frankl but his beautifully enriching work will shine brightly like a beacon of hope in the hearts and minds of men for years to come."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Dr. Frankl does a superb job in capturing life in the concentration camps during WWII. I was moved at the same time touched by his words, \\"A man's salvation lies in and through Love.\\" It is true that we are free to choose our attitudes in any given situation and Dr. Frankl choose not to suffer by relying on the Love for his wife to survive the gruesome days in the Nazi camps. This is a beautiful book, which reflects on human suffering and how we are free to choose our attitudes. In the most horrific situations, we as humans can choose not to suffer. It is in us, the most influential power we carry (our attitudes) that lies in humans which can guide us to see the beauty the lies within and around us (life), even during the toughest times!A MUST READ BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, I read it for a Philosophy class. It made me vision what it was like in the concentration camps, and how people had to adapt to the situation. Shock and Apathy were ways to deal with it, but they weren't the only ways. In life we have many defense mechanisms, such as ignorance, humor, apathy, and others. I would encourage others to read this book, because in life there is meaning, we get it by our name, who we love, and our relationships with other people. We can identify with a lot...Read this book..."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"To start off this review I would like to say that I am very pleased so far with the book. Right now I have already finished the first part of the book and I am reading the second part. I am reading the part where he goes over Logotherapy. It is really quite interesting. The book got to me in so many different ways. I find it very surprising how this man got through the Holocaust especially when he was a victim. To live through the horror of a Nazi death camp isn't anything easy but this man did it and with great struggle. Reading this book makes me think a lot differently about life now. What really got me in the book was the part where he describes how he and his fellow friends in the death camps would save others from committing suicide. He would tell them that life waits for them. He told them that they should live because somewhere out there, after they are all liberated, a person will be waiting for he/she. This gave the person great confidence in themselves and started looking forward to the future instead of the present. It really made me think about life today. Although we are not going through even half the stuff that this man went through, it makes you think about life. It makes you wonder what WILL happen in the future and what kinds of things wait for you ahead. So I say to my fellow comrades out there, death isn't the only way out. There is much more in life. It's a tough book in the sense that it makes you think beyond a lot, but it is definitely worth it when you figure out the meanings behind everything he has to say. There is always a message. Take the message of death for example. It is all fate. It really all comes down to fate. It all comes down to having unconditional faith in life even though it doesn't seem like the right idea at the time.He explains everything about Logotherapy and to me it is the strongest and most powerful form of therapy yet! Logotherapy is something that one does to them self. It is a mind thing and it works. It really does. It is really effective. You could learn, from Logotherapy, how life is so beautiful and so wonderful. One just has to open their eyes. After reading this autobiography, you learn so many things about life and all the tricks in life. It's actually something quite beautiful. This is such an optimistic book. This book helps you find yourself and where you're at today. It helps you find a meaning in life. Oh, there are so many.Viktor Frankl wrote an excellent book for all kinds of different levels of readers. He touched bases with the reader and, even though you may not like it, makes you understand that everyone goes through the same thing one way or another. This was an excellent book and I strongly recommend it for those interested in psychological books."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is an awesome book, written by a survivor of Auschwitz death camp in Nazi Germany, and a man who is surely one of the most gifted and insightful psychiatrists who has lived. Indeed, a psychiatrist who has personally faced such extremity, is a psychiatrist worth listening to.Frankl is a man of faith, and he explains that there exists a deep, spiritual core within each of us which cannot be crushed or taken away from us - no matter how grim or awful our external circumstances may be. He says that from the soul's reckoning, tragedy can be the greatest opportunity for triumph. While in the camp, even though Frankl had no idea how many hours, days or years he had left to live, he realised that during the moment now, he had a choice whether to be free, or whether to be imprisoned. That is, to be free in his spirit. During his experience in Auschwitz, Frankl literally found himself on the bottom line, and from there, he made the most amazing discovery of all. He discovered the truth of his own spiritual awakening.The most effective way I can convey the Frankl's message, and the profundity of his work, is to share some quotes from the book itself. Frankl says...&quot;The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity - even under the most difficult circumstances - to add a deeper meaning to his life.&quot;... &quot;One of the main features of human existence is the capacity to rise above such conditions, to grow beyond them.&quot;... &quot;Often it is just such an exceptionally difficult external situation which gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself. ... To be sure, a human being is a finite thing, and his freedom is restricted. It is not freedom from conditions, but it is freedom to take stand toward the conditions.&quot;... &quot;Even the helpless victim of a hopeless situation, facing a fate he cannot change, may rise above himself, may grow beyond himself, and by doing so change himself. He may turn a personal tragedy into a triumph.&quot;Frankl closes the book with a profound, bedrock refutation against Sigmund Freud's theory, and also against materialists' theories that human beings are 'conditioned' by their external surroundings. He quotes Freud, who had asserted, &quot;Let one attempt to expose a number of the most diverse people uniformly to hunger. With the increase of the imperative urge of hunger, all individual differences will blur, and in their stead will appear the uniform expression of the one unstilled urge.&quot;Frankl replies, &quot;Thank heaven, Sigmund Freud was spared knowing the concentration camps from the inside. His subjects lay on a couch designed in the plush style of Victorian culture, not in the filth of Auschwitz. There, the 'individual differences' did not 'blur' but, on the contrary, people became more different: people unmasked themselves, both the swine and saints. ... We may predict the movements of a machine, of an automation; more than this, we may even try to predict the mechanisms of the human psyche as well. But man is more than psyche.&quot;Frankl's conclusions are profound: &quot;The self transcendence of human existence ... denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something, or Someone, other than oneself.&quot;Overall, this is an extraordinarily profound and unique book which, at times, proves quite heavy and difficult to digest, but once one gets in tune with the author's message, then its truth and light becomes fully clear, apparent and undeniable.Certainly not a light read, yet highly recommended."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Besides presenting his Logotherapy in a nutshell, Viktor Frankl tells us about the horrors of concentration camps and how some people survived - and why. A fascinating book on human behavior."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Enough has been said about this little book. It is captivating to read. The depth of his insight will leave you wanting to memorize certain passages. I just finished it but i already want & need to read it again to get a better understanding of it in order to better apply its principles to my life and to those i come in contact with. This book will go on my short list of must reads of truly great books."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl was, as he put it, \\"a professor in two fields, but a survivor of four camps - concentration camps, that is\\". Already a renowned psychotherapist, Frankl's experiences at Auschwitz and other concentration camps provided him profound and striking insights into human psychology. He sets them out in this brief and elegant book.Firstly, when put in a situation of extreme adversity or deprivation human personalities do not blur into one \\"uniform expression of the unstilled urge\\", as Sigmund Freud had supposed they would but, on the contrary, true personalities are accentuated. Secondly, despair and depression are not at all correlated with the experience of adversity, but if anything inversely so: in our modern, plentiful and comfortable times, neuroses are legion. By contrast, on the whole they weren't in Nazi death camps. Frankl was uniquely placed and qualified to comment on this; Freud was not: \\"Thank heaven,\\" Frankl remarks dryly, \\"Freud was spared knowing the concentration camps from the inside\\".This seems right: I dare say you don't see much neuroticism in modern day Somalia either (though I do quite like the idea of obsessive-compulsive Mogadishan parents pushing their kids into extra cello lessons.)Frankl uses his anecdotal observations to propose what was in its day a revolutionary psychology: it isn't our primal physical urges which determine our behaviour, with intellectual constructions being mere epiphenomenal by-products (Freud would have it that love, for example, was a spin-off of the deeper primal sexual urge), but the other way round: it is the intellectual content - the *meaning* of our lives that shapes and drives our behaviour and, crucially, our happiness.The more profound and compelling you find the meaning in your own life, the less neurotic you're likely to be.This leaves open the question of what \\"meaning\\" might be, and what might make a profound and compelling one. This question Frankl doesn't answer, rightly I think, other in rather an airy fashion. Anecdotally, meanings are more likely to count as profound and compelling the more gravely connected with the \\"tragic triad\\" of pain, guilt and death they are (no shortage, therefore, at Auschwitz). But beyond those axes, the implication will be that we, the users, determine our own meaning.This may perhaps be a little self-fulfilling, and neurosis may be a product of existential frustration (in other words the confounding of one's own quest for meaning through preoccupation with things you don't truly value): Frankl cites a senior American diplomat who sought treatment from depression arising from discontent with his working life. Frankl's advice was not undergo psychotherapy, but to change his job to something he cared more about!But all the same this seems to me a plausible explanation for modern melancholy: who, these days, isn't continually and forcibly preoccupied with things he or she doesn't truly value? That seems to perfectly capture the \\"asset rich, time poor\\" existence.This is a short book, but it's a gem: the message of plurality and self-determination are ones which should strike harmonious chords in the ears of those, like this reviewer, who are nudging into middle age and wondering if it is quite all what it cracked up to be.Olly Buxton"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"At multiple levels Viktor Frankl's book is simply brilliant.At the level of primitive survival Frankl shows that there is no way of knowing whether volunteering will end at the gas chamber or a rest camp, when the dice are being rolled by someone else.In terms of the day-to-day existence he found that it was important to stay in the middle of the flock, or work party to stay warm, and not be beaten.On the re-adjusted scales of Happiness, he understandably developed the concept of negative happiness- freedom from suffering.Finally, he realised that LOVE is the highest goal to which one can aspire.This is the one book that you finish reading and think- My life is pretty damn good!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I don't think I have ever read a book where someone has written what is so true to me about the essential truths of life. What makes this book so different is the background of total adversity in which it was written.

In the book he said and I quote \\"When we are no longer able to change a situation...

Frankl, reached in the course of more than three years in a succession of four Nazi concentration camps, including Auschwitz. The book he wrote in the space of nine days in 1946, originally under another title, morphed over the years into the thin volume known around the world today as Man's Search for Meaning. It has sold more than 12 million copies and been translated into 24 languages, serving as a source of inspiration and solace for millions of people. Man's Search for Meaning is frequently cited as one of the most important books of the 20th Century.Frankl's almost matter-of-fact description of his years in concentration camps is profoundly moving, the more so because it's a fiercely personal document and makes no attempt to relate the familiar statistics now surrounding the topic or to place the Nazi phenomenon in historic perspective. Frankl writes simply about how he personally managed to remain hopeful in the face of staggering brutality, including the murder of his young wife at Bergen-Belsen and the death of numberless friends and colleagues. As Frankl relates, their deaths came not only at the hands of SS guards but also, at least equally, as the result of sadistic behavior by the \\"Capos,\\" prisoners themselves raised to positions of authority and privilege by the Nazis. The effect of reading this material is searing. Here, God is truly in the details.However, Frankl's story about life in the concentration camps is only one of several parts in Man's Search for Meaning. The edition I read included five pieces written over more than half a century by three different authors: a foreword by Rabbi Harold S. Kushner, an Afterword by William J. Winslade, and three articles by Frankl. The first of these three, \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp,\\" has received the most attention from non-professionals. The second, \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell,\\" is Frankl's brief summary of the principles and procedures of logotherapy, the \\"third school\\" of Viennese psychiatry that Frankl created -- an approach that's often termed \\"existential psychiatry.\\" (Somehow, Carl Jung seems to have gotten lost in the numbering system -- perhaps because he was Swiss, not Viennese.) Frankl also wrote a \\"Postscript 1984&#8243; bearing the title, \\"The Case for a Tragic Optimism.\\" And all this writing fits comfortably into a remarkably thin little volume.Intellectually, Frankl's abbreviated introduction to logotherapy for the layperson, was the most intriguing part of the book. The term itself is derived from the much-used Greek word, logos, which has been applied to all manner of pursuits in philosophy, rhetoric, and religion. Frankl took it to mean something like \\"meaning.\\" He rejected the determinism of Freudian and Adlerian psychiatry, insisting that neither approach was useful in treating more than a minority of psychological problems. In his own practice and that of the students under his supervision in a series of top Viennese hospitals, Frankl found that many psychological problems could be easily cured by one or a few conversations between the patient and the logotherapist. Logotherapy involved no years-long sojourns on the analyst's couch. (In fact, patients sat in chairs.) He cites many cases of ingrained phobic and compulsive behavior that he and his disciples cured by somehow convincing patients not to worry about their behavior. A lifelong stutterer, for example, was cured when he was persuaded to enter conversations unconcerned about stuttering -- and the cure was lasting. A fellow physician transcended his depression over the loss of his wife in a single, short conversation with Frankl. The essential truth of logotherapy is as Frankl discovered in the camps: so long as we maintain a powerful commitment to some life goal outside our present circumstances, we can get through practically any privation.Man's Search for Meaning should be in everyone's library. The lessons Viktor Frankl teaches can be applied to challenges in any culture and all walks of life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Very thought provoking that gives you a look both into life in a concentration camp and why and how many of us cope.

I do continue to find the idea that a purpose is imposed on you rather than vice versa intriguing, although again, I'm not sure that I agree.It's a great book and everyone should at least make a lap of the biography to understand what the Holocaust looked like from an insider, particularly people like myself who have been affected by the death of loved ones.If you've never read it, it will be the best $7 you've ever spent."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl has written an powerfull book about his years as a prisoner inside a nazi concentration camp. He worked as a psychologist and wrote on the subject of lifes meaning. The book is a powerfull testament to the will of humans to survive in dire circumstances. The book begins with the train full of prisoners rolling into the camp. At once they are stripped of all their belongings. Beginning with their clothes, and then glasses, jewlery and all other personal belongings. This is the first step in the process of dehumanizing them. So the struggle for these prisoners he writes is very much about struggling to keep the idea of yourself as a subject alive. To keep alive ones feeling of self worth was essential for survival. it was also important he writes to have the feeling that one had a spiritual center where one could retain some freedom even though one was imprisoned. Otherwise he or she will regress to feeling very small and in the end becoming a formless member of the herd, like an animal. Once this was achieved, when the personality and subjectivity had been broken and erased the person could be willed to do almost anything. The spirit only survives he writes, as long as the idea of hope does. That is why in the suffering one has to parodoxically have to try to find some meaning. If one dosent then the organism is in great danger of being annihilated. Only those who where able to somehow retain a sense of hope, that maybe somewhere someone was waiting for them, that someone who loved them was thinking about them, that god,even though it seemed impossible, saw their suffering."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Title says it all. The second half of the book has some really great tips & tricks for life. You shouldn't skip the first half of the book since it ties into and validates the teachings in the second half of the book.Sometimes the writing is a bit awkward and verbose (he does speak in technical terms at times), but go slow and really try to understand what he's saying. The book is a really quick read, but again take your time!For a while I really didn't understand this quote from the author: \\"Live as if you were living a second time, and as though you had acted wrongly the first time.\\" But, after taking some time to think about it (like the time you need to read the book), it truly hit home what this quote means.I'd recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Suffering, Meaning & a Worthwhile Life....\\"A psychiatrist who personally has faced such extremity [as the Nazi death camps] is a psychiatrist worth listening to. He, if anyone, should be able to view our human condition with compassion. Dr. Frankl's words have a profoundly honest ring, for they rest on experiences to deep for deception.\\"So wrote Gordon Allport, Harvard Professor of Psychology and at mid-20th century, one of the great American psychologists. What does Frankl say? More vitally, what talk has he walked?\\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is not a boastful or an easy book. But it is forcefully honest & gripping -- ongoing struggles, failures and flashes of success, brilliant success really. Not so much in preserving sanity. For who of us has the right to dare call insane anyone in a concentration camp who became overwhelmed or gave up? Frankl's struggles, and the struggles of those around him, were how to keep humanely living in the face of what seems unfaceable.As Frankl says, \\"...we had nothing to lose except our so ridiculously naked lives.\\" If there's a meaning, a reason, a \\"why?\\" sturdy enough to bear that load, it must confront outrageous & unavoidable suffering.I'm a psychotherapist; I work with many who suffer: children severely abused & neglected, adults still caught up in their abuse, soldiers back from Iraq along with their spouses & children. A label is easy & obvious: PTSD. Healing is not.Frankl, writing well before we called this a \\"stress disorder\\" (Concentration camps = STRESS? Can you feel how wrong it is to stop at the mechanics of stress?), shows us a deeper, more accurate, more transcendent reality & truth. Struggling to find a worthy life in the face of suffering is not a \\"disorder\\". In that struggle we can become profoundly sickened, and our risk of sickening is never far away. But equally possible & present is a humbling choice: we can honestly face our suffering and struggle to find (create, build, open ourselves up to, ....) our own meaning. \\"Our own\\", in that it is individual to us, but it is never \\"just ourselves\\".Through brutally-learned understandings & terribly-lived examples, Frankl shows us ways. I fear quoting a few lines. It feels like sound-biting & trivializing, not only misleading but obscene. Frankl isn't about one-liners, though he writes many memorable lines & stories. But lines pale when removed from their stories, their struggles to grasp onto meaning.\\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is short and easy-to-read, especially the first section, about the camps. Read it. Likely someday you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book was recommended to me by my mother while I was in college. I read it during college at a time I was having trouble with anxiety. This book and The Road Less Traveled by M Scott Peck helped me deal with my ego based psychological problems at the time. These two books were very influential in helping me to finish college and move on with my life. Now I read books by Deepak Chopra and Eckhart Tolle which help me but these books were powerful stepping stones during that period in my life. Recommended for anyone who wants to read and be motivated by the power of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book gives you a very powerful insight in the lives of millions that had the opportunity to be prisoners in the concentration camps. As strange as it sounds, that was an opportunity to develop their love for life, and that love for life was what kept them alive, Victor Frankl is a being full of light that not only thought about his own life but the value of other's lives, specially in such an ultimate experience where survival was critical. You will love it and is such a small book that gives you so much that is incredible that so much light could be put in to such a small book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I've been meaning to read this book for years and finally got around to it. WOW WOW WOW! That just about sums it up. The amount of thought provoking passages increased with each page. I was in tears several times. I've gone back and reread many sections that touched me. I think I'll read the entire book again very soon. There are already so many great in depth reviews here, so it's not necessary to go into detail. Just read it if you haven't yet! It'll make you count your blessings and give thanks."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book offers a very insightful look into the human mind through circumstances so dire its almost difficult to contemplate. Fortunately, most of us will never likely come within reach of such dreadful circumstances; however, by means of this book we are able to ascertain meaning by vicariously viewing the experiences of Dr. Frankl and learning from his own thoughts and perceptions about the matter.This book rates high in its ability to help the reader search for meaning, define purpose, and gain an incredible sense of relativity. I give four stars only as a result of its propensity to read like a psychology text book. I admit, however, that may speak more to my weaknesses and lack of pursuit on such subjects than the quality of the writing. As such, this is certainly not meant as a major detriment as the substance presented is excellent."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"One of the best books I've read in my life.

Is there a chance you can find meaning in living that torture? This is a truly inspirational book that reminds you that not everything is lost, that you can find light in the most terrible conditions. It's not new age, it's a story of survival and hope.The second part of the book is about logotherapy. Victor Frankl was the creator of this discipline and it basically addresses the question of meaning in people's lives."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I loved this book it is a short read that is power packed with truth. A must read for every counseling student."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I love this book - it's fascinating to think what we can choose, even in the worst of circumstances."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I read this book because I sometimes struggle to find meaning in my life and wanted to learn more about what it was like to \\"live\\" in a concentration camp. I find it hard to believe there is so much hate in this world that would drive one group of people to want to kill and oppress not only one other person, but an entire race of people. The hate is there and it is awful. Since I feel sorry for myself and become depressed more than I would like, I found more meaning to my life just from reading this book. I can't imagine what it would be like to survive such a horrific event such as this. For people to find meaning in their lives while experiencing these tragedies is amazing. I think many of us can apply logotherapy in our lives too. The logotherapy examples the author described that helped his patients were interesting because they worked and now I want to apply them in my own life. The fact that the author experienced these awful things and was able to learn from it and help other people is awesome. This book is a great read for everyone, especially ones who are depressed. It is important to find meaning in your life. Like Viktor Frankl suggests, we can start by loving people and becoming more responsible."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book was incredibly impactful for me. We search for meaning in our lives, but, as Dr. Frankel says, I can't hope to find the meaning of my life as a whole until I'm at the end of it, and maybe I can't even know it then. Instead, following his example and writings, I can find meaning in my life every day by being the best me I can be today. That's all there is, anyway, because we don't know if we will even have tomorrow. He says finding meaning in life is an art to engage in every day, not a scientific search to reach a conclusion once and for all. For me it was a new perspective to look at the meaning of my life from the perspective of just being my truest self today, rather than deriving my meaning from my activities and accomplishments."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have to admit that I heard about this book very recently. I was introduced to this book while I was reading Dr. Francis Collins's collection of essays \\"Belief\\".Dr.Frankl's essay from that collection struck me as one of the deepest and most meaningful one.At that moment I decided to read the book. The book is worth the money with just the introduction, throughout the book you really feel like talking to the person himself on a winter night by the fire place.As a person who was partially faced with similar decisions (having to leave the parents and spending part of my life time under oppression), I found this book very touching.I wish every high school student read this book, this way they may take fewer things for granted.The value of the book does't consist only in the excellent narrative style but also on the psychological depth.Definitely one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"a must read for every thinking person.

The book begins with Frankl's experiences in WWII Nazi concentration camps; later chapters explain logotherapy -- man's search for meaning. I found the book to be fresh, insightful and I gained enough of an understanding of logotherapy to know I'd like to learn more. Frankl's work is especially relevant in our time."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for MeaningSignificant work indeed after Freud and Adler. The book shows by example of personal experience of the author, and that of many other, how the influence of one's thought power can make you live or die and the rightful thinking that can make one stand against all odds. The meaning for life is not defined by someone but to be found by each one of us and that the meaning exists whatever the living state of affairs be, is the message of the book. There probably has never been a worst place to live other than in concentration camps, as described in the book and the ordeal of living through it. The book also deals with the dimension of spiritual thinking a little (probably the 8 volumes of the theory proposed by Viktor Frankl has more info). A must read for students of psychology."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Excluding scientific achievements and their documentation, no other short book presents the gifts of the twentieth century as perfectly as Frankl's work.Man's Search for Meaning, or ISM for the modern substitution of \\"An Individual's\\" for \\"Man's,\\" gives the extreme twisted side of human organization with its autobiography of a holocaust survivor, but balances it with the strongest statement possible not against the horror, but against determinism: humans always have the freedom to choose their response. Furthermore, the text is written with the direct, yet respectful words, for the twisted, but not fixed, timber of human life exemplified in the intelligent style of Freud, Jung, and Adler - a mid-century style not commonly written anymore, a style that assumes that a reader not only has worked to develop a humane education, but is also willing to work to improve it.The main thrust of Frankl is that humans strive to make meaning of their lives first and foremost. This updates Freud's statements that humans seek pleasure primarily or Adler's statements that people seek power. The job of a psychoanalyst (a quaint word today) is to use logotherapy (a set of approaches initiated by Frankl) to help patients solve their problems, internally and externally, by finding their meaning. Obviously Frankl fits within the resolving existentialism tide of the twentieth century. He complements the texts of Isaiah Berlin which also focus on the meaning of freedom within the constraints of humans as they are and the societies in which they live.If only considered responses to Frankl by stoics such as Seneca and Aurelius were possible. A dialogue across time - which a reader can form - places many of the travails of history as being those of humans within history resolving their search for meaning, a seeking also inherent within most readers. This segues into seeing history not just through the lens of great events and powers, but through the experiences of everyone, not just elites."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This was required reading my sophomore year in high school. Though I had tremendous appreciation for it then, I find that reading it in my adult years has allowed me to more deeply understand the significance of the message.

Frankl writes of the need to find meaning and the positive side and strength in the midst of the most dire circumstances. Even though it is relatively short, plan on spending some time with this book because you will constantly be reading, and re-reading each section because it is so meaningful. Perhaps the most powerful sentiment - \\"...everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I read this book many years ago for my high school English class.

I gave a copy to a friend going through great and long term suffering, and she absolutely loved it. She was very inspired, and although her suffering continues, I have noticed a great improvement in her health already.This is a book which draws on universal truths celebrated and taught by all major religions.

The Holocaust displayed such horrors but this book shows and identifies a conflict one would think the Holocaust, but that's not the conflict Victor examines man himself within his conflict himself and his environment finding meaning in his actions in how he approaches life, \\"What he becomes -within the limits of endowment and environment-he has made out of himself.\\"\\"Yet one of the main features of human existence is the capacity to rise above such conditions, to grow beyond them. Man is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the better if necessary.\\" Victor express his own testimony of the Holocaust he was a survivor for three years in the camp he shares his observations as he observes those encamped around and about \\"In the concentration camps, for example, in this living laboratory and on this testing ground, we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behave like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself, which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions.\\" Victor retorts his findings how the human being can overcome adverse situations even though the environment was created to destroy the human spirit Victor expresses that it is not the conditions that make the decision it is the decision of the one that makes his choice of the outcome. Many of us have endured tragedy that's what makes this book identifiable although our tragedies are unique they create the same questions, \\"How is it possible to say yes to life in spite of all that?\\" When most people especially soldiers in the military veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars question their views on life from the traumatic events they have witness and endured, not only within the theater but within the home and so we find ourselves lost within our trauma questioning life, \\"Can life retain its potential meaning in spite of its tragic aspects? After all, \\"Saying yes to life in spite of everything.\\" In a world that is quick to write someone off or medicate Victor expresses that we have to be careful as the collective body, \\"First of all, there is a danger inherent in the teaching of man's \\"nothingness,\\" the theory that man is nothing but the result of biological, psychological and sociological conditions, or the product of heredity and environment. Such a view of a man makes a neurotic believe what he is prone to believe anyway, namely, that he is a pawn and victim of outer influences or inner circumstances. This neurotic fatalism is fostered and strengthened by a psychotherapy which denies that man is free.\\"Victor created \\"Logo therapy\\", a therapist a Logo therapist's role, \\"consist of widening and broadening the visual field of the patient so that the whole spectrum of potential meaning becomes conscious and visible to him.\\" He believes that you have to go beyond yourself the future and not dwell in the past, \\"he stimulated many therapists to look beyond patients past or present problems to help to choose productive futures by making personal choices and taking responsibility for them.\\" I truly see this book as inspirational one that can help one to get back on track to push it forward, \\"to take a stand towards the conditions.\\" Victor says, \\"What is demanded of man is not, as some existential philosophers teach, to endure the meaningless of life, but rather to bear his incapacity to grasp its unconditional meaningless in rational terms, Logos is deeper than logic."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Awesome content, well put even for the non-specialists.

I used to dream of being a Messiah and had encounters with life twice where I was equally pinned on cross but all in my thoughts I knew I cannot bear the pain far less the thought so I am a mere mortal. Same way I cannot fathom the depth of concentration camps or what crystalizes out of it. Typically in India we have a philosophy which I found comes handy that when you are given pain then you also get the courage to with stand it. When do you cross over to enlightenment is something eluding me though it is not a per-requisite as far as I know. Kabbalah scholars will also find the book intriguing and failing in spiritual goals which he (VF) should have somehow alluded.

I can almost promise anyone's heart would be warmed and nurtured as mine has by this amazing book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"We really do only have one constant and irrevocable freedom--the freedom to choose our attitude in any situation, no matter how grave. This gives one a silver lining in any situation. Frankl shows us that the true test of one's existence comes only in the times of deepest suffering. The use of the word suffering is used so loosely in pschycological texts, in the context of our own lives, most of our suffering only construes to be the everyday problems of our existence. Recognizing this connection gives the reader a better understanding of the ideas of transendence, existence and love. A very enlightening school of thought that is well supported and easily understood through Frankl's many examples from his own practice. An excellent read!!!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it started me on my search for meaning. While I don't think this is the be all, end all of books about life's meaning, I think it's important as a starting point.

It makes so much sense. Society is suffering from an existential vacuum and it has nothing to do with sex. This book is not about the horrifying details of the SS but of the ways and means the prisoners tried to cope with their situation. He does this by dividing the experience into three phases: the period immediately following admission; the period where they are entrenched in camp routine; and the period following liberation.

As a Jewish family, his wife and child were murdered in the Holocaust but he survived by being a doctor in the camps. While most of us would probably curse the German Nazis who killed his wife and child. He uses his suffering and examines how suffering can help better a person's life in this book. He doesn't recommend everbody suffers but his voice is one of reason, kindness, forgiveness, and gentleness. He describes the horrors of World War II and the camps. He also gives a detailed account even criticizing his fellow Jewish prisoners who play favorites with prison guards. Not all the Germans were cruel and mean, one even got medicine for them and they paid by trying to save his life after the war. It's a war and people were both inhumane and humane to each other despite their ethnic differences."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is more than a simple retelling of what happened in the concentration camps.

Some people found themselves confused why he'd still keep writing in German. One woman dared to ask him:\\"How can you still write some of your books in German, in AdolfHitler's language\\" asked the american woman.Viktor answered calmly \\"How can you still use knives after so many killers have used them to stab and murder their victims\\"I thought, to quote the situation above was most essential and the simpliest way to tell other readers that this book is absolutely filled up with similar extremely smart comments.Unfortunetaly, a lot of writers publish books for the world and to understand them it's so difficult if not impossible - becausethey write the books to themselves.Fortunetaly, Viktor Frankl doesn't belong to that group of writers.

His case is very persuasive. I was changed by the book. While a Jew from concentration camps, he sometimes borrows Christian imagery to make his point, and his message is ultimately and purposefully universal. This is not merely a work for Jews in search of their history, but also for people in search of their sleeping souls. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"There are many reviews for this book that explain that Frankl gives insight into his experiences in the concentration camps. However, if you are looking for a book that chronicles the experiences, this is not necessarily the one you want to get.The book does an excellent job at presenting a few ideas regarding the psychology of suffering, taking as a case example the concentration camps. However, it is somewhat fragmented and does not present a coherent, complete story of Frankl's experiences.As I said before, that was not the intent of the author in writing this book. His intent, rather, was to look at the experiences of individuals with suffering. One of the take home messages for me was that suffering can bring out the very best in some and the very worst in others.He refers to meaning as one of the prime motivators and quotes Nietzche twice: (1) That which doesn't kill me makes me stronger; and (2) He who has a why to live can bear almost any how. He also expresses profound wisdom in explaining that some prisoners would go around comforting the others and even giving away their last piece of bread, proving that they can take away anything but a person's ability to choose how s/he will respond to any given situation.The only reason why this gets four stars is that I think Frankl would have an AMAZING book if he would have incorporated a more complete telling of his experiences in the concentration camp. For the most part, he only talks about the most basic details in order to talk mostly about the psychology of the camps.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the psychology of individuals, especially when they are suffering. It is also a good basic read for those who want a little bit of insight into the Holocaust without any portrayals of graphic suffering."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Read the other lengthy reviews for detail."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Truly an inspirational book.

I applaud Mr. Frankl for not only a life well lived, but for his decisions and service to his fellow man.Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"... A man with such intellect should realize that while life can be *given* a meaning, it can no longer be denied that the idea of an inherent one is ludicrous.

The only meaning life can have is secular, in the end."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Out of falsehood nothing good can come. Viktor Frankl devotes a large section of his story to Auschwitz, and claims to have been there for quite some time, noting that \\"we had to wear the same shirts for half a year, until they had lost all appearance of being shirts.\\" In reality, Frankl spent only a few days in Auschwitz, en route from Theresienstadt to an outcamp of Dachau. As Timothy Pytell, a professor of history at Cooper Union who has researched Frankl observed, a reader of Man's Search for Meaning would \\"be stunned to discover that Frankl spent only a few days in Auschwitz\\" and \\"if truth be told, Frankl's rendition is contradictory and profoundly deceptive.\\" Frankl finally admitted the truth in 1991 when he told the magazine \\"Possibilities\\" that \\"I was in Auschwitz only three or four days [...] I was sent to a barrack and we were all transported to a camp in Bavaria.\\"Frankl left Theresienstadt on October 19, 1944 and arrived at the Dachau sub-camp Kaufering III on October 25, 1944. How then did he come to write his stories of Auschwitz? One cannot avoid concluding that he simply made the stories up. One could also have determined this from Frankl's story of seeing large flames coming out of the Auschwitz crematorium chimneys - a technical impossibility for such installations.One can even identify Frankl's transport from Theresienstadt. But the Auschwitz Chronicle of Danuta Czech gives the following account of his train:\\"October 20: 1,500 Jewish men, women, and children are sent in an RSHA transport from the ghetto in Theresienstadt. After the selection, 169 women are admitted to the transit camp and 173 men as prisoners to the camp. The men receive Nos. B-13307-B-13479. The remaining 1,158 people are killed in the gas chamber of Crematorium III.\\"Frankl did not receive a number at Auschwitz. According to Danuta Czech's reasoning, which is followed by all the standard histories of Auschwitz, this implies that he was gassed. In reality, he merely stopped at Auschwitz on his way to Kaufering III. Therefore Frankl's real story disproves the story of extermination camp Auschwitz!As for Frankl's philosophy, it amounts to a ponderous meditation on one of Nietzsche's epigrams. Its fame is principally due to the intrigue of the Auschwitz story, which turns out to be fundamentally false."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Let me start by saying that this book does not belong to \\"My Favorite Books\\" bookshelf. I started reading this book for couple of reasons. One ... the central idea behind this book was referred by one of my favorite Authors (Stephen R Covey) in one of my favorite books viz \\"Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\\". Secondly, the title of this book was extremely seductive \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\". (Who does not want to know meaning of life?)This book is primarily divided into two parts. The first part is more of an autobiography of the Author(Victor E. Frankl). Second part is dedicated to \\"Logotherapy\\".As regards to the 1st part, I found the narration a bit dry. I think the Author did his best to put forward his life as dramatically as possible, however it does not stand out. As much as I sympathize with the Author for what he went through, I felt that he was being a bit boastful at times. I was specially disappointed to see that he was putting down some of his comrades to show how superior he was. The Author also also failed to explain how Logotherapy therapy helped him during his tough times.The second part is on Logotherapy, which is nothing but a \\"bowl of spaghetti\\". The ideas are not very well organized. Whatever is put forward is not sufficiently substantiated with reasoning or facts. Author has tried to use some high-sounding words to make it sound something superior, but I guess the Author failed miserably. The Logotherapy that is referred in second part has no reference in the first part. So it is difficult to make any correlation between the two parts of the book.If there is anything to learn from this book, it is ... \\"If you have a *why* in life, you will go through any *how* to achieve it.\\". So effectively, to find meaning in life, find out what is your final goal and let it direct you.Overall I found this book disappointing :-(-Sachin"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book was not quite what I expected. I do not mean todoubt Mr. Frankl's character or value or theories, or the atrocity ofconcentration camps, or anything else. In this book I expected to find a presentation and discussion of a theory. However, the first part was a description of camp life and consisted of \\"plain\\" facts. Of course, I do not doubt that they have certain things to say, but I did not see any theory coming through from these facts (at least up to the point that I had the patience to read). In my case, the first part did not attract my interest, but rather worked as a deterrent, because of very different expectations I had from this book.In describing a theory that wants to be called \\"scientific,\\" it is necessary to mention certain facts to prove ones point; in my opinion the first part did not serve such a prupose. Appealing to the emotions of the reader does not help him judge objectively a theory and certainly *doesn't* validate a theory! I do not suffer from any kind of loss and I've had little to do with physchology (my background is in physics and computer science... :-). I expected a logical and \\"matter-of-fact\\" description of a theory and (at least as far as I got in this book), I didn't see that. The beginning of the second part did not seem very \\"promising\\" either, so I gave this book up completely.To sum up, I'm *not* rejecting Mr. Frankl's theories (I still don't know what they are, after all!) but if you think in a manner similar to mine, maybe you should seek to learn about them from another book (possibly by the same author)."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" left out the reason for our existence.

Phrases like \\"the same shirts for half a year\\" account for Pytell's judgment that \\"any reader ... will be stunned to discover that Frankl spent only a few days in Auschwitz.\\" This is not an honest book.I only give it 2 stars because I did find some of the later philosophizing to be interesting. Frankl's thesis about how humans are able to survive through great torments when they feel they have found a meaning in life rings true. But the point would have been better gotten across if the first part of the book had been honestly written as a novel about a fictional character who might possibly resemble a real person somewhere in history. Instead, Frankl tried to pass this off as an autobiography of himself and for that he deserves to be slammed hard."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I am a widow, and this book was recommended to me by a psychologist to help lift my spirits.

That if you can convince youself you have something to live for: you will continue to live for it. So? If after getting hit on the head with a lead pipe 100x one is to receive ten million dollars, I suppose there are some who will endure that pain, too, in the hope they will survive. They won't.Perhaps the real question is if there is *any* reward for enduring the brutality of life that is worth the suffering. Most, if not virtually all, love relationships are based on a thinly or not-so thinly disguised basis of psychology mercantilism, if not outright economic dealmaking. Other higher pursuits: art, philosophy, philanthropy, so-called spiritual attainment are arguably better, but, really, are little more than panaceas not much different, in their ultimate purpose, than devoting one's life to developing the perfect tennis game, for instance. They absorb one's attention and distract one's focus from the pain &amp; dissolution to come, or even occuring, &amp; keep one, perhaps, from ending it all at the very moment. In this manner, we all buoy each other up, but for what? The question remains unanswered. Life is a concentration camp and we are all going to the gas chamber in the end. What do we do in the meantime. Is it worth it?Frankl, like any reasonably intelligent person, delineates the central problem well: Why live? But like every other professional philosopher or psychologist, he comes up with a reason (altho in this case the reason boils down to *find a reason*) because, well, what else is he going to do? The biological imperative compels us to go on with life at any price. The alternative: that there is no reason to do so--that is simply too terrifying to contemplate, would violate species survival, and be considered unpublishable. Just once I'd like to see a thinker have the courage to face the ultimate question and not flinch, escape to a flight of fancy, take a leap of *faith* or otherwise dissemble.Life is not worth living.

His approach to the human mind can be seen in the diction of his prose. Frankl does not intimidate his reader with convoluted explanations of the perplexing labyrinth that is our mind, but rather he speaks directly and clearly about the nature of experiencing everyday. Nor does he make his audience suffer by going into great gore and detail, but rather he makes his audience suffer in blatantly stating the facts of humanity. Like many of us, Victor Frankl does not have an answer to the \\"big questions\\" , but resolves that mans power over other beings is our ability to continue to question what we don't know-even if we never find the answer. The mirroring effect that the dual story-one of a Holocaust survivor, the other of a Psychotherapist-gives is theory the advantage of applicability. It is fascinating to see what experiences mold the mind of a man who studies the mind. To anyone interested in the nature of nature I greatly recommend this read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The original purpose-filled motivational book and a timeless masterpiece.Viktor Frankl was a Jewish neurologist, psychiatrist, and philosopher, whose work was interrupted by the advent of World War II.There are two sections to the English edition of this book. The first is an account of Viktor Frankl's experiences in four different concentration camps, (but often just referred to as Auschwitz).As a psychiatrist, he objectively analyzes the motivation and behaviors of everyone in the camps; prisoners and captors alike. Surprisingly, not all prisoners are \\"good\\", and not all captors are \\"bad\\".The second half of this book explains Logotherapy, defined as healing through finding meaning. It was dubbed the third Viennese school of psychotherapy. Rather than Freud's pleasure principle or Adler's power principle, Logotherapy is based on the principle that finding a meaning in one's life is the most important and powerful force for all human beings.\\"There is nothing in the world that can so much enable a person to overcome outer difficulties and inner troubles as the awareness of having a mission in life.\\"Is it possible to find meaning in the camps? Viktor claims meaning can be found in three ways; through love; through work or deeds; and through suffering. This book proves his theories.\\"Ever more people today have the means to live, but no meaning to live for.\\"This is the best book I have ever read, and re-read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book presents the whole spectrum of what a human being is capable of. From kindness to cruelty, from empathy to indifference to others, it is all there in Viktor Frankl's recollections of his concentration camp experiences. He is concerned with presenting the three stages that concentration camp prisoners go through, and what can be learned from those stages.The book consists of two parts. The first half deals with his experiences in the concentration camp. The second part deals with the form of psychotherapy that he created called Logotherapy.Every form of psychotherapy has a particular emphasis. For example, Rational Emotive Therapy emphasizes rational thinking as the key to improving mental health. In Viktor Frankl's Logotherapy, the emphasis is on the individual finding meaning in his or her life. To quote Dr. Frankl, \\"According to Logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.\\" There is no one ultimate abstract meaning of life, but very personal meanings of life. Dr. Frankl argues that even in the most difficult experiences that life can present to a person, that person can choose to find a meaning in that suffering. His life was a shining example of that truth.Here are a few reasons why I admire Dr. Frankl. He had the opportunity to emigrate to the United States, and thus be spared the concentration camp experiences, but chose to remain with his parents. He rejected the idea of \\"collective guilt.\\" He could have emigrated after the war to almost any country, but chose to stay in Austria and devote himself to the patients there. He could have been bitter, but he chose to be giving. Having lost all of his family, he married again. In short, he chose love and responsibility all along the way.The prisoners at the concentration camp were stripped of everything that gave them dignity. Each was assigned a number. Dr. Frankl's number was 119,104. I suspect that if a number could feel, then the number 119,104 would feel honored to have been assigned to such a one as Dr. Viktor E. Frankl."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl's narrative brings me face to face with Nazi concentration camp: the abhorring degradation of fellow human beings, mass murdering, barbaric treatment of prisoners. Yet, human souls were able to seek comfort in natural beauty in such unbearable existence. Ultimately the book is about triumph, particularly spiritual triumph despite all the suffering one went through. If a person can emerge from such experience: being stripped naked, taken away all possessing, being beaten and starved, doing harsh labor in the bitter winter, facing arbitrary death in every moment, later learned that his parents and wife were all killed in gas chamber, but coming out compassionate, forgiving and becoming a successful doctor and author (publishing 30 books afterwards), how can we not marvel at human resilience?The eventual survival of Frankl may be due to luck (not boarding the last train), his own social smart (avoiding offending prison guards, befriending the foremen), and kindness from fellow prisoners (extra bread saved, joint escape attempt). But it also crucially depended on his spiritual strength and holding on to the final hope. He called this search of \\"meaning of suffering\\". By assigning meaning to his suffering, he then would not fall prey to bitter disappointment when liberation did come at an expected date, while a fellow prisoner lost hope and died. In other words, Frankl found a way to maintain eternal hope. It is this hope enables him to stand strong despite any suffering or disappointment.In the last chapter, Frankl offered an invaluable explanation on logotherapy. Its methodology is enlightening, much similar to what Anthony Robbins has preached all along in his seminar. Humans need \\"meaningful goals\\" to feel happy.Each of us goes through life with unique experience. No one can repeat that experience for us. Even our suffering is unique. Thus the meaning of our life is put upon us instead of us searching for it. It is how we answer life, in our unique way.The bare truth of concentration camp, the honesty and the compassion deeply touches me. There is no self pity or hatred. Instead you experience a deep sense of beauty in this writing. All you feel is a much larger understanding for human existence and the ultimate triumph of human spirit.How can we feel despair when men endured and survived concentration camp? Even if the world problem is daunting, Frankl said, \\"the world may be in a bad state, but everything will become worse unless each of us does his best\\". As horrible as Nazi concentration camp is, Frankl lived to tell the story, to share his experience. All those who died did not die in vain. Ultimately goodness and justice, and human spirits triumph in this world."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book has information I hadn't seen anywhere else and the author interpreted his experience well. Frankl was sincere in his account and lucid explanation of the search for meaning. I intend to listen to this book (I got the CD format) many more times.Because there was so much information that was new to me, I really have to listen again. For example, Frankl said sensitive individuals tended to last longer in the concentration camp that less sensitive inmates. This is exactly the opposite of what I expected. The reason given is that sensitivity helped people to retreat to an inner spiritual life and thereby provided strength.Frankl's views on the importance of love stands out. He felt that it was the strongest force in our world and through it we would in a sense never really die. He discovered this in a time when he would talk to his wife while suffering in the camp. He had no way of knowing his wife had been killed already, and he felt her presence as if she were alive. To do this point justice, I'd have to quote Frankl verbatim and at length.One of the lasting impressions of the story and the interpretation has to do with the futility of trying to control one's fate as opposed to being true to one's innermost feelings. At several turns, Frankl would have perished if he had taken choices that seemed correct for purposes of survival and yet didn't feel right to him.I recommend this book to every one, because we all suffer since there is no escape from suffering."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I was given this book by my psychotherapist while I was suffering a deep and long-term depression. I cannot understate just how crucial this book was in helping overcome that depression. I realize that not everybody will have the same reaction to this book as I had, but I do sincerely believe that everyone's life can become at least slightly better after having read it. Dr. Frankl is not your average psychotherapist. In the book, he tries to explain the \\"existential vacuum\\" that he believes is the ultimate underlying cause of our mental neuroses. Frankl argues that the human creature needs a purpose or a meaning for which to live, otherwise he sinks into a deeply nihilistic, life-denying depression. This purpose or meaning is unique for each individual, and it can even change over time. Frankl believed that life was full of suffering and pain, and that quite often there is very little we can do to alleviate it - except to find a meaning or purpose that can help us to overcome it. Without a meaning or purpose in life, the individual would have little reason to get out of bed to face each day's challenges. Meaning overcomes suffering. Meaning defeats nihilism. That is the core message of Dr. Frankl's book. It is a message that I myself need to hear and learn in order to win the battle against my depression. It is also a message that I believe that many, many modern people need to hear and understand because we live in a world that is increasingly dominated by depression, apathy, and nihilism. \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" teaches us that we can create our own meaning in life - a meaning that is uniquely situated to us and the suffering that we individually struggle against. Out of the empty vacuum of existential nothingness, the human being can create his own meaning or purpose in life. Just because the universe or life itself may have no inherent meaning, we can still create meaning on our own. Indeed, Dr. Frankl says that this is the highest achievement to which the human being can aspire - to create his or her own meaning in life despite the suffering and emptiness of existence. Dr. Frankl's own life proves that this is so: he managed to create his own meaning in the death and concentration camps of the Holocaust. If the human being can create meaning there, then it is possible to do so anywhere. Dr. Frankl's own life experiences serve as evidence and testament to the truth of his ideas. The human being can create meaning and purpose no matter the suffering and torment that the universe throws at him. This is a very powerful and compelling message, in my opinion. But, do not take my word for it, read the book for yourself!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I was given this book by my psychotherapist while I was suffering a deep and long-term depression.

Without a meaning or purpose in life, the individual would have little reason to get out of bed to face each day's challenges. Meaning overcomes suffering. Meaning defeats nihilism. That is the core message of Dr. Frankl's book. It is a message that I myself need to hear and learn in order to win the battle against my depression. It is also a message that I believe that many, many modern people need to hear and understand because we live in a world that is increasingly dominated by depression, apathy, and nihilism. \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" teaches us that we can create our own meaning in life - a meaning that is uniquely situated to us and the suffering that we individually struggle against. Out of the empty vacuum of existential nothingness, the human being can create his own meaning or purpose in life. Just because the universe or life itself may have no inherent meaning, we can still create meaning on our own. Indeed, Dr. Frankl says that this is the highest achievement to which the human being can aspire - to create his or her own meaning in life despite the suffering and emptiness of existence. Dr. Frankl's own life proves that this is so: he managed to create his own meaning in the death and concentration camps of the Holocaust. If the human being can create meaning there, then it is possible to do so anywhere. Dr. Frankl's own life experiences serve as evidence and testament to the truth of his ideas. The human being can create meaning and purpose no matter the suffering and torment that the universe throws at him. This is a very powerful and compelling message, in my opinion. But, do not take my word for it, read the book for yourself!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Very easy read, not an easy topic, but it's message is profound. The gist of the book is, no matter your circumstances, you are responsible for your experience. That is singularly one of the most powerful truths. When we realize we are responsible for our lives and experiences, we will discover the gift of power. You want to have a happy productive life, create it. We are not the victims of our circumstances as Viktor Frankl writes, and if anyone realized that, it was Viktor Frankl. Do yourself a favor and read this book, then pass the book along to someone that will appreciate it's value."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Well, everyone knows this is a classic. It surely is a great (and very short) book. The first part of the book (\\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp\\") is not that easy to read. Great is its content and profound is its ideas, it is nevertheless slightly fragmentary - but given the fact that Dr Frankl wrote it in only nine successive days, and within months after his liberation from the camp, it is understandable; indeed this just adds to its authenticity. The second part of the book \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\", written presumably in 1962, is more organized, at least comparatively speaking. Some of the terms and even ideas might sound out-dated, but this surely does not diminish it greatness.His ideas are protean and not restricted to merely an unconditional \\"belief\\" in life's meaningfulness. In fact, as Dr Frankl reminded us, there is no such thing as a single and unified \\"meaning of life\\". This varies from person to person and vitally also changes from time to time even intra-personally. Everyone, because of his possession of self-determination (i.e. free will), has the responsibility to choose the right action and even more crucially the right ATTITUDE when dealt with a situation or a set of circumstances. It is because of this ultimate freedom, the freedom to choose, that man can retain his \\"meaning\\" and dignity under the most devastating catastrophe. In short, I quote Dr Frankl, \\"it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us\\" (note that he wrote this in 1945, sixteen years before JFK's inaugural speech). Implicit in the book, although hard to explain (and does it or can it be explained anyway?), is the importance of love (not self-love though) - a medical practitioner myself, I was honestly moved by his reliquishing the chance to escape because he could not bear abandoning his patients in the camp.The importance and the possibilty of freedom is illustrated by a very touching story of the SS commander of Dr Frankl's own camp who privately and secretly bought medicine \\"from his own pocket\\" for the inmates. It was even more endearing that right after the liberation of the camp, he was protected by his former Jewish immates.I cannot help but to finish this short review by quoting Nietzsche (whom in turn Dr Frankl quotes) - \\"He who has a WHY to live for can bear almost any HOW\\"."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"To find this book at the exact time I was struggling to find a reason for my life, to me, was no coincidence.This book, to use the cliche, changed my life. I came across it entirely by accident, looking for research material on Auschwitz.Frankl's philosophy, and basis for logotherapy, that man must have a meaning to his life is basic to human existence. We are shaped by the past, but we must live for the future.And I must comment on a previous review, you missed the point Frankl was making entirely, when telling the man who's wife had died about the reason for his experiencing pain. Try rereading that passage, and the entire book for that matter, because you are truly missing something that could change your life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is an important book if you are interested in human psychology, particularly in logotherapy. The book consists of three parts, the first is Dr. Frankls personal account of his survival at Auschwitz and other concentration camps. In the second part the author gives a concise summary of logotherapy (Def: It focuses on the meaning of the human existence and assists its patients to find meaning in their life.) and in the third and last chapter Frankl discusses \\"Tragic Optimism\\" and its usefulness.I found Dr. Frankls account of his time in Auschwitz very interesting, yet not as emotionally moving as accounts by other authors. I believe that's because the author focused his writings on the psychological aspect of the whole experience, thus giving it a more clinical and detached feeling. This actually proved to be helpful to the reader in understanding the theories of logotherapy.There were some really good insights in this book and I would like to quote the ones that I found to be most important:\\"Don't aim at success- the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's dedication or a cause greater than oneself or as a by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.\\"\\"Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!\\"I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the meaning of life and how to live a meaningful life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Dr. Frankl went through the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps. While many gave into despair and gave up their will to live, Frankl fought on to create some meaning from these horrible experiences. He believed that anything in life can be dealt with as long as we are able to find meaning in it.This book saved my life when I had lost everything I ever worked for. All my life I fought to be a champion. I got close to my dreams with national shows and sponsorship requests at 18, but I got severely injured.Doctors said I would need painkillers and Prozac for the rest of my life. They said I would never train again. I proved them wrong.After 2 grueling years, I got back to my peak and surpassed it at 20. Yet, in the finals of a grappling tournament, I got a severe injury that was supposed to have crippled me forever. I felt constant severe pain throughout my body.All the best doctors and therapists said I had no hope. I was doomed to lose the body that I worked all my life for. All my dreams, businesses, relationships, and meaning came from martial arts, fitness, and health. I sacrificed everything for my dreams, and now, everyone said my dream was dead. At times, I thought I should just die with my dreams.This book made me realize I always, always, had a choice. No matter what happens in our external circumstances, we can always decide our character.No one can take that away from us but ourselves.Now, 2 years and 30 doctors later, I found the most amazing doctors and masters who could heal me. They both showed me a new life and a new way that I never even dreamed possible. I learned about qi qong, tai chi, and bio-mechanics to cultivate the yin in my yang soul.I am healing, becoming stronger, bigger, and better than ever.The wound is the seed of our adult life; it is out of that wound that our adult life grows. In the shaman traditions, it was believed that a healer only got his powers from being wounded in battle. It was through that wound that the spirit of healing could enter. It was by healing oneself that one could heal others. You can look at your suffering and pain as disabilities, or as an ability to be a miracle, an inspiration, and a champion."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I bought this book because I was searching for yet another book on workplace bullying and another book came up in my search based on Frankl's book. I read the customer reviews on that book and one reviewer said something to the effect of, \\"If you want to read a book based on Viktor Frankl's opinion of how to get along at a bad work environment (like a Nazi death camp), why don't you just read Frankl's book?\\" So, that's where I started. I read it. Twice. Then I got out my computer and typed in passages that had meaning to me so I could re-read them during difficult times. I compressed the entire book down to about 10 pages, single spaced. I must admit that I consider myself a negative, often depressed sort of person, mostly because my work situation is so demoralizing. I was amazed by Frankl's coping mechanisms on how to get along in a difficult situation; every day meant multiple incidents of having to choose the correct path to avoid death or worse, making the choice to give up on your own life (suicide). He went through 5 years of that and lived to tell about it. It is a must read for everyone, particularly when you are having the hardest time of your life. I could tell that if I had read it as a college student, it wouldn't have the same meaning as now, when I am 50 and have had many ups and downs. I see everything at such a deeper level and appreciated this book so much more than I would have if I were younger. Briefly, the lessons in the book written 50 years ago still apply today. Here they are: Let luck be your guide. It's not what you know, it's who you know. Network with the equivalent of a one-step-up lateral (not your own) middle manager and they will help you when they can. Schmooze. Be kind to others. Don't complain, it doesn't help. You can't fix, deal with or appeal to a sadist, so don't try. Avoid sadists at all costs. Keep your mouth shut unless asked for your opinion and then be short and to the point. Praise, even when praise isn't deserved. Keep criticisms to yourself. Be inconspicuous. Work hard for the sake of doing a good job. Fantasize for escape. Everything can be taken away from you except for your past, so relish in it. When something good happens to you, write it down (keep a gratitude journal). Don't do anything that compromises your own values so you won't have regrets. Be careful who you abuse today because tomorrow they may be your master. You are not your job, your title or your position. You are a unique person loved by others. The only thing in life that really matters is the people you love and the people who love and need you. Love shared is eternal. Treat everyone with respect. The meaning of life is not what life can do for you, but what life expects of you; how you make the world a better place with your presence. The purpose of life is not happiness. The purpose of life is discovering what you can contribute to it. Save a slice of bread (or whatever is the only material thing that matters to you when there is nothing left) for later when you are really depressed and it's the only thing left that can get you through that difficult moment. (For me it's chocolate and a dark beer at the same time.) Apathy is the signaling of the beginning of the end of one's life. Everyone that you respect and look up to has human failings. Even tough guys cry. Suffering without purpose is meaningless. The larger the suffering, the bigger the lesson. There's lots more in the book for you to discover and it's an easy read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"From the perspective of a member in a culture consumed in the \\"existential vacuum\\", Frankl's experiences and logotheraphy discussion offers a call to action for those prepared to live a meaningful life. This book will change you."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is deceptively small, but incredibly deep, and probably unmatched anywhere in literature...(that I have ever read at least). The first part is a stark autobiography of Frankl's personal journey through the Holocaust. It is powerful, compelling and harrowing.. this story is now familiar, but Frankl tells it with immense compassion and dignity. A Google search reveals that this book has not been invited into a certain Holocaust museum (?), but one would assume it is because Frankl's philosophy, which he outlines in the second part of the book, which is borne from his personal search for meaning in the darkest days of WW2, achieved a transcendence of Self that went beyond the labelling of Jew and Nazi. I found his exposition of logotherapy fascinating, with golden threads of thought that I could unwind with more current day psychological schematas, such as those propounded in NLP and Psychosynthesis. As a primer on the theory of Existentialism and an introduction to existential therapy, which he helped to form, I would also thoroughly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book changed my life. I have purchased this book more times than I can remember to give to other people. The author has a way of stating things with a minimum of words. This is good for the reader because a library full of other books cannot begin to have the impact, in my opinion, of this book.Frankl does not seem to feel he is special or extraordinary is any way because he has survived his circumstances. He is kind to his readers. When I read this book I feel as though I am in his kind hands. I feel as though I am being taken care of.One thing I always remember from this book, and think about almost daily is something he writes about how we perceive other people. He writes that often we form an opinion about someone, and then later hear something about that person from someone else that is totally different. He says perhaps we think that someone is very bad, and then hear someone say that that person is very good. He goes on to remark that what made that person good had perhaps not happened to that person yet, when our opinion was formed. Before I make opinions about others now, I think that whatever I'm about to say that is critical, may have already changed. I think we would appreciate if others would do this for us."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl's journey and his amazing survival techniques in the Auschwitz death camps prove to be one of the most meaningful books ever written. If there was 1 book that everyone should read in their life this would be my choice. Forget all those meaningless self-help books on getting rich, getting in touch with your inner self and all that new age baloney that might enhance your life but if your life has no meaning, no foundation for growth than nothing will ever bring you true happiness. In the midst of our greatest struggles we learn our greatest lessons and a life without struggle is not a life with meaning."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"People have considered this book primarily a book about survival in inhuman conditions. But Victor Frankl got into those inhuman conditions because he did a decent, human thing; he honored his aged father and mother, instead of accepting the US immigration visa. He had a opportunity to participate in an escape attempt, but was moved with compassion by one of the sick prisoners in his care.Viktor Frankl considered his logotherapy to be basically humanistic, attempting to focus the patient's attention on the meanings he will fulfill in the future, the things he will create, the deeds he will do, the people he loves, the sufferings he will courageously endure. But a lot of logotherapists didn't have the God of Viktor Frankl inside them, the God who delivered Viktor from his narrow prison.Given that we have had other impositions of inhuman conditions since the book was written, such as the Killing Fields of Cambodia and the massacres in Rwanda, it would be useful for future editions to address these situations. Neither the foreword nor the afterword addressed these."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a must read for everyone! It is a look at the day to day experience of the Nazi death camps and it is soul grabbing. Frankl allows us to feel his experience and he shows how he and how we can choose to cope with suffering.

How we choose to experience the suffering and what we do with it when it has ended is what will make the difference in our lives today."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and he said he read it 5 times.

I also got the advice to read it from my therapeut and, yes, in the life-limit situation. I don't think it's because of it I'm still living, but it surely push bounds my knowledge a bit forward. I have red it for a second time during last days and understand a little more...it should be red for many times. Like in E. Fromm's &quot;To have or to be&quot;, there is no simple solution -- but it helpes you to find your own. Because you only need to know WHY and the remaining is so easy...(so read Nietzche also, he is full of vitality) From other people I could only take a little -- like I took from Tony Shue's review some months ago, when I was looking for this book. I know, I don't have to repay him or my psychologist or friends, known or unknown people which helped me, knowing or unknowing -- but I feel I should do the same for someone else, known or unknown, who might be in need of simple human touch. So I wrote it -- maybe this book is the touch you need."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In the first portion of this book, Dr. Frankl examines his experiences in concentration camps during the Holocaust from a psychological perspective. Even though I have never read this book before I have heard many of these stories already. The second, and I think more profound portion of the book, is about logotherapy. He describes what he terms \\"existential vacuum\\" as a lack of meaning in ones life. He attributes many psychological problems such as addiction and depression to this existential vacuum. He therefore treats psychological problems through logotherapy where he helps the patient find meaning. Frankl asserts that happiness cannot be found as long as we seek happiness but only when we find our meaning. I, however, was disappointed to find that Dr. Frankel does not tell us what the meaning of life is, but states that the meaning is different for different people and even different for the same person at different times. This relativistic view of the meaning of life seems somewhat arbitrary to me and therefore meaningless. He does, however, tell how a person can find their meaning through relationships and even through suffering."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Found this book to be insightful and meaningful.

I tend to only rate books as five-star when I come away feeling the experience has changed my life in a significant and positive way. Dr. Frankl's book is an inspiration, thought provoking, and life changing reminder that we always have choice and kindness and compassion always matter.As a communicator, Dr. Frankl was extremely eloquent and I found that as I was being led through his life experiences, thoughts, and perception, I was able to process his message for myself. Within the pages of this thought-provoking book, about a psychologist who was a prisoner in concentration camps during WWII, Frankl proposes spiritual liberation is possible within any experience, \\"everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms...to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\"This is one of those books that you keep on your shelf and reread from time to time. A very inspirational read, this short book is especially for those in search of life's meaning. The concepts flow logically and in a straightforward language. I recommend this book for everyone."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The outcome of many a debate is determined in advance by the opening presumption. For example, do we assume a proposition is correct and require evidence against or assume it is false and require evidence in favor?Viktor Frankl's genius consists of applying this principle to the question of the meaning of life. In MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING, he proposed that we should not demand meaning from life, but rather recognize that life demands meaning from us.More than that, since the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and even from hour to hour, what matters is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's particular life at a given moment. And from this it follows that each person has his own specific vocation in life and must carry out a concrete mission. In that special assignment he cannot be replaced.Even under the tyranny of the Nazi death camps, where Frankl was a prisoner for nearly four years (described in Part One of the book), or the Soviet Gulag, where almost everything could be taken from a man or a woman, Frankl insisted that one thing remained, the last of human freedoms: the ability to chose one's attitude under any circumstances.For me, reading MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING as a young man was a life-changing experience. It settled in my mind the question of determinism vs. free will. It established for me a working hypothesis that my life could be pulled by goals as well as pushed by drives. As Frankl points out, between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space lies our power to choose our response and in that choice lies our growth and freedom. In short, it doesn't matter what we expect from life but rather what life expects from us.In my opinion, MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING should be on the core reading list of every American who aims to preserve human freedom and dignity.NOTE: For anyone facing an existential crisis, I recommend Frankl's speech to fellow concentration camp inmates in the winter of 1944-1945, which can be found on pages 102-105 of the book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is the absolute best book that I have ever read.

The first is his own harrowing account of the time he spent in four concentration camps under Nazi occupation during WWII. The second is his introduction to logotherapy, which is his own psychological method for helping others cope with pain, guilt and death. It is the first part of the book, from his own perspective entitled 'Experiences in a Concentration Camp', that is the true heart of his story.His retelling of the concentration camp experience is so gripping because it is, for lack of a better word, so simple. So much inhumanity of the most heinous kind was endured, and yet some of these men and women clung to something deep within themselves and managed to survive. And not everyone had a choice. Some lives were taken without a chance of survival.The introduction to logotherapy is much more academic, but it's summary is basic: From within and outside of yourself, find that which gives your life meaning and focus upon that to carry you through your pain and suffering. This wisdom has been echoed by many, and putting it into practice may take considerable time and effort, but it is the truest form of living I have ever encountered."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"How can one triumph over tremendous and bitter evils? How can someone even survive the ongoing evil faced head-on in a Nazi concentration camp--in facing the violence, the inhumanity and the injustice, where to all appearances, sin seems to have taken the upper hand? How does one even find hope when caught up in the clutch of such crushing evil that can so easily cause others to throw up their hands in helpless defeat? Victor Frankl not only tells us, but shows us how it's done from first-had experience--from finding meaning in one's existence and those around you--from finding dignity in your life regardless of circumstances--from exercising that which stands seemingly above all human characteristics: human freedom, which gives us the ability to continue to steer our choices and direct our lives.Yes, he writes, wrote: \\"We who have lived in concentration camps can remember those who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from man but one thing, the last of the human freedoms--to choose one's own way.\\" Deprived of his own freedom, paradoxically, he kept his freedom. He continued his decision making. Revealing a profound insight into the reality of our existence, Frankl said, \\"Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.\\" He nonetheless exercised this unassailable supreme human ability while imprisoned under the most horrendous conditions. Accordingly, he maintained to always have the benefit of \\"the last of the human freedoms: to choose one's attitude in any given circumstance, to choose one's own way.\\" He acknowledges the immeasurable greatness of the human spirit, unyielding under the grip of overwhelming evil--insistent on the import and value of right resolve, in spite of all odds--on being fully who we are, regardless of fully inhumane treatment--and remaining fully alive.The book is a study in psychology, all to itself!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"If you are intrigued by human nature this is a book for you.

Unlike Hollywood depictions of camps, he shows what the inmates actually had to do in order to survive (they would do just about anything not to be on a \\"list\\") and he even shows the occasional humanity of some of the guards, even, amazingly, the final commandant of his camp.The second part of the book is a brief summary of Frankl's theories called logotherapy. I can't say I'm an expert on this; he published over 20 volumes on the subject. But what I read here is fascinating. In summary, he believes that man's search for meaning is his primary motivation, unlike Freudian psychology which teaches that man's search for pleasure is his primary motivation.I plan to reread this book regularly. Truly inspirational."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.\\" ~ Viktor Frankl from \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\"Viktor Frankl. He's unquestionably one of my heroes and this book is a must read (or re-read as the case may be). If you don't have it yet, it's time to get it. It's impossible to be a serious student of life and not soak up as much Frankl as you can.The man survived the horrors of Nazi concentration camps and, from that pain, brought the world his \\"Logotherapy\\"--a philosophy based on the fundamental precept that we have ultimate responsibility for choosing our responses to any given challenge AND equally powerful responsibility to determine how we will give ourselves to the world and create a truly meaningful life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a terrific book about the meaning of Life. However, it is tough reading! You'll find yourself re-reading many passages just to understand the subtleness of the author. It will have a profound effect on anyone searching for some meaning to their lives. Warning: it is sometimes depressing, but enlightening."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Easy to read, full of good thought provoking content, this book has three parts to it: in part one Viktor Frankl discusses how everyday life in a concentration camp affected the mind of the average prisoner.Having been a concentration camp prisoner himself he speaks of his own experience and observations. He postulates that the search for meaning and the belief in meaning to one's life (and suffering) is what keeps us going or makes us give up. He explains how we can find meaning in our life. There's no meaning for everybody but our individual actions give meaning to our life.In part two he sketches out his own approach to psychotherapy which he called logotherapy. And in part three he explains the term tragic optimism.Part 3 seemed a cling-on to me. As if the publisher felt that the book wasn't long enough without some more material. Several statements from parts one and two are repeated and very little is added to the value of the book in my opinion.That notwithstanding I couldn't but be humble and thoughtful after reading parts one and two. How anybody can survive the horrors of a concentration camp and then live a life of compassion for others is in itself so noteworthy to me that I cannot but pay attention to what such a person has to say. Frankl's emphasis on action (creating a work or doing a deed and experiencing something or encountering someone) and attitude (especially towards suffering) to find fullfillment and give meaning to your life and his disdain of finding the same in introspection/meditation leaves me to contemplate my own beliefs in this regard. Maybe the next book I read will help me decide which way I tend to lean."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl's journey and his amazing survival techniques in the Auschwitz death camps prove to be one of the most meaningful books ever written. If there was 1 book that everyone should read in their life this would be my choice. Forget all those meaningless self-help books on getting rich, getting in touch with your inner self and all that new age baloney that might enhance your life but if your life has no meaning, no foundation for growth than nothing will ever bring you true happiness. In the midst of our greatest struggles we learn our greatest lessons and a life without struggle is not a life with meaning."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book has always been one of my favorites.

What more can I say than its an excellent book?"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Of all the \\"maven\\"/talking heads\\" that appear on TV and radio,I have always considered the most spaced out to be the various categories of shrinks.The one exception who easily comes to mind is Victor Frankl(1905-1997) who founded 'logotherapy' which he distinguishes from psycoanalysis with,\\"Now in logotherapy the patient may remain sitting erect but he must hear things which sometimes are very disagreeable to hear(p.104).\\"And Frankl brings a strong moral basis to his 'therapy' largely based on lessons learned during the three years he was imprisoned in Aushwitz;in his forward,Frankl,who had a visa to leave his native Austria,decided to stay with his parents,influenced by a piece of marble his father managed to salvage from a representation of 'The Ten Commandments' from Vienna's largest synagogue which the Nazi's destroyed.The salvaged piece of marble was from The Commandment 'To Honor Your Mother and Father'(p.13).But,with one sentence Frankl shatters all the nonsense coming from \\"mavens\\" and modern culture:\\"...From this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world,but only these two-the \\"race\\" of the decent man and the \\"race of the indecent man\\"(p.94)."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"People go through different obstacles in life, some good and some bad. Individuals who experience the worst of life sometimes come to an ending point and have no hope,nowhere to run and simply give up. Those who experience the good come to an ending point and try to understand their meaning in life, but come to find they don't know where to begin on their search. It's like they lost themselves on their journey and are only left with a blank to fill in. Everyone at some point in their lifetime need to realize what their meaning in life is and how to mold themselves into the person they truely are and not into who they have falsely become.Viktor Frankl has done just this. In his book he talks of his life as a young adult surviving a concentration camp horror. He also talks of his life after Auschwitz, and the other camps, and how he overcame the many hard and terrifying obstacles the concentration camps laid before him. He talks of his strengths, his weaknesses and his miraculous survival during those long, dreadful years of brutality and dehumanization.After reading this book I was so amazed to find how Frankl could take a bad experience and turn it into a success. He founded his own Logotherapy which he lectures at many worldwide universities and conventions. Overcome by so many things, Viktor found his own meaning in life through the concentration camps. He talked of taking one day at a time, not as if it was his last, but as if it was a new beginning. He always spoke the truth about his situation to himself and to his fellow prisoner's. He never tried to deny the situation he was put in, but to deal with it in his own therapeutic way. Even when the other's gave up hope and turned down the path towards suicide, Viktor kept his head high, stayed smart and always hoped for a brighter day, even though he knew the gas chambers were only seconds away.Never once in Man's Search for Meaning did Frankl contradict himself on the points he was trying to get across to the reader. He always stayed true to his own psychology and his own beliefs even at the hardest of times. All of the evidence he gave throughout the book clearly explained his journey for his meaning in life.Left with no one but himself, Viktor found ways to deal with his tremendous mound of emotions and grief even when he felt like the end was near and he was slowly losing hope until the final days. In the midst of mental and physical torment frankl always decided at the end of each day that he was going to live to see freedom and the outside world surrounding him in the camp.Viktor clearly explained his views in such a profound and meaningful way throughout his entire book. In the end it all came down to one point the clearly sticks with me after reading his story:Searching for a meaning in life can sometimes be hard and done in so many ways, whether your in a good situation or a bad one. You can either strive for that meaning or you can fall with those around you and never come to find what your life has in store."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Profound truths learned from real life experiences...

In this book, the author not only describes his experiences as a survivor of Auschwitz, but he sets out a premise and philosophy for life, and in this actually answers in concrete terms the question posed by the many as to the meaning of life. I have copied and pasted my notes on this book below for you, in hopes that it will give you a feel for the book. I HIGHLY recommend this book:Life holds a potential meaning under any conditions, even the most miserable ones.Even in a position of utter desolation, where no expression is possible in positive action, achievement is still possible in enduring suffering in an honorable way and fulfillment can still be achieved through loving contemplation of the image one carries in his heart of his beloved.A human being is not completely and unavoidably influenced by his surroundings. There is human liberty in every circumstance. Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, an independence of mind, even in the bleakest of circumstances.Those who lived through the concentration camps often recall the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but even one individual would offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing- the last of the human freedoms- the ability to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.Dostoevski once wrote \\"There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.\\"In difficulty lies the chance for man either to make use of or forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that only a difficult situation can afford him. When faced with difficulty, man can either choose to forget his self respect and dignity and turn himself into an animal or he can remain dignified, brave, and unselfish. It is in this decision that he determines whether he is or is not worthy of his sufferings.But difficulties are not found only inside the concentration camp. Everyday offers us the opportunity to make a decision- the decision as to whether you will or will not submit to those powers which threaten to rob you of your very self, of your values.If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. For suffering is an inescapable part of life, even as death. The way in which a man accepts his fate and whatever suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, always gives him ample opportunity, regardless of circumstance, to add a deeper meaning to his life.Man can either make a victory of difficult experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or he can ignore the opportunity and become an animal among life's miseries.Do not think that such aspirations are unworldly and too far removed from real life. Though it is true that only a few people are capable of reaching such high moral standards, and that of the prisoners in camp, only a few were able to keep their full inner liberty and obtain those values which their suffering afforded- it is also equally true that even one such example is sufficient proof that man's inner strength can raise him above his outward fate.Former prisoners, when writing or relating their experiences, agree that the most depressing influence of all was that one could not know how long his term of imprisonment would be. The prisoner had been given no date for his release. As such, a prison sentence was not only uncertain but also unlimited. Life in a concentration camp has often been referred to as a \\"provisional existence.\\" We can add to this by defining it as a \\"provisional existence of unknown limit.\\"New arrivals usually knew nothing about the conditions of camp. Those who had come back from other camps were obliged to keep silent and from some camps no one had returned at all. Upon entering camp, a change began to take place in the minds of the men. With the end of uncertainty came the uncertainty of the end. It was impossible to foresee whether or when, if at all, this form of existence would end.A man who could not see the end of his \\"provisional existence\\" was not able to aim at an ultimate goal in life. As such, he ceased living for the future and only looked backwards. In turn, the whole structure of his inner life changed and signs of decay set in.A man who let himself decline because he could not see any future often found himself occupied with retrospective thoughts. There was a tendency to look to the past to somehow make the present less real. But in becoming retrospective, there laid a certain danger: Everything in the present and going forward suddenly became pointless.The prisoners who declined did not view camp's difficulties as an opportunity to develop inner strength, but instead only despised life as something of no consequence. Life for such people became meaningless and soon they lost their will to live.Because of this effect, any attempt at fighting environmental influences had to aim at giving the prisoner inner strength by pointing out to him a future goal to which he could look forward.He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future. Man lives not in the present but only either in the future or the past.The prisoner who saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, was soon lost. The typical reply with which such a man rejected all encouraging argument was \\"I have nothing to expect from life any more.\\"What was needed was a fundamental change in our attitude towards life. We had to learn ourselves and furthermore, we had to teach other despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what mattered was what life expected from us.We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to see ourselves as those who were questioned and our answers had to consist in right action and right conduct.In this, the meaning of life ultimately lies in taking the responsibility to find the right answers to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. As these tasks differ from man to man, the meaning of life differs from man to man. Questions about the meaning of life can never be answered by sweeping statements. Life does not mean something vague, but something very real and concrete, just as life's tasks are also very real and concrete, and a man's willingness to fulfill them is what determines his destiny.Let us now consider what we can do if a person asks what the meaning of life is. I doubt that a doctor can answer this question in general terms for the meaning of life differs from man to man. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life. To put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to the chess champion: \\"Tell me, master, what is the best move in the world?\\" There simply is no such thing as the best or even a good move apart from a particular situation in a game. The same holds for human existence. One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific purpose in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Each situation in life represents a unique challenge to man and presents a problem for him to solve. As such, the question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed. Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is questioned. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.Logotherapy tries to make the patient fully aware of his own responsibleness; therefore, Logotherapy leaves it to the patient to answer for what, to what, or to whom he understands himself to be responsible. It does not provide answers but merely assists by asking the right question."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Thanks to one of my psychology professors, I was introduced to a book by Victor Frankl that is about what he went through in the concentration camps in Germany during WWII and how he survived. He talks about his beliefs on psychology, his forms of therapy on helping patients, and on how even the worst of life's events made him want to keep living and continue to be a good and strong man. He reminds me of what many of my friends and family members have had to go through. They all make my problems look stupid and ridiculous. The book also helps me to appreciate life, what you have, and who you have.

Yet, the overall message of this book is wonderfully exhilarating. Whatever meaning you find in your life is your life. If that meaning gives you hope, you will have hope. If that meaning gives you despair, you will find despair. This is a fantastic piece of existential work! The whole idea in this book reminds me a bit of the concept of the self-system in Toru Sato's genius book &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot;. Now &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; is a much newer book but it is another truly excellent book that takes these things one step further by integrating these ideas with the psychology of relationships as well as transpersonal experiences.

The first of which is a real life experience about being in a concentration camp in World War II. The second analyzing what went on and how he used his knowledge to help himself and others. He breaks down how many people acted and reacted to the gruesomeness of what he saw in the camps. He says that there are three stages of the mind in the concentration camp. The first being when you first get there, second being when you get into the work schedule, the third being when you get released. The first revolves around realizing that life is over, as you know it to be. The second is just a repetition of doing and putting up with what the German soldiers and Capo do to them. The third revolves to being numb to happiness and not being able to be happy because everything and everyone you knew was gone. This reaction was caused by being in a deep depression or posttraumatic stress disorder. He describes helping people to find hope for something, a will to live. In the second part of the book he describes that the meaning of life for anyone person changes at any point in time. That we need to find our own meaning and that he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.I loved the first part of the book about his personal experiences but failed to understand most of the second half of the book. I would recommend this book to everyone who is looking for a meaning in life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl presents the horrendous conditions of Auschwitz with the matter-of-fact tone of a sympathetic but objective observer, much like a clinician who cares deeply about his patients but does not allow his emotions to interfere with his analysis. He shows the reader a wide range of human behavior under extreme duress, including examples of the best and worst in our nature. It is hard to imagine anyone reading this first part, his condensed description of surviving the death camps, without being moved, without becoming deeply thoughtful, even stunned, in the face of man's inhumanity to man, and conversely of what it can mean to be truly human.The book continues with Frankl describing his philosophy of psychiatric treatment, &quot;logotherapy&quot;, that is, therapy based on discovering meaning in one's life. Based in large part on his observations in the camps, Frankl developed a method of treating depression which rejected the Freudian approach of dwelling on the past, wallowing in childhood traumas, in favor of focusing on the future, discovering personal meaning in one's present context. The idea of proper context is important here. Frankl enjoins against the notion of a One True Meaning of Life. The analogy he uses is that of asking the chess grand master, &quot;What is the best move in the world?&quot; It's an absurd question as it stands, of course, as every move must be evaluated in light of a particular game, the current layout of pieces, the personalities and strategies of each player, etc. Similarly, the constellation of meanings that lend our lives substance and power can very well change over time. The content of the answer is not as important as asking the right question: &quot;For me, in this place, at this time, what gives or can give my existence the most meaning?&quot; [that's a paraphrase, not a quote] Acting always in accordance with the honest answer to this question is, in Frankl's view, the most sustainable route to happiness throughout our lives."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is life changing.

There is so much to learn from what he teaches. You will never think or act the same way again."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The book was selected because of its listing in &#34;must read&#34; books. It is in fact two books with the first being his Concentration Camp survival story and the second about Logotherapy. The former is an incredible story of survival with perhaps a significant amount of sheer luck. What shocked me was the manipulation aspects of controlling prisoners by their own and the absolute lack of respect for life. I could not help thinking that many unpalatable incidents were left out of the book. I was not disappointed in the author's desire to show that survival was closely linked to having a meaning in life or positive attitude. Frankl did not wallow in pity, bitterness and was factual in his account during those dark years.The Logotherapy analysis did use jargon and technical terms. However, I was impressed with the argument of not digging into the past to solve all problems. More could have been done to highlight differences to Freud and Adler. Selected case studies did help.For any person wallowing in self-pity this book is a must read.

The second part is more targetted towards psychologists or psychiatrists and can get a bit dense."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"What makes \\"Man's Search For Meaning\\" such an enduring masterpiece, and, if such can be said, my preferred literary rendering of the holocaust experience, is that Frankl is able to concretely draw out meaningful truth and positive prescriptions for action from the deepest declivity of despair. Other works, including the deservedly revered \\"Night\\", give way at points to nihilism, cynicism, and bitterness, understandable in such devastation, but noticeably absent in Frankl's response. The humanity with which Frankl transcends the total assault he endures is more than laudable - and is the enabling and empowering turn in his destiny.\\"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\" (86)\\"Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him - mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp. Dostoevski said once, \\"There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.\\" These words frequently came to mind after I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whose suffering and death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost\\" (87)\\"But not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.\\" (88)These are the ultimate lessons - the wisdom, which in fact, can only emerge from the crucible of such suffering. Who is more deserving of our respect and attention than those who endured a challenge which so few survived to report? The wisdom articulated in this book is thus rare as it is hard-won, and we, the more fortunate, should heed the contents of this slender, accessible, and powerful record."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"After years of hearing others praise this book, I finally read it for myself, and found it is worth reading! Dr. Victor Frankl, an author-psychiatrist, experienced first-hand the horrible atrocities that were forced upon the Jews in Nazi Concentration Camps, and lived to tell about it. He shares the truths he learned as a prisoner, including man's search for meaning in life, and his ability to survive extreme physical and emotional hardships, despite the odds. In the process he developed a new approach to psychotherapy, known as \\"logotherapy.\\" At the root of the theory is the value of helping others find their unique purpose or mission in life.What was the key to the survival in the Nazi death camps? It wasn't survival of the fittest in the traditional sense of those who were the most physically robust of the human species. Rather it tended to be those individuals, described below, who found inner survival strength as follows:(1.) Those who had a meaning in life, a sense of purpose, or intent to accomplish a goal. It was Dr. Frankl's desire to survive the death camps so that he could write and publish his experiences and truths learned through his suffering.(2.) Those who had a spiritual belief in God and a faith that there was a divine plan for them. They believed God would help them through their difficulties. Dr. Frankl said: \\"In spite of all the enforced physical and mental primitiveness of the life in a concentration camp, it was possible for spiritual life to deepen.\\"(3.) Those who had an intellectual life to fall back on (in their thoughts) during the monotonous, strenuous, and most painful times of endurance. He states: \\"Sensitive people who were used to a rich intellectual life may have suffered much pain... but the damage to their inner selves was less. They were able to retreat from their terrible surroundings to a life of inner riches and spiritual freedom.\\" This was something their oppressors were not able to take away from them.(4.) Those who held on to the cherished bonds of loved ones. Dr. Frankl often found strength by carrying on imagined conversations with his beloved wife who had been taken to another death camp. His ability to communicate his love for her in his thoughts, and receive back her love, gave him the incentive to hold on to life during the toughtest of times. Unfortunately his wife was not able to survive, but he didn't know this at the time. (Perhaps it was her Spirit he was communicating with afterall.)I was impressed with the description Dr. Frankl gave of a few of the prisoners, who despite being in a starving and sickly state, managed to go around offering aid and moral encouragement to others. Such individuals often gave of their meager piece of daily bread to keep another fellow prisoner alive. Such selfless service in the face of death, was truly admirable.In the second half of Dr. Frankl's book he distinguishes the difference between his theory of logotherapy and that of traditional approaches to physcho-analysis. At the core of his theory is the challenge to help individuals discover for themselves their reason for being, even a worthwhile goal. He quotes Nietzche who said: \\"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.\\" Dr. Frankl says: \\"The meaning of life always changes, but it never ceases to be.\\" This book can be a great resource for readers to evaluate their own purpose in life, and perhaps in the process choose a path that is worthwhile not only to them but that will benefit others as well."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"My copy of Viktor E. Frankl's book is dog-eared through constant re-reading. Never has such a short book had such a long-reaching effect on my life. The story of his survival against formidable odds in Nazi concentration camps may be compared with other great survival stories and stories of people with extraordnary handicaps who make their lives a resounding success. I never understood how they did it. And now I know and I feel inspired because I know. They gave their lives meaning, and worked on that every waking moment. Some aspects of logotherapy do, as one reviewer notes, sound a bit like reverse psychology. But if it works, who cares about the label? I'm cynical about self-help books and self-styled gurus but Dr Frankl and his book don't even belong in that genre. The Los Angles Times is right: &quot;If you read but one book this year, Dr Frankl's book should be that one&quot;."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I wish I had read this book earlier in my life.And, I can see that this will be just the first time that I have read it--I am going to be reading this book at least once a year, I want to re-visit it frequently. It will be a classic for me.For me, the first power of this short book is his narrative of survival in the concentration camps. What he witnessed and reports has its own power, but when he compounds it with an interpretation, that is, a search for meaning, Frankl's book has resounding merit. The second power is his development and explication of logotherapy. Freud advanced the theory that it was sublimated urges that drove the individual; Adler advocated that it was the individual's will to power that moved one; but Frankl's logotherapy is a theory searching for meaning--life needs to be interpreted. The individual lives and suffers now and in the past, but for the future, striving to be a better person, one must find a meaning, a 'why,' in order to change.Frankl's psychotherapy school of thought, I'm sure, has its detractors. I don't care about that. What I care about is the singular wisdom, tested in the fire, of his narrative. My spirit and my soul are still reverberating."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"OverviewThis book is divided into two sections. The first is a 100+ page autobiographical story of VF's experience in Nazi concentration camps, mixed with his observations on the nature of suffering and how a person can endure suffering if he/she can find meaning in it. The second is a discussion of \\"logotherapy\\" - essentially VF's rebuttel to psychoanalysis. In a nutshell he asserts that most people don't need psychoanalysis, but rather they need to understand that existential angst is \\"normal\\" and they need to find meaning in their lives and to know that their struggles have value.The Good:It's short and to the point and forgoes overly gruesome discussions of concentation camp horrors. VF looks at the events objectively, for the purpose in redeeming them per se - i.e. to learn lessons rather than to cast judgement. The message is profound and valuable: that our suffering has value and that we can bear up under our suffering if we find meaning in our lives.The Bad:As short as the book is I actually found it a bit boring and repetitive. And I found his approach myopic - he just keeps restating his idea that finding meaning in suffering and in life is the answer to psychological problems.The Ugly:While witholding judgement of the Nazi's, VF actually seems to subtly judge those prisoners who \\"gave up\\", sort of implying that they had failed because they could not find a reason to live.Overall I found it worth reading, but perhaps I found it old hat because I've read a lot previously on the subject of suffering and meaning and it didn't break any new ground for me personally. I can see how others would find it quite eye opening and inspirational. : )"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have been inspired by this book for 20 years. There is a reason it is still selling so well. It is not only a great first-hand account of life in Hitler's concentration camps, but Frankl takes this worst of all circumstances and transforms it into a purposeful, meaningful, even enriching experience. If he can do that with THOSE circumstances, what can we do with ours! As the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, I am an expert on what kind of writing meaningfully imacts a reader. Frankl's book is about as good as it gets!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have read many books on what the Jewish people and others went through during their life in the concentration camps and after. Dr. Frankl has given us an excellent insight into the during and after life of the concentration camps. He has also expressed his logotherapy and existence therapy in such a way even the layperson can readily understand. It is a book I highly recommend for all."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I was originally attracted to this book on the recommendation of syndicated radio talk show host Dennis Prager, who characterized it as \\"one of the best ten books ever written.\\" I'm not sure that I would agree with this statement, but agree that in the massive history of book publication, in certainly ranks within the first one thousand.Victor Frankl was a WWII concentration camp survivor and founder of the third Viennese school of psychotherapy, namely \\"logotherapy.\\" (The first, of course being classic Freudian psychoanalysis, and the second the Adlerian variation of this).The book is divided into two parts. In the first part, Frankl relates his experiences as a concentration camp inmate, and the internal psychological devices he used and taught to other inmates to cope with it. Even a non-psychologist would be interested in it, especially those who perceive themselves to be suffering unjustly (such as any jail inmate). These ideas later coalesced into a separate school of psychotherapy, logotherapy. The second section of the book is apted referred to by the author as \\"logotherapy in a nutshell.\\"I would characterize this book as one which you would want to read sometime before you die. It is concise and relatively short (179 pages in my paperback edition), and is thus a relatively fast read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I look with awe and reverence at those who have survived Auschwitz and similar death camps and am amazed beyond belief at how they managed to survive not only physically, but emotionally. I do not believe any amount of psychology could fully prepare one for the horrors inflicted on the survivors of such attrocities. Both my parents fought for their country overseas during the World War II and I heard, first hand, of stories that touch, horrify and will remain with me for a lifetime.Dr. Frankl developed an approach to psychotherapy known as, logotherapy. At the core of his theory is the belief that man's motivational force is reaching for meaning. While this book is not one that could be described as enjoyable reading, there is something about the author's experiences that will remain with us long after the book has concluded. Frankl gives meaning to life, despite life's suffering, and in a thought-provoking manner leaves a lasting impact on the reader that could well change the path of direction you choose to follow and how you continue to live your life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The author was sent to Auschwitz. After a while, disgust, horror and pity went numb; you could not feel them anymore. Apathy was the second stage: a \\"protective shell\\" to preserve one's life. Under-nourishment, absence of sexual urge came third. Thus, he began to reconstruct the manuscript he lost in the disinfection chamber. People with intellectually rich life were able to retreat \\"within,\\" away from their terrible surroundings. Love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Salvation of man through love and in love (p. 57) He answered YES to the question of the ultimate purpose of existence (p. 60). Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even under tremendous stress. Outside influences are not the only cause of a person's behavior. Only the men who allowed their inner hold on their moral and spiritual selves to subside, eventually fell victim to the camp's degenerating influence (p. 90). Any prisoner who lost faith in the future was doomed: to let go of the spiritual hold on life, caused one to die. Frankl's views truly turn Maslow's hierarchy upside down (this suggestion of mine used to send my former fiancee into fits of rage, who loved Maslow's view because it \\"justified\\" her lack of control in her life and her innate inability to grow spiritually and mentally)."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"For a long time, I'd heard about this book and seen it quoted by other authors. I finally realized that if so many great writers and speakers were familiar with it, I should be too. It is definitely a must read. It is in my personal top 10 list of all time. Frankl's revelations and wisdom from his horrifying experience will intrigue and amaze you. This book will be underlined, highlighted, and dog-earred. I promise.Gene Jennings, Author of Timely Words"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is one of those book that has to be read. \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is actually in two parts. The first part is Frankel's experiences in various concentration camps during WWII. The anecdotes are deeply disturbing while it gives an insight how someone can survive the horrors of the times. It is these experiences that the second part of the book relies upon.The second part of the book is what Frankel describes as logotherapy. Frankel's hypothesis and his psychotherepic practice after the war is based on the premis that man's life needs to have meaning. He uses the story of various prisoners trying to survive another day including not smoking the last bit of a cigarette because that was the reason to continue until the next day. He notes that everybody in the camp would know when a prisoner was going to die because they gave up the will to live.This is not an easy read and it is not an indepth study of logotherapy. What it is is a very concisly written book on both the horrors of prison camp and the development of a fascinating therapy developed from part of these experiences. It is interesting to note that he turned a horror into a benefit to mankind. For that development, this is alone worth reading. Highly Recommended"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have read few books that contain as much wisdom in as few pages as Frankl's &quot;Man's Search for Meaning&quot;. As a professional psychologist, Frankl's unique point-of-view within the Nazi concentration camps allowed him to observe phenomena that others would have missed. The theories that he refined while imprisoned, termed &quot;logotherapy&quot; (meaning-therapy) are a wonderful way a looking at ourselves and our problems. Logotherapy focuses on the importance of finding meaning in our lives and our activities - the very factor that Frankl noted was the most valuable in surviving the camps.I cannot give a higher recommendation from this book. It is profound, moving, informative - and under two-hundred pages. Without a doubt it is worth the handful of hours required to read it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the most compelling book I have ever read. I was a student at Gonzaga University at the time I read it as part of a religious studies class.The diary that Victor Frankl kept (which he could have been severely punished for if ever discovered) are a tribute to the very essence of man's desire to survive under any conditions.I have lost my copy to loaning it to someone who forgot that I loaned it to them, and I am going to order a copy for my wife to read. EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Once, in our lives, we've all read or heard about the facts of the Holocaust-the pain and suffering from famine, disease, unsanitation, and the mistreatment of Jews. Viktor E. Frankl, the author of Man's Search for Meaning, depicted his experience of the concentration camps and allowed what he called, an \\"outsider\\" to look in at the pain and suffering that he experienced. The first part of his book discussed his experiences at the concentration camps. It amazed me that even though he suffered a great deal, he managed to overcome his suffering in a comical way at times. During his time at the concentration camps he used nature as an example, and of course, the love that he had for his wife, to allow him to not only overcome his suffering, but made him much appreciative and he paid much more attention to these things than he ever did before. He allowed me to accept sorrow, pain, and suffering, things that we, as people, try to stay away from. As each and everyone of us do at a point and time in our lives, we experience the lost of a loved one or a tragedic event that occured in our life. How do we move on? How do we get over such a thing? In this book, Frankl tries to understand two things: how can one see or determine their meaning of life after an experience like he had? After years of mistreatment, will life be better?The second part of the book was split into two parts: \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\" and \\"The Case of Tragic Optimism\\", which answered his question about the meaning of life. He states that lopotherapy focuses on the meaning of human existence as well as on man's search for such a meaning. The meaning of one's life differs from man to man. Frankl used logotherapy not only on himself, but on the other prisoners as well. He, along with lopotherapy, help prisoners to realize that despite their present hardships, they will know what their purpose is and the meaning of their lives, and lopotherapy allowed them to have a different perspective on life.This book was not only amazing, but the illustrations of his experiences were so surreal, to the point that I could almost visualize being there. It has uplifted me and taught me that the meaning of my life will be defined, no matter what obstacle, trial, or tribulation may come my way during my life time. Very hope-filling and uplifting! Definitely, a book, promising not to let you down!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book has motivated me to completely change my lifestyle. Henceforth I intend to be involved in worthwhile projects."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor E. Frankl, as you've read in other reviews, is a holocaust survivor. In Man's Search for Meaning Frankl takes his experiences in concentration camps and translates them into a theory for therapy. His personally developed therapy, logotherapy, strives to help mankind overcome nuerosis by applying meaning to one's life experience, including (if not especially) a person's suffering. It is stated over and over again in Frankl's book that if a man can be shown a why, he can endure almost any how. This isn't really a new idea. However, Frankl goes one step further by helping people to see meaning and dignity in their suffering. Indeed, the preface of the book starts out with the line ' Dr. Frankl, author-psychiatrist, sometimes asks his patients who suffer from a multitude of torments great and small, \\"Why do you not commit suicide?\\".' What an opening line! What a question! Why does a suffering person not commit suicide? Are they living for a minor child, to finish a project, because their religion forbids suicide? Whatever the reason is, Frankl suggests that while that reason does not necessarily eliminate the suffering, a person's recognition of the dignity of their suffering can give them the will to go on.While this book is not light reading, and does occasionally get a tad repetitive, it has such a wonderful message and packs so much into such a short space, that I highly recommend that everyone get a copy and read it. I was lent a copy by a friend and now I plan to get a copy for several people who I know. It's just wonderful."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Disclaimer: I am not a psychologist, simply a student who had a couple of psychology courses. Therefore my knowledge of the complex field of psychology is admittedly not expert, and my opinions are based on my experiences (as, I may add, all persons are), not how the world may be for an expert in the field. That being said, this is my review.The world of psychology today seems to be dominated by Freudian theories and thinking. This is pervasive. For a student it is drilled into your head that your actions and beliefs are based on what your parents have done to you, and you are at the will of your primitive urges, versus your upbringing. For me, however, this theory never worked well for me. It takes the concept of free will out of the equation, which has bothered me immensely.Reading Frankl's \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" therefore was quite refreshing. It opened up a new theory of psychology that is not commonly referenced in (at least introductory) psychology courses. The logic of Frankl's arguments, coupled with personal experiences for authority, provided me a better psychological explanation that Freudian psychology ever could. The beauty of Frankl's school of thinking, \\"logotherapy\\", provides a viable alternative to the cold, almost mechanical Freudian school of thinking.In addition to introducing a beautiful school of thinking, \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" has the added benefit of being an enjoyable read. Where as most other psychology books read like a text book, making the average reader bored stiff, \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" reads quickly, logically, and despite the horrifying accounts of holocaust atrocities, is a very enjoyable read.It is a shame that the academic psychological community doesn't have much regard for the theories of Frankl. In short, \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is a breath of fresh air, recommended for anyone who is sick of being force-fed Freudian theories."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is the most influential book I have read.

However, in Viktor E. Frankl's autobiographical book, A Man's Search for Meaning, Frankl reveals how he and his family were treated within the horrific confines of concentration camps. Regurgitating the trauma, Frankl reveals that the only way he made it through was by searching himself for a meaning in life. He illustrates how this drive to discover his purpose in life kept him alive through the hellish five years. In the second half of his book, Logotherapy in a Nutshell, Frankl describes the therapy of 'searching for a meaning' that he used on himself during survival of the concentration camps. Each person has his or her own meaning in life, Frankl states, a meaning different than anyone elses. He gives counts of his performance of logotherapy. Specifically, he may ask a depressed patient, \\"Why don't you commit suicide?\\" Through techniques like this, he shows not only real-life patients, but also the reader, that there really is a meaning in life.Personally, this book was one of the best self-theraputical books I have ever read. Frankl's perserverence through life's most gruesome and wearisome hardships is amazing. Through it all, he has used this book to press readers like myself to search deep within the soul. Easy to read, I literally finished this book in an hour. Although I never feel that I'll forget the lessons learned, I am going to the bookstore to purchase this book for any future melancholy I might face. I recommend this book to anyone will give an hour for bright enlightenment."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a small book with a big subject - life and meaning - written in 1946 and first published in 1959.

He originally wanted to be an anonymous author; however, his friends persuaded him to publish under his own name to give the book credibility. Readers could therefore also understand this is a psychiatrist's objective view of suffering, which is part of life, and why life and hope prevail in the darkest moments.Part One, Experiences in a Concentration Camp is key to all he learned on the meaning of life. The horrible losses and inhumanity are seared into your mind, but when Dr. Frankl looks at the horror with educated eyes, he recognizes courage, objectivity and responsibility as vital for survival. This is a story of a man who was sent to the concentration camp with a belief that if he had to suffer and die, it would be significant: he would not suffer nor die for nothing.Dr. Frankl reviews the fight for survival and his decisions that somehow help him survive. He notes that prisoners go through three phases, 1)shock: the period following his admission 2)apathy: the period where they they become well entrenched in camp routine, and 3)the sense of loss, where they lose everything but hope. He digs down deep in his own soul to helps others to go on and have meaning in their life - not to give up and find the basic motivation to go on. He teaches despairing men \\"that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but what life expected from us.\\" Dr. Frankl repeats, \\"if we have the \\"why\\" we will always find the \\"how\\" to go on.\\"This book shows each individual he is important and every decision he makes is impactful. Therefore, make the right decisions and be triumphant. Right decisions cause the least pain and give the most love for fellow man. It is what gives us hope and value as part of humanity.Part Two, Logo-Therapy in a Nutshell, was not as interesting to me. It describes Frankl's philosophy of logo-therapy and reminded me of of mid-eastern religions as well as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. It is a way (Frankl calls it \\"neo-dynamics\\") to have a goal in mind and achieve it no matter what obstacles and stress you are facing. The things that make life important and with meaning are different for each of us. All of us can have a meaning of life, but the \\"big picture meaning\\" is hard to understand.

Logo-therapy teaches there are three main avenues on which one arrives at meaning in life. The first is creating a work or by doing a deed. The second is by experiencing something or encountering someone, and the third is turning a personal tragedy into a triumph.

Dr. Frankl endured the horrors of three Nazi concentration camps and then thankfully lived to document his experience and, more to the point, the effects of the camps' conditions on himself, his colleagues, and his oppressors.The book's first part contains Dr. Frankl's observances of human nature in the concentration camps, while the second part discusses his technique of logotherapy. Logotherapy, in contrast to Freudian techniques, doesn't immerse itself in childhood conflicts and sexual frustration. Logotherapy instead asserts that humans ultimately desire to know and live the meaning of their lives above all else.He cites his staying alive in the camps for his wife, who at one point resided in an adjacent barracks yards away, as an example of how meaning in his own life inspired his survival. He also discusses being kept alive by his drive to further develop his ideas and theories about the human quest for meaning, which he actually began forming before entering the camps. These two examples cover the main ways he says humans find meaning -- in relationships and in their life's work.He also discusses suffering with dignity and the function of an inner spiritual life as a respite from harsh and humiliating conditions.

In the end he is completely dehumanized but his psyche is intact. I have read adventure stories of men at war, men at sea, faced against unforgiving storms or mountain ranges, but no tail to me rings of such incredible human strength and perseverance. This is a story of incredible human will power.Since this man was a Doctor of Psychiatry before the war it doesn't surprise anybody that he came out of his experience with a new school of Psychiatry. The second part of the book which outlines his Logos theory didn't interest me much although his differences with Freudian psychology I found valid based on my readings of some of Freud's books.

Frankl try's to answer that through his experience as a prisoner in a concentration camp in Auschwitz (among others) and in his psychiatry practice after the war. Be it by grace, a miracle, or chance, he made it out alive. And now he is here to tell this powerful, optimistic story and help us with an age old question.He try's to answer this question: \\" How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?\\" This would later influence psychotherapy. Even being surrounded by so much evil there was still kindness to be found in an occasional guard. The prisoners were not always kind to there fellow inmates: there were sellouts and CAPO's; Capo's were Jews that watched over their fellow captives for favors, food, and extended life. Who is to say what any one of us would do. With misery and suffering beyond comprehension, \\"having a why to live for enabled them to bear the how\\". I will never look at that last leftover pea the same way.Writing on his concentration camp experience Frankl briefly discusses \\"logotherepy\\". In a later chapter he goes into detail: Logotherepy (which he coined), the \\"striving to find a meaning in ones life is the primary motivational force in man\\". In his practice he uses a form of reverse psychology. The last chapter is on optimism during tragedy.Freedom is only part of the story, he writes: \\"I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast\\"There are many quotables from Frankl, I will leave you with this: \\"Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.\\"In the end, there is that need for a reason.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I first heard of this book years ago through a strong recommendation by Stephen Covey in the 7 Habits, but didn't think about it until earlier this year when I was at Half Price.

There's a point where some random dude telling you how you should live your life becomes a highly ineffective approach to growth.Which is why Man's Search for Meaning appealed to me. Not only does the author back up his thoughts on suffering and meaning through extensive research, Dr. Frankl applied his ideas to help survive his three-years in the Holocaust, and so has a huge personal connection to the ideas he's presenting.What he's talking about, as many others have agreed, is pretty straightforward: by creating meaning in life, you have the capacity to move beyond any hardship in life.

Sans the detailed horror and gore of other WWII stories, Frankl gives a compassionate telling of his experiences and examines man's choice in how he reacts to life's many diffulties. He also introduces the reader to logotherapy, which he developed as a result of his WWII years. Logotherapy states that the root of depression and discontent is the person's lack of meaning in life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I first read this book when I was thirteen years old. I understood the main idea of this book to be--your attitude is the most important concept for living life.

Frankl was a neurosurgeon and psychiatrist whose insights into the experience of grotesque devaluation of life are priceless.The second part of the book are the beginning observations that lead to developing a new psychological school, \\"Logotherapy\\".Cherishing this book, I bought this copy for a lifer in the \\"hole\\" in prison. He reports that it has calmed him down a great deal. Hopefully he will find a meaning to his life..."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have wanted to read this book for some time and finally I got around to it and I am so glad I did. The first part of the book describes the struggles of Frankl and prisoners in the concentration camps and puts you very much in the situation these people had to bear with.The author was able to find meaning even in the most terrible circumstances. The book is about making personal choices of how you want to define a situation and taking responsibility for the life that you give meaning to in each and every moment.I realise now that when I am faced with a challenge I decide how I want to perceive it and to turn the challenge into an opportunity to grow and change as a person. When I see the TV news about how bad things are economically and the so called crisis in the world and then compare today's events with the authors experiences in the death camps and how he found meaning in spite of it all - I know I can change my outlook and find opportunity in spite of what the media says."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"What's there to say ....... ought to be required reading in every school (if it isn't already)."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Excellent book about survival and life approach.

Maybe it is the \\"meta\\" feeling of the High Holiday. The High Holidays can be a letdown. The liturgy, the long hours in the synagogue, the archaic and sometimes alienating images of a God who is King (and male) who rewards and punishes, who inscribes people in book of life or a book of death. All these concepts can be profound (after all, what else is more important than life and death) but also difficult to grasp, even in ten days, even with all one's strength and attention.So, Frankl's book on \\"existential\\" psychology probably acted as a counterweight to grand theories of life and death. By definition, existentialism tries to avoid overarching \\"meaning\\" systems. For Frankl, a survivor of the Nazi death camps, there is only the moment, and how we frame the meaning of that moment. Frankl's book gives numerous examples of how this is done, and that is the meat of the book. Toward the end, there are silly sections about the therapeutic school he founded based on these insights, replete with technical jargon that sounds outdated and odd.But that is not the lesson we should take away from Man's Search for Meaning. Finding meaning, God, self, love, are ongoing activities, happening at every single moment. It never ends. When we stop trying to find a meaning in each moment, we fall into a torpor which is a kind of death."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I'd heard Man's Search for Meaning and author Viktor Frankl referenced many times over the past few years. I decided in 2010 to finally read this. Was I glad I did. It is by far one of the most riveting stories of the power of the human mind and spirit. I've since re-read this 2 more times in the past 12 months.His theory that there are only 2 \\"races\\" of men on earth is intriguing. He asserts there are only \\"decent\\" men and \\"indecent\\" men. He states every society has both. The thought that there were \\"decent\\" Nazi guards in the camps and likewise \\"indecent\\" prisoners is interesting and he brings the point home so very well.I believe this book has been deemed, by the Library of Congress, one of the 10 most influential books ever written.

To be fair, Frankl never sets out to answer the question, and in fact proposes that each individual must answer it on their own, for themselves.Frankl's position seems to be very similar to those of people like Albert Camus: that despite man's incessant search, there is no inherent meaning in life. Frankl differs in his response to this reality from people like Camus in that his solution to the meaninglessness of life is to create meaning on our own, based on our own interests and experiences. For Frankl this meant identifying with human suffering and helping others to find individual meaning. For me at least, it's hardly enough.Of course there are no easy answers, and that is precisely the point."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have always been inspired by Man's Search for Meaning, with its tough-minded and inspiring message.

It's an excellent depiction of how we act in various circumstances.

As a survivor, Viktor Frankl discusses how he observed himself and other survivors find meaning in the terrible suffering they endured. Frankly sites many examples of human courage and endurance that occurred, but he does not go into graphic detail of actual events. He explains how these experiences helped him to build upon his psychological theory which he termed Logotherapy. The book is divided into two parts, the first part describes his experiences and the second part consists of an explanation of his theory. I was emotionally moved to tears many times while reading this book and will never think about life the same way again.

This allows it to answer questions that other accounts not often have an opportunity of answering. To me it's still difficult to read without being overwhelmed by emotion, but the calm tone and clear analysis of the author constantly refocused my attention to the lessons that can be learned from experiences like these. For readers with a special interest in the subject, it's certainly a book that adds a lot to everything that has been written about the holocaust throughout the years, because of this particular analytical point of view. The second part, about the psychotherapy method, was very dry to me and might be more interesting for people with a professional interest in psychology."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This two-part novel is written by a holocaust survivor and later psychologist of logotherapy.

Further, every trial encountered is an opportunity to show your character, and hence to assign meaning to your life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"There is no need to review a masterpiece already translated into 57 languages.

Only you control your own thoughts. This is of course not for children."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This marvelous work does for the psychologically wounded what Peter Drucker's \\"The Effective Executive\\" does for the time-impaired. That is give people a feel for what tools to use to construct their own framework for achieving happiness (not someone else's concept of what another person's happiness ought to be).Both \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" and \\"The Effective Executive\\" should be taken up and re-read at least once a year (pardon me for offering so specific a prescription). Both works are short enough so they can be read quickly. But don't go too fast. Consider Speaker Newt Gingrich's advice when he recommended people go through \\"The Effective Executive\\" stopping at salient points (there are plenty of those) and making notes about how something relates specifically to one's life and incorporate that into one's operating system.Dr. Viktor E. Frankl's logotherapy (or \\"meaning\\" therapy) springs from his experience in World War II concentration camps. His writing is refreshingly free from veiled (and sometimes not-so-veiled) invective of Holocaust literature. The terms \\"Jew\\" and \\"German\\" are scarely to be found. The Jewish identification is raised only when unavoidable to give a complete picture such as when Dr. Frankl's words give an Eastern European rabbi a new lease on mental health. Frank's statement about mankind's only two groups -- the decent and the indecent -- is telling.Among other Frankl profundities ---- Suffering is unavoidable.-- Man in metaphysical tension is normal and worthwhile.Perhaps his most important statement is that life is meaningful yet the meaning is different for each person and it changes more often than one might think. Keys to following this bouncing ball include taking responsibility and developing a sense of humor, according to our author.Freedom is not an end in itself, Frankl correctly notes, although others (especially libertarian thinkers in the tradition of Ludwig von Mises) have suggested that it needs to be treated as such societally to that the road to happiness be as wide as possible for individuals. Recognition that life is meaningful is essential to a successful navigation of this road, no matter how wide.Frankl: \\"Freedom is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness.\\"Frankl and many libertarians/classical liberals would agree that freedom and responsibility call for a delicate balance in the human mind. But who am I to say? Read Frankl, Allport and Fabry alongside Mises, Hayek and Rothbard and judge for yourself.Something you can't miss about Frankl -- he refuses to be a dictator. He was persecuted through the caprice of at least one hideous dictator yet denied the enemy victory by not taking on the enemy's characteristics. This represents a high level of moral reasoning. Although Frankl isn't an explicitly religious author he has earned the title of \\"Rabbi Frankl\\" through such choosing.The opposite of the spirit that animates Frankl and other greats (arrived at through attainment of true knowledge coupled with respect for all mankind) was wonderfully encapsulated by Stephen Crane is his story \\"Above All Things.\\" Of this all-too-common unholy spirit of the imperialist, the dictator, the socialist \\"reformer,\\" Crane wrote:\\"...The stranger finds the occupations (read: lifestyles) of foreign peoples to be trivial and inconsequent. The average mind utterly fails to comprehend the new point of view...'How futile are the lives of these people.'...This is the arrogance of the man who has not yet solved himself and discovered his own actual futility.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is the first book I read that can offer ordinary people with extraordinary power to overcome unimaginable difficulties. If one is equipped with such power, he becomes invincible. Such power is not money, ranks, social status, and etc. Instead, it is \\"man's deepest desire to search for meaning and purpose\\".

Most of all, he is happy no matter what happens."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"One of the great books of the 20th Century.

Because Victor was a Jew, he and his family were persecuted and his wife and child were murdered in the Holocaust. Now he survived, he decided to remain in Vienna where he spoke German much to the nerve of his fellow Holocaust survivors. Unlike all the other books about the Holocaust, Victor shows both inhumanity and humanity. He explains the prisonlike atmosphere and the politics of the system in order to survive. Yes, they did horrible things and horrible things happened for somebody to survive much like Victor who worked as a doctor. Frankel tries to determine what the pain, suffering and horror of the HOlocaust was all about. He brings color to the German Nazis and well criticizes his fellow prisoners who would sell their own out to survive. We will never know unless we have been there ourselves. For Frankl, he tries to do something positive out of the most horrible situation of the last century. He died around the time of two other notable world figures, Mother Theresa and Princess Diana. In their own way, they did something positive for humanity that most of us will never get to do. Mother Theresa's death was not unexpected but she should have gotten a lot more press than Princess Diana whose death was a shocker and Victor Frankl who died after living a long life surviving the ultimate horror of death and the joy of living afterwards.

The book is in excellent condition and I would not hesitate in using your services again."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Jewish German psychiatrist, Viktor Frankl, fathered the \\"Third School of Viennese Psychiatry,\\" known \\"logotherapy.\\" This book introduces his philosophy as he tells the gripping account of his three years in the Nazi death camps World War II.Frankl wrote seventeen volumes in German on the principles of logotherapy which he weaves into this short book, so it is difficult to summarize his philosophy in a review! Nevertheless, most basic to logotherapy is Frankl's strong conviction that man is responsible. I agree. Unfortunately, the great defect of Frankl's system is the lack of objective ground given for this responsibility! Humans are responsible, yes. But to what or who? Frankl fails to answer this. Logotherapy is then essentially a humanized moralism-better than the nihilism which was bred by Neitzsche,but still short of what men really need.The following paragraph represents the strength and contribution of logotherapy to the field of psychiatrics: \\"We who lived inconcentration camps can remember the men who walked through huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\"This is also the essence of the proactivity which Stephen Covey commends in Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, the book in which I first learned of Frankl. In and of itself, this concept is good. But concepts cannot be divorced from a world-view. And a world-view which isn't built on objective reality is faulty.According to Frankl, the basic motivation in man is \\"the striving to find a meaning in one's life\\" - notice he says a meaning, and not meaning. He didnt' believe it was possible to define meaning generally for all people: \\"The meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day, and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment.\\"Frankl's attempt to relieve the \\"existential frustration\\" of human beings fails to deliver right here; for though a subjectively perceived meaning may help a person endure suffering (as it did him), this meaning may have no objective ground in reality, and thus be REALLY meaningless after all, leaving the person deluded and deceived. Frankl says, \\"self-actualization cannot be attained if it is made an end in itself, but only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.\\" But is not self-transcendence impossible if there is no objective reality which is transcendent?! Logotherapy leaves us to ourselvs after all.According to Frankl's philosphy, one can discover meaning in life in one of three ways: \\"by doing a deed, by experiencing a value [such as love], or by suffering.\\" Unfortunately, logotherapy fails to connect deeds, experiences, or suffering to anything objective; God is virtually absent.Having said all of this, commendable in the book is Frankl's conviction that liberty be balanced with responsibility: \\"freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness. That is why I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast.\\" True.I also commend Frankl's rejection of pure naturalism:\\"there is a danger inherent in the teaching of man's \`nothingbutness,' the theory that man is nothing but the result of biological, psychological and sociological conditions, or the product of heredity and environment. Such a view of man makes him into a robot, not a human being. This neurotic fatalism is fostered and strengthened by a psychotherapy which denies that man is free.\\" Thus, Darwin and Freud both suffer from Frankl's analysis.Of interest is Frankl's description of logotherapy as a technique, where he discusses \\"anticipatory anxiety\\" and its cure, \\"parodoxical intention.&quot; This sounded a lot like reverse psychology to me!I'm not a psychiatrist or the son of a psychiatrist,but I am a pastor, a theologian, and an amateur philosopher; and in my judgment, Frankl leaves us with some helpful principles, but they are like a beautiful superstructure with no foundation, and thus, shaky. Man's search for meaning will ultimately fail if it does't terminate in the purpose for which human beings are created,namely, \\"to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.\\" Though Frankl has some good thoughts, I still prefer Saint Augustine who prayed to God: \\"Thou hast made us for thyself, and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in Thee.\\" That is where meaning in life is ultimately found."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I love the book. That's why I ordered multiple copies for a Sunday School Class study. And at $6 a copy, what could go wrong? The actual books are practically pocket-sized, however, and the print is very small.

It really analyses what people go through in their minds during trauma, especially during the Holocaust and concentration camps. It was interesting at times, but for me it was also very slow. It took me awhile to finish it, sometimes because it gave me a lot to think about and other times because it didn't quite hold my interest. It inspired me in many ways because it focused on how you can have an optimistic attitude during really tough times and that this attitude can help you find good in every situation. It is definitely deep and I am glad I read it, but not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"not an avid reader. this is one of the rare books i read and loved it. real life experience of the author, description of nazi era and concept of logotherapy have been explained quite well..."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"An excellent read.

Because I believe the ideas it contains are so critical to the human condition, I have given a copy to all my children and to each grandchild when they became young adults. Since I was a teenager when the dreadful truth about the camps was revealed, the horror of the paths some people can take to abuse others was mind boggling. Frankl's message of hope was essential. After 80 years of life, it seems his words are, unfortunately, as necessary as ever."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"On the surface this little gem of a book could appear simplistic. However, the author, a Nazi camp survivor, does not dwell on his horrors or loss (both unimaginable to me).

Frankl was so that I might gift my first copy to our church library. From cradle to grave man searches for meaning in life. Viktor Frankl was already a distinguished psychiatrist when the Second World War broke out and he and his family where brutally torn from their lives and thrown into concentration camps.

The ability to constrain your options for something greater than this moment comes from having a meaningful purpose."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Out of the worst of contexts, Viktor Frankl speaks the wisdom of how to live within suffering and find meaning. Staying present to the reality of what is happening right now and finding a glimmer of something that calls us forward seem to be the keys. Dwelling only on what has been lost or is being lost leads to meaninglessness and to a despair. This lose of all hope was certain death in the camps. Reading this book again continues to inspire me to manage my suffering in a way which gives my life meaning and purpose. I highly recommend this book for anyone for whom suffering is an issue."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I think this book should be required reading for everyone. Some of my little desires are so petty.. this book has made me think more about life and what is really important.."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Attempting to understand how anyone could endure the holocaust without giving up hope is of itself almost unfathomable. Yet Frankl, through his own direct experience, shows us how to find meaning through assisting others, thereby creating the purpose to continue on despite the suffering.In the second part of the book, Frankl then goes on to demonstrate how Logotherapy can be used in so many of the situations we inevitably encounter in our lives; from terminally ill relatives through to a reason to get out of bed each day and make a difference to the people around us.This book will put your own life into perspective, and will make you see the world in a vastly different way.

We could learn much about ourselves as well as people in general about going forwars after tramatic experiences. The ooones that searched for a reason to survive; did and those who gave up expired.

Having been interested in the human condition and psychology and philosophy for my entire life, this book is extremely interesting on all levels. It is a true story of Viktor Frankl's own internment in the Nazi German concentration camps brought to the world as a first-hand account of the experiences and conclusions of a learned and brilliant psychologist, who went from respected professional to holocaust prisoner to holocaust survivor. He has turned his brilliant mind to analysis of the experience from a perspective that no other mere researcher could ever achieve.It is moving, horrifying, and educational. Well worth reading, and I bought it for my Kindle so that I could read it again and have it with me as a reference.

It is truly captivating. The emphasis on finding purpose and meaning sparks something within. It makes you want to look for more in life, putting things into perspective. For example, he describes the need to find meaning in life in each moment, highlighting the need to live in the moment.Although the story describes how Frankl's survived concentration camps, he focuses upon aspects of human nature, man's ability to persevere, and other parts of the human experience. This allows anyone to relate to such an extraordinary story. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Read this book as soon as possible no matter who you are. The first half is Viktor Frankl's experience in concentration camps during WWII. In the second half he explains logotherapy, logo from the Greek word for \\"meaning.\\" He wrote something like 10 volumes during his life explaining logotherapy, so this is a short synopsis, but I am able to apply the logotherapy to my life to make it more meaningful. The book is wonderfully written. You will appreciate this amazing man after reading this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"... I really do. It's a great departure from the metaphysics of Jung and the sex-centered Freud. It might have been more helpful to present his theory of logotherapy before his account of the camps, but it still worked. And to all the people who bashed the book for not being complete in some way read page 97, Frankl flat outs says that it would be impossible to condense his entire theory down to 20-30 pages when it took volume upon volume in his native German to lay it all out. If you're going to bash a book on these bases you might not want to forget the author's own disclaimer (or maybe you do because then you wouldn't have anything to whine about)."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"'man's search for meaning' by viktor frankl is a profoundly touching book. i approach most inspirational books with reservations due to my pragmatic nature. an unfounded, brainless, and 'new agey' approach to optimism for the sake of wearing a smile on one's face does not resonate well with me. to my delight, this book is anything but that. i would not even consider it a conduit for optimism per se. it a simply a historical account and analysis of the possible strength that can be garnered in even the worst of suffering. the inspiration derived from this book is simply a by-product of becoming aware of the possibilities of human strength. frankl argues one has the power to take responsibility for his or her actions and reactions no matter how bleak the circumstances. truly imbibing this principle can be life-changing. i highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl's voice enraptures clairvoyance. The story is penetrating as well as moving. In his direst moments he maintains a strong voice and shares his introspective meditations. This is a Holocaust book unlike others."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In Man's search for meaning, Frankel details the account of his survival in a concentration camp and introduces the foundation of his idea on Logotherapy.Many of you are familiar with the atrocities committed by the Nazis in the concentration camps during the Second World War. One only needs to look at the terribly gaunt facesstaring from the pictures taken at some of the camps to shudder at the thought of the horrific experiences of these unfortunate people. For the lucky few who survived, only to discover their entire families were exterminated, existence most certainlyseemed meaningless.By all accounts, Victor Frankel should have easily succumbed to a destructive behavior immediately after his liberation from a camp in Bohemia. Surviving some of the mosthorrific encounters of those times, including overcoming a deadly case of typhoid fever, he was informed that his wife, his father, mother, and brother were all killed in various camps. Rather than commit suicide, he struggled to find meaning in his survival. It was this search for meaning that shaped the idea for a new brand in psychotherapy calledLogotherapy. Through this therapy, which literary means \\"healing through reason,\\" he helped numerous patients focus on the challenges of their personal search for meaning in life. It would do justice to mention that he found a way to cope with his losses, marry, have a daughter, two grandchildren, and a great granddaughter. He taught at the University of Vienna until he was 85, wrote over 30 books, and was nominated for theNobel Peace Prize.A very good read and highly recommended for those in search of life's meaning."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is an excellent book, for anyone trying to discover their purpose in life.

Reading Frankl's book really inspired me to change my life and take a whole new perspective on every step I take. I was a little skeptical before reading it, thinking that it would be just another Holocaust memoir; but, in fact, it was quite the opposite. Although it gives a good perspective of the suffering that occurred, his main focus was how he took the suffering and learned from it rather than let it take him down. It's an awe-inspiring book. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, both in stages of rock bottom and their prime, it doesn't matter; there's something in it for everyone to learn."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is amazing -- not only is Viktor Frankl a remarkable man but has equally important things to say.

And what if there were nothing, no savior, no relief, no narcotic or dream--nothing--! to keep us from falling into life's absurdities, crazinesses, meaninglessneses...Would it still be worth living to its fullest? Frankl says of course it is, if we could just keep our hearts hopeful. (My interpretation is, &quot;Things'll be better, if I can make it to Thursday&quot;.) Do you see? In spite of the philosophical/scientific lingo on his chapters on logotherapy and the fact that perhaps we'll never be in such dire circumstances as he experienced at the concentration camps, Frankl is telling us, if anything, life is worth living because of all the good things and good people that are here around us and that we can find...even during genocide or war or personal trauma.

But you must reach."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I picked up this book because it is referenced in so many other books and I had to read for myself what all of the hype was about.

However, science is not the only way of approaching these things. Where would literature be if it was all scientific? OK, that's not the best view. How about this -- isn't there room for crossover between what we so readily divide into &quot;science&quot; and &quot;fantasy&quot;?? Isn't there science and philosophy in literature, and can't there also be literature in science and philosophy? Viktor Frankl has written a book you may not have expected -- neither did I. Nevertheless, there is truth in his view of our ability to give ourselves meaning. There is a scientific way of approaching this -- quantum physics, biology, anthropology, cultural theories and neurological studies of the &quot;will&quot; in the mind -- but Frankl has approached truth in a different way. Namely, through his experience and that! of others.

I think one needs to have a specific goal in mind before reading it. I don't know if it's a very content-rich book, and it seems to be geared towards a specific audience, as opposed to one of Dale Carnegie's gems. But consider this: it's short. With most everyone's busy schedule, that should compensate for it's lack of universality.

It changed my life in many ways. Viktor Frankl did an extraordinarily job that influences many people's lives. He deserves all respect for his job."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"For Frankl, if life has a meaning, it has to be found in suffering. And he knows what suffering is.A brilliant student who writes essays on Schopenhauer, Psychology and Philosophy when he is still in high school, reduced to a beggar child in WWI and excluded from Alfred Adler's circle, without any reason at the age of 19.At 23 he already enjoys international recognition for his free work with suicidal youth in Vienna.In 1938, already a respected psychiatrist, he is invited to live in the US, but prefers to stay close to his old parents, only to be deported, 4 years later to a Jewish ghetto in Prague, where his wife is forced to abort their child and where his father dies from exhaustion 6 months later. Sister Stella manages to escape to AUS. In 1944 the whole family is separated and send to different concentration camps. Only when freed by US troops in April 45, he comes to know that all were killed, including his brother and sister in law. He is kept alive to take care, as a doctor, of other sick prisoners. \\"Man's search for meaning\\" was written in 9 days in 1946, and sold 9 million books until his death in 1997, and is considered one of the ten most influential books among lifetime readers in America today.\\"Man's search for meaning\\" makes an analysis of the psyche of a concentration camp prisoner.What becomes of man when everything is taken from him? To Frankl what one becomes is the result of an individual choice, the choice of weather to behave with dignity and according to moral values or renounce to his freedom of choice, dignity and self respect and behave and become like a scum and an animal.Suffering is part of life as much as death. The meaning and purpose of life lies in making use of suffering to exercise our freedom of choice, to chose how to take and accept suffering and in this way grow as a human being. Unavoidable, unescapable suffering is in fact a blessing. We must be worth our suffering. Man is free to chose to transform suffering into growth, guilt into change and life's transitoriness into action.Just as life has a meaning, even under the most miserable of conditions, so does a human being have value independently of its usefulness to society.The meaning of life in general is less important than the specific meaning of one's life at a specific moment, because that meaning may change every moment. We have to decide every moment what we want to be.Logotherapy, the psychoanalytical method he devised, concentrates on the responsibility one has for his own life. Responsibility to one's conscience or to society. It identifies the what and the who, one's responsible for. And no one can be responsible for someone else's acts.Man is free to chose to transform suffering into growth, guilt into change and life's transitoriness into action.No 2 persons can be compared, No 2 lives are the same.Sometimes we have to take action, sometimes, we have to accept things the way they are. We all have to suffer, no one can suffer for us. We are alone in the Universe for this task. We have to face suffering bravely and don't cry more than is necessary. Those who see us in our suffering (family, friends or God) expect us to do it with pride and not miserably.The meaning of life lies outside man. Lies in the people s/he loves and the causes s/he serves.We cannot know someone completely but through love. Only love sees the potentialities and is able to help realize them.Sex is only an expression of that love.A person that has fulfilled the meaning of his life, actualised his potentialities and suffered with dignity, is a person that looks back on his life with pride and does not envy youth."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"While I have never really warmed up to the second part of Frankl's book, the \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp\\" section has to be one of the finest examinations of meaning under terrible circumstances ever written. Frankl is insightful, unpretentious, incisive, elegant, brilliant. The first section is an existential masterpiece.I guess my difficulty with logotherapy is that meaning as experienced and conveyed by Frankl feels like it gets reduced down when put forth as a psychiatric theory.But part one is just brilliant beyond any attempt to review it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor E. Frankl teaches us that light can be found in each individual struggle to find meaning within - even through the worst pain, suffering and dehumanization; even in the darkest corners of history...The book is split into two parts: Experiences In A Concentration Camp and Logotherapy In a Nutshell.Part one is an account of his experiences in the concentration camps (Auschwitz and several others). Frankl gives us a picture of the sequence of three psychological reactions the prisoners experience to the process of imprisonment and freedom. Despite the horrifying circumstances, we begin to see an optimism budding in the sea of bleakness: a unique sense of meaning in some of the prisoners which helps them to cope with the day to day horrors of camp existence - a meaning which holds their spirits up even though their bodies are broken. This part of the book is unbelievably sad, yet the message it carries about the human condition is truly empowering.In part 2, we are given a brief overview of Frankl's theory of logotherapy, a form of psychotherapy which helps patients find meaning in their lives - no matter what their circumstances.The wisdom contained herein is so rich that after having only finished it last night, I know that I will be re-reading it for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I am not much on bibliotherapy, but I have lost more copies of this book than any other giving it to psychotherapy clients to read. This is an incredibly readable, heartfelt treatise on meaning-oriented, existential therapy. The greatest component to it is that it is not written in an erudite nor an obtuse manner. Instead, it is written so that everyone can grasp it. Written from a first-person perspective, with the first part of the book focused on Frankl's personal and interpersonal struggles, trials, tribulations, and explorations while in a concentration camp, this book clearly and simply develops Frankl's logotherapy perspective on therapy. As I have done before with countless clients, I highly recommend this book for anyone in search of meaning in life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is the best book I have read! It is: easy to read, a nice blend of thoughts and drama, inspiring, and comes with great ideas. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"One of the most important themes of this great work is substituting society's common grouping of people (black, white, Jew, gentile, etc.) with a delineation that is truly practical. Frankl rightly says there are only two categories of people \\"the decent and the indecent.\\" That is perhaps the greatest idea postulated in generations. So now we must wrestle with the fact that there are decent and indecent black people, decent and indecent white people, and yes, even decent Germans in the midst of the holocaust.To arrive at that conclusion under those circumstance gives hope that we may transcend the unnecessary divisions of our time, freeing us to see past exteriors and balance the core of a person on the scales of decency. We all carry baggage and this book has lightened my load.While these ideas are powerful they are only a sub-theme in this work. Centrally, Frankl conveys his method of overcoming life's greatest challenges and it is very profound."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I was hesitant to read this book because I thought it would only be about the horrors of the concentration camps which we have all heard about for decades. But this book is different in that it examines the prisoner's state of mind and how Viktor Frankl uses his experiences to support his logotherapy. Great book, I'm glad I finally took the time to read it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is really two works in one. In the first, longer part, Frankl details his experiences in Nazi concentration camps. His purpose is to demonstrate to the reader that even in the most horrific of circumstances it is possible to hold your head high and maintain your sense of purpose and optimism. In the second part, Frankl describes just how his \\"logotherapy\\" works.This book, highly popular in the 1970s, is both informative and practical. If you hadn't previously figured out how to rise above the fleeting events of your life when they distress you, this book makes the process clear and explicit. It is in fact one Western version of some of the main tenets of Buddhism, which tells us that life is only an illusion of endless change, and you must constantly reach for the unchangeable truths beyond that illusion.Having missed reading the book when it was first popular, I am glad to have finally gotten to it, if a bit late in life. I strongly agree with Frankl's point that \\"self-actualization is possible...only as a side-effect of self-transcendence\\". There are additional tidbits I found useful, such as the notion of \\"paradoxical intention\\", in which you try to consciously perform some action you are trying to cure yourself of, such as stuttering. Frankl also rightly reminds us that in each situation, you will know for yourself what the one *right* thing to do is, and you must chose that in order to be at peace with yourself.I gave the book only four stars, since I felt it was a bit repetitive (I wonder what the original 20-volume German-language version was like), continually recycling a single core idea which could have been explained in fewer words - though shortening the text might admittedly have made it less effective. It is in any case a great work, a classic in the psychology and self-help genre, not to be missed."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"To this day, Viktor Frankl's name is a frequent reference or footnote in motivational and business books and many others. He says we never cease to be ourselves, we are never without an ability to choose. In this small, understated treatise of his time in Nazi concentration camps, as part of his own means of coping, Frankl analyzes why some seemingly strong people die and others, whom you'd expect to wither away, do not. In the inhuman caldron that burned away all pretense and excuses, leaving bare human nature, Frankle witnesses the skills to mastering life: hope, chiefly, then humor, love, beauty and more. In his book, those change from lofty concepts to the essence of existence--and in many cases the means to continue to live."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I would never recommend an idea or explanation as the sole truth.

Read closer and you might find the sublime scientific method evident in passages like: &quot;We who lived in the concentration camps can still remember the men who went from hut to hut comforting others giving up their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number but they offer sufficent proof that everything can be taken away from a man except on thing--the last of his freedoms.

He blazed a path for others to follow by finding a purpose to live for and accepting both responsiblity AND freedom of choice in all situations.In therapy, I found Frankls ideas useful when my client is overwhelmed with the question of &quot;why?&quot; Frankls lessons have led me to ask the return question &quot;how will you respond in the face of this, even if you never know why?&quot;His book is about philosophy applied to tradgey and the human spirit.

I enjoyed it, and it was a very powerful book but I would have liked to know that this book focused so much on the theory and origin of logotherapy.This book was recommended to me by a family member who thought very highly of this book. Indeed, it was a very powerful book, yet (perhaps since it was written quite a time ago), it didn't connect or flow in the ways I was hoping it to. A book about the horrors of the holocaust- absolutely. A book about the foundations of the author's theory \\"logotherapy\\"?- yes. The meaning of life?- eh.The author seems to spend an extended amount of time reflecting on his experiences in Nazi death camps, which were terrible and captivating, but became redundant. And although I had little interest in logotherapy to start with, I was open to learning more about it. I found the descriptions to be quite dense and forced, his attempt to describe logotherapy was sometimes a bit awkward and came off at times like a poorly written textbook. Specifically, the examples given about logotherapy I found sometimes to not be the best, sometimes the examples being more about other theories or not logotherapy at all.Overall, not a bad book at all, I just found the title and descriptions to be misleading. This book has a lot to take in, and once you read it through it maybe worth going back to certain sections to fully be able to digest Frankl's material.op"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Every human being should read this book.

GREAT read!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book would get five stars even if only its first half was written.It describes the life at concentration camp as pictured by the author Victor Frankl, who was a trained psychiatrist and a concentration camp survivor.The author lost his wife and parents in Holocaust and himself experienced nadir of human suffering in concentration camps for three years.He gives a very detailed account of how the various human mind states manifested themselves under conditions of duress. And it really touches you at a very deep level.In the second half of the book, he lays out his theory that man's primary motivation is finding meaning in life.Logotherapy is his theory which gives an analysis of man's search for meaning in life. He proposes the basic principles as:- Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones. We need the right attitude to deal with difficult situations.- We have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stand we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering.Contrary to what Sigmund Freud proposed, he says that there are objective differences in the behavior when human beings are subject to deplorable conditions.Instead of harping on his own suffering in Nazi camps he instead chooses to focus on his message.\\"Suffering is not necessary to find meaning, but one can find meaning in spite of suffering.To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic. Rather, a positive attitude can go a long way to ease even the most dreaded human conditions. And there can always be a meaning in life if one is ready to search for it.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl is indeed a study in resilience. He has demonstrated the power of finding purpose in pain, in suffering, in dying. Man's Search for Meaning is his opus; it includes Frankl's reflections on years of suffering and it provides principles for others who find themselves feeling hopeless and helpless.By his late-20s, Frankl was a respected Jewish psychiatrist practicing in Vienna, Austria. He specialized in neurology and psychiatry and even worked as a brain surgeon. His work was primarily with those struggling with depression and suicide. In 1942, at age 37, Frankl, his wife and his parents were deported to a German concentration camp where Frankl was asked to treat newcomers to camp in order to reduce the risk that they would commit suicide. After two years in that role, he was transferred to Auschwitz and then on to a third concentration camp where he worked in slave-labor until the concentration camp was liberated by Allied forces in 1945. By then, however, Frankl's wife and parents had all been murdered as residents of separate camps.The purposes of those concentration camps were two-fold: the methodical killing of millions of innocent people but also the demoralization and dehumanization of the Jewish people (Ainsztein, 1974). In Man's Search for Meaning, Frankl reflects upon those around him who struggled with thoughts of suicide (p. 31) and even his own blunting of emotions (p. 35). Pain is not a respecter of persons, a valuable lesson implicit in the book as Frankl discloses his own struggles as being parallel to those without the great intellect, education and opportunity that he possessed.It appears as though Frankl the psychiatrist was not demoralized to the extent that he could not recognize strategies for coping in himself and those around him. The fact that he was later able to put these observations and reflections on paper is a treasure.In Resilient Adults: Overcoming a Cruel Past, Higgins discusses a number of characteristics and dynamics of the resilient that mirror Frankl's experiences. Higgins notes that those in her study who demonstrated resilience had above average IQ, exceptional talents, high levels of ego development, attuned empathy, and a strong sense of activism. One dynamic particularly relevant to Frankl is the component of profound religious faith. Of those who participated inHiggins' study who were identified as resilient, a number discussed the value that they received in expressing how they overcame their distress. Frankl demonstrated this decades before Higgins' study noted the therapeutic value of self-expression of resilience.Higgins' study participants reported that being exposed to the resilience of others provided a sense of hope for them in the midst of distress. Reading Man's Search for Meaning provides encouragement for those who find themselves in distress. For many people, the tragedies reported and documented from the German concentration camps are of the most heinous of all time. The resiliency demonstrated by Frankl offers hope for any circumstance.Frankl discusses the importance of \\"simple desires\\" during the times of greatest agony (p. 40). Those who are feeling hopeless and full of desire should likewise recognize the simple things that they appreciate despite the gravity of their situations. Frankl's perhaps most important contribution was his disclosure of the role of the \\"vigor of religious belief\\" (p. 46). This is of particular interest considering the opinions of religion propagated by the two other key Viennese psychiatrists, Freud and Adler.A struggle normalized by Frankl was that of thoughts of suicide (p. 31). For those who believe that they are the only ones so desperate as to consider the taking of their own life, Frankl writes about the struggles with suicide of the entire concentration camp community as well as his own individual struggle with hopelessness and doubts about whether he could go on. Inclusion of such a vulnerable disclosure is helpful to readers who feel that they are alone in the depth of their pain. To recognize the prevalence of this struggle in the face of such extreme pain is therapeutic, particularly when coupled with the knowledge that those who acknowledged the struggle survived.A thread present at numerous points within the pages of Man's Search for Meaning is that of the preeminence of family. At various points, Frankl discusses how \\"longing for home and family\\" (p. 33) kept painful emotions at bay, even when they were thinking about their spouses being in similar, or worse conditions (p. 48). By doing so, Frankl encourages future readers to also treasure those close to them when facing trials.Frankl discusses the role of humor (p. 54) as a means of self-preservation in the darkest of hours, noting that \\"a very trifling thing can cause the greatest of joys\\" (p. 55). Solitude, often considered the enemy of the oppressed, was treasured (p. 61). Day-dreaming became a real coping mechanism to get through each day; inner life became intensified (p. 50). These dynamics may come as a surprise to those in the midst of pain; however, Frankl emphasized the healing component that each provided for those in the midst of the torment found in the concentration camps of World War Two.While the first half of Man's Search for Meaning is autobiographical, the second half is a summation on Frankl's penultimate contribution to his field, logotherapy. Frankl wrote that his experiences in Nazi death camps taught him to affirm what Nietzsche had said, that \\"he who has a why to live for can bear with almost any\\" (Frederick Nietzsche). The theory upon which logotherapy is based grew out of Frankl's experiences within the Nazi death camps.Logotherapy is from the Greek word logos. Logos can be translated as study, word, spirit, God or meaning. Boeree noted that Frankl was often compared with two other famous Viennese psychiatrists Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler. While Freud concentrated on pleasure as the root of human motivation and Adler upon power, Frankl concentrated on meaning. It was his goal to bring into greater balance perspectives on physiology and spirituality as a means to construct meaning.Frankl posited during his autobiographical section that man \\"can only live by looking to the future\\" (p. 115) and noted that the \\"ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire\\" is love (p. 58). Frankl reflects upon his experiences and states that \\"everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to chose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's one way\\" (p. 104). Frankl is critical of those who shame others out of reflecting upon their own suffering noting that suffering that is endured with dignity fosters meaning.Religion is a key construct in Man's Search for Meaning. Frankl is clear to testify to the importance of relying on God. In his introduction to logotherapy, Frankl presents his theory in a much broader religious context. While Freud clearly presented a psychological basis that was hostile to religion, Frankl posits one that recognizes how his own spiritual life \\"was deepened\\" (p. 56) while encouraging others to identify their own relationship with the transcendent.Completing Man's search leads readers to wonder how psychotherapeutic models would be viewed differently if access to the same depth of autobiographical reflection was available for each theorist. Having a glimpse into Frankl's time in a World War Two concentration camp allows his audience to see into his heart and to recognize the context of his work with patients and students.Filled with hope, Man's Search for Meaning is quite inspirational as Frankl chronicles how he found meaning in life under the worst of circumstances. It is as though Frankl has found a dozen ways to say that the answer to all psychological problems is to \\"find meaning in suffering.\\" His optimism has a contagious flavor to it. Man's Search is a compelling read that prompts deep introspection as to the relationship between the sufferer and the suffering and how to ascribe meaning to that suffering. Frankl demonstrates that, \\"even in the most terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress,\\" individuals \\"can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind\\" (p. 74)."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The detachment with which the author plows through the deprivations of concentration-camp life (as he personally experienced) is erudite and emotional. The vivid imagery is caught in the mundane yet otherworldly details of camp survival techniques--whether using cigarettes as currency or clapping loudly to poor capo-poetry as a means of self-preservation--underpinning the despair that assailed the lives of the prisoners. In his account, love transcends the barbarism of genocide, shouted commands, lashings, and shows itself to be the greatest aspiration man can hold.At one point, the author, scantily clad, marches on frozen ground, before the pale light of dawn emerges, envisaging his wife, talking to her, relishing in her memory, occasionally interrupted by a falling prisoner, a whipping, a lashing, a shout, to return to the indelible warmth of her memory.There can be bliss in hell and strength of soul in a corpse-like man. The impetus of life is self-determination and meaningfulness in both the dark and light of humanity. This book centers on the notion that individual decisions define an one's future--not circumstances, external prejudices, or the environment. It is a book that celebrates the future, reveres age and experience, gives perspective to suffering and, most importantly, tells of freedom as value-less without \\"responsibleness\\"--in other words, life has naught to offer but the chance to offer it something; every hour, every day."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"It's absurd to \\"review\\" a reflection on the Holocaust by a Holocaust survivor. I guess I just felt compelled to write a few words about how much this book touched me.Previously, I have only read two other Holocaust memoirs: Elie Wiesel'sNight (Oprah's Book Club)and Simon Wisenthal'sThe Sunflower: On the Possibilities and Limits of Forgiveness (Newly Expanded Paperback Edition)and I can't help but use them as references when thinking of ways to describe Frankl's approach in \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\" Both Wiesel and Wisenthal were strictly documentarian in their approaches. When recounting their time as victims of the Nazi regime's extermination program, both described their experiences as they happened, and attempted to convey their emotions at the time. Both wrote beautifully, but were very faithful to the attitude Wiesel once described about the \\"experience\\" of the Holocaust, which is that no poetry or analytical thought could do it justice, that silence was the only possible response.Frankl clearly doesn't take this approach in \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\" Before he and his family were captured by the SS, Frankl was an aspiring psychoanalyst who was on the verge of publishing a major book. His fascination with human nature clearly runs deep, and is self-evident in the way in which Frankl chose to respond to the Holocaust. While in the camps themselves, Frankl paid close attention to the people around him, and paid particular attention to himself. Despite the sheer brutalization he experienced, he didn't seem to lose his sense of curiosity, and wasn't afraid to use his experiences in order to develop insights into the souls of human beings, or to compare the suffering he and his fellow inmates experienced to experiences of suffering found in the outside world. He noticed their coping strategies, their behaviors, the things they would say, the ways in which their perspectives changed. Although he comes across as an individual who can never really shed his intellectual gaze, he never comes across as cold. His retellings of his memoires, his reflections on what happened to him, and the ideas he develops out of them are all intertwined with a deep concern for the moral future of humanity, and the care he felt for those who suffered along with him in Auschwitz and the other camps he was imprisoned him.I won't bother describing the events that Frankl retells. I shouldn't have to, because you damn well should read them! His conclusions, however, are both interesting and inspiring. While in the camps, Frankl noticed that although all the prisoners were reduced to nothing, and all were equally degraded and posessionless, their individuality did not disappear. The Nazis may have stripped them of every signifier that spoke of their dignity, but various prisoners still stood out in their moral actions. Some shared food when they hardly had any themselves. Some sacrificed themselves in order to help others. Meanwhile, others became cruel, or others simply gave up, smoked their last cigarette, and awaited their death. The first philosophically significant conclusion Frankl takes from this is that human beings are not the total products of their social environment. Even when \\"equalized\\" in the harshest, most severe way possible, various prisoners were still able to define themselves through the care they showed for their fellow man. Secondly, those who did act morally and did persevere believed in something. This \\"something\\" could be the hope that they would see their significant others one day, that they needed to still carry out God's work, or that they would continue to live after the Holocaust was over. Frankl also shares the way in which he applied this to himself, and he insists that it was the sole factor that allowed him to survive. His thoughts of his wife, and the work he needed to continue outside of the camps, according to him, were the things that allowed him to survive the Nazi's worst tortures and cruelties. His suffering was intense, but he was able to give it meaning, which made it bearable. In multiple instances, he repeats a famous Nietzsche quote as if it is his personal mantra: \\"He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How.\\" Ironically, those who believed in nothing but survival fell into animality, and according to what he saw, did not survive. Those who didn't believe in their own survival, but rather, the importance of something greater, in fact, were far more likely to persevere.The second half of \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is an argument that his experiences are fully applicable to all peoples' lives. I find this particularly interesting, because as I mentioned earlier, one of the most common statements one hears about Holocaust experiences is that they're incommunicable, that the only proper reaction is silence. I'm not saying that Frankl would think that the experiences of Holocaust survivors were \\"communicable\\" per se, but he clearly believes that they can tell us something about ourselves. He provides various stories from his time as a practicing psychotherapist where he applied \\"logotheraphy,\\" a strain of psychological thought we now would probably refer to as \\"humanist psychology.\\" Frankl criticizes the prevailing Freudianism of his day for its promotion of the idea that the human mind was machine-like, and that individuals had no control over their actions. He retells one particularly funny story about an Austrian patient who was dissatisfied with his diplomatic career. Previous psychoanalysts told him that he was dissatisfied because he worked with U.S. relations, and that his mind interpreted the U.S. as his father. It makes the modern reader laugh, but this is actually what Frankl was fighting against! Frankl, as an alternative, suggested that the man's career conflicted with his inner values (which the patient kept telling his previous psychoanalysts anyways!), and that he needed to find a career that was in line with his personal sense of meaning. The patient did exactly that- and what do you know- it made him happier!Modern American pop culture is overloaded with feel-good gurus: \\"The Purpose-Driven Life,\\" or the garbage referred to as \\"The Secret.\\" These hucksters either pick a specific religious belief as \\"the big solution,\\" or tell their followers absurd things, such as the idea that they can \\"do anything,\\" or wish their ills away. Frankl, being a profound philosopher-psychologist, promotes the idea that people should discover their own purpose. However, he understands the complexities of such a project. Frankl stresses that discovering purpose is a task unique to each individual. If an individual wants to turn to religion, that's fine. At the same time, Frankl points out that fidelity to one's family, a creative project, or the desire to improve one's character can all play the role of meaning. In fact, he warns against simply picking a \\"meaning\\" out of thin air. Unlike feel-good gurus, Frankl understands that suffering is a part of life, and no amount of therapy or reflection can change that. He frankly admits that \\"logotherapy\\" cannot solve all psychological problems, or that it's a magic cure. Rather, he believes that it represents something which is lacking in the modern world, something that needs to balance out the influences of crass capitalist materialism and cold scientific determinism, and suspects that many could stand to benefit from this sort of reflection.This book is wonderful. You should read it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl was one of the greatest psychologists and noblest human beings of the 20th century. He taught that the primary motivation in human life was the search for meaning. He explained that \\"the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day, and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment.\\" There is potential meaning to be fulfilled in every situation in life, no matter how painful and difficult it may be. During World War II Viktor Frankl and his family were imprisoned in the Nazi death camps; his pregnant wife was murdered in the gas chambers and his parents died of starvation and illness. Frankl miraculously survived and after the war wrote about his experiences and conclusions about human nature in his book \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\"Frankl asserted that man is free to make choices and determine his life and that is a much needed refresher in our age, when many perceive people to be simply subjects to biological, psychological, and social conditions. Frankl says: \\"Man does not simply exist, but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment... In the concentration camps, for example, in this living laboratory and on this testing ground we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behaved like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself; which one is actualized depends on decisions and not on conditions.\\" He clarifies that although man is not free from conditions, he is free to take a position toward those conditions. Our power and responsibility is to give meaning to our unique lives and fulfill that meaning, no matter what the conditions are.There are certain achievements that have the potential to greatly impact all of humanity; I believe that Viktor Frankl's ideas represent such an achievement and should not be limited to the realm of psychotherapy. They were tested during the darkest hour of human history and after passing such a test, they are no longer \\"ideas\\" but rather facts about human nature, facts that we all need to consider as we face the challenges of our times and in our personal lives.Roumen Bezergianov, author of \\"Character Education with Chess\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Everyone should read Man's Search for Meaning at some point in his or her life. I personally am not a huge fan of pulling a book from the shelf and reading for hours, but I could not put this book down.In his book Viktor Frankl uses his experiences in concentration camps to teach this valuable lesson: that when one finds meaning to life, then trials, challenges, and pain become more possible to overcome. Frankl, who is a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps, uses his background in psychology to help him survive.I really liked the book because he taught the valuable lesson that no matter where you are and what happens to you, no one can control your thoughts, mind, and attitude. Frankl is thrown into Nazi prisons and endures more than I will probably face in my lifetime. But he showed me that even if your job, home, family, career, and name are taken away, no one can take away what is inside of you.The possibility of seeing his family again was Frankl's motivation to survive the different situations that he was thrown into. I really enjoyed the moral of the book and his desire to survive. I wish that he would have written more about his experiences and time in the camps. The book is a short read, and about the last third is devoted to explaining his psychotherapy called Logo Therapy.One of the reasons that I enjoyed reading the book so much is because it is a part of the world's history from an individual's perspective. I personally felt like I could relate different parts of my life to the things that were being said in the book. I was never put into a concentration camp, but I think that at some point in everyone's lives, they are stripped of something. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a lot out of a little. If I can read it, you can too!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Length:: 1:01 Mins"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning was a fascinating account of Victor Frankl's life before, during, and after serving as an ordinary prisoner and survivor of four Nazi death camps. The first part of the book is more of an auto-biographical account of how he arrived in Auschwitz, the harsh living conditions, and later what happened after his release. I found this section easy to read, with some real pearls of wisdom. The second part of the book was more difficult for me personally because it included a lot of psychology terms.It was interesting to learn about the things Frankl endured, and more importantly how he survived the bitter cold, limited food rations, brutal punishments, and the overall depression associated with being a death camp prisoner. Despite all the hardships, he even discussed a few rays of sunlight that broke through the otherwise drab existence - this included humor, natural beauty of a sunset, and many other things.Overall, this is a book I would like to read and study again, especially so I can better understand the psychology concepts used in the second part. I do think the first book is written simply enough for anyone to understand the basic concepts Frankl is conveying about our own personal search for meaning."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" by Viktor E.

I appreciate my life more every time I read such survival story's. I cannot begin to comprehend how anyone survived these camps considering their exposure to the elements with virtually no food to provide the energy for work or the body warmth/immunity to ward off illness and disease. God Bless Mr. Frankl and all others who survived.The more psychoanalytical add ons at the end of the book were more in depth than my literary interests or needs at this sector of my life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book was exactly what I expected and was oddly similar (but obviously not as cruel) as basic training. I liked his story, he's a very brilliant man. \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" basically cronicles this psychologists' (Viktor E. Frankl) experiences at Auschwitz extermination camp in World War II. Frankl gives the reader an inside look at his day-to-day life, what he thought about while away, and essentially how he was lucky enough to survive."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"For all its complexities and mysteries, life boils down to one aspect that should ALWAYS allow a human being to keep his dignity if nothing else: We have the ability to react to any situation any way we want. That is, even in the awfulness of the Nazi extermination camps, a person can still keep his dignity if merely by being able to control how he reacts to a situation.Also, Frankl continously refers back to a qoute by Nietzsche that says, \\" He who has a WHY to live for can bear any HOW.\\" In a concentration camp, Jews often found that the will to live no longer existed within them. They had lost all hope and it was their despair that often led to physical illnesses that led to their death. As a response, people like Frankl tried to reinforce to their friends that they did in fact have something to live for. That \\"something\\" could be their family back home, their kids, their other loved ones, their careers that they may be able to once again resume after the war, etc. Now, one may question how this relates to his main idea of people reserving the right to react to any situation however they choose to. Well, Frankl argues that once a human has hope, that is the WHY to live for, then he can bear just about any HOW. That is, no matter how long the SS made the Jews stand out in the bitter cold, often with no shoes, and no matter how often they whipped them and kicked them and punched them, it was always the victim's right to react to those situations as he wanted to. Whether it was by giving up and perishing or by replying with even more fervent prayer and hope that they will once again be reunited with their loved ones; therefore, survival, Frankl argues, is up to the individual.The first section of the book is divided into three periods of a \\"prisoner's\\" life; the period of shock, the period of being a prisoner, and the period after liberation. Frankl provides specific examples for each period and then ties them back into his main idea. The second part of the book explains Frankl's notion of Logotherapy. I found this second section to be not as important as the first section, because I'm not really interested in psychology.If I had been asked to only rate the first part of the book, I would have rated it 5 stars; however, the second part of the book isn't as interesting. I would recommend that you read this book either before or shortly after reading \\"Kaddish for an Unborn Child\\" by Imre Kertesz. You will find differing philosophies on what happens to the human mind during such tragic and degrading conditions as were the Nazi extermination camps."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.\\"What is the meaning of life? Frankl try's to answer that through his experience as a prisoner in a concentration camp in Auschwitz (among others) and in his psychiatry practice after the war. Be it by grace, a miracle, or chance, he made it out alive. And now he is here to tell this powerful, optimistic story and help us with an age old question.He try's to answer this question: \\" How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?\\" This would later influence psychotherapy. Even being surrounded by so much evil there was still kindness to be found in an occasional guard. The prisoners were not always kind to there fellow inmates: there were sellouts and CAPO's; Capo's were Jews that watched over their fellow captives for favors, food, and extended life. Who is to say what any one of us would do. With misery and suffering beyond comprehension, \\"having a why to live for enabled them to bear the how\\". I will never look at that last leftover pea the same way.Writing on his concentration camp experience Frankl briefly discusses \\"logotherepy\\". In a later chapter he goes into detail: Logotherepy (which he coined), the \\"striving to find a meaning in ones life is the primary motivational force in man\\". In his practice he uses a form of reverse psychology. The last chapter is on optimism during tragedy.Freedom is only part of the story, he writes: \\"I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast\\"There are many quotables from Frankl, I will leave you with this: \\"Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.\\"In the end, there is that need for a reason.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Amazing book, gives the reader many things to comtemplate.

Viktor Frankl is someone everyone should meet through this works."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The first part of the book is a look into life at a German concentration camp. This book is based on the author's own life experiences, so it makes you have a more empathetic view of the story he is telling. This is an actual account of his time in the camps. His story moved me through a variety of emotions: anger, sadness. It really brought to light some of the horrible things that were done in the camps."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In the first section of this book, the author describes in great prose his and others' experiences as prisoners during the Holocaust and the horror of it all. Then in the second section, he relates the logotherapy theory (or the therapy by looking for meaning.)The connection between the two sections clearly is that the fellow prisoners of the author's who did not have a meaning/objective in their lives to live for or who gave up on any meaning were the ones who gave up on the will to live (and actually let themselves die without being taken to the gas chambers.) Those who had a meaning to their life or something to strive for were those who tried their best to survive those horrible conditions.Another way to look at it is: if those people found the will to live in such horrific circumstances (some of them didn't as mentioned above), then one must conclude that life in and of itself must have a meaning and is worth fighting for.I highly recommend this book for any serious reader."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I read this book while I was in high school and it touched me so much, I still enjoy rereading it today. Granted, I only read the first section, so I cannot speak for the second half on &quot;logotherapy&quot;, but I can say this book ranks as one of my all time favorites. It is touching and it makes you really think about your life and what brings you happiness and meaning. Anyone can read this book, regardless of age or background. Obviously, when I was younger, I did not completely comprehend the finer points of &quot;logotherapy&quot;, but I still found this book fulfilling because it really made me think. The holocost does play a role in this book, but even if you shy away from history books or books about an individual's suffering, you should still read it. It gets you to think more about your life than his and it opens your mind to thinking about everything just a little differently. And I always think that's a good thing."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Victor's writing in Man's Search for Meaning helped me make one of the most important realizations of my life, one that would ultimately change its course and my experience of it. It brought home, with certainty, the notion that in life, it is not what happens to you that matters most, but how you respond to it. Watching Victor discover and live that in a concentration camp is a story not to be missed. It is, in part, because of this book, and my commitment to live the ideas in it, that I now run my own wellness center and have authored of The Spirit of Joy, an intimate story of spiritual awakening."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I read this book when I was in a very tough place based on the recommendations of a surgeon who unlike many surgeons was interested in my emotional well-being as well. I was hit by a semi-truck while riding my bicycle and spent months in a very difficult place. This book provided some solace although my situation was not nearly as bad as that suffered by the author and the other victims of the holocaust. The author attempts a very difficult task, namely to develop tools for people to find meaning in some unimaginably painful situations. Situations where finding the power to cope and find meaning seem to be pointless. The author describes how he found the emotional strength to survive the concentration camps and come out to be a man who is not broken by circumstances. I couldn't relate to all of his advice but I will remember one thing that the author advised. When in an unbelievably dire and hopeless situation and all other meaning is lost, you can find meaning in suffering and dying with dignity. When all bets are off, you shouldn't lose your humanity."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This was a very moving story and outlook on life. When everything of your life has been stripped away what remainds is the true meaning of life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl's imperative is:&quot;Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!&quot;Nothing more needs to be said."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In \\"Man's Search for Meaning,\\" Victor Frankl provides an introduction to existentialism and logotherapy. Based on his experiences in the concentration camps during World War 2, he says that life's meaning comes from within and that life does not cease to have meaning just because of suffering.He asked fellow prisoners why they did not commit suicide and he got responses such as they had a talent to be used, or a loved one waiting, or they had memories worth preserving. But how many people try to avoid death and don't commit suicide because they fear death?Frankl says that if there is a purpose in life at all, there must therefore be a purpose in suffering and dying. I don't think agree with that line of reasoning. If life is purposeful, then isn't death likely to be unpurposeful? Maybe there are \\"purposes\\" in suffering and dying but are they necessarily in our interest? The purpose of murder might be revenge, but that meaning doesn't benefit the victim. \\"Without suffering and death, life cannot be complete,\\" he writes on page 76. WHAT?! Could some cases of searching for meaning in suffering and dying be rationalization? Frankl says to search through suffering and find how good can come of it, making the suffering more bearable. \\"Suffering ceases to be suffering the moment it finds meaning,\\" he says. But I think it would be better still for good to come on its own and not through suffering. Finally, I think Frankl's statement that death gives life meaning contradicts his other beliefs. He is against suicide and helped his fellow prisoners to find meaning in life so they would keep living, yet he says life isn't complete without death. So if in his day, technology and medicine allowed man the option to live forever, would Frankl turn this down and allow himself to die? Wouldn't this be the same as commiting suicide?Frankl's Logotheraply proposes that many neuroses are caused by a failure of the sufferer to find meaning and sense of responsibility in his existence. Logotherapy is based on the belief that search for meaning is the primary motivation of man and not a \\"secondary rationalization\\" of instictual drives, defense mechanisms, reaction formations, or sublimations. He backs this up by saying that people live and die for their beliefs and values.He says that life is so valuable that it is worth living no matter how great the suffering may be, and finding meaning can pull man through any amount of suffering. He's against mercy killings and euthanasia for that reason. So if someone has a wasting, uncurable, terminatable illness, they should live out their natural life, he says. Or if someone has Alzheimer's disease, knowing who no one is, including themself, eats their meals through a straw, and has their diaper changed by a nurse-- they should be kept alive as long as possible. He says that we shouldn't confuse how much a person contributes to society with how much they are worth to it. Personally, I found insufficient information in the reading to convince me that there is a difference. The inference of these ideas is that human life is sacred and all humans are equal. What about animals? They can feel pain too. On the other hand, there are some humans who are in some condition that's it's like they don't even know they are alive, such as retardation, being comatose, etc and there are humans who do not want to be alive. As Frankl himself writes in the same book, being useful is equated with being meaningful and vice versa. So shouldn't we all seek to be useful in society to make our lives meaninful?As he noticed in the concentration camps, hope and courage were what kept people in the camps alive. Those who lost hope and courage would commit suicide or succumb to disease. Frankl quotes Nietzche, \\"He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how.\\" In \\"The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\\", Stephen Covey noted that our ability to do anything is determined by knowing what to do, how to do it, and why to do it. Frankl's book stresses the \\"why\\"-- the motivation, the reason and meaning, to live.He says that people shouldn't focus on what they expect from life, but rather what life expects from them. To Frankl, the meaning of life is different for each person. To ask for a general, abstract meaning of life is like asking a chess Grandmaster what the greatest move in the world is, he writes.The last part of the book is devoted to a very brief intro to logotherapudic methods. \\"Hyper-intention\\" is how fear can bring to pass what we are afraid of or how trying too hard for something can prevent it from happening. To alleviate this problem, the author proposes to simply relax the hyper-intention. For example, to cure sleeplessness, try to stay awake. To achieve sexual orgasm, don't worry about it and instead focus on your partner. He says many neurotics aggravate their problems by trying to fight them. By learning to laugh at themselves, he says, neurotics can be on their way to a cure.As for the pursuit of happiness, Frankl urges the reader to pursue a REASON to be happy, just as to make someone laugh you must give him a reason to (tell him a joke). He notes that these days many people have enough to live by but nothing to live for-- they have the means but no meaning. In the future, as automation puts more time in people's hands, many will be in the \\"existential vacuum\\", faced with the lack of meaning in their lives when they aren't occupied with work or labor.Overall, I think this is an insightful book but I disagree with certain parts."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book was really two books in one. The first part centered on the author's experiences and feelings of suffering as a Holocaust survivor. The terrible pain and indignity came out crystal clear.

The idea behind this book is that, when man has lost everything, there is still something they can pursue in their mind, there is still something which he they can look forward to.Coming from his own experience in the concentration camps, there was something he was looking for, even when he had lost everything in life and there was nothing else to look forward other than to be gassed. He also motivated his comrades to look for something - to search for a meaning in life and to isolate their minds from the external happenings.As a general read, it is worth reading, it gets us thinking in new lines.But is it applicable to give new hope to people ? Can it motivate a terminally ill cancer patient to look for something ?What would have Lance Armstrong have to say about logotherapy ? I think Lance would have acknowledged it - having recovered from cancer to become a champion again. Again it is all about finding new meaning/new hopes to continue and sustain life, even in the brink of hopelessness."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl's narrative begins with an especially long, detailed account of his horrific experiences in the infamous Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps. Frankl assesses the various stages one endures upon being imprisoned in a camp. He contests that the stages can be categorized into three phases: \\"the period following his admission; the period when he is well entrenched in camp routine; and the period following his release and liberation.\\" He goes on to examine the symptoms that characterize each phase. The first phase, he asserts, is identified by \\"shock.\\" He describes the horrific journey, \\"everyone's heart missed a beat at the moment. Auschwitz-the very name stood for all that was horrible...\\"The second phase detailed in the narrative is one of \\"relative apathy in which he achieved a kind of emotional death.\\" Frankl describes his experiences as a physician treating members of the camp diagnosed with typhus. He recounts the death of a patient and how he watched with no emotion as the other prisoners robbed the still-warm corpse of whatever could potentially be of use to them. Additionally, he describes the body being carried away with no emotion, \\"the man with the corpse approached the steps. Wearily he dragged himself up. Then the body: first the feet, then the trunk, and finally-with an uncanny rattling noise-the head of the corpse bumped up the two steps.\\" He later elaborates by further assessing the distinguishing features of the second phase, \\"if my lack of emotion had not surprised be from the standpoint of professional interest, I would not remember this incident now, because there was so little feeling involved in it.\\"Finally, he concludes that the final phase is distinguished by a prisoner's release from the concentration camp, \\"'freedom,' we repeated to ourselves, and yet we could not grasp it.\\" He contests that while liberation from the camp was to be a joyous occasion, the prisoner's had difficulty feeling pleasure, he explains that psychologically, what was happening to the prisoner's was known as \\"depersonalization,\\" in other words, they found it hard to believe that the events unfolding around them were real. He also reminds the reader that even the period following liberation saw survivors lusting for vengeance, or seeing no meaning to their lives when their entire families had been murdered.Though \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp\\" is certainly the longest portion of the book, \\"Logotherapy In a Nutshell\\" formally introduces Frankl's \\"school of thought.\\" The term \\"logotherapy\\" is derived from \\"logos\\" the Greek word for meaning. Frankl believes that the most effective therapy for many individuals is to discover the essential purpose of their lives. Frankl believes that the origins of so many self-destructive patterns and behaviors lie in an individual's \\"existential frustration,\\" in other words, their inability to seek out the meaning in their lives.Frankl asserts that Freudian-style psychoanalysis is faulty in that it spends a disproportionate amount of energy searching for the origins of \\"neuroses.\\" On the contrary, Logotherapists help their patients find the meaning in their lives, subsequently fostering an onward-looking method to therapy. Though Psychoanalysis often reduces meaning and values to sheer \\"defense mechanisms,\\" Frankl responds, \\"I would not be willing to live merely for the sake of my defense mechanisms.\\" In addition, Frankl argues that logotherapy is a much more realistic response to the human state in that it seeks to establish an appropriate conflict between a person's current circumstance in life and his or her goals.In conclusion, Frankly objectively assesses how he used Logotherapy to overcome the mental traumas of life in a concentration camp and encourages individuals to apply his findings to their own lives. While there are many distinctions between traditional Psychoanalysis and Logotherapy, it is certain that one could potentially reap many rewards from considering Frankl's findings."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"If you were assigned to read this book in school years ago, maybe you can't remember what all the fuss is about.

All of the self-help books out there, from Deepak Chopra to Stephen Covey to Dr. Phil, are mere twaddle compared to this book.

Ask Austrian Psychiatrist Dr. Victor Frankl. Having spent a few years in the death camps the images he explains in the first half of his book is just unthinkable. The torture these people endured during these times are simply hard to believe.Frankl's graphic details of the killings, beatings and other inhumane activites makes the read wonder if there is any hope for them. This is the same type of question people ask when they loose clarity in their purpose. When there is a sudden change in their life, one may ask \\"What am I going to do now?\\"Frankl's introduction to logotherapy is fairly basic. No matter who or where we are, we can always choose our own attitude. Further, he says that everybody who finds their purpose will persevere to leave their legacy. Whether it is in business, family or a particular mission, once your purpose is discovered you will get to your destination.Frankl's phylosiphy helped him and others during the war to make it out of the camps before the Americans invaded Germany and the camps were raided.

We all know of the physical trauma and fear felt by all of the prisoners. We can't truly know all of the hurt done. This book doesn't go into the horrible details, but into the mind of a prisoner. There had to have been absolute trauma knowing one was a moment away from death. In this book, however, Viktor E. Frankl tells how the prisoners mentally survived. It was through a collective will to get through each passing day. One story tells how one person lost the will to live it was obvious that they weren't going to live. The going into of an individuals mind through the holocaust and the different perspective of horrors make this a great book.2. It offers principles and help to find meaning in life. Frankl's logo therapy is one way he identifies to help people examine his/her life. One doesn't need to have his logo therapy but identify principles in the book to help find meaning. The principle taught that one must make the best of whatever situation is present in life. He was in the holocaust and managed to survive. There is always a choice and only you can decide how you will react. It would have been easy to give up and lose character but Frankl never did.

It is the man who gives suffering, joy, or whatever his life contains a meaning, the way he accepts his fate and all that it entails.Regardless of external circumstances, there is a spark of freedom which enables man to fight or despair. To choose to be a demon or a saint.Agree or disagree, this book has power because it is written by someone who has been to hell and back. Who has seen it all with his own eyes.

Take a weekend and read this book.My only gripes are the translation, which was crap in the version I read (but I'm an editor, so I get cranky about things like that) and that Frankl does paint himself as the all-answering, all-curing type who can walk into a room and fix any poor fool who's been suffering for years within minutes. I appreciate a degree of modesty. But I guess he's earned the right to feel righteous."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Was referred to this book-using all three I ordered for help in understanding the minds and lives of our encarcerated brothers and sisters.

It is awe inspiring, horrifying and make you want to go and hug your children."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The first half of this book is the authors struggles held in a Nazi prison camp during the second world war. No matter how many times we here these stories they still hit you hard. But to survive the atrocities commited in these situations takes a mental attitude of the most extreme strength.The second half of this book is a term called logotherapy. The Doctor decribes this as how are thought patterns can make us or break us in intense situations. How some prisoners lost all hope and eventually died or got sick. And how some just continued to hope and made it. It tries to describe the meaning of life that man is always asking himself. The doctor actually says that the meaning of life is the meaning that you give it in any certain situations. I like that philosophy. Other than that the basic concept I got from it is you think your way to happiness or gloom."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I think Frankl is a excellent writer and therapist. He makes several valid points about how man should go about finding meaning in his life. I especially like how he presented the Meaning of Suffering to the depressed doctor with the analogy of what if the wife died first? Essentially saying that the husband is saving the wife from having to suffer his death by the husband suffering the death of his wife. It is a justified way of looking at suffering. Logotherapy is all about finding meaning in life and the book explains just that but only after a very long, depressing section on his stay at Auschwitz. Although this section is somewhat dry, it is necessary to understnad where he gets his point of view for the remainder of the book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This may be the only negative review of this book, but there needs to be a first for everything. This book started off great, recollections of the tradgedies and sufferings that the author (Viktor Frankl) experienced in numerous German concentration camps during the second World War. But the first section, describing the actual war, was intriguing and kept me reading. But with the introduction of Logotherapy, the book started to go downhill, and I lost interest in it, as logotherapy and an in-depth view of human reactions just isn't my thing. So, if you're into psychological text, this is your book, but if you're the action/suspense kind of book reader, you can read the first section. This was just a disappointment after the first section."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I am not one who reads as much as many of you. My time is spent mostly \\"doing\\", as opposed to reading about doing. That said, I selected this book to read as one that I thought would be useful and enlightening. While it did provide some insights to the inner workings of the mind, it fell short of my expectations.To me, the content did not represent that which was implied by the title. Furthermore, the first half of the book relating to the authors experiences in a concentration camp, was severely disconnected with the second part of the book, which was basically, a self help phychoanalysis book. Both parts were interesting to a degree, but I did not think that they complimented each other.

Frankly, if coming from a concentration camp inmate, I don't think anyone has any right to suggest that is not a valid position.Any camp memoir has plenty of examples of the arbitrariness of who got to live and who got to die. Frankl survived by pure chance several times. I don't think we can accept his insinuation that those circumstances were somehow due to his wonderful philosophies.I am genuinely pleased for him that he found something that worked for him in the face of the annihilation of his family, and the book is indeed full of inspiring ways of looking at the world. However I find it simplistic in the extreme and bordering on the offensive that he seems to believe that what worked for him can and should work for everyone else, particularly when he uses the behaviours of those who gave up and/or died for other reasons (occasionally he seems to blur the distinction) as an example of how not to live.I also find his little nuggets of wisdom and anecdotes of how with a simple sentence he turned patients' lives around to be extremely obnoxious. Ditto his unfortunate insinuation that the only thing that can give a woman's life meaning is to have children."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I am not a very avid reader and find it difficult to complete a book.

While it is my personal belief that this is especially true in relationship to God, Francl demonstrates that it applies not only to the spiritual, but to every aspect of living. Even in the unimaginable conditions common in the German concentration camps of world war II, people survived by focusing on the needs of others or doing some greater good.

Even though Frankl was not telling all of the many horrors of concentration camp life, the few details he shares are enough to make one cringe. Human depravity has led to many horrific events, such as the concentration camps. The overall message of this book was that of finding meaning in life. As a Christian, this fits very well with a biblical worldview. Even though Frankl falls a bit short of what the Bible teaches on the issue, he nevertheless brings out many valid points about life in general. The second half of the book, which seeks to summarize logotherapy, was not as good as the first half of the book. Going from personal reflection on his time in the concentration camps, Frankl provides the overall framework for his therapy of, finding meaning in life. I would definitely recommend this book and enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Every student of psychology should read this at least once.

Maybe I should have read this 20 years ago and I would have had a different slant, but I have grown weary of listening to victims believing that by surviving the ordeal and then telling the story that they are somehow making up for the less than human behavior they exhibited. The holocaust was inexcusable. I just didn't feel like I learned anything new from this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Great books are often great testimonies. This is one. Frankl's message is not so much about man's inhumanity to man as about how everyday life in the Nazi death camp was reflected in the minds of the prisoners. Beyond that, what can his experiences mean to us today? A great deal, writes Frankl: \\"Do not think that these considerations are unworldly and too far removed from real life. It is true that ... of the prisoners only a few kept their full inner liberty and obtained those values which their suffering afforded, but even one such example is sufficient proof that man's inner strength may raise him above his outward fate. Such men are not only in concentration camps.\\" What has this to do with Abraham Maslow's concept of self-actualization? And, what are the metavalues Dr. Frankl referred to? Why, of course, Truth, Beauty and Goodness: \\"... by experiencing something--such as goodness, truth, and beauty--by experiencing nature and culture or, last but not least, by experiencing another human being in his uniqueness--by loving him ... by love [we are] enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, to see that which is potential in him; which is not yet actualized but which ought to be actualized ... By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, [we help make] these potentialities come true.\\" Too bad these contemporary geniuses and champions of the invincible human spirit, Frankl and Malow never met. Readers who are taken by Viktor Frankl's remarkable testimony in Man's Search for Meaning may want to examine his first book, the precious manuscript the Nazi's confiscated and he recreated shortly after WWII ended. Originally titled \\"The Unconscious God,\\" it has been republished as \\"Man's Search for Ultimate Meaning.\\" Written for his peers, and not laypersons, it is a challenge to read. But it is also a spiritual gem of equal value to Man's Search for Meaning."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Professor Gordon W. Allport writes in the preface to Dr. Victor Frankl's book, \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" that, \\"A psychiatrist who personally has faced such extremity is a psychiatrist worth listening to\\". I could not agree more.With a gentle yet critical eye, Dr. Frankl documents in great detail the physical, emotional and psychological conditions endured by the prisoners of Nazi concentration camps during the insanity of the second World War, based on first-hand experience. Although of Jewish background, Dr. Frankl presents a perspective more secular than religious, with values that all humanity can identify with and learn from, yet he never disregards the possibilities inherent in something \\"higher\\" than human understanding.The book is divided into two parts. The first - \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp\\" - is Frankl's autobiographical narrative, while the second part - \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\" - contains a brief summary of the system of psychotherapy that Frankl developed throughout his life. The style of writing does not appreciably change between the sections, and the language is relatively simple and pleasant to read, which I always take as a sign of a talented author.The experiences that Frankl describes make for fascinating and shocking reading. The level of deprivation and brutality the prisoners were subjected to does not seem comprehensible at times, and yet Frankl's humble and matter-of-fact style insists upon the reader's serious attention. As well as the anecdotes of concentration camp life, Frankl outlines various psychological states and phases experienced by prisoners - both those who did and did not survive. Interestingly, he also classifies people into two distinct types based on the conditions - the \\"race\\" of the \\"decent man\\" and the \\"indecent man\\", and these \\"races\\" were seen in all groups - Jew, Nazi, guard or prisoner. Frankl's observations along these lines seem especially interesting when viewed in the context of Ponerology.Although Frankl's work carries a warning of the suffering and misery that human beings can allow to be perpetrated on a mass scale, his writing always turns to the optimistic, hopeful and meaningful, and what can be learned through suffering. Indeed, his system of psychotherapy - logotherapy - is based on hope and finding meaning. The second part of the book contains more information on this.I strongly recommend this book to anyone with the even the slightest interest in psychology or history. Well written, insightful and touching, its success to date shows clearly that Dr Frankl has overcome immense suffering and touched something of the human soul in his life and work. He stands as an inspiration to all who aspire to express the creative aspects of Existence."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Very simply, a book everyone should read.There's no point saying more than that, because Frankl says it himself.Go, read, reflect, be enriched."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning is considered among the most influential works of psychiatric literature since Freud.It begins with a moving personal essay about Frankl's imprisonment in Auschwitz and other concentration camps for five years, and his struggle during this time to find reasons to live. The second part of the book describes the psychotherapeutic method that Frankl pioneered as a result of his experiences in the concentration camps and the resulting belief that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose. The profound lessons for me from this book are key messages in my workshops and in my book and audio book,Managing Thought: How Do Your Thoughts Rule Your World?-- that what we think is a matter of choice, that no one else and nothing else is responsible or to blame for what we choose to think; and that thoughts of purpose and possibility are powerful thoughts that bring us peace and inspire us and connect us with our highest awareness."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The 4:8 Principle: The Secret to a Joy-Filled LifeThis is an excellent book that continues to impact and influence a new generation of readers.

His experiences and observations, ultimately leading to an incredible understanding of human nature.Though he experienced unimaginable tragedy and adversity, he nontheless realized great truth. After reading and even re-reading his story, it is hard to imagine he authored these famous words, \\"The one thing you can't take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me.

I will treasure it always."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Part essay about his time in the concentrations camps, part psychiatric tract based on those experiences, Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning is one of the most important books I've read. It is not surprising that there are more than 12M copies in print and that it's been named one of the ten most influential books.In the first 100 pages, Frankl recounts the time he spent in the camps from 1942-1945. Anyone who has read other accounts of the camps or seen movies of them knows the depravities there. But Frankl's account is somewhat unique in that he approaches the experience as a psychiatrist, in a very clinical fashion, only using emotion here and there to spice his writing. His writing is perceptive, showing a keen empathy for not only those who were heroic in such places, but also those who were not. This goes for both the prisoners as well as the German guards. He explains the psychology of lowered expectations, how a simple de-lousing, for example, could be the source of so much happiness for the prisoners. And given the title, it's not surprising he spends much time talking about meaning. The whole premise of his book is that humans are driven by their search for meaning. And in these pages, he demonstrates how meaning in a prisoner's life, whether it be a family to get back home to or work still left to be done, literally was the difference between life and death in many cases.This leads to the second part of the book, called Logotherapy in a Nutshell. Logotherapy is a therapy Frankl pioneered after his experiences in the camps. In it, a patient is \`actually confronted with and reoriented toward the meaning of his life'. He talks of the existential vacuum, in which so many people now languish due to the complexity of having so many choices and a lack of traditions to fall back on. Logotherapy simplifies this for us. According to it, meaning can come from three places: creating work or doing deeds, experiencing something or encountering someone (love), 3) or by our attitude to unavoidable suffering.To me, this puts logotherapy in the realm of religion, especially eastern religion. It's about human transcendence. Frankl says here that we derive meaning by helping others (through deeds or work), putting another above ourselves (loving someone), or by seeing unavoidable suffering as something of meaning in its own right. These ideas seem Buddhist to me, and in this case I applaud the convergence of science and spirituality in a space that needs it.I found this book inspirational. The experiences of the concentration camps by themselves are enough to put matters in harsh perspective for anyone living in freedom. But Frankl's expanding of this information into a book that can help so many others is a fine example of his own theories. We are lucky to have such a work available to us."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a must read for all those \\"woe is me\\" people always complaining about everything. Man's Search for Meaning will enlighten you to what \\"having a bad day\\" really means. I applaud Viktor Frankl for his inner strength to survive such an ordeal and come away with such dignity and inner peace."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.\\"What is the meaning of life? Frankl try's to answer that through his experience as a prisoner in a concentration camp in Auschwitz (among others) and in his psychiatry practice after the war. Be it by grace, a miracle, or chance, he made it out alive. And now he is here to tell this powerful, optimistic story and help us with an age old question.He try's to answer this question: \\" How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?\\" This would later influence psychotherapy. Even being surrounded by so much evil there was still kindness to be found in an occasional guard. The prisoners were not always kind to there fellow inmates: there were sellouts and CAPO's; Capo's were Jews that watched over their fellow captives for favors, food, and extended life. Who is to say what any one of us would do. With misery and suffering beyond comprehension, \\"having a why to live for enabled them to bear the how\\". I will never look at that last leftover pea the same way.Writing on his concentration camp experience Frankl briefly discusses \\"logotherepy\\". In a later chapter he goes into detail: Logotherepy (which he coined), the \\"striving to find a meaning in ones life is the primary motivational force in man\\". In his practice he uses a form of reverse psychology. The last chapter is on optimism during tragedy.Freedom is only part of the story, he writes: \\"I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast\\"There are many quotables from Frankl, I will leave you with this: \\"Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.\\"In the end, there is that need for a reason.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"He was a concentration camp survivor; he is a psychologist/doctor.

I will always remember Dr. Frankl and his story when I am sad or suffering. I will also never forget the Holocaust, it was good hearing about it from an ex-prisoners experience and not just hearing about all the brutality and horror. Frankl's book is split into two sections, the 1st half is him telling about his experiences as a POW, but it is not only horror stories, he also tells you how he and other prisoners were feeling. The 2nd half is more about his philosophies on the meaning of life. Frankl's Nazi Concentration Camp stories are very interesting, they were sad, but I enjoyed reading them. It also gave what the rest of the book was about great meaning. It made you definitely realize what suffering was about. For me, I listened more to what he had to say because he told you his stories. Had I only read the 2nd half of the book, I really would not have understood so much exactly what he meant by suffering. However the 2nd half of the book was harder to follow. This is the only complaint I had about the book. Some things he said did not have much meaning to me- in one ear and out the other, perhaps if I were a psychologist I would have understood more! When he told stories, gave examples or it meant something in my life, then it had meaning. Also, if I could relate it back to the 1st half of the book it meant something. The main points that I got out of the book were:People survive the worse conditions by knowing their life has meaningIf people give up, they dieThe book makes you understand reasons for suffering and helps you overcome itSuffering has value if it lets us see the meaning in our livesI really enjoyed reading Dr. Frankl's book and I would recommend it to others.

Perhaps it's because I AM Jewish, but, I really understood, found depth in life and understanding.

What a brillant man, to not only survive a true living hell, but to rise above and become such a great person, author, doctor!! May heaven have that special place for him where he can now find all his loved ones.amber, 41Colorado"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is divided into two parts. The first part is a mesmerizing and horrifying account of Victor Frankl's suffering and agony while imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps. His analysis of why some died and why some survived the camps is encapsulated by Nietzshe's words, \\"He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how\\". In other words, people who had religious faith, or someone to love, or something beyond just themselves to live for, were much more likely to survive.This forms the springboard for the second half of the book, \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\", which is the theory of psychiatry that he developed as a result of his experiences in the concentration camps. In it, he argues that \\"man's search for meaning is the primary motivation of his life\\", and that people exist in an existential vacuum unless they can find meaning through \\"creating a work or deed... by experiencing or encountering someone... by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering\\". In other words, a person finds meaning in life by \\"giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love\\".The book describes the Hell created by a brutal twentieth century religion, National Socialism. It also discusses Man's need for the transcendent in his life. There is an inherent contradiction in the book, because the Nazis were inspired to create a transcendent vision of life (at least in part by Nietzsche), which gave them a \\"why\\" to live. This also affected \\"how\\" they lived, engaging in activities such as building concentration camps, invading Poland, etc etc. These were evil deeds: clearly the \\"why\\" and the \\"how\\" both matter. Frankl gives us no guidelines on how to judge and defend ourselves from various manifestations of the \\"will to meaning\\" that create false, brutal, dehumanizing ideologies and religions. The Reader is should be aware of the limitations of Frankl's book and of logotherapy."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is full of philosophical insights. Based on the author's experiences in German concentration camps during the second world war, Viktor Frankl gives the reader a greater understanding of happiness in life by showing how people can find meaning not only through love and serving others, but even through hardship and suffering. He mentions how although the majority of people in the camps became depressed and bitter because of their trials, there were others who preserved a spark of hope by turning their focus of attention outward. This is an inspiring book full of valuable lessons."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl, who survived the concentration camps, writes that suffering is inevitable and that avoiding suffering is futile. Rather, one should be worthy of one's suffering and make meaning of it instead of surrendering to nihilism, bitterness and despair. He uses poetic, moving anecdotes from the concentration camps to illustrate those souls who find a deeper humanity from their suffering or who become animals relegated to nothing more than teeth-clenched self-preservation. Though not specifically religious, this masterpiece has a religious purpose--to help us find meaning. This book succeeds immeasurably."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I purchased \\"Mans Search for meaning\\" because Amazon suggested it after I read \\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel. I began to read it, and at first it seemed quite a bit like \\"Night\\" (which was a terrific book may I mention). As you read on after his story of being in the Concentration Camp, he begins to talk about how he was able to handle being in the position in which he was. This is when the book begins to hit you differently! It feels like he is talking directly to you. Trying to help guide you in a better direction than what your life may be leading. It makes you want to be and do better! I believe everyone gets something different and the same from \\"Man Search for Meaning\\". It helped me, I now feel like my life is going in the right direction, thanks to Viktor E Frankl. I highly recommend this book! Make time to read it, there's so much power in such a small book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Victor Frankl was an existentialist. The existentialists went out of fashion in psychiatry because they were equated with a \`be glad you're neurotic\\" approach, and denial of the reality of mental illness. This was bad for the psychiatry business, although several existentialists made a living as psychiatrists.The book is in two halves; the first describes his concentration camp experiences, the second his method of psychotherapy (or rather his philosophy of life) which he called logotherapy. The first half is not irrelevant to the second half. Some psychologists, such as Abraham Maslow, with his hierarchy of needs, suggest that issues like search for meaning are just icing on the cake of life. They become irrelevant when the chips are down. A starving man does not worry about the state of world politics. Frankl's experiences taught him that the will to go on living comes from some kind of inner force that is not just an animal survival instinct.Is logotherapy really a treatment method, or should we consider this book as self-help? I think it is more useful as a book for patients than as a manual for therapists, although I hope it doesn't persuade them to throw away their Prozac. It is full of illuminating insights and I found myself underlining many passages. Some of the actual techniques described, such as negative practice for obsessive rituals are more akin to behavior therapy than insight-oriented psychotherapy. He describes several one-shot cures brought about by philosophical utterances which may have worked for him but are in the category of \\"don't try this at home\\" for less charismatic practitioners. His ideas about anhedonia and boredom are good."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Dr. Frankl's book of Man's Search for Meaning, was written by him in only nine days.

Dr. Frankl, an existentialist psychotherapist, has a great outlook on life and is a religious man who through his trying experiences can help others get through bad times.The first part of the book describes his pain and suffering in concentration camps and \\"the why and the how\\" he made it through the injustices unfairly brought upon him. His mother, father, brother and wife all died in the concentration camps. But, it was only when he got home that he found out their destiny. With all the pain and suffering that occurred, his will to live endured because of his research which gave meaning to his life.Logotherapy, was covered in the second part of the book.

In the first part of Man's Search for Meaning, Experiences in a Concentration Camp, Frankl engrosses the reader the feelings and general experience of the average concentration camp prisoner. He does not focus on the horrific details of the camps, but rather, he poignantly expresses the psychological state produced by these experiences. The second part of the book, Logotherapy in a Nutshell, is a brief overview of the system of psychology that Frankl founded. The third part of the book, The Case for a Tragic Optimism, was added to the 1984 edition and is based off one of Frankl's 1983 lectures. In it, Frankl expounds logotherapy a little further. This work has won its place in history. In conjunction with being one of the main texts in the field of logotherapy, its gripping description on the concentration camps makes it not only compelling but also highly informative. This is a must read for anyone who has ever put thought into psychology, spirituality, or the meaning of life. Man's Search for Meaning is well written and not difficult to read.

Frankl's highly personal account of war crimes and his practical logotherapy that resulted deserves careful reading - he earned that respect with blood - and for military or law enforcement professionals who are burdened with the worst of humanity, Frankl offers mature understanding and legitimate hope for us all.

We, humans have this curiosity to discover ourselves and if we don't really put an effort to find an answer, we at least put a lot of effort in hiding and forgetting this maddening quest. It takes various forms, from intoxication and debauchery to art and science. But, there is no peace until we find an answer to this question that we have in our mind. The lives of great geniuses of the past and all their sad stories stand witness to my above hypothesis. We feel victimized by the society or god for some reason or the other. But least do we realize that irrespective of all the tumult that happens around, we are bestowed with something that the rest of the animal kingdom doesn't have-spiritual freedom.

In a nutshell, and if you aren't feeling like reading a more or less long review, the main idea of this book is that \\"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how\\".The above quoted phrase is from Nietzsche, but don't jump to conclusions: Viktor Frankl (1905-1997) certainly does not share his philosophical ideas. Frankl merely chose one of Nietzsche's phrases as a way to crystallize his own ideas: that is, that the most important force in a person's life is his will to meaning. In a way, this book shows how Frankl reached that conclusion.The first part of \\"Man's search for meaning\\" deals with the author's experiences in a Nazi concentration camp, and the lessons he draw from that torturous experience. Frankl said that those that survived had one thing in common, a purpose, and that \\"everything can be taken from man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way no matter the circumstance\\".In the second part of this book, Frankl explains logotheraphy, the theory of psychotherapy he developed. According to the author, logotherapy focuses on the meaning of human existence as well as on a person's search for such meaning, and the consequent purpose. Frankl says that \\"The meaning of life always changes, but... it never ceases to be\\", and that we really find ourselves when we find it, or at least our own personal version of it. Furthermore, he also says that \\"the meaning of our existence is not invented by ourselves, but rather detected,\\" and that logos, or \\"meaning\\", is not only merely something emerging from existence itself but rather something confronting said existence. The author also points out that logotherapy gives great importance to responsibility, due to the fact that \\"each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.\\"It is pertinent to highlight the fact that logotheraphy differs strongly from other two well-known schools of psychoteraphy, Freudian psychoanalysis (that centers on the will to pleasure), and Adlerian psychology (that focuses on the will to power). From my point of view, Frankl perspective makes for a much better explanation...All in all, I highly recommend this book. I like the central place that Frankl gives to responsibility, and the idea that man \\"does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment\\". In my opinion, \\"Man's search for meaning\\" is interesting, but specially and most importantly, it makes sense...Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Since its first publication in 1946, Viktor E. Frankl's landmark book has sold over two million copies. From his horrific experiences in Nazi death camps, Frankl has extracted a moving, uplifting message of that uniquely human longing: the need for meaning. Frankl delves into the depths of his own experience to extricate a highly provocative and extraordinary suggestion; that man's primary motivating force is his search for meaning. Frankl holds that man cannot exist or live with any hope or joy if he cannot find meaning to do so.Frankl's stays in Auschwitz and Dachu provided him with the opportunity to examine human behavior under the most strenuous of circumstances. He was able to separate himself from his emotions and allow himself to examine his compatriots in the light of his psychoanalytical training. The account of his time in the camps veers away from recounting the terrible events, towards focusing instead on the prisoners' reactions to them; the way they coped and how some survived where others couldn't.Frankl's book is composed of several parts. The first section is a narrative of his concentration camp experiences. The second and third sections of the book summarize and expand upon his new form of therapy; logotherapy. The basic tenant of his logotherapy is the concept that the primary motivating force in a man's life is his search for meaning. Hence, the title of the book. Frankl illustrates his new concept through many examples. From the men joking in the trenches they were digging to his meditation on his wife and his love for her. Frankl kept himself alive through his dedication to optimism and his hope for the future. He calls his optimism, \`tragic optimism' for it is only through the experience of tragedy, Frankl says, that we can come to know the extent of our imagination and thus, our optimism. Frankl says that this tragic optimism is borne only out of dire situation such as his experience.In the latter half of the book, Frankl goes on to explain his new philosophy and therapy model. He uses the example of the man who decided not to work one day in the camp to illustrate how some men found the will to live and others did not. He holds that this will to live is created as a direct result of a man's desire for meaning and the ensuing search for the same. He explains that a human's reaction to a gives set of circumstances is not defiantly controllable. A man's emotional reaction and response are fluid and private; unable to be controlled by any external force lesser than his own internal will.While not discussing his ideas in religious terms, per se, Frankl's Jewish identity seeps through the books lines and becomes quite evident at times. While it may be difficult to reconcile strict existentialism with true Judaism, Frankl's devotion to his faith and to his theory are, quite evidently, equal. While he usually discusses an inner being and an \`emotional centre', Frankl's language sometimes slips back into his common tongue and he refers to this \\"centre\\" as a soul.This book is a wonderful investment. Its succinct and direct analysis of the human condition is an easy read for even the most novice. It explains the concepts of logotherapy in language that is unencumbered by complexities of language or technical terminology. Frankl was a common man writing for others in his style. Initially intended to be published anonymously, Man's Search for Meaning is as deep and profound an analysis of the human condition as there has ever been. Written by a man on the forefront of a disaster of epic proportions, it provides the reader with a refreshing gust of clear reasoning and profound opportunity for self-analysis and self-improvement."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is simultaneusly a chronicle, a pshychology essay, an ethical treaty, and a quite effective medicine against suffering.The first part is about the author's experinces in some nazi concentration camps, from a psychiatrist point of view.

One of his categorical conclusions is that there are only two kinds of human reces: the decent human beings and the non decent ones.This first part of the book (originally planned to be the whole book) serves as a basis for the second part where the basics of logotherapy are explained. Regardles wheter or not a reader agrees with the psychiatry ideas on the second part, what resulted evident to me is that those ideas can be enormously helpful for people that are suffering deeply.

He is most commonly thought of as the founder of \\"logotherapy,\\" the third \\"Viennese School of Psychotherapy,\\" Freud and Adler being earlier founders of psychoanalytic and individual psychology respectively.SYNOPSIS OF THE BOOK:The book is divided into two parts. The preface to the first edition is by Gordon W. Allport (1897-1967), at the time of the first edition, former professor of psychology at Harvard. Allport was chiefly responsible for the spread of Frankl's logotherapy within the U.S.[1]The preface to the 1984 edition is by Frankl himself. In that preface, Frankl explains the relationship between the two parts of the book. The first half is a story of life in a concentration camp and serves as the existential validation of the second, theoretical half of the book, which is Frankl's introduction to \\"logotherapy.\\"In the first half, Frankl relates some of his own experiences during World War II, during which he spent time in three concentration camps, including Auschwitz and Dachau. He divides the first half of the book according to the three phases of life he and others experienced in their internment in the camps: (1) the initial shock of camp life, (2) the routine of camp life, and (3) the experience and aftermath of freedom. Highlights are as follows:From the beginning, camp life is dominated by a sociological structure made up of Capos (collaborators who rule over other prisoners), other prominent prisoners (e.g., cooks, storekeepers, doctors, nurses, and camp policemen), foremen, wardens, and theSchutzstaffel (SS). At the bottom are ordinary prisoners. Despite the hierarchy and the evil it represents, no group is entirely villainous. Humanity is made up of two \\"races\\" -- the decent and the indecent -- and they are found at every level. The mere fact that a person is a member of a particular group does not indicate to which \\"race\\" he may belong.At first, prisoners experience hopelessness mixed with \\"delusions of reprieve.\\" Homesickness and nostalgia are intense. Abnormal responses to abnormal circumstances are pervasive and entirely normal. Everything conspires to eliminate the basic humanity of victims -- yet some manage to rise above the downward pull of bestial circumstances. But sadly, as Frankl says, \\"the best of us did not survive.\\"As camp life becomes routine, grim humor and cold detachment take hold. The world outside the prison camp becomes unreal. The torture of others no longer provokes sympathy or revulsion. Apathy and the blunting of emotions become functional in making inmates insensitive to routine beatings. The sole task becomes survival. For most inmates, inner life is reduced to its most primitive state. Lack of sleep, lack of food, sickness, mistreatment, and hard labor amplify irritability. Violence begets violence among those who are routinely violated. Food dominates dreams and conversation. A few even resort to cannibalism. Yet politics and religion remain topics of intense conversation. Inmates still join each other in appreciating the beauties of nature. Amazingly, art and entertainment still survive, while sexual deviancy is strikingly absent in their all-male environment.The most telling influence of all is the \\"provisional existence\\" inmates experience in not knowing if or when their confinement will end. Psychic time runs counter to actual time. Days seem to last forever, but weeks pass quickly.In the midst of it all, some inmates manage to maintain an inner hold that helps them rise above their degrading environment. In so doing, they bear witness to the reality of human liberty despite the unimaginable constraints of camp life. In the worst of circumstances, humans still have a choice. Present existence can still have meaning in the face of profound and unavoidable suffering. Opportunities and challenges are continually present. It is always possible to make something positive of life -- even life in a concentration camp. In Frankl's words, \\"it does not really matter what we expect from life, but rather what life expects from us.\\" In contrast, those who lose faith in their future are doomed.Liberation from camp life has its own dangers. Surprisingly, it does not come with overwhelming gladness, but with timidity and with depersonalization. Prisoners have to relearn joy. The sudden release of enormous mental pressure puts inmates at risk of moral and spiritual deformity. Liberty does not mean the prisoners do not need spiritual care. The oppressed have almost irresistible temptations to become oppressors. Bitterness comes from disappointed expectations of how great release would be. The dreams that kept prisoners going in the dark days of imprisonment clash with the reality of loved ones who no longer exist. Disillusionment comes when inmates learn that suffering does not cease. Eventually the experience of camp life becomes unreal -- more like a nightmare than something that really happened. But in the end, former inmates have the comforting realization they have nothing left to fear except their God.Man's Search for Meaning differs from Frankl's original intention in two important respects. He originally intended only to write the first half of the book as an anonymous account, content simply to have his unattributed experiences of deepest suffering demonstrate the possibility of finding meaning in life despite the worst of circumstances. His friends, however, convinced him to add his name as author and his publisher requested he add a description of the basic tenets of logotherapy and a bibliography, the former of which constitutes Part II of the present work. The 1984 edition addresses more recent concerns in a postscript entitled \\"The Case for a Tragic Optimism.\\"REFLECTIONS:Logotherapy provides deep insight into the basic nature of humanity. Its tenets are so easily taken for granted that Frankl's contribution seems to be, not so much as telling people something new, but more for articulating so well what they knew all along. The idea that humans cannot survive without meaning has explanatory power that can hardly be questioned. As Frankl says, \\"suffering ceases to be suffering once it has meaning.\\" And to paraphrase him, suffering is not a prerequisite to meaning, but meaning can be found even in suffering.Logotherapy is valuable in highlighting absence of meaning as a common source of psychological problems. Frankl is astute in seeing meaninglessness as the motive behind destructive pursuits of pleasure and the constant need for more and more entertainment.[2] There is little doubt that boredom,[3] depression, aggression, and addiction[4] are often traceable to a loss of meaning. It is useful to see such problems as possibly arising, not from psychodynamics, but from Frankl's \\"noodynamics\\" and the \\"existential vacuum\\" that meaninglessness entails. Frankl's examples of how quickly aggression within a group is \\"cured\\" by a collective task and how rapidly depression gives way in the face of new meaning to life are compelling. He is right in observing that people may have the \\"means to live,\\" but they are in deep trouble if they do not have a \\"meaning to live.\\" Most people will agree (although they may not act accordingly) that happiness cannot be obtained by pursuing it directly. Rather, as Frankl points out, it must ensue as an unsought consequence of pursuing something else.Logotherapy provides a useful counterpoint to much of Freudian psychology. Freud predicted starvation would reduce people to an identical urge. But Frankl found that starvation heightened the distinctions among individuals rather than diminishing them. Freudian psychology equates length of treatment with the depth of cure. But logotherapy suggests the possibility of deep and lasting benefits from the shortest of consultations. Freud sought cures in introspection and retrospection. But logotherapy finds answers to problems by looking outside oneself and to the future. Freud saw the deepest motive of humans as a \\"will to pleasure.\\" But logotherapy sees the most basic need as a \\"will to meaning.\\"[5] Freud saw inner tension as a problem in itself. But logotherapy sees inner tension as healthy in leading to the resolution of existential frustration through the discovery of meaning in individual situations. Freud provided modernism's third blow to human dignity[6] in challenging human free will. But logotherapy holds that humans always have a choice.Frankl is a realist and an optimist in arguing that, although humans are not free from circumstances, they are free to take a stand against circumstances. He is provocative in asserting that no circumstances exist that can rob humans of all freedom. He opposes reductionist understandings of humanity in affirming the main characteristic of humans as the ability to rise above determinants -- determinants that Freudian psychology would find insurmountable. As Frankl says, \\"man invented the gas chambers, but it was also man who entered those chambers with head held high.\\"On the surface, Frankl's assertion of the \\"unconditional meaningfulness of life\\" sounds troubling in apparently asserting meaningfulness for all choices, good and evil. The phrase is best understood, however, in opposing nihilism, which asserts that nothing has meaning. Frankl would probably say that even bad choices have significance -- how much more the good ones!Frankl correctly points out that humans find meaning in three kinds of choices: (1) through deeds or actions, (2) through encounters with something or someone, and (3) through their attitudes toward unavoidable suffering. The latter is most important in religious matters because it is the fact of suffering that calls God's goodness or even His existence into question.[7] For religious people, the personal meaning of particular situations is inseparable from the meaning of those same situations to God. For them, the search for meaning is the pursuit of what God intends in a particular circumstance.So Frankl's denial of any absolute meaning for a given situation may be a bit problematic for religious people who are accustomed to thinking of one big divine Master Plan that comprehends and judges every decision. That apparent dilemma can be resolved, however, by appreciating the radical nature of human freedom. True righteousness does not mean choosing the one right course of action out of a multitude of wrong ones, but rather pursuing one choice out of many equally good choices with an attitude of faith.[8]Of course, non-religious people need logotherapy too. Logotherapy is well-suited to an increasingly secular Western world where psychiatrists are increasingly encountering, not cases of disease, but questions of meaning. Unfortunately, many psychiatrists have been educated, as Frankl notes, into a philosophy of nihilism, which they in turn pass on to their patients with tragic results. They are also wrongly trained to see human beings as \\"brain machines.\\" They are too inclined to debunk that which is truly human in terms of it being simply a mask or facade for subconscious mechanisms.[9] So logotherapy provides a needed corrective for both secular patients and their secular care-givers in its \\"re-humanizing\\" of psychology.Frankl disavows any dogmatism in logotherapy. Although Jewish, he easily speaks of \\"crosses to bear.\\" Frankl's eclectic impulse is evidenced in his adoption of techniques that have no necessary connection to logotherapy itself. An example would be \\"pseudo-orientation in time\\" -- a strategy of clarifying decision making by adopting a future stance looking back on a present decision. Another would be \\"paradoxical intention\\" -- a treatment of disorders (e.g., stuttering, insomnia) by intentionally trying to incite them (hyper-intention). A third would be \\"dereflection\\" -- a treatment for hyper-reflection and hyper-intention.One of Frankl's most intriguing thoughts is his assertion that man is most human when focused on something outside himself. Couple that notion with the idea that man is made in the image of God and the result fits perfectly with the self-emptying nature of Christ in the \\"kenosis hymn\\" in chapter 2 of Philippians. Moreover, it should not be surprising that the good theology of Philippians 2 finds expression in physicalities of God's good creation. For we see humans who are made in the image of God endowed with the same kenotic impulse -- the same need to empty themselves for the sake of something outside themselves. Achieving that transcendence is healthy. Failing it is dysfunctional.Compared to existentialists in general, Frankl is more optimistic, less nihilistic, and more accommodating to the notion of God than most. But his is an odd form of existentialism in those respects. Existentialism and traditional Christianity do not mix very well. Existentialists say, \\"existence comes before meaning\\" -- i.e., no meaning exists until humans create it. Christianity says just the opposite -- \\"meaning comes before [human] existence\\" -- God has imposed a meaning on human life in advance of human existence. Therein lies the friction. Frankl, like all existentialists, comes down on the side of the notion that humans create \\"the good\\" by choosing. A better, Christian alternative is the idea that the real choice for humans is not whether \\"to create 'the good' by choosing\\" but rather to \\"to enter into 'the good' God has already chosen.\\"Present-day preoccupation with the \\"search for meaning\\" is a rather recent development. Gerhard Sauter[10] thinks it comes from the loss of a common story that religion, tradition, law, and community once provided. In times past, people did not have to \\"give meaning\\" to their lives because their shared understanding of past, present, and eternity had already done so in advance. Many people today, however, have no \\"story\\" but the one they create for themselves -- thus the prevalence of Frankl's existential vacuum. The answer to that vacuum is to discard the credo of individualism and return to the biblical story shared within a biblical community.-- Bill Brewer[...]NOTES:[1] See the publisher's note beneath the preface.[2] Readers should consider Richard Winters' book,Still Bored in a Culture of Entertainment, for a Christian psychiatrist's view of the symptoms, causes, and cures of existential emptiness.[3] Use of entertainment to alleviate boredom avoids the hard task of making sense of life. Use of drugs to dull existential frustration in the depressed does the same thing. Logotherapy would work on the problem by creating tension in the life of the bored and the depressed, not resolve it. Frankl's illustration in this regard of fortifying an arch by putting more weight on it is a good one.[4] Frankl's belief that the libido runs wild in the presence of an existential vacuum matches everyday observation.[5] Frankl says the search for meaning is primary -- it is not simply a rationalization for Freudian hydraulic forces operating within the subconscious.[6] Copernicus argued that humans were not at the center of the universe. 2. Darwin argued that humans were not different from the animals. 3. Freud argued that humans are not even in control of their own minds.[7] Suffering is especially good at exposing an existential vacuum that might otherwise remain hidden.[8] Of course there are moral boundaries, but they are not necessarily narrow.[9] Frankl is superb in noting, \\"'I would not be willing to live merely for the sake of my 'defense mechanisms,' nor would I be ready to die merely for the sake of my 'reaction formations.' Man, however, is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values!'\\"[10] Gerhard Sauter,The Question of Meaning: A Theological and Philosophical Orientation, trans. and ed. by Geoffrey W. Bromiley (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1995), passim."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I thought this was a great book. Caveat: you better be interested in psychology and not merely a historical narration of Auschwitz. There's a lot of pscyhology in this book...and to me that made it great. I didn't give it 5 stars because it didn't floor me. Unfortunately, it'd been built up way too much by the person who recommended it to me. However, if you come in with no real expectations, i think you'll love it (so long as you're interested in both historical events and related pscyhological aspects)."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have read this book many, many times. These are the words I live by. If I was told that I could only own one book for the rest of my life, this would be it. Viktor Frankl's harrowing testimony of surviving in a concentration camp seems incomprehensible. Even more unbelievable is the attitude he adopts during his struggle as he remains apart from his family, starving, cold, and forced to perform hard labor with no relief in sight. Through it all, he decides that even though his body is being held captive, he is still free to control his mind and his attitude.When he is ultimately liberated from the concentration camp, rather than be bitter and remorseful, he uses his tragic experiences as a basis for logotherapy, a counseling theory that helps people to find meaning in their adversity. He also influences a generation of existential psychotherapists including another favorite writer of mine, Irvin Yalom. This is an incredible book that significantly altered my life and way of thinking. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"One of main idea of the book, an idea that is quite enlightening when you read it from Frankl's perspective, is that that you can have everything stripped from you: your family, your clothes, your food, your freedom, your rights, everything, but there is one thing that no one can ever take from you, and that's how you choose to respond to those situations. When we realize there is a higher purpose for living, and we want to live, we will find ways to make it through. No matter the circumstances.Very powerful stuff!This book is about Frankl's experience through his time in a concentration camp during World War II and how he managed to survive when hundreds of thousands did not. Frankl lived through the very core of camp life. It was horrific and he was staring death in the eyes every day. To live through this dreadful experience is amazing in itself, but Frankl came out with more than just horror stories. He came out of it with the knowledge that there was a reason for his existence, for mankind's existence, and he passed on that knowledge to millions.The first half of this book tells us about POW camp life; the other half of the book is about what Frankl learned. The concepts are universal, and you've probably heard them before, but Frankl puts them in a way that is new and so enlightening you can't help but live your life in a whole new way.Frankl's book is a must read for anyone who is feeling low with overwhelming thoughts that things are bad and getting worse. The power to \\"choose one's own way\\" can help one transcend the appearance of ugliness and chaos that surrounds us and create for ourselves an inner peace that is ours to keep. This book is a great reminder that life can be tough, but we can choose how we experience it.This book is a goldmine and should be required reading for everyone."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I first read this book in college, as a psychology major.

You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" opened my eyes to a new way of thinking. This is not just another holocaust horror read. Frankl's take on his experience separates because he did not entirely focus on the complete horror and gore he experienced. He illustrated how bad it was, but the main objective of his illustration was to convey his message to us that:No matter what your circumstance, you have the freedom to chose to either become a product of your environment or remain who you are; a person of character and compassion.It was interesting to see how those in the camp who had no purpose (in their own mind) gave up the drive to live and gave into their circumstances; even if that meant 'to die', or to 'BECOME the oppressor'.If you find purpose in life, no matter how extreme your circumstance is and no matter how much a being may attempt to imprison and/or oppress you, NO BODY can take away your freedom to live. In your mind, if you have a purpose, you may decide to either give your oppressor the keys to your freedom, or you may decide to keep your keys.No one can take away your happiness. ...Unless you allow them.I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a bit of inspiration in their lives :-)"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I read this book years ago for the first time.

Author Viktor E. Frankl is a pioneer for his groundbreaking Logotherapy. Most of this book was written in Auschwitz concentration camp.Part 1 of the book summarizes author's experience in concentration camp and his observation of human nature. One of my favorite quotes from this part is \\"there are only two races of men, decent men and indecent and no society is free of either of them.Part 2 of the book explains Logotherapy & related concepts. One of his favorite metaphors is the existential vacuum. If meaning is what we desire, then meaninglessness is a hole, an emptiness, in our lives. Whenever you have a vacuum, of course, things rush in to fill it. Frankl suggests that one of the most conspicuous signs of existential vacuum in our society is boredom. He points out how often people, when they finally have the time to do what they want, don't seem to want to do anything! People go into a tailspin when they retire; students get drunk every weekend; we submerge ourselves in passive entertainment every evening. The \\"Sunday neurosis,\\" he calls it.So we attempt to fill our existential vacuums with \\"stuff\\" that, because it provides some satisfaction (i.e. happiness), we hope will provide ultimate satisfaction as well: We might try to fill our lives with pleasure, eating beyond all necessity, having promiscuous sex, living \\"the high life;\\" or we might seek power, especially the power represented by monetary success; or we might fill our lives with \\"busy-ness,\\" conformity, conventionality; or we might fill the vacuum with anger and hatred and spend our days attempting to destroy what we think is hurting us. We might also fill our lives with certain neurotic \\"vicious cycles,\\" such as obsession with germs and cleanliness, or fear-driven obsession with a phobic object. The defining quality of these vicious cycles is that, whatever we do, it is never enough.On the subject of happiness, Frankl quotes Edith Weisskopf-Joelson's paper on logotherapy, which shows great insight into the soul of the 21st century: \\"Our current mental hygiene philosophy stresses the idea that people ought to be happy, that unhappiness is a symptom of maladjustment. Such a value system might be responsible for the fact that the burden of unavoidable unhappiness is increased by unhappiness about being unhappy.\\" He contends that \\"Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue\\". What an eye-opener...I read this part of the book every day, till the time I was reading the book.Finding Meaning:So how do we find meaning? Frankl suggests three broad approaches. The first is through experiential values, that is, by experiencing something - or someone - we value. This can include Maslow's peak experiences and esthetic experiences such as viewing great art or natural wonders. The most important example of experiential values is the love we feel towards another. Through our love, we can enable our beloved to develop meaning, and by doing so, we develop meaning ourselves! Love, he says, \\"is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire\\".Frankl points out that, in modern society, many confuse sex with love. Without love, he says, sex is nothing more than masturbation, and the other is nothing more than a tool to be used, a means to an end. Sex can only be fully enjoyed as the physical expression of love. Love is the recognition of the uniqueness of the other as an individual, with an intuitive understanding of their full potential as human beings. Frankl believes this is only possible within monogamous relationships. As long as partners are interchangeable, they remain objects.A second means of discovering meaning is through creative values, by \\"doing a deed,\\" as he puts it. This is the traditional existential idea of providing oneself with meaning by becoming involved in one's projects, or, better, in the project of one's own life. It includes the creativity involved in art, music, writing, invention, and so on. Frankl views creativity (as well as love) as a function of the spiritual unconscious, that is, the conscience. The irrationality of artistic production is the same as the intuition that allows us to recognize the good.The third means of finding meaning is one few people besides Frankl talk about: attitudinal values. Attitudinal values include such virtues as compassion, bravery, a good sense of humor, and so on. But Frankl's most famous example is achieving meaning by way of suffering.He gives an example concerning one of his clients: A doctor whose wife had died mourned her terribly. Frankl asked him, \\"if you had died first, what would it have been like for her?\\" The doctor answered that it would have been incredibly difficult for her. Frankl then pointed out that, by her dying first, she had been spared that suffering, but that now he had to pay the price by surviving and mourning her. In other words, grief is the price we pay for love. For the doctor, this thought gave his wife's death and his own pain meaning, which in turn allowed him to deal with it. His suffering becomes something more: With meaning, suffering can be endured with dignity.Frankl also notes that seriously ill people are not often given an opportunity to suffer bravely, and thereby retain some dignity. Cheer up! we say. Be optimistic! Often, they are made to feel ashamed of their pain and unhappiness.He says this: \\"everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\"Conclusion:Irrespective of your religious or spiritual inclination, this book is something you cannot ignore. Every reading session will introduce you to a new aspect of human psyche and will set you in soul-searching mode. A highly recommended book for those who want to go beyond the clutter of everyday life and find deeper meaning."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"If I had to read only one book in my life, this would be the book.

The first section where he describes his time in a concentration camp and the ways that he and his fellow inmates attempted to cope with the terrible conditions , is extremely good. It is well written and though maybe not quite in the class of Primo Levi it is still one of the best biographical works on this subject that I have read. It is extremely inspiring.The second section of the book mainly describes his \\"logotherapy\\" theory. It is very interesting and I can see that many people would get a lot out of it but I was not entirely convinced by it. Finding your own personal meaning to life is probably extremely beneficial to you but I don't think that you can entirely prove or even disprove that there is an ultimate meaning to life.Despite this small reservation I thoroughly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I found his perception of human behavior incredibly enlightening. I found his honesty incredibly humbling. He wrote for the reader and I learned about myself and human nature. Sin. Given the circumstances, when ones basic needs are not met, in the face of terror, pain, loss desperation, what would I do? What would I accept? How far would I go? I am afraid to find out. He did. He can be proud of who he is. He has gone there and come back. His integrity intact. His wisdom far beyond what I can ever hope to achieve."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"As with any story of survival I am inspired. However, in addition to recounting his experience in the concentration camps, Viktor Frankl expounds on his unique psychological technique -logotherapy. Of course this is a fascinating and terrifying read but he provides an insight into his experiences that really must be read firsthand to truly be appreciated."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is definitely a must read for everybody. The first part of this book focuses on Frankl's time in the concentration camps, and the second part focuses on his ideas of logotherapy, and you definitely need the first part to really understand the second part. According to Frankl, no matter what situation you are put into, you can choose how to react to it, you end up choosing who you are. Frankl's Logotherapy is based around the idea that everything man does stems from his search for meaning, which I think makes a lot of sense. This is is a book that you must read, whether or not you are interested in psychology. It is a quick read, but you will want to keep reading it again and again."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book was everything it's title suggests. This coming from a person who has sworn off reading anything with existential undertones (although I still enjoy Woody Allen flicks). I encourage everyone to read this book. It was very refreshing to read something that had a positive answer for the &quot; existential vacuum&quot; (finding no meaning in ones life).

His thoughts and reflections have helped me shape my own outlook on life, and I have become a happier person as a result. I recommend this book to anyone of any age who understands that beyond all the hassles of everyday life there lies something more--something sacred inside ourselves that empowers us to be whatever we want to be."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In general, only by going though hell and emerging out the other side can you have any profound insite in spiritual matters, such as the mother of all spiritual questions: What is the meaning of life?

There is only one thing that i dread, not to be worthy for my sufferings.Dr. Frankl's idea of meaning is a bit unnatural and i believe it would be fair to say that he sees this as a kind of religion. The first part of the book which tells the story of Frankl's horrific experience in Nazi camps was a great read. I have not read such a touching text for a long time."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book was read many years ago at a time when this reviewer felt nearly crushed under the weight of family and personal troubles. It is not light and diverting reading; indeed, in part it is terrifying. Yet the memory of it has persisted across all these years.A prominent psychiatrist in pre-World War II Vienna, Doctor Frankl found himself suddenly stripped of all money, possessions, position, respect, and ultimately, his family--including his pregnant and beloved wife. After confinement in some of the smaller concentration camps, he ultimately arrived at Auschwitz--the lowest circle of the man-made Hell that was the system of concentration and extermination camps (in German, 'Konzentrationslager' and 'Vernichtungslager'). There, his medical skills were not employed until nearly the end of the war. Instead, he was employed at hard labor just like the rest of the men in his prison block who were marched every day to their work site before dawn and marched back late at night.The most striking thing about Frankl's account of his imprisonment (to me at least) was not the backbreaking work, the all-pervading fear, nor even the constant, maddening hunger; but the unrelenting degradation of the prisoners in order to get them to accept the Nazi's judgment of them as sub-human. For example, when carrying heavy tanks filled with human sewage for disposal, almost inevitably some would splash prisoners full in the face. Any move to wipe one's face, or even show instinctive grimaces of disgust would be punished by the Capos (trusted prisoners, chosen mostly for their brutality) with a prompt beating from a club or whip. Because of this, the normal reactions of prisoners to being befouled were soon suppressed. Every attempt possible was made to degrade the prisoners by the (frequently delighted) SS guards and the Capos. Subjected to this treatment, some prisoners gave up hope and committed suicide by running into the inner electric fence that encircled the camp. Others would lie motionless in their bunks in their own waste--ignoring pleas to get up from fellow prisoners, and blows from guards alike--smoking up all of the cigarettes they might have been saving for barter.Faced with this, Frankl combated this potential demoralization in himself and others by leading the prisoners back to their own humanity. \\"Every freedom may be taken away from a man but one; the freedom to choose what attitude he will take towards his conditions.\\" Despite every attempt to rob them of human dignity, prisoners still had a choice. Would they take an attitude of 'I die tomorrow; you die today' and behave as starving beasts--stealing other prisoner's food, for example; or would they show that they were neither animals nor things, but human beings? Some Amazon reviews of an earlier edition of this book seemed to imply that Frankl had judged those who despaired and died to be weak, or that he was somehow 'better' than they for having survived. Those reviewers can only have done this by forgetting what they had read. Frankl instead writes with sorrow that \\"the best of us did not survive\\", warmly remembering comrades who ended their days offering comfort and sometimes their last bit of bread to fellow prisoners.We live in an age when the feeling that one's life is meaningless is rampant even compared to the recent past. Many compensate by drowning themselves in their career; working fourteen hour days, always gabbing into their cell phone, and carrying their laptop everywhere so they can do some work even in what would be an idle moment. Others escape into escapist and/or authoritarian religion, gladly handing over the miserable burden of their freedom and the need to find meaning to someone else. (Frankl--an observant Jew throughout his life--was not anti-religious I should point out. He writes that a therapist's attempts to debunk genuine religious or spiritual views are an unethical attempt to force the therapist's views on a client.) Still others use alcohol and/or drugs (including perfectly legal drugs)as a response to a sense of life's meaninglessness or futility.Frankl writes that our struggle--even our despair--over finding meaning in our lives is not an psychiatric illness, or even a precursor to one. Potential readers of this book will not find \\"The Meaning of Life\\". What they will find is the story of a man who was compelled to develop the tools to find his own meaning, his 'why'--at a time when his life depended on it in a way seldom seen in life and history. Hopefully, these tools will benefit others as they have benefited me. As someone wrote of Ralph Waldo Emerson, \\"He did not try to lead others to himself, but to themselves.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Hitler had occupied Austria when Viktor Frankl, a young Viennese psychiatrist and writer, learned that the United States had approved his request to immigrate. His parents were overjoyed --- their son would escape the Nazis, go off to America and continue his brilliant work.Frankl was feeling guilty about leaving his parents when he noticed a piece of marble on a table at home. What was it? His father said it was a piece of the largest synagogue in Vienna, burned by the Nazis. On it was a fragment of the Ten Commandments --- the part about honoring thy father and mother.Rock covers paper. Frankly decided to stay in Vienna and look after his parents. As if that were possible! Before the war was over, the Nazis imprisoned Frankl, his pregnant wife, his brother and his parents. All but Frankl perished.In 1945, in just nine days, Frankl wrote \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\" It has sold tens of millions of copies, been published in dozens of languages --- for many, it's been a life-changer. Somehow, I missed every opportunity to read it. Just as well. My younger selves might have missed the profundity of this short, simple book.Frankl's message is simple: Life can be terrible. But there is one power you alone possess --- the power to decide what you think about your situation. If you think there is a point to your suffering and if you can imagine your life on the other side of it, you are searching for meaning. More, you are finding meaning, for the very act of searching ennobles you. Achievements can pile up, riches may come your way --- none of that matters. The search is everything.For Frankl, the search for meaning is both a philosophy and an attitude. Going into a concentration camp, he knew what the odds were --- 90% of the people on his transport train would die, most within a few hours of arriving at Auschwitz. And this led him to his first breakthrough: \\"I struck out my whole former life.\\"Auschwitz became his teacher. He had no fear of death; the gas chambers spared him the thought of suicide. He learned to look eager for work; if you want to live, you have to be useful. And then he learned The Secret. Let him tell it:We stumbled on in the darkness, over big stones and through large puddles, along the one road running through the camp. The accompanying guards kept shouting at us and driving us with the butts of their rifles. Anyone with very sore feet supported himself on his neighbor's arm. Hardly a word was spoken; the icy wind did not encourage talk. Hiding his hand behind his upturned collar, the man marching next to me whispered suddenly: \\"If our wives could see us now! I do hope they are better off in their camps and don't know what is happening to us.\\"That brought thoughts of my own wife to mind. And as we stumbled on for miles, slipping on icy spots, supporting each other time and again, dragging one another on and upward, nothing was said, but we both knew: each of us was thinking of his wife. Occasionally I looked at the sky, where the stars were fading and the pink light of the morning was beginning to spread behind a dark bank of clouds. But my mind clung to my wife's image, imagining it with an uncanny acuteness. I heard her answering me, saw her smile, her frank and encouraging look. Real or not, her look then was more luminous than the sun which was beginning to rise.A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth -- that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love.I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world may still know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when a man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way--an honorable way--in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment. For the first time in my life, I was able to understand the words, \\"The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.\\"Those are easy words to write in the comfort of the coffeehouse, surrounded by attractive people who have the dual luck of health and wealth. But to feel this way after being shipped to four concentration camps and losing your loved ones --- that's something else.Yes, Frankl was lucky, and he knows it; as he says, \\"The best among us did not return.\\" But the lucky did. Indeed, only the lucky did. And isn't a great part of luck the irrational belief of a better future?Like all concentration camp memoirs, Frankl's is one horror after another. But unlike almost all others, his memoir is dotted with remarkable scenes. Like the time a block warden, at a very low point in the war, asks Frankl to speak to the inmates. Frankl reminds them that all they have lost can be achieved again. And then he says something at once shocking and inspiring: \\"Human life, under any circumstances, never ceases to have meaning.\\" Even hopelessness offers a kind of dignity. If we act well in dire straits, we honor God --- we show that, even as we are killed, we maintain our dignity. That was some sermon....Days after the war ended, Viktor Frank walked out of the camp and into the countryside. He listened to the birds sing; he felt the expanse of earth and sky. He did not yet know that the wife he thought of constantly was dead. He had just one sentence running through his head: \\"I called to the Lord from my narrow prison and he answered me in the freedom of space.\\" And with that, Frankl walked into his future.Why read \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" now? Because we live in an age of weak excuses and phony explanations and very few people stepping forward to take responsibility for anything. In this appalling time, Viktor Frankl reminds us that what we do and how we think about it actually matter. He tells us that, even on a crowded planet, every life is important. He makes us stand tall and see clearly and think straight and want to do right.It doesn't get much simpler than that, does it?"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I've always found it rather a clich&eacute; to say that a book has the power to change one's life. However, of any book that I've ever read, Viktor Frankl's Man's Search For Meaning has come very close to doing so. For the first time, I have found a desire to read and re-read an individual book, and have already asked others to read it as well. While it would be a tad exaggerated to say that it actually changed my life, I can say that it has had some powerful effects on my perspective on life. For the most part, it has reinforced my existing beliefs, but it has also made many things clearer for me, including the importance of one's search for meaning in life. I found many parallels in Frankl's Logotherapy to William Glasser's Choice Theory, but Frankl's views were really more profound in many ways, due partly to his account of life in a concentration camp, and partly to his ties to existentialism.Frankl's portrayal of life in the concentration camp moved me in many ways, and on more than one occasion while reading the book. From the beauty he was able to find in unexpected moments within the hellish world of a concentration camp, to his ability to remove himself from the experience in the most humble manner, Frankl portrayed a life of suffering and anguish beyond words as having rays of hope, and even, for some, a sense of meaning. This is simply remarkable, providing for the reader a new sense of perspective on all aspects of life. Additionally, Frankl's explanations of the psychological stages of an inmate are truly enlightening. Honestly, I find it difficult to find the words to describe the first portion of the book. While it is both informative and illuminating with regard to life in a concentration camp, it is also poignant and truly inspiring, written from a different perspective than most accounts of the same subject matter."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl tackles a lot of ground in a short space, looking deeply into the profound question of meaning in our lives from the perspective of a Nazi concentration camp survivor.The first half of this book is a recounting of the authors' experiences as an inmate in various Nazi death camps. My skin crawled reading about the brutality and inhumanity he tells us of. I've heard and read a lot about the concentration camps before, but this first hand experience was very powerful. Frankl had already developed his psychological theory before the internment, so he tells us how his experiences essentially confirmed his view that humans have a need to find personal meaning. He recounts numerous stories from the camps of how hope for the future kept him and his comrades alive. Frankl describes how the prisoners were able to create dreams and plans for the future in order to stay sane and keep their will to live in an environment where it was very easy to give up. What I got out of his recounting of the horrors of the death camps was that even though the Nazi's took away almost all of the basic human necessities we are used to in life, and brutalized their prisoners, they weren't able to control the minds of those imprisoned. We each have the ability to control our own thoughts no matter what the situation - this is our power.The second half of the book delves into Frankl's formal psychological theory he terms &quot;Logotherapy&quot;. He says traditional psychotherapy looks into our past to find cures for current psychological problems. His Logotherapy on the other hand he says helps people through finding hope for the future by getting in touch with the meaning in their lives. I felt his argument was in some ways simplistic in that he suggests those who are depressed and/or suicidal have lost a personal meaning to life - and that they need to find it. That much is probably already evident to the suicidal patient - they already know they have nothing to live for. Telling them to &quot;go find meaning to your life&quot; is surely good advice, but kind of obvious. How do you do it? Frankl does have some suggestions however.I felt that overall this was a compelling read that challenges the reader to consider what role personal meaning has in their life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is one of my favourite books. It is really two books in one. The first is an account of the author's imprisonment in Auschwitz, and the insights he gained into the individual's search for meaning in suffering while there, and the second book is a more detailed introduction to &quot;Logotherapy&quot;. Frankl does not deny the usefulness of Jung's or Freud's work, but he does not stop there -- he continues where they left off. His brand of pychology he calls &quot;logotherapy&quot; -- or &quot;meaning therapy&quot;. In this sort of analysis, he tries to get the individual to look at their present life rather than examing complexes, phobias or dreams. Many people who are unsatisfied in their lives can trace this to a nagging sense of meaning starvation. This can be overcome, in Frankl's view. He doesn't give any very good ideas as to how one is to go about doing this in much detail, but then again, this is just an introductory text. The problem of meaning is a topic that also embraces a religious perspective on life, and it may be of interest to those who wish to pursue this further. It is a very inspirational book and contains many helpful insights for those who are struggling with any sort of suffering, pain, or grief, which they are powereless to combat. In such cases, Frankl suggests, one's only positive action may to be to endure the suffering in the right way, and to find meaning and worth in pain. This seems important to me, because life is not all happiness . . . the bad times as well as the good must be redeemed as worthwhile for an individual to feel a true sense of life's worth. Hopefully, in the future, Frankl's ideas will gain more prominence as they seem to offer more promise than most other forms of psychological theories do. A very powerful read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl deserves the highest respect, much as Nelson Mandela does today although the severity of the experience would have been somewhat harsher but less daunting in time. Frankl's book covers two main aspects in his title: Search for Meaning, the first details his experiences in Auschwitz, one of the worst concentration camps used by the Nazis and controlled by the SS. The second part of the book outlines his own way of psychotherapy entitled Logotherapy, refering to the Greek word Logos, in this case related to meaning. It approaches the process of psychotherapy in a completely different way from that of Freud.It's the first part of the book which completely captures the reader, its simply unputdownable, Frankl's suffering in the camps is remarkable in the sense of the humanity he talks of rather than the more than obvious horrors he must have been exposed to. The camp changed him as a human being or rather, one feels, that Frankl grows into his own humanity expanding what was already there in potential form as he reminds the reader that his early Logotherapy manuscript was with him in the camp, although lost. It is edifying that he returns from the camp in a spirit of underlying trust in humanity's ability to, so to speak, save itself.In the second part he describes Logotherapy and the techniques used to put it into practice. The therapy deals with the search for meaning in a person's life and the lack of it in present society. This has of course been even more exacerbated in current times compared with the more moderate version of the 50's and 60's of Frankl's era. It is in fact remarkable that this kind of therapy has not taken over from other forms given its obvious improvement over older more mechanical and less human forms of therapy.Its a remarkable work deserving of the highest respect."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going? These are questions that confront humankind each day. Without the answers to these questions, a person may find their life void of purpose or joy. This book does not answer any of those questions, but reminds you of the importance of getting the answer to the second and third questions.Before reading the book I felt I had a pretty good grasp on my own answers for the three questions of life. However, Dr. Frankl made me specify my answers. I needed a mission, a creed by which I should live my life, a statment by which I could measure each decision in life.Dr. Frankl explains, through his own experience during the Holocaust, that each person has a reason to live. When that reason ceases to exist, that person must either find another reason or be dead emotionally. This story reminds me of the story of Anne Frank. She was doing quite well until she felt that her entire family was dead. She could no longer see a reason to continue fighting the opposition, so she gave up and died shortly after her sister. Had she known or thought her father was still alive, I believe she may have been able to escape sickness and survive her imprisonment.Dr. Frankl encourages you, without preaching, to find THAT reason for you life. What purpose does your life hold? Don't ask what you want out of life, but ask, &quot;What does life want from me?&quot; The key is to find what life wants from you.The holocaust stories will help you see the necessity of answering these questions. Whether you find your life with or without purpose, read this book. It could change your life for the better."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"+++++This book, by Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry (at the University of Vienna Medical School) Dr. Viktor Frankl (1905 to 1997) has five divisions:(1) Preface by Gordon Allport. (Comprises 4 pages.) Allport was formerly a professor of psychology at Harvard. It was mainly through his efforts that Frankl's work was introduced to North America. Here he highlights key aspects of Frankl's book. I agree with him when he says:\\"A psychiatrist who personally has faced such extremity [of spending three years at Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps] is a psychiatrist worth listening to. He, if anyone, should be able to view our human condition wisely and with compassion.\\"(2) A recent preface by Frankl where he discusses his book (first published in German in 1946) and other significant matters. (3 pages.) He states the true intention of his book:\\"I...wanted simply to convey to the reader by way of concrete example that life holds a potential meaning under any conditions, even the most miserable ones.\\"(3) Frankl's actual book. (130 pages.) It consists of two parts, \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp\\" and \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\" respectively. (Logotherapy was the psychotherapy developed by Frankl.) More of this division will be explainedbelow.(4) A postscript by Frankl written in 1983 entitled \\"The Case for a Tragic Optimism.\\" (15 pages.) This section is very interesting. By tragic optimism Frankl \\"means that one...remains optimistic in spite of [tragedy].\\" He goes on to state that \\"[t]his chapter...raises the question, \`How is it possible to say yes to life in spite of [overwhelming tragedy]?'\\" Even though I disagree with certain parts, it still is packed with wisdom and facts. My favorite piece of information from this section:\\"Austrian...pollsters recently reported that those held in highest esteem by most...people interviewed are neither...great artists nor...great scientists, neither...great statesmen nor...great sports figures, but those who master a hard lot [or hard circumstances] with their head held high.\\"(5) An extensive bibliography of Logotherapy. (40 pages.)Part one (consisting of 85 pages) of Frankl's actual two part book begins with the following:\\"This book does not claim to be an account of facts and events but of [my] personal experiences...It is the inside story [or autobiographical story] of a concentration camp, told by one of its survivors.\\"And what a story it is!! This story is not concerned with great horrors (well-documented in other books) but \\"with the multitude of small torments\\" that were endured. Not only does Frankl relate his experiences, but he also details his observations and conclusions based on those observations. He also imparts to the reader his wisdom (not all of which I agree with). Four of my favorite wise sayings that he imparts are:(1) \\"An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior.\\"(2) \\"Suffering is [a]...part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.\\"(3) \\"Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.\\"(4) \\"No one has the right to do harm, not even if wrong has been done to them.\\"He also passes on to his readers philosophical truths. Two of my favorites come from the philosopher Nietzsche:(1) \\"He who has a WHY to live for can bear almost any HOW.\\"(2) \\"That which does not kill [or destroy] me, makes me stronger.\\"Part two (35 pages) introduces the reader to \\"logotherapy,\\" the theory of psychotherapy developed by Frankl from his experiences in the concentration camp (that were outlined in part one).\\"Logotherapy...focuses on the meaning of human existence as well as on [a person's] search for such meaning.\\" Thus, Frankl \\"speak[s] of a will to meaning in contrast to...the will to pleasure on which Freudian psychoanalysis is centered, as well as in contrast to the will to power on which Adlerian psychology...is focused.\\"This part is not difficult to understand and is simply written. Here, Frankl again imparts his wisdom to the reader (not all of which I agree with). Two of my favorite wise sayings are:(1) \\"[A person] should not ask what the meaning of life is, but rather [that person] must recognize that it is he [or she] who is asked.\\"(2) \\"The meaning of life always changes, but...it never ceases to be.\\"This part consists of about twenty small, easy-to-read sections. Examples of the titles of these sections include:(1) The Will to Meaning(2) The Meaning of Life(3) The Essence of Existence(4) The Meaning of Suffering(5) The Meaning of LoveIn conclusion, read this life-transforming book and discover for yourself why it has been translated into more than twenty languages, why it has seen nearly one hundred printings in English, and why it is, according to the Library of Congress, \\"One of the ten most influential books in America!!!\\"+++++"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Wow. I work at a bookstore and have always been interested in the psychological and spiritual elements of life, so it was admittedly humbling when a young girl asked me to help her find this million-selling book which I had never heard of. Upon locating it, I looked at it in my hands and asked her what it was about----besides the obvious, that is. She didn't know that much about it herself, except that it had come highly recommended. I made a mental note to pick it up a copy, and did so. I dunno. There was just something about it.... Maybe it was the fact that this book just reeks of brilliance. And even more importantly, LOGIC!!! For something so short, it's amazing that Victor was able to cram so much insight and genius into such a small, riveting piece. From page one, you are enraptured, totally drawn into his grueling first-person account of what it was like to spend years in a concentration camp. Of special interest is it to note that Victor takes great pains not to &quot;overglorify&quot; the events, but instead chooses only to document accounts that were relevant to his learning.The second part of the book illustrates logotherapy, logos actually meaning the word &quot;meaning&quot;. He discusses the existential vaccuum (TV, sex, etc), among other issues. Although enthralled by psychology, I was of course worried this segment would be drier and/or difficult to understand. Fortunately, Frankl is much better at explaining himself than the likes of other fascinating minds (e.g. Jung, etc.), and this part of the book was just as entertaining, since he not only speaks in a language we can all easily understand but also discusses behaviors and scenarios we each face (and struggle with) all the time.One example really stood out to me. He tells of an older, educated man of society who comes to him for help. Apparently this man's wife had died two years prior and he was still having difficulty overcoming the grief and loneliness--the utter depression---he was experiencing. He didn't know what to do. Victor simply asked him what his wife would have done had HE died first. The man quickly assured Victor that she would have been equally distraught and would have suffered greatly. Victor then commended the man on what a tremendous gift he was able to give to his wife in saving her all of that tremendous pain. The expense was, of course, his own pain and suffering, but he was still able to save his beloved wife from going through such a traumatic ordeal, and instead had gone through it FOR her (since one of them was bound to do it at some point!) This man, in five minutes, was healed. And beaming. My grandmother is going through this EXACT scenario, and you can be sure I am sending her a xeroxed, enlarged copy of that part of the book, to say the very least.His work is as equally philosophical as it is psychological--he speaks---NOT &quot;preaches&quot;---of changing one's outlook, which was perhaps the only thing the Germans couldn't rob the Jews of. And afterwards--although he's very careful not to tell anyone that they &quot;should&quot; in fact change their perspective, you can't help but look at things differently---with more acceptance and analysis than you might have otherwise done so. It's very enlightening, riveting, and insightful, and I look forward to exploring more of his mind and works.There is now not a doubt in my mind that the aforementioned customer at the beginning of this review came up to ME looking for that book for a REASON--and that I was supposed to read this book. And the next time she came in, I thanked her profusely as we discussed the book in total awe of what we had read. I can't recommend this book enough---to anyone and everyone. It should be required reading! In fact, I already bought a copy for my friend Rebecca, who just received her masters in psychology, although it would make a great gift for just about anybody.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Of the many thousands of books I have read this is the most important. Frankl survived Auschwitz and derived meaning from the experience. Can we do any less in the face of our own small problems?The book, to a large degree, is based on a quote from Friedrich Nietzsche, \\"He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how.\\" It's true, and Frankl's life proves it.Frankl doesn't provide a road map for finding the meaning in every experience. He does something better. He asks us to ask ourselves what our experiences mean. We already know, if only we will stop to think. My favorite example is that of a man who greaves the loss of his wife. Frankl asks him why he greaves. The man answers that he greaves because he loved his wife. Frankl asks him, \\"Isn't that a good thing?\\" A light goes on in the man's mind, he nods, and gets up and leaves. Frankl's book can make a light go on in all of our minds. All we have to do is spend a couple of hours reading this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I read this book in a college course which I am forever grateful for; I would not have read it if I didn't take this course. When it comes to reading a book that affects your life and its meaning, this books sets the standard. It provides a painful and true look into a dark and horrbile time in human history. Instead of standing at the fence and looking into the state of man in a concentration camp, we are offered a view from within the camp and the man. When you consider the survival and the perspective of the author, an actual survivor, life becomes inspiring and full of meaning.As humans we must pay attention to the lessons of history and the wisdom learned by those who lived it. In this case, we are presented with a message wrapped in horror. Yet, the outcome can be inspiration and change.The text is written in direct and simple langauge. Its level of thought and reading is certainly mature, but its significance is ageless! Empathy is born here. It is a wide-open glimpse into the heart and soul of a man who survived hell.This book is a message for all."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Every now and then, I notice that a book is frequently mentioned in conversations or referenced in other works. Once I have made that mental connection, I am compelled to discover why that book has influenced so many different people. Viktor Frankl's \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is one of those influential books, and now I know why -- it is one of the best, thought-provoking, and potentially life-changing books I have ever read.Frankl was a Holocaust survivor who used his concentration camp experiences as a laboratory to study the nature and character of man. Frankl went on to become a world-renowned psychiatrist whose thoughts developed a new psychotherapy called logotherapy.Frankl believed man's main concern in life is in fulfilling a meaning that is unique only to him, that each life has its own specific meaning, and that everyone is responsible for his own life and existence.The book was broken down into two complementary chapters, and a postscript (revised edition). In the first chapter, \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp,\\" Frankl shared his thoughts and observations as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps. The descriptions of his life and the lives and actions of his fellow prisoners was authentic, yet not as overly graphic as other Holocaust accounts I have read. In the second chapter, \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell,\\" Frankl gave a scholarly explanation of logotherapy. While some of the more academic terms and concepts were difficult to understand at first and required me to re-read some sections, he gave sufficient examples that helped me to get his main points.The postscript was titled, \\"The Case for a Tragic Optimism,\\" and was based on a lecture Frankl gave in 1983. Frankl defined \\"tragic optimism\\" as \\"...an optimism in the face of tragedy and in view of the human potential which at its best always allows for: (1) turning suffering into a human achievement and accomplishment; (2) deriving from guilt the opportunity to change oneself for the better; and (3) deriving from life's transitoriness an incentive to take responsible action.\\" The postscript helped me to better understand some of the more difficult connections between the first two chapters.Throughout this book, I found many spiritual and thought-provoking quotes and passages that made reading it a very personal and reflective experience for me:\\"He who has a 'why' to live can bear with almost any 'how.'\\" Friedrich Nietzsche\\"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\"\\"Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.\\"\\"...the commonplace truth that no one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them.\\"\\"Man is 'not' fully conditioned and determined but rather determines himself whether he gives in to conditions or stands up to them. In other words, man is ultimately self-determining. Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.\\"\\"Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now.\\"\\"In the past, nothing is irretrievably lost, but rather, on the contrary, everything is irrevocably stored and treasured.\\"I consider my life to be a constant work-in-progress, so this book is on my short list of books that I plan to read again and again to help me keep my life focused and meaningful."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I've read numerous books on philosophy and psychology, but of all the books I've read, I would say that this book should be compulsory reading for everyone. Not only does he explore the basic psychological motivation and purpose of our existence, he does it in an unusual way, by describing his own experiences at Auschwitz under Nazi occupation.By giving insight into human behaviour in its most vulnerable and exposed state, he provides us with an insight into our own psyches.It's also a reminder of the extraordinary evil that men can do with very little incentive.

Yet somehow, through providential care, I knew, even as a youngster, that life must have meaning to both the fortunate as well as to the unfortunate, to the rich as the poor, to the privileged as the lowly. This meaning I have long understood. Viktor Frankl has helped me to see, even more clearly, the groaning of life itself, which yearns for meaning and purpose, even in the midst of unimaginable sufferings. Frankl said, \\"For the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into songs by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth-that love is the ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry, human thoughts, and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is the through love and in love.\\"My personal discovery has, furthermore, led me see the significance of what Blaise Pascal said with respect to the futility of a life, whose existence is without love, and that the highest expression of this love is ultimately found in God. He said, \\"I see the terrifying immensity of the universe which surrounds me, and find myself, limited to one corner of this vast expanse, without knowing why I am set down here rather than elsewhere, nor why the brief period for my life is assigned to me at this moment rather than another in all eternity that has gone before and will come after me. On all sides I behold nothing but infinity, in which I am a mere atom, a mere passing shadow that returns no more.\\" Yes, without God, life is a mere existential vacuum in the great cosmos.I am struck with one curiosity about the book. I am not sure why Frankl often quoted Friedrich Nietze. According to historians (Paul Johnson; History of the Jews), Nietzche's philosophy was one of the impetus which brought about the rise of Germanic-centricity, or the attitude that German was a superior race, which tragically led to the horrifying oppression against the Jews."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In terms of usefulness, this is the best book I have ever read.

There are many passages in this book that are burned in my memory.Among them is, &quot;the salvation of man is through love and in love&quot;.A simple statement, but, one which the world needs to be reminded."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Wow - what an exceptional book written by an exceptional man.

To overcome the horror and absolute hell on Earth of the Nazi Death Camps is itself a monument to the spirit of man but to then go on and help others grow and become more at peace with themselves through Logotherapy is absolutely amazing. Reading this book helps you put your life into perspective and helps you see the trivialities of the things that we sometimes spend too much time worrying about.

My advice - quit whining about things, don't buy the stuff off the T.V, just read this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANINGby Dr Viktor FranklI was introduced to an earlier edition of this book after I had watched Joel Barker's video, 'The Power of Vision' during the early nineties.The book captured the author's chilling & yet inspirational story of his personal struggle & eventual triumph against unspeakable horror at the Auschwitz concentration camps. His entire family (His father, mother, brother & his wife) perished in the camps, except for his sister.[Frankly, I did not realise the magnitude of the author's horrendous sufferings - & the Holocaust as a whole - until I personally visited the Auschwitz concentration camps, in the town of Oswiecim, situated about 60 kms from Krakow in southern Poland, with my late wife during the mid-nineties. Auschwitz was actually the German name for the town. I was told by my guide that about 6 million people died in the Auschwitz camps, more than 90% of whom were Jews.]Because he was a psychiatrist, he was able to observe behaviours at the camps. He noticed that the healthiest, youngest, smartest, & best looking were not automatically the ones who survived.At this juncture, I would like to quote exactly what he wrote:\\"Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food & various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, & not the result of camp influences alone. Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him - mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp. I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whose suffering & death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost......Everything can be taken from a man but one thing; the last of the human freedoms-to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way......Most men in a concentration camp believed that the real opportunities of life had passed. Yet, in reality, there was an opportunity & a challenge. One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or one could ignore the challenge & simply vegetate, as did a majority of the prisoners......What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves & furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us...\\"According to him, in the final analysis, the most significant indicator of survival was that all of those who made it through had something significant yet to do with their lives. In other words, if one has something significant or purposeful or meaningful yet to do with one's life, the chances of survival against hardships, obstacles, setbacks & even death threats, will be much higher. That is to say, man's primary motivational force is his seach for ultimate meaning. Joel Barker calls it the power of vision. According to Barker, a positive vision of the future is what gives meaning to life & a meaningful vision empowers us to solve problems & accomplish goals.Another productive learning experience for me, from reading the book, is this: one often cannot change the circumstances of one's encounter with any situation, person or event, but one certainly has the power to choose how to interprete it & how to respond to it.Put it in another way, one's attitude or outlook on life certainly has ramifications on how one can survive - & thrive - in the longer term.I think I can now appreciate better about what Anthony Robbins once said: \\"It's in your moment of decision that your destiny is shaped.\\" He added further:There are three decisions that control our destiny:- our decisions about what to focus on;- our decisions about what things mean to us;- our decisions about what to do to create the results we desire;Viktor Frankl had also made another profound observation in his book:\\"Don't aim at success - the more you aim at it & make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, & it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.\\"This resonates very well with what F Buckminster Fuller, recognised as Planet Earth's friendly genius (he created the Geodesic dome), called 'precession' or 'precessional effects' is his book, 'Critical Path'.On the whole, I have enjoyed very much reading Viktor Frankl's 'Man's Search for Meaning'. Thanks to Joel Barker for the timely introduction!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl touches upon the most fundamental aspect to some of the psychiatric problems (and non-psychiatric) that face us today: life lacking meaning. his genius and foresight that is seen as he details his experiences and perspective while in the camps is a feat, or rather a level of magnitude, to which we should all aspire. I read the book in 1 1/2 days, it was a truly compelling read. I hope it affects everyone else as positively as it affected me. Happy (or at least \\"meaningful\\") reading.-S."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book should be a required reading for every human being on earth. It demonstrates what having a purpose and passion in life can mean to an individual. Frankl vividly discusses his torture as well as the other prisoners and describes how he found meaning to get through a day at a time. After reading this book youll definitely know that you can find meaning and purpose in anything and you can also survive any challenge that life hands you. Read it and live it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is an unforgettable piece of writing. It is written by Viktor Frankl, a concentration camp survivor, psychiatrist, and founder of logotherapy. In a clear, true, voice he quickly entrains the reader into the reality of the camps; the hierarchies, the realities, and the will to live that will allow humans to endure and participate in almost anything. Yet with the depravity he also writes of the few who shone- who cared for others; who did not abandon spiritual principles. This amazing first-person account is unforgettable because of his bravery, intellectual approach, and clear-headed ability to recount details. Dr. Frankl also shares the core principles behind his innovative approach to psychotherapy. We are all searching for meaning; reading this book will allow you to look at life in a new way and you will be changed forever.

Frankl found a way to confront the greatest evil of the last century, which for him was very personal, and survive. In the midst of it he discovered that we most long for meaning in our lives, and so he developed a therapy that helps people search for it.The beginning part of the book about life in the camps simply cannot be forgotten. And then, when he tries to make sense of it, ordinary readers realize that whatever they have suffered there is a way forward. Frankl used tragedy to help others. A person can't be more noble than that.Lawrence J. Epstein, author of \\"At the Edge of a Dream: The Story of Jewish Immigrants on New York's Lower East Side.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl wrote a brilliant book. The way of his writing is very clear and to the point. There are a lot of psychology terms, but not so many that it makes the book confusing. Frankl looks at the story from an unattached view, and thus he is able to give good, unbiased theories about why things happened. This book made many of the reasons of what happened during the holocaust clearer. It is an enjoyable and informative read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The following summarizes the true meanings the author wants us to absorb.There are three avenues to arrive at the meaning of life. 1) Creating a work or or doing a deed 2) Experiencing or encountering something added to your life i.e. finding love 3) facing a fate one cannot change. You then rise above oneself, rising above what is expected. One grows from the experience, and experiences positive change.Experiencing and surviving suffering is something to be proud of... not something to be ashamed of. We all learn and grow from our experiences."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is a classic as both an compelling human story and a model of self-help, self-actualization.

First part contains his account of time in the concentration camps. Second part serves as an introduction to logotherapy, imparting a sense of hope in psychotherapy patients by helping them find the meaning in their life or hardship. Frankl states that meaning is an innate need for all people, not just a reaction formation or ego issue. It makes sense to me, and as a survivor, Frankl has the \\"credentials\\" to back it up!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"well i learn psycology at the university and my professor has recommended it so i bought it through amazon.this book will rock your world.and give you a different perspective of life and how man interacts in a hostile and unreal enviroment ...for more info of the book itself i recommend turning to a better source :) but as a reader i can say this book is worth the time and the money :)"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"If you've read the book - which I suggest you read the book so you can really digest its meaning - the audio provides a great avenue to hear it again. I spend 2 hours in the car everyday and having the audio text of Frankl's work is a nice distraction from the 'speed' of the day. I would add though, if you haven't read the text, listen to it. There is much meaning to draw from it and apply to your own life. Very insightful generally speaking, the audio doesn't detract. I'm a book guy to begin with and that is why I would suggest the book before the audio.

The reason? Well classics frequently attract readers who have every intention of reading timeless literature, yet alas, they occupy space for a generation and the glue backing is brittle and splits the book in half when it is finally cracked open. The Ipad storage story? Ask me in a generation's time.Now Victor Frankl's &#34;......Search For meaning&#34;: Man's that is. It is a classic and a bloody good one to actually read. Why? Because it is classically meaningful and it makes classical common sense. If things are bad enough, how do you live without hope? Well if you are resident at hotel Auchwitz in the first half of the forties, you don't: unless you recall classics like Dostoyevsky. (spelled differently in Frankl's script but the same bloke I assume) You will learn that suffering is within the human condition for all of us. Therefore we can get meaning by being worthy of our suffering. To be unworthy is the real suffering. You may even die to be a worthy sufferer like that because it is better than turning into an impulsive unprincipled animal. Good people die in Frank's book but they lived with meaning until they were dead. How about us? Just because we don't live in concentration camps does not mean we do not suffer excruciating struggles. Frankl gives an analogy of a bottle that fills up with gas, meaning our lives fill up with challenges that pain us wherever we are. The second part of the book is a technical and professional rationale of what Frankl told us about in the first half. Why don't you just read it and see if you find principles to find some meaning in?"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"A man is for the good of others if he has dignity.The stars were chosen for there purpose to dream, hope, and see beyond our own eyes.

RF Stealth is somewhere between a textbook and handbook for the relevant RF technologies. It is well suited to the needs of the stealth systems analyst, designer, test engineer and customer. The included software programs (over 100) alone are worth far more than the price of the book. It is readable, very practical, avoids useless padding and focuses on explaining those designs and techniques that have been shown by test to perform well.Note: Amazon.com has somehow managed to garble the editorial reviews of Mr. Lynch's book by inserting a review and summary of a book apparently concerned with environmentalism and false science. That unknown book has no relevance to Mr. Lynch's excellent book and reflects poorly on Amazon.com's ability to accu-rately organize it own site presentations."},{"Title":"Halliwell's Film, Video & DVD Guide 2005 (Halliwell's: The Movies That Matter)","review":"I used the last edition that Leslie Halliwell wrote until I finally got to where about half the movies I was trying to look up were not in it. Walker has done a commendable job of a seamless transition. The only difference that I can detect is that later movies are included."},{"Title":"Halliwell's Film, Video & DVD Guide 2005 (Halliwell's: The Movies That Matter)","review":"Long before the Christmas shelves were full of film guides and before every publisher caught on that there was a market out there, Halliwell's was king. And far superrior to Leanard Maltin's facile effort, which used to be the only other reference around.This book was indispensible for a whole generation and was even the basis for a short story. Unfortunately, since his death in 1989, the book has been revised again and again, until now it's almost a pale shadow of it's former self. Think of the difference between The Godfather parts 2 and 3, yes, it's that big a gulf.Leslie Halliwell's ratings of films had become tougher and tougher on any made after 1960- with only four films from that decade given the four star rating. This was plain silly. His tastes were very conservative, blindgly so some times - with foreign and colour films given shirt shrift. But that rating was a cast iron guarantee that it was something special. Something to stay in for. If he gave a film two stars, you'd stay in because it was going to be entertaining. Three stars and you'd forget your plans. Four stars and you forget the world. And these were very, very rare.On his death I brought a hardback edition in case it went pear-shaped and crumbled into silliness, and since Mr. John Walker has taken over- I'm glad that i did and wish I had brought a dozen editions. Not only are Mr. Walker's comments very unenlightening, you always got the impression that Halliwell had deliberated over the wording, so that even the briefest critique seemed fully-realised by an educated mind alive to cinema, but not Mr Walker's. Virtually every entry is vastly over-rated, with no glimmer of thought behind the utterly one-dimensional wording. Every dumb-ass movie, all those passing fads of the last 15 years has been evaluated & given merit way beyond their value. I remember watching one of his first recommendations ('8 Men Out' rated three stars and was in shock that I'd been let down for the first time in a decade by THE BOOK. And it's happened again and again). His contributions have the statue of a third-rate, fickle hacks - from a down-market grungy tabloid.Some of the ratings are plain silly, The Terminator gets a tight-fisted one star by Halliwell (it should have been at least ***), while Walker gives the empty and souless special effects vessel Terminator 2- two stars. Check out Speed (***), or any of the other dumbed down intended blockbusters churned out every summer to see how they are rated ('Independence Day' & 'Titanic' two stars). Many of these movies are the modern eqivelant of those long tedious wide-screen Epics of the '50s. With Halliwell's original guide, you grew to form your own opinions and argue for your own favourites, like the 'The Ghost and Mrs Muir' & 'The Manchurian Candidate'. Even rock documentaires have been added into the brew and they are a matter of taste in music as much as the cutting and shaping.The book is no longer a guide to a quality night in. Even worse than all the poor reviews during Mr. Walker's tenure, is the ditching of the forewords and essays by the founder of the guide for each edition, giving his pets hates and his percieved disappointments in the changing face of the media since the last edition. This now robs the guide of a sense of perspective and personality - which would draw in the reader, when it would have been wiser for Mr. Walker to have add his own essay.Another gripe is the look of the entries themselves. Where they had been streamlined before, tightly constucted, and smart-with italics to denote a contribution of a very high standard, Mr Walker seems to have been playing with those little computer tools of his. The film sypnosis' have been italicised, and anything else he could find to play about with. The italics are no longer eye-catching, there is now far too much information italicised. So that nothing catches the attention. Sometimes, as with movies, less is more.Anyway, who cares if it's on DVD or Video? This information dates so easily. What's the point? All it takes to find out this info, is to tap it into Amazon. Duh!In every edition that he has edited, Walker has made huge blunders of judgement and not just in the film ratings and those gripes listed above. There are now several pages devoted to solely listing all the 3 and 4 star rated movies, both by year and alphabetically. One of the pleasures of the Halliwell guides was to find those treasures on your own and because they were so infrequent they genuinely would stand out and then you'd have that buzz of discovery. Not here, now. By providing everything, the reader no longer invests anything into the discovery. This is basic psychology 101.In this edition he has eliminated 1 star from nearly 25 or so vintage masterpieces that were rated so by the original founder of the guide. EG: 'Scarface' (1932), 'I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang', 'Wuthering Heights', 'The Letter', 'Rebecca', 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn', ect, ect. This serously damages the historical prespective of the early '30s. Those films have a raw primitive edginess and toughness - & they still draw you in. Maybe all the special effects and whizzing camera-work of modern films has corrupted his ability to see this. He looks but he doesn't see. The '40s - an incredible decade is becoming more and more sparse and mundane. 'The Cabinet of Caligari' (a tedious but mightily important German 1919 film) - was said by Halliwell to have been 'faded' but given, like 'A Birth of a Nation' the 4 stars for it's landmark contribution to cinematic-development. What next, maybe 'The Jazz Singer' can be reduced too. The Original was an entertainment guide and educational. The last word can now be scratched off.This latest edition also features a new gimmick; every page and entry is colour-coded. Yep, not content with with his italic tools from previous editions, he's now got the colours out too. A bright, garish ORANGE for all movie titles, and in between deviding lines, and any other elements. They burn the eyes after awhile.What this amounts to is a cack-handed trivilastion of another man's great work that goes against the grain of the original, offering huge disparities in stylish presentation, crituques, and a monuemental dumbing down. At each step and in each decision, Walker's Edited Guide has always chosen the short end, the low road, the simplton's way, the talk-down. He has never ever granted intelligence towards the reader/researcher/browser. If a rival guide had wanted to ruin an indipensible book, they couldn't have asked for greater assistence. For those that live in Britain, it's the eqivelent of the esteemed Barry Norman being replaced by Jonathen Ross for the BBC's seminal film review programme.The work put into this Guide by Walker - change for changes sake - a kind of perpetual revolution for revolutions sake, rather like an insecure political party trying to mould the world to it's image -begets the question, did you ever like the original, mr. Walker?It's now so 'relevant' and for 'modern' tastes, that they don't even bother to issue a hard-back edition. The story of this guide is the story of the fall of a five star and indispensible family reference book - a landmark in its field one of the nation's favourite reference works -into a mundane a shrivelled ghost of it's former self.So do yourself a favour and get a second hand copy before Halliwell died, which is the seventh edition from 1989- try 'ablebooks' (http://dogbert.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchEntry). You'll find him tenacious and tight-fisted, but the films he chooses will have some merit to them and you'll amend the ratings of your favourites in your own mind. For newer entries, go for the superb Time Out film guide, which has been the only one to match HALLIWELL'S in quality.....they will give all that you need. Good viewing."},{"Title":"Halliwell's Film, Video & DVD Guide 2005 (Halliwell's: The Movies That Matter)","review":"Superlative!If it was an annual magazine, I'd subscribe!"},{"Title":"Halliwell's Film, Video & DVD Guide 2005 (Halliwell's: The Movies That Matter)","review":"Hang on a minute.

It shouldn't be allowed for a book to be called 'Halliwell's...' unless it's written by him alone. The fact is that Halliwell is NOT a brand name. It's the name of an author who died in 1989. He wrote the entire books himself - He wasn't just the curator of a collection - he was an author in his own right. To start adding further reviews by John Walker means it is no longer Halliwell's guide. Simple as that...Why isn't there a Walker's Film, Video And Dvd Guide 2005 by John Walker?

I did not understand why the Lord had decided to cripple me in such a way, but accepted it, knowing that He must have a reason.\\" (Pg. 30)\\"As was our custom, we prayed as a group before splitting up, asking the Lord for ... unity within the group; but within ten seconds of the 'Amen,' the unity was gone... it was obvious that feelings were hurt and relations strained.\\" (Pg. 32)\\"As I had feared, Satan had disunified the group. Roger had been separated from the group because neither he nor Bill could overcome their pride.\\" (Pg. 34)\\"It would be futile to try and climb to the upper reaches of the mountain without knowing where to go. I have felt all along that, although our experience and knowledge are seriously limited, our potential is great. So the Lord Himself must guide and show us what He wants us to see.\\" (Pg. 35)\\"The object itself was continually pummeled with rocks from above. A wooden structure would not have survived a summer's day, let alone 5000 years. So ... we ruled it out as a possibility based on these several good reasons...\\" (Pg. 39)\\"As they related their stories to me, I sensed friction between them. I did not understand why, but the feeling was unmistakable. Satan was again trying to destroy our unity and effectiveness.\\" (Pg. 46)\\"We left the region of Ararat early, each disappointed that we had not found the Ark, but each relieved that the trip had come to a close... Some internal friction had built up among us, and it is doubtful that the team could have continued to function in harmony much longer.\\" (Pg. 98)"},{"Title":"Sundrinker","review":"Duwan, the warrior, had been foremost of the Drinker warriors in training, destined in time to become leader of all the valley's warriors. Then an accident had claimed his arm, leaving him unfit to lead. With no other choice, Duwan turned to Drinker legends for hope, legends of a lost homeland to the south, where the sun was so strong, the soil so rich, that a Sundrinker could regenerate a lost limb.And so Duwan left the valley, seeking this fabled paradise. But what he found was the Enemy, the dominant, less evolved form of his species called Devourers, who lived by preying upon other life forms. The Devourers, who, ages ago, had driven the Drinkers from their homeland, intent on their total destruction. Yet to Duwan's horror, he found Drinkers too, Drinkers enslaved by cruel Devourer overlords!

My father was also a Thomas Hardeman. Of course I'm proud of this great pioneer family. But anyone will find this history of the immigration & settlement of our country exciting and informative.

I'm a member of the NSSAR because of Thomas Hardeman. Thomas Hardeman fought at the Battle of Kings Mountain in 1780.

It's well made, this is not a cheaply made book the materials are excellent and durable. there are photos, illustrations, documents and maps inside.By reading this book you are learning about an underrated American family more importantly you are learning about America and how the west was really won. I often say, the lives depicted in this book are the kind John Wayne could only depict as an actor in a western adventure film.This book is about more than the Hardeman family, this book is about American History.

In 1964, he was convicted of sabotage and sentenced to life imprisonment, along with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and the other Rivonia Trialists.Fellow prisoners for 26 years, these leaders were also the closest colleagues and friends, sharing the unshakable belief that truth, justice and democracy would ultimately triumph over oppression and racism.Released from prison in 1989, at the age of 60, Ahmed Kathrada was at the center of dramatic changes in South Africa and went on to serve as a member of South Africa's first freely elected Parliament, Parliamentary Counsellor to the Office of President Mandela, and Chair of the Robben Island Museum.He is proof that human beings are capable of exceptional goodness even in the most difficult circumstances, and that political power can be wielded with integrity, empathy, and compassion. He also possesses a wonderful sense of humor as well as unique insight into his close friends and colleagues, including Nelson Mandela.Ahmed Kathrada's Memoirs offers an essential and all-too-rare view into the mind and soul of a truly great and profoundly gentle revolutionary."},{"Title":"Memoirs","review":"From Ahmed Kathrada's lifelong involvement in the thick of South Africa political activism and his 26 years in prison in the notorious Robben Island and Pollsmoor prisons for political prisoners, he became the fellow activist with and confidant of Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, and other historic figures in the struggle against that country's apartheid. And with them, Kathrada played a leading, though for the most part less visible, role in developing a post-apartheid South African political and social system. Though apartheid was abandoned years ago, the full story of the struggle against it is just now beginning to emerge, as the leaders of this struggle are finding the time to write their memoirs in their later years after moving out of the political arena and giving way to the succeeding generation of leaders. Kathrada sees his own \\"Memoirs\\" as a \\"modest addition to the growing and most welcome body of work that is emerging about a particularly significant period in South Africa's recent history.\\" Kathrada's modesty kept him from moving into the political, governing, arena as visibly as others, notably Nelson Mandela. But it's clear from this modestly-written \\"Memoirs\\" that Kathrada was a major figure in bringing apartheid to an end and setting South Africa on a new course."},{"Title":"Memoirs","review":"As a white immigrant growing up in South Africa during the apartheid regime, I was subjected to some discrimination as well; because our views were not what the government would have liked. Mr. Kathrada's book again brings back the frustration one felt of the dishonesty and cruelty of the white protestant government, hiding behind racial superiority and religion, and keeping everyone misinformed. This is a must read book for everyone, to remind us of what should not be happening in this world again. I am very proud of what the new S.A. government has achieved."},{"Title":"Are You Ready? the Best and Worst Predictions for the Millennium","review":"If your in the mood for a road-map of the future printed in the past this is something you might want to unfold.

Apparently, Jill Smolinski's writing style is similar to Marian Keyes's and Jennifer Weiner's. Having read the aforementioned authors' novels, I picked up Flip-Flopped. Glad I did. Filled with dry, sarcastic humor, Keenley is one of the funniest heroines I have read in a while.Set in Hawaii, Keeley is under a lot of stress. Her husband, Kam, has left her for a hula dancer. He intends to move to Figi with her and, to Keeley's dismay, take his and Keeley's son with him, which is why he stops at nothing to get full custody of the child. To make matters worse, she is stuck in a professional rut. As a scientist, she wishes to study the progress of a volcano that threatens to burst at any given day, but she is in charge of the finance department instead. The only good thing going in her life is Ian, an adorable British art agent. But does she have time for romance? And, more importantly, is she over Kam? There are some interesting twists in the novel.I love the characters. Morna, Keeley's eccentric divorce lawyer, is the most hilarious character in the novel. I also liked Regatta and Keeley's workmates. Character development was done brilliantly.I have to agree with my friend. Smolinski's writing is similar to Marian Keyes's and Jennifer Weiner's. In fact, for all Marian Keyes fans, this novel reminds me of Watermelon. However, Smolinski is a great author in her own right. I hope that she continues to write for a living. I recommend this gem."},{"Title":"Flip-Flopped: A Novel","review":"I saw that this got a \\"thumbs up\\" from the author of GOOD IN BED (which I loved), so I decided to check it out... glad I did! I couldn't put it down! Much like GOOD IN BED, the main character is witty and a bit sarcastic, yet the book has moments where it's very touching. It tells the story of Keely, a woman who's trying to come to grips with the fact that she's been dumped by her husband, then finds herself in a custody battle over their four-year-old son. There are some very funny moments in here. My favorites were the erotic origami auction and the scenes involving Davy Jones of the Monkees. Hilarious! Yet the story also has a lot to say about love, relationships, forgiveness and parenting that will stay with you long after the laughs are over. You can't go wrong for a fun and thoughtful read. The BEST book of the summer!"},{"Title":"Flip-Flopped: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed the characters in this book. Ms.Smolinski made then seem like my friends. I loved the Origami Exhibit! Her style of writing makes for a fun read, yet her characters had depth, and you really felt the emotions that Keeley was going through.

A friend of mine suggested a brand-new romantic comedy called \\"Flip-Flopped.\\"I picked up a copy and later that night started to read it. Well, I couldn't put it down. Page after page kept me riveted to this amazing character, Keeley, and her emotional roller coaster ride on the Big Island of Hawaii.What made the book so unique and fun was that the author gave us a character we have not seen before. Keeley is sexy and sweet, smart and refreshingly unsentimental. In the madness of a divorce she somehow manages to keep her head together and keep her heart open all the while taking care of her adorable son Dante.As she balances affairs of the law and the heart we fall in love with Keeley's tenacity, tenderness and her terrific sense of humor.I found this book to be a fantastic read. The problem is I couldn't stop reading it.

Keeley Baker-Kekuhi is a smart, but frazzled, woman with an interesting job (as a volcanologist), a young son and an even more immature surfer-dude husband, whom she's trying to divorce, in fits and starts. Smolinski's writing is nimble and makes biting use of pop culture (the kind spelled with a \\"k\\").

Personally as a straight male I wouldn't be caught dead reading a book like this. But my girlfriend read it and I kept wondering what the hell she was laughing out loud about. She handed the book to me several times over the days that she was reading it and I found myself cracking up as well. Needless to say, when she was finished, I picked it up. I'm normally the \\"Stephen King\\" type book reader, but this book is damn funny, especially for a \\"chick book\\". Anyways, I'm sure the women will love this book, but if you're a guy and want some hilarious insight into the way a woman's mind can work, pick this book up. Of course this is fiction (wink, wink)."},{"Title":"Flip-Flopped: A Novel","review":"What a wonderful find! Very witty with great characters. She had me laughing from the first paragraph -- seriously! I outright roared at the origami exhibit, winced in L.A., gulped when....well, I won't spoil it. Jill is a talented storyteller who will keep you in stitches with her sarcastic one-twos. Much like her other writing, this book puts you right there with the characters, almost as one of them, rather than as a spectator.The story rolled so well I felt I was watching her share her story, complete with the usual side comments and brief histories that pepper animated conversations. This novel is also visually provocative, but not blatantly so, which would have been dreadful. I read this book in two evenings, with young boys charging about, even, because I didn't want to put it down.Keely is a character that you want to &quot;wahoo!&quot; for, as she attempts to gracefully glide through such difficult times. The allusions to the time and place of her youth are, trust me, dead-on, another reason I really like this book. The other characters are rife with mannerisms and idiosyncracies enough to fill a Bob-Lo boat.While I've never actually been there yet, the descriptions in &quot;Flip-Flopped&quot; led me into what I imagine would be real-world Hawaii, off the beaten resort path. Who needs Fabio?! Kam in his surf duds, with the descriptions of this clever authoress, does it for me.Now, where did I put that Hawaiian music CD?

This is a book that makes you laugh out loud (especially when Keeley is describing a past event or thinking about something that could happen in the future). I loved the scene when she was thinking about family tales that she would someday pass on to her grandkids (or, as Keeley noted, probably wouldn't pass on). And, her interactions with her attorney are hilarious.

While there are many books on Gurdjieff which detail his complex philosophies, they require basic level of understanding of the Gurdjieff to understand them. Until now, that basic level of understanding could only be achieved through years of research. For the first time, this introduction is available in a single book. Gurdjieff: An Introduction to His Life and Ideas is the seminal stepping stone toward all other Gurdjieff teachings. The clarity and charisma with which Mr. Shirley wields his pen, place this work apart from all other explanations of Gurdjieff and his teachings. Most of these other books, while indeed enlightening, are a true labor to digest. Mr. Shirley's book stands in stark contrast to these difficult reads. Without eschewing detail, Mr. Shirley enlightens and entertains with his splendid introduction. Finally, a definitive background on Gurdjieff and his philosophies, you will not want to put down."},{"Title":"Gurdjieff","review":"Although I am not new in the \\"Work\\", it is always very stimulating to come across a nice and well written literary work about such a man as Mr Gurdjieff, or simply G. No matter how much deep we dig into our selves, to me at least, this man still stand above us in his sharp and compassionate view of our own possibilities. In reading Mr Shirley book, one gets the feeling and the atmosphere of those first years of the \\"work\\", in a time where the world was (like today!), very much immersed in deep sleep (wars...).But I do have one little piece of criticism, nothing that denegrates the work itself, but an attitude commom among orthodox Gurdjieff followers. That is, the subtle negativity directed towards Mr Ouspensky. One can feel that throgought the book, and it is my belief that the work (or Mr G) does not need anyone defending its purity, or making sure everyone undertands that Mr G was really THE TEACHER.Other than this minor mistake (in my view, of course), the book is very pleasent to read and well structured. I do recommend."},{"Title":"Gurdjieff","review":"This book knows the real Gurdjieff teaching (some groups out there are a bit mixed up). THe book has received very good reviews in Publisher's Weekly, Library Journal and elsewhere. It's objective, it's not promotional, and it criticizes Gurdjieff, evenhandedly, as well as setting out his very important teaching."},{"Title":"Gurdjieff","review":"The author manages to make some extremely complicated ideas as clear as any introduction can make them and does so in a highly readable manner. Whether one agrees or disagrees with the teachings of Gurdjieff, knows nothing of them, or is already acquainted with his ideas, reading this book will be a rewarding experience. Gurdjieff has always been a controversial figure, but he founded no religion and neither have his followers, but those with an interest in religion, spirituality, philosophy, or just looking for an interesting biography of a fascinating chracter."},{"Title":"Gurdjieff","review":"John Shirley has written an invaluable biography of the philosopher and mystic G.I. Gurdjieff. His writing is clear and incisive, and he gives the reader a very good sense of the man, \\"warts and all.\\"Gurdjieff was a very difficult man to be around, according to those who were his students and companions. He relentlessly strove to shake people from their \\"dream\\" and get them to see reality. While he had many faults, he also had a compelling vision of what humans were and could become.I would recommend reading this book to anyone who wants to study Gurdjieff or Ouspensky in depth, before they take on the original material. Gurdjieff's writing style is very difficult, while Ouspensky is much clearer, conveying the same general orientation. Shirley's book will help clarify the distinctions, and give a good overview of the body of Gurdjieff's thought."},{"Title":"Gurdjieff","review":"Author John Shirley has written a clear and compelling overview of the life, ideas and teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff. Shirley clarifies that this book is just an introductory piece, and points to other works, including Ouspensky's &lt;i&gt;In Search of the Miraculous&lt;/i&gt;, which Shirley describes as the authoritative explanation of the Gurdjieff Work, insofar as a book can do justice to Gurdjieff's teachings, which are said to be experiential rather than intellectual. However I think he's too modest; he's clearly devoted subtantial careful research and consideration to his complex subject. I highly recommend this book - even if you've never heard of Gurdjieff, it's a great read."},{"Title":"Gurdjieff","review":"It seems there are always strong personalities around who want to dominate others. And there are others looking for a life and let themselves be dominated. Shirley, like other Gurdjieff devotees, is so full of hero worship he doesn't see the shortcomings he describes in his hero. Gurdjieff's teachings are pretty ordinary, and derivative. He cherry picks ideas from Kabbalah, then adds some twists of his own.His actual teachings are simplistic.He loved to mess people up by getting them to do things they found unpleasant, such as giving him something they highly valued.Gurdjieff had his pupils do senseless things, such as dig holes and them fill them in.It is not mentioned by Shirley, but once Gurdjieff had elderly women followers try and dig out a tree stump with teaspoons. Such tasks were supposed to induce mindfulness, but it just shows a streak of sadism lurking in the Gurdjieff personality. A true teacher helps the pupils to be free, whereas Gurdjieff had tricks in his teachings to confuse and make pupils dependent on him. At one point Shirley says Gurdjieff was saintly. Shirley, after stating Gurdjieff fathered an unknown number of illegitimate children, rapidly moves on to other matters.Gurdjieff smoked, drank alcohol, and ate meat. (Shirley reports that Krishnamurti didn't think much of Gurdjieff because he smoked. Make of that what you will.) This biography is one-sided because Shirley has too much hero worship for his subject."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"This book is one of many other aviational books i have read.

Full of personal anecdotes from his time with the AVG (Flying Tigers), VMF 214 (The Black Sheep), his time as a &quot;Special Captive&quot; (not a POW) of the Japanese (in my opinion the most interesting part of the book), his post-war fall from grace and descent in to acute alchoholism, and finally his redemption. Nothing politically correct about this one folks. Boyington calls them as he sees them. An absorbing first person account of an amazing time in human history. Shows that the Black Sheep weren't the collection of &quot;screwballs &amp; misfits&quot; portrayed in the entertaining, yet highly fictionalized 70's TV show. Also the story of a man trying to make sense of his life. I have owned this one for over 20 years, and re-read it on a regular basis. It never gets boring. A man who's days of combat were over by the age of 31, was considered the 'old man' in his squadron, hence his famous nickname. I find it amazing that a 6 week or so period of time in this man's life defined if thereafter. Well worth having in any WW II buff's collection, or simply for fans of the TV show who are interested in learning a version closer to the truth, at least the truth as seen through the eyes of the man himself."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"I came to this book believing that \\"Pappy\\" Boyington was a pugnacious drunken spendthrift that the Marine Corps was anxious to be rid of, and that he may not have been the leading Marine Corps ace of World War II as he was thought to be. From what I had read, Boyington spent most of his time on the ground as a member of the American Volunteer Group (AVG), better known as \\"The Flying Tigers,\\" and was only credited with shooting down 3 Japanese planes (although he claimed six). I also understood that Boyington left the AVG early and was the only man ever dishonorably discharged from that organization. In addition, I questioned his account of the final action in which he was shot down, another unseen action in which he claimed two more enemy planes.After reading this book, however, I'm not quite so sure. In it, Boyington readily admits that he was a \\"drunk\\" and a \\"bum,\\" and he allows as how he liked to wrestle a bit. As to his claim of six enemy planes while with the AVG, his explanation is easily believable. As he explains it: In order to get credit for a kill with the AVG you almost had to bring your victim back to the landing field in your teeth and drop it where everyone could see it, whereas the majority of his kills had been 75 to 100 miles away, most times behind enemy lines. In addition, and most likely with some merit, he states that the records of his actions at Rangoon were lost when that city fell to the Japanese. With regard to his being \\"dishonorably discharged\\" from the AVG, Boyington acknowledges that he left shortly before the remaining volunteers were forced/coerced into the Army Air Corps as 2nd lieutenants. But once again his explanation rings true. Boyington correctly states that he wasn't the only member of the AVG to leave the group, that the reason he left was because he wanted to return to the Marine Corps rather than be conscripted into the Army, and that it was ridiculous to claim that you could \\"dishonorably discharge\\" someone from a civilian volunteer organization. As to his account of his final, once again unseen action, Boyington's account is so vivid as to be easily believable.Having read a number of books which touched upon the life and times of Gregory \\"Pappy\\" Boyington before reading this one, I had already formed a somewhat negative impression of the man. After reading this book, however, I have concluded that it is one thing to view a man from the outside, especially from a distance in time, recounting his every fault and failure, but it is quite another thing to view that same man from the inside looking out.So, although much about Boyington is and will always remain a mystery, he certainly was an American hero and he certainly could tell an interesting, believable, and highly entertaining tale. And this is one of them. But don't stop reading too early. You certainly won't want to miss the chapters in which he recounts his nineteen months as a \\"captive\\" of the Japanese. To me, that's the best part of the book. Six stars anyone?"},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"Pappy Boyington would not have gotten great marks for literary style or technique, but a reader delving into BAA BAA BLACK SHEEP probably wouldn't care very much. I certainly didn't. The insight into the man's life is often priceless--especially his takes on aerial combat, his experiences in the South Pacific (both before and after being shot down), and the Japanese people once the war was over. The lucid and colorful accounts of his days in the AVG as well as VMF 214 make all the superfluous sidetrips, self-deprecating ruminations, and endless proselytizing (even though he tells you time and again he's not doing that) worth the bumpy ride. There's a genuineness and immediacy about his story that would indicate that, while he may have necessarily had a heavy-handed editor, the words are basically his own. Boyington drives home the excitement and horror of his wartime experiences with great intensity, making this book a real thriller. Despite Boyington's endless flaws and rough edges (which he never ceases to remind you of), he comes across as a character to admire and to identify with--even if you often want to smack him a good one. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"This is a strange book with a misleading title. It is more an autobiography than a narration about the Black Sheep squadron. However, I rate it five stars because it delivers what I was looking for, an excellent narration of Boyington's internment in a Japanese internment camp.Reading the book, it appears Boyington wrote it himself without the help of a ghost writer or editor, and it shows. It rambles at times, meditates, confuses, dwells on his drinking problems... But overall, Boyington delivers the goods: (1) a pre-war background; (2) his work in China; (3) the Black Sheep aviators; (4) his being shot down by the Japanese; (5) his internment; and (6) after the war.Boyington, the author, treats us to the use of \\"tough guy\\" 1940-1945 words and expressions, which is refreshing, and he goes into detail on some events which could have been left out but which, nevertheless, are very interesting (traveling as a missionary, adventures ashore, etc.) and give the book a special touch.His capture by the Japanese was what I was after, and I was well satisfied. Boyington goes into great detail and, by his method of writing, makes the reader feel you could actually see him sitting there begging sake from the Japanese guards while he worked in the kitchen preparing for one of their celebrations.A nice book, better written by Boyington than by a ghost writer. It captures the essence of the moment."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"At first I found this book dull and boring. The author talks in great detail about his drunken excesses in the opening year of service as a pilot in the Pacific. It gets to be a bit much. He obviously has a big problem controlling his alcohol. The beginning of the book should be titled \\"I was too drunk to remember much\\". However the author begins to change as he is given more responisiblity. He becomes a leader. He leads a very successful fighter group. However after his 26th aerial victory he himself is shot down. When he is captured by the Japanese he is beaten and treated very poorly.The best part of this book is that even though he was a rough and tough SOB that liked his booze and was badly beaten and mistreated by most of the Japanese guards - he does not hate his \\"enemy\\" in the end. He writes in great detail about some courageous acts kindness that some Japanese offer him while he is in captivity. These stories are very moving, honest, and personal. You will be amazed at the transformation. The last third of the book is well worth it. Unfortunately when he returned to the US he got back into the drinking. A tragic hero."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"Greg Boyington is likely the most likeable and most irritating of WWII heroes. He was a Flying Tiger before he was a Black Sheep, and he was a drunkard and a braggart throughout. His autobiography is a delight to read, but you can't take it at face value--he had a ghost writer, he had some axes to grind, and he himself admitted that booze affected his memory. Still, you haven't read them all if you haven't read this one."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"I found this book to be a fascinating historical look at the Pacific theater during World War II from the eyes of a marine combat pilot who experienced it first hand. Boyington was indeed in the thick of it during the war, and to his credit he shot down 28 Japanese planes during his time in combat. Once in a single mission, he shot down five planes over Japanese territory. This book is an auto-biography of his time before, during and after the war. It is quite an interesting read. I enjoyed the pilot's viewpoint this book carries from the cockpit of a Corsair during combat. Boyington was an incredibly adept pilot and taught the other pilots in his famous \`Black Sheep Squadron' how to beat the Japanese in air combat. Boyington describes first hand aerial dogfights over the Pacific Islands that comprised well over 100 planes at a time with the skies glowing like fire flies filled with tracer fire, a truly remarkable period in aerial combat history. He portrays his experiences as a pilot and later as a 'Special Captive' instead of a prisoner of war, with finesse so as not to make it too heavy of a read, but it leaves the reader with a deep respect for the American service man. During his time in a Japanese prison of war camp, his courage was undaunted and he emerged as a true American hero receiving national recognition after the war was over having won the Navy Cross and the Congressional Medal of Honor. This book is relayed by the author in a first person narrative, and is a sincere and down to earth account of his experiences. It is very interesting and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"There is no doubt that Pappy Boyington was a man who really had &quot;been there and done that.&quot; He was a Flying Tiger and an ace before WWII even began, recipient of the Medal of Honor, and a former Japanese &quot;special captive&quot;.His writing style is certainly not concisce. It is sometimes winding, often rambling and tortured. Pappy was not a writer, and doesn't try to pretend the book is a peice of great literature. He is just a man who had been through a heck of a lot, and shares his recollections with you. Pappy simply calls them the way he sees them.Pappy Boyington would be the first to point out his numerous flaws, (he points them out in the book ad nauseum...). The book is almost nothing at all like the series. I loved the series when I was a kid, and still watch it on the History Channel. But the tales in the book are his real recollections, this is history the way Pappy saw it, there are other accounts that sometimes do not jibe with what Pappy remembers. That really doesn't bother me, nor do I think it detracts from who Pappy Boyington was.Is all of the history accurate? I don't know, I am not a historian. Should you take some of his assertions with a grain of salt? Of course, I do that no matter what the source. Should you read this book? I would recommend that you do if you are interested in the subject matter at all."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"Boyington was definitely not your Tom Cruz type of pilot, he was an unorthodox risk taking, erm, a Black Sheep, which goes a long way to describe his style. In a time when so many people played it by the book, he took men destined for hard jail time and turned them into one of the most feared squadrons of the South Pacific.The book is a description of the days with his squadron, as recounted by him so expect this not a dry and exacting account written by someone in USMC public relations.This is among my favorite books of all time, and a recomended read for anyone interested in aviation, WWII, or just a great (and true) action story."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"I first met Pappy at the Oshkosh Airshow in 1983. He came across as he does in the book; somewhat of a braggard but also self depreciating. While the book is certainly worth reading, I am disappointed that no one (including Pappy) attempted to expand on his biography in the years since it was written. I would like to know more about how he chose the Marines, his early training and flying experiences before the war and the period of time after he wrote the book until his death.To more fully understand the period that is described in the book, one should read Daniel Ford's &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; and Walton's &quot;Once They Were Eagles&quot;. The TV serial, while it occasionally borrowed ideas from the book, must be supressed (except for the great aerial sequences)."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"This aired a long time a go, but we enjoyed it then and now thanks to technology, we are enjoying them again.

A true Marine and American. Great addition to my book collection. Nothing better than actually having the book in your hands."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"I was deeply touched by Pappy Boyington's thoughtful and apparently honest insights about himself in this book. Especially interesting was his descriptive telling of the 20 months he spent as a secret prisoner of the Japanese. His appreciation of cultural difference seems ahead of his time. His very human flaws made the book even more interesting to me. From the difficult upbringing he had, I can appreciate what he was to accomplish in his life (flaws and all)."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"The flying life of WWII fighter pilot Greg Boyington, who flew against the Japanese with the Flying Tigers immeidately prior to to WWII and then again with the Marines until being shotdown in 1944 and becoming a POW. Greg &quot;Pappy&quot; Boyington's career as a Marine aviator was pretty much over before America even entered WWII. At that point, teh fighting was being carried on, supposedly, by the Europeans and the Chinese. When numerous pilots were being asked to join the famous &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; - a Chinese AF unit actually run by Americans and flying American fighters - Boyington jumoed at the chance. With his career going nowhere, and his marriage also over, the prospect of going to China to fly against the Chinese offered him a chance of redemption, to put his career on hold until he could get back from China with a record strong enough to rejuvinate his career. Instead, frequent clashes with the head of the Tigers - Claire Chennault - led to Boyington's quick removal from that unit. Leaving China, where condescending Yankees are sewing the seeds of hostility which the Chinese will harvest in 1949, Boyington finds he can't get back to flight duty. The Marines, from which Boyington resigned in order to join the Tigers, at first can find no record of Boyington's arrangement to rejoin the Marines at Major's rank. Despite this, and also despite Chennault's insistence to Boyington's superiors that Boyington be reinstated to the Marines and given a desk job, Boyington returns to the Pacific in time to fly F-4U Corsairs against the Japanese for the Marines. Patching together a squadron out of misfit flyers, Boyington leads his men against the Japanese in a theater that isn't getting the most attention from Washington. Everything seems second hand about Boyington's unit, already deemed unusable by others. This was especially true of their planes. Though the Corsair was powerful, it had racked up a poor saftey record among Navy carrier units unused to it. Nicknames like &quot;Widowmaker&quot;, &quot;Bent-Wing Eliminator&quot; and &quot;Whispering Death&quot; hint at a lethality directed at Corsair pilots almost as much as at the Japanese.Shotdown by the end of 1944, Boyington endures nightmarish deprivation as a POW. Nevertheless, there isn't a bitter bone against the Japanese to be found anywhere.Returning to America with the war's end, Boyington slides deeper into alcholism and failure. The most enduring image for me is that of the scarred warrior as a ref in wrestling matches, a long way from the glory he should have realized from his iron determination in the air. Boyington's honesty seems striking - he reserves virtually all of the blame for himself. &quot;Show me a hero&quot;, he says &quot;and I'll show you a bum.&quot;"},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"I'm not a big military/plane history book reader but I found Pappy's book interesting enough to make it through within a few days of buying it.I enjoyed hearing his view on things that were happening and of not reading so much the technical aspects of the war/planes.There were times when I felt it needed something. Like a kick in the rear to get it going but decided that this was written by Pappy not Tom Clancy. This was his life, it was not &quot;entertainment&quot; to him.He put himself down alot about his drinking which, to me seemed like he was trying to make amends with the reader about his problem. I ignored this and concentrated on the story. It had me wanting to hear more and I was never bored with it.This book shows that heros can be great and still be human.It showed that people we call enemies are human also.I mostly liked that it's not blood and guts so I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"Readers who read this expecting to find redneck caricature Sergeant Micklin who calls the fliers \\"college boys\\" and fires antiaircraft guns with a cigar clenched in his teeth will come up empty.

But General Moore was a real person--you'll find him here as the tough-but-fair \\"old man\\" he was in the series. As was Colonel Lard, who was so unable to judge Boyington by his effectiveness instead of spit and polish that Moore frequently had to intercede between the two. But the Solomon Slot period depicted in the series was but a part of a much wider autobiography written here by Boyington himself. Boyington is brutally candid about his own alcoholism in this book, plus he gives a lot more credit to Naval fliers saving his butt on at least one occaision than the \\"branch-o-centric\\" version of him as played by Conrad ever would have. I was amused to find mention of Japanese night bomber \\"Washing Machine Charlie\\" and his nuisance raids which kept the base awake largely through the out-of-synch twin engines which gave him his name--my memories of the series supplied me with the sound--an oscillation that sounded just like my mother's Easy Spin Dry pre-automatic washer."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"great service and a book in great condition at a price well below similar offerings."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"i could not put the book down until i finished it. make sure you have time to read this book before you start it."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"The story itself is good, but getting through the writing is a chore.

It was the first book I read about War, etc. After 30 years or so, and Thousands of books later, I still consider it one of the best. Boyington was not afraid to be honest, even to the point that it made him look bad. I have read hundreds of vietnam books where the authors are so concerned about their image, that the words don't ring true. Not so here. While this is not the quintessential WWII book, it is a study in A hero to zero to redemption. I re-read it every 2 years or so. ps. the teacher was a WWII vet, appreciated that I read a boot about his war and gave me an A."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"he was no hero. As he said himself, he was a &quot;daredevil&quot; and a &quot;drunk.&quot; But he lived long enough to realize it & suffered greatly in the process. He doesn't hit the brutality he encountered too hard. He didn't hate the Japanese, despite the POW camps he was in; he hated careerists and martinets more, and says so. Discipline wasn't his forte, but he knew the difference between wartime and peacetime leadership, when many didn't. He valued friendship above all and found friends everywhere. He manged to alienate those he worked for and earn the admiration of those who worked for him. He was the man Hemingway wanted to be--hard-drinking, two fisted, a fighter, a man's man. But his values changed as he left youth behind. His introspection about the growth of spirit is limited, but he's clear about balance being the only road to happiness, and he sets out on that road with the determination he exhibited in his flying career. He says he was never brave and that the line between being brave and being a bum is a fine one. It was in his case, as he admits. This is a man who did what he had to when he had to and had no illusions about the patriotic gore he heard or read. He reveals his humanity by what he notices and reports, sometimes grudgingly. But the effect is one of a confessional by the unrepentant, as if some of the twelve steps in his cure were still missing. Overall, an unpretentious book by an Ace pilot who lived through the worst and lived to tell about it. Worth reading, and more humane and unpretentious than most books by WWII pilots."},{"Title":"Baa baa, black sheep","review":"The man lived one hell of a life. I recommend after reading this, you read a biography such as \\"Black Sheep One\\", by Bruce Gamble. It will shed more light on Pappy's youth and how amazing it is he accomplished all he did. It will also shed some light on some of the creative liberties Pappy took, and on the outright exagerations Pappy made.

Some of the Japs were good to him and others were bad to him. After the war he goes home and receives the medal of honor. Sadly his life then takes a turn for the worse and he starts to drink again.

Who doesn't like the myth surrounding this squadron's, & Boyington's, exploits (except Lard)? I just started reading The Black Sheep (Bruce Gamble) to see how much light that sheds on the truth. Boyington's real life story is interesting enough. Some claims are impossible to disprove due to no witnesses. Others? Well, here's what stood out the most for me: He said he bailed out through a closed & locked canopy bubble... Simply by pushing the stick forward w/his foot. He claimed centrifugal force did the rest. Ahah... He then claimed to be repeatedly strafed by a couple of Zekes while helplessly treading water. Despite strafing him for about 30minutes. He said they never got a good hit on him. He claimed resultant serious wounds that magically healed without proper care (I'm a Nurse) Suuure.... He was a self-admitted pathological liar. He also did enough without the embellishments to deserve respect. I feel for him, especially his life-long battle w/the bottle. He shouldn't have had to walk such a hard road after the war. A hard road he doesn't allude to in great detail, BTW. It's a worthy read. The author of the book I'm reading on the Black Sheep, Gamble. He apparently doesn't like Boyington @all. He wrote another book specifically about Boyington. He supposedly slams Boyington throughout the book. I think I'll take a pass on that one. I like Greg the way I envision him now. Part BS, part truth, warts & all, a plucky regular Joe.

Back in WW2, it was more acceptable to be a hard drinker, but even by those standards, Pappy had problems, which he admits to in his Bio of 1958.Of course the media make a huge deal out of who shot down how many Japanese planes, and Pappy felt this pressure, as well as those of leading a squadron of Marine pilots. Back in the early days of WW2, the US was just beginning to reign supreme over the Japanese.After 26 victories, he was shot down and spent time as a guest in a Japanese POW camp for 20 months where torture was routine and brutal.Success did not come so easily to Pappy after the war, but after finally winning his struggle with alcohol, things improved and he enjoyed a resurgence of popularity and fame when the 1971 TV series came out with Robert Conrad playing Pappy. Anyone familiar with the show knows that it is a very Hollywoodized version of what happened.This is a good bio, the writing style is understated, which was common back then.

However, if you want to be in the company of Pappy Boyington as he spins his yarns,apparently told from memory, than this is the best book on the subject. I liked that he wrote every word himself which is a nice change from the host of celebrety books you see today, some with three authors. Even if some stories are \\"misremebered\\" they let you get the feel of the man for who he was. It's interesting to note that nowhere in the book does Boyington refer to his men as misfits. I have a first addition of the book and the whole misfit legend seems to come from one line on the dust jacket. Over the years Boyington seemed to play up on that himself, perhaps as a marketing tool.Young readers today with short attention spans may have a hard time with this book, the early chapters on Burma and China read more like a travel log than a miltary shoot 'em up.

I enjoyed reading it and all the information contained in it is very useful. I had bought some essential oils but didn't want to start using them before having more information on how to do it safely! I wish the author didn't use the word etc because one is left without knowing the other options. Also, when she tells you the complaints essential oils can be used for (which is very useful) I wish she would tell in which form, bath, gargling, ingested, topical..... with a carrier oil, without..... I think that I will give another one a go as well. The explanations about how to massage are very interesting but I wonder if a layperson like myself will manage to remember it all.... but I will try! I will surely try some of her recipes and see where I can buy her products. I have already tried essential oils diluted in yogurt in my bath and also gargled with tea tree oil, vodka and water.Aromatherapy is fascinating and although I am new to this I hope to be using it more often in the future (minus point is that so many oils on the market seem to be adulterated)!"},{"Title":"Christmas in Plains (memories)","review":"President Carter is a man ahead of most by centuries, ahead mentally, peace making, way ahead spiritully. These traits strongly show in this book. These traits shown forth when he was President, and for some, these same took advantage of him. The Iranian Hostage Crisis is the utmost example, being a man of peace, the primitive and simple minded could abuse him. This has always been the case in the past, the intelligent and peaceful get run over by the aggressive lower minded. Now Mr. Carter is showing forth by continuing this peaceful way and effort. These pages are more than memories, the insightful can read better than that, they can see that he has a powerful message of peace and advancement that 95 percent of the world is not able to grasp yet due to simple mindedness. But people like Mr Carter are offering us valuable contributions that will in time help. My way of saying Hi President Carter (always the president of peace) is check out another mind similar, a book ahead of its time, SB 1 or God By Karl Mark Maddox. Destiny is what it is all about now, the only way we can assure that is a move to peace world wide. What would our destiny be without the true and honest peace makers?Recommend reading Karl Mark Maddox, way ahead of our time."},{"Title":"Christmas in Plains (memories)","review":"In An Hour Before Daylight former President Jimmy Carter reminisced about his boyhood on the farm during the Great Depression. Included in that were memories of Christmases, both for his family and for those around him in the farming community of Archery. Following up on the reception of An Hour Before Daylight, President Carter has focused his reminiscences on Christmases on the farm, in Plains, in Atlanta, and in the White House.Christmas in Plains is a short but warm book that will not take long to read. In that short time, however, the reader will be struck by the importance of family, tradition, and holiday in President Carter's life. Some of the material presented is repeated from An Hour Before Daylight, and perhaps from some of President Carter's other books as well. It doesn't matter. The book is well-written, and evokes in the reader his own stirring of ghosts of Christmas past.Written by almost anyone else, this book would not attract much attention. Many people have experienced Christmases much like these (except for the White House). Perhaps that is why it does receive attention-because of President Carter's celebrity we will read it and remember our own roots, family times, and traditions. And this is a time when those memories bring us a special comfort."},{"Title":"Christmas in Plains (memories)","review":"Merry Christmas from the Former PresidentProlific former President Carter's slim volume of Christmas memories--most spent in his hometown--makes for a quick and easy read and leaves a lingering satisfied feeling. No vignette is particularly earth-shattering, but perhaps it is the mundane and wholesome nature of his experiences that makes them all the more engrossing.While few observers would term Jimmy Carter a great president, only the most blindly partisan Republicans fail to see him as a noble patriot overflowing with integrity. These identifying attributes are quietly displayed throughout the episodes he narrates. Even when he steps on a few toes, they are feet that deserve it. Those with a phobia about vestiges of Christianity in public schools will shutter when he writes of his childhood, \\"it would have been ridiculous in those days for anyone in our community, or the state of Georgia, to think that the dedicated religious services that were held every day in the public school might violate in any way the First Amendment.\\" The former president sees great value in the school's religious presentations \\"because they reached every child, not just the churchgoers.\\" Such virtuous suasion may earn him membership in the vast right wing conspiracy in some circles, but unabashed honesty forms the basis of Jimmy Carter.Perusing his others Yuletide tales spent in the Navy, as a young father and husband, serving as Georgia's governor, on to the White, House, and back home again, readers may be disappointed by the skeletal nature of certain chapters. However, Carter's post-presidency has produced a substantial oeuvre, and other works can undoubtedly flesh out the missing tidbits.Maybe the book's greatest strength is near complete avoidance of the political realm. Carter seems to be saying that Christmas is for all Americans, and while politics has its place, it takes a back seat--or at least it should-- to our nation's sacred holidays."},{"Title":"Christmas in Plains (memories)","review":"In the short &quot;Christmas in Plains&quot; Jimmy Carter shares mermories from a lifetime of very disparate Christmases. He remembers childhood holidays in rural Georgia where his young African-American neighbors might get an orange and some raisins. He recalls the four Christmases he spent as President. A very religious and family-oriented man, Carter has alsways treasured the birth of Christ as one of the highlights of his year. Easily read in one night this is a charming little book. To better understand this complicated and important man, a fuller read is last year's &quot;An Hour Before Daylight&quot; which is a more thorough memoir of his childhood years. But &quot;Christmas in Plains&quot; stands on its own: a charming, sometimes heartwarming account of a good man and his 70+ Christmases. This deserves to become a minor holiday classic--unlike, say, Grisham's new &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;."},{"Title":"Christmas in Plains (memories)","review":"I had the privilege and honor of meeting President Carter at the University of Washington, where he signed a copy of this book for me. &quot;Christmas in Plains&quot; is a wonderful book that approaches autobiography in a new and interesting way: Jimmy Carter reflects on his life as a series of holiday seasons.

His earliest memories begin around 1930 (when he was 5), and involve memories of father Earl and mother Lillian, as well as black neighbors (in an era of separation, his family perhaps represented a light in the South). There are happy childhood memories of finding the Christmas tree and fireworks. Jimmy and Rosalynn always tried to get back to Plains, but there are included a few absent remembrance from Navy years, and a rather tense Christmas with the holding of the Iran hostages. The line drawings by daughter Amy add a family charm to the book.

Part of that reputation has been earned through the numerous books he has penned over the years. His books are thoughtful and down-to-earth, and remind us of values and perspectives that are truly part of the American tradition. His latest book is no exception and offers a delightful read during this holiday season--an opportunity to pause and reflect on Christmas Past with the former president, thereby recalling our own Christmas memories as well. Once again, we thank this man of wisdom and integrity for sharing his thoughts and memories with us!"},{"Title":"Christmas in Plains (memories)","review":"I learned more about President Carter than I did before but overall I was not very impressed with the book."},{"Title":"Christmas in Plains (memories)","review":"ISBN 0743224914 - I've got a large collection of Christmas books and thought that Christmas In Plains would fit in nicely. Since then, I've read the book and have no desire to keep it - but I am glad to have read it. It's a nice look at Christmases gone by and a tiny window on the interaction between blacks and whites in rural Georgia over the years.Carter shares his memories of Christmas throughout his life. As a member of a well-off family in Georgia, he is blissfully unaware of any real difference between himself and his black playmates and shares Christmas joys with them as well as with his close family. Even the town figures into the earliest celebrations, with fireworks and church services. Through his years at West Point and in the Navy, including the early years of his marriage and finally reaching his time in public service, when his family grew and grew until, returning to Georgia from the White House, he and his wife find that much has changed - and much has stayed the same.For other former presidents, perhaps the years in office would be their choice for an uplifting ending to a book like this. Carter chooses to end with the beginnings of his time with Habitat for Humanity, a fitting place to leave things for this man who, more than any other recent president, comes across as a normal guy with the ability to relate to the rest of us.I was a little annoyed to find that the first chapter or two never really came into focus. Carter spends most of his ink there pointing out, in various ways, how not racist he is. While I believe that Carter's an open-minded non-racist, it seemed a little much. On the other hand, bookending the entire tale with his childhood among black neighbors in the 1930-1940s with the story of Curtis and Martha, black neighbors in need of help, is a great choice. Despite being part of a close family, and his mentioning the days before his father's death, he glosses over that death and its impact on himself, his family and their holidays. The illustrations by Amy Carter would have been cute, had they been done when she was 8. She's not eight and the only cute factor is that they're evidence of her closeness to her father. A nice holiday read, just not a keeper.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Christmas in Plains (memories)","review":"This is a perfect book to read at the holidays, curled up in a comfy chair with a good drink and a warm blanket.Who knew Jimmy Carter was so sentimental?

A great Christmas book is Hickam's The Coalwood Way."},{"Title":"Long Shore: A Psychological Experience of the Wilderness","review":"Jane Wheelwright and Linda Schmidt -- a mother-daughter team -- authored this book, which is really a conversation about the intricate relationship between one's psyche and one's place. Both are trained in psychology -- Jane in Zurich at the Jung Center -- and both bring a refreshingly honest self-critical flair to this book.The Long Shore is the story of the Hollister family ranch -- a vast oak-studded arroyo-dipping range of coastal grassland near Santa Barbara, California -- and how each author experienced the place psychologically. Their experiences are extremely different, much of which seems related to the gradual conversion of this vast cattle ranch to a series of late-20th century subdivisions. Sound familiar?By treating this as a personal exploration, and by calling each other down from any soapboxes, the authors go new places in literature. The Long Shore remains the BEST examination I have read of how one's psychological state is derived -- at least in part -- from the state of the land surrounding. How a wild environment parents us. How it challenges us. How it forces a kind of a reflective relationship that few nature-writers have the first-person confidence to detail on the page, and few psychologists have the wherewithal to examine directly in themselves, much less in others.If you incline toward this kind of exploration of inner nature and outer nature, The Long Shore is a book to own, to savor and return to. If you don't incline toward this, what else are you doing that's more important?"},{"Title":"Long Shore: A Psychological Experience of the Wilderness","review":"This mother-and-daughter account of their experience of the Hollister Ranch upon which they both grew up moves the reader into a good feel for how land and psyche interact. There is a minimum of speculation and a maximum of sense and event. The life of the ranch, its voice, surfaces now and again through human conflicts and encounters against the backdrop of its imminent sale. As Jane Wheelright says: &quot;The coastline of the ranch is like the floor plan of my life....&quot;Both writers are Jungian analysts, and most of the Jungian commentary is provided by Lynda Schmidt, who on occasions describes the ranch as a &quot;manifestation of the Self&quot; (for Jung, the Self with a capital S meant the archetype of totality; he also called it the God-image).I think we must be very careful--and Lynda Schmidt generally is--when we bring in archetypal concepts, because how we do so can either illuminate or devalue their manifestations. It's like describing one's wife as a Goddess figure or an anima container: what happened to the actual woman? If we see wilderness as a manifestation of the Self, or even of God, is this helpful, or does it shift our attention away from the wilderness as an entity in its own right?This is one of the few books that take the land seriously. Here is a characteristic passage:I had a strong sense of being buried deep in the soil, lost under the vast, rocky ledges, melted into the landscape, submerged as an integral part of that place. None of the others in my generation had the remotest sense of being so influenced. I was starting at scratch and I felt like a child about to be orphaned."},{"Title":"Managing Technology and Innovation for Competitive Advantage","review":"This book is very thought provoking.

Nearly all of the major scenes are identical. The only difference is that they are told from Saul's POV.

I understand that Stasheff was probably getting bored with the series, but he still could have done a better job with this one."},{"Title":"Witch Doctor (Wizard in Rhyme, Book 3)","review":"My main problem with this book is that it takes Saul's POV the entire time, and to be honest, his need to contradict himself all the time just annoys the heck out of me and takes up too much space. I'm surprised Saul has a guardian angel at all actually. Narlh is the best reason to keep reading. And how stupid is Saul to never realize that Matt is the Lord Wizard of Merovence despite being told that at least 5 times in 3 days???

In this book Matt Mantrell's college chum, Saul, is transported into a magical parallel universe version of Germany and must free it from a satanic sorcerer using rhyming based magical powers he has in this new universe. See the difference?The adventures are fairly similar, both characters go on a journey to fight the evil sorcerer and accumulate a group of quirky friends along the way. There are even ideas lifted nearly whole cloth from the first, Matt and Saul both independently get the idea to summon Maxwell's Demon in each of their books! The main difference between the books is Saul's personality. Matt was pretty agreeable about joining the forces of Good. Saul, however, is really prickly, and refuses to join either Good or Evil.Now, since Saul is supposedly neither Good nor Evil,you'd expect him to do a mixture of good and evil things throughout the book. And your expectations would be unfulfilled. In practice Saul's refusal to choose a side amounts to him waffling a lot and being rude to the Emissaries of Good, but then to go ahead and do the right thing anyway. This is part of an annoying thread I've noticed in Fantasy books in general, namely the idea that Good and Evil are sides that a person joins, rather than evaluative statements about the morality of someone's desires and actions. Saul in spite of Stesheff's attempts to convince us otherwise, isn't an amoral person. He's a good person who's kind of rude.In spite of these flaws this is still a fairly fun adventure novel and it has a few cool ideas. I will never forget the scene where Saul uses magic to remove someone's cancer. I also really liked the troll."},{"Title":"Christmas Bedtime Stories","review":"So I've been reading a few of the stories in here for many years now (probably going on 20 now!)

The final two suitors have to create a dress in one night and the princess has to decide the winner.

Her family doesn't have enough money to buy nice clothes, so she has to make a big decision!Happy Birthday, Sandwich Jackson!--A young boy with a Christmas birthday makes a wish that Christmas was no longer on the same day. It comes true, and then he realizes how special it is.Not Evan A Mouse--A story about Twas the night before Christmas, from the viewpoint of a mouse in the author's house.Pepper Cakes--Set in Salem, NC, a Moravian family makes Christmas cookies, and make some \\"special\\" cookies for the father's troublemaker apprentice. The wrong person ends up finding them, and everybody learns that revenge isn't always best.The Fleet--A boy who is afraid of horses learns that his uncle's horses are reserved by a certain someone at the North Pole! He learns to appreciate the horses and is no longer afraid of them.Crayon Box Christmas--A little girl has just moved to a new apartment, so she gets help from a new friend to make Christmas special.The Best Christmas in the Universe--Santa helps rid the earth of pollution, with the help of other santas in the solar system.John Franklin's Story--A story about the origin of A Santa Claus.It's not the best writing, but you can tell its focused towards children who are getting comfortable with reading.

I had the pleasure of seeing the Childe Hassam retrospective in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2004; it was one of the few times that I have seen total strangers turn to one another at an exhibition this size and speak with each other about their mutual amazement for the artist's technique. I knew a bit about Impressionism, and a bit about American artists such as Whistler and Cassatt who were influenced by Impressionism. But I didn't know anything about Hassam. Who was this wonderful artist and why didn't my college courses in modern art teach me about him?I wanted to learn as much as I could, and this book provided me with the answers to both questions. Childe Hassam was the essential link between the Impressionism of Paris and later American descendants of the genre. He was a proud and gifted man who, like most giants, contained giant-sized paradoxes. He steadfastly denied the influence of Monet while clearly celebrating that influence in his cityscapes. He championed the spirit of the growing spirit of New York City while denying its increasingly immigrant population. In the end, like so many greats, he was an anachronism and ignored by the younger avant-garde. After reading and rereading this immensively informative book, I had a good idea of both who Hassam was and why modern art scholars have trouble with his standing among his peers. He's a complicated person, but aren't all great artists?The illustrations in this book, as you'd expect, are not only first rate but complete. We are treated not only to full-page accurately colored reproductions but also to many enlarged details of the same paintings. All the paintings from the exhibition along with many that were notare reproduced here,and several paintings by Monet and Degas are included for comparisons. The writing style is largely academic, but I think most of this book would be accessible to anyone who loves to read and isn't easily discouraged by long blocks of text. This isn't an oversized picture book, but an indepth examination of Hassam that places him in the context of the early 20th Century.If you enjoy Impressionism and the roots of modern art, and you have a penchant for learning all you can about some of the relatively forgotten figures from that time, you will not only add this book to your collection but cherish it."},{"Title":"Childe Hassam, American Impressionist (Metropolitan Museum of Art Series)","review":"While many books have been published featuring the work of famed American Impressionist Childe Hassam, few offer such stunning illustrations and none trace so completely the many years Hassam spent marketing his art. He lived the statement he made in 1892: \\"I believe the man who will go down to posterity is the man who paints his own time and the scenes of every-day life around him.\\"Paint those scenes he did - who is not moved by his depictions of the red, white and blue flags and banners flying from the tallest buildings in New York City at the onset of World War I? It's clear that Hassam loved New York and painted it in all its many faces - summer, autumn, winter and spring.The artist also spent a great deal of time in New England where he captured quaint villages and fabled East Hampton interiors. Adept at both urban and rural scenes, Hassam studied in Paris where, it's believed, he first became acquainted with the eye catching French Impressionism. He brought much of what he had learned to America, where he would become one of the most prolific practitioners of American Impressionism.H. Barbara Weinberg, Alice Pratt Brown Curator of American Paintings and Sculpture at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, has done a superb job of selecting the 374 illustrations included in this luxe volume as well as penning engaging and informative accompanying texts.\\"Childe Hassam: American Impressionist\\" will be treasured by not only art aficionados but by Americans as well as they come to realize the enormous contribution Hassam made to bolstering pride in our country.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Childe Hassam, American Impressionist (Metropolitan Museum of Art Series)","review":"This book is an excellent read and provides ample pictures for immense enjoyment.

His intense research of newspaper accounts, letters, journals and papers of prominent loyalists of the period, has resulted in a work which is considered today a classic. The files of the Loyalist newspaper &quot;Rivington's Gazette&quot; proved to be invaluable regarding the plight and activities of the Loyalists. Van Tyne looks at the origin and evolution of the Loyalists movement, anti-loyalist legislation by the revolutionary government, and treatment of Loyalists including confiscation of property and restriction of civil liberties. He also addresses the British governbment's attitude and policies toward the Loyalists, their support and compensation during the war along with the British army involvement in the raising, support and joint operations with Loyalists units in the Colonies. Three appendices address Loyalists declarations, test laws by different states to restrict activities and principle laws enacted against Loyalists by each state.

It describes their politics, their life as soldiers and their relations with the British.It is shameful how books lump the Loyalists in with the British, when they are clearly just Americans fighting for their beliefs and their country, as they saw it at the time. Considering their numbers, the loyalists should never be forgotten.I especially liked the reprinting of the Loyalist version of the Declaration of Independence (from Congress). It truly does show that history is not what you are taught in school. A+"},{"Title":"The Loyalists of the American Revolution","review":"This book helped me to understand why some people chose the understandably hard road against the massive movement for rebellion and war. The lives of many of the sincere Loyalists were not easy as they had to flee the land upon which they had settled for 2 or 3 generations. Since I have many who chose that route during the American Revolution, this book helped me to find sympathy with their views even if I do not agree with them."},{"Title":"The Loyalists of the American Revolution","review":"This is a page-turner. After reading this book (and I know I'm going to draw fire on this one), it's clear to me that the American Democrats are the political descendants of the Revolutionary War Patriots, and the Republicans of the Tories/Loyalists. I'll tell you why below.This book is about those Americans before and during the Revolutionary War who did not want to divorce themselves from the King of England. These were of course mostly the rich and powerful - those who had most to lose by a change in the status quo.What happened to them is the gripping tale that is the focus of this book. The author paints in vivid and minute details as he tells the stories of countless colonial Americans who refused to become \\"patriots\\": where they went to keep safe, how they were punished if caught, what happened to them after the war, how obsequious they were to the British in charge - and how these British despised them as much as they did any other American.One very interesting point made: the masses turned neither Patriot nor Loyalist. Reminds me of Americans to this day, most of whom are neither Republican nor Democrat - or at least not strongly enough to take action one way or the other. Like their Loyalist fathers before them, rich and powerful Americans today flock to the Republican Party. They hate change. Why shouldn't they? One sometimes suspects that many would gladly chuck democracy, if that's what it would take to keep their power."},{"Title":"Birding Texas","review":"Birding Texas offers two additional pieces of information not usually available: (1) illustrations of Texas's 32 speciality birds, those not normally found in any other state, and each illustration includes info on where the species can best be found; (2) a distribution/ status checklist for all 10 regions throughout the state; first time ever and extremely helpful. This book is extremely useful for birders, both beginners and experienced alike, for finding all the birds, from northern cardinals to golden-cheeked warblers and lucifer hummingbirds, throughout the year."},{"Title":"Birding Texas","review":"This book includes many of the out of the way places to bird, along with many local birding spots, that are not listed in past birding guides."},{"Title":"Birding Texas","review":"I tested Birding Texas under field conditions last spring.

If Wulfila had not translated the very Bible into Gothic, we wouldn't have today any tangible hint of the existence of this early Germanic language.Wright gave us a very good grammar. Yet, Moss&eacute;'s &quot;Manuel de la Langue gotique&quot; - which is originally in French and (I hope) has certainly been translated in English - may be a better.But anyway: you want to learn Gothic ? This grammar is clear, handy, and certainly a reference."},{"Title":"Grammar of the Gothic Language: With the Gospel of St. Mark, Selections from the Other Gospels and the Second Epistle to Timothy","review":"It is fascinating to consider that fact that Gothic, the oldest recorded Germanic language, has come down to us principally as a translation of the New Testament. That the language of this warlike people is preserved in the scripture of the nominally peaceful Christian religion is thought to be due to the effort of Ulfilas (the source of my pseudonym) the first Bishop of the Goths. It is thought that at least one expression coined in this translation has made its way into the English translation of the Bible--that of the term \\"Almighty\\" to describe God.I should also note that the Gothic language is not too difficult to learn if you are already somewhat familiar with old English or Old Norse.My copy of this book, \\"Wright's Grammar of the Gothic Language,\\" first published in 1910, is the Second Edition with a Supplement to the Grammar by O. L. Sayce (1954). Mine would seem to be the 1981 Paperback edition by Oxford University Press. I assume that this book is the same edition, although I am not completely sure of this!I also see that not all pages of the Gothic Gospels have a Greek page facing them. Chapters 6 of Matthew has a Greek page facing each Gothic page, but Chapters 8 and 9 are only Gothic. Chapters 1-5 of Mark have a Greek page facing each Gothic page. But Chapters 6-16 of Mark are only Gothic with no Greek pages. Of the scattered Chapters of Luke, 2, 4, and 14 are only in Gothic, but Chapter 15 is both Greek and Gothic. John consists of Chapters 12, 14, 15, and 17, but only in Gothic. There are also Chapters 1-4 of the Second Epistle to Timothy that are only in Gothic. I should also say that I note all of the Chapters are complete."},{"Title":"National Audubon Society Field Guide to African Wildlife","review":"This field guide is exactly what we need for an upcoming trip to Kenya and Tanzania to see the wildlife.

Indeed, following my first trip to Tanzania, I purchased a copy. Prior to my second trip, however, someone suggested that I take a look, instead, at Withers' Wildlife of East Africa and I was immediately sold on it.There are various reasons why I think Withers is the better choice for those going on their first safari in East Africa. Most importantly, it's a lot smaller/lighter and the descriptions are opposite the bird and animal photographs, rather than at the back of the Audubon Guide. In addition, the coverage of wildlife is excellent: we saw a lot of different animals and birds and, with very few exceptions, they were all covered in Wild Life of East Africa.A friend is off on safari this summer and asked me about what to take. They had heard of The Audubon Field Guide, but not Withers et al. It's that conversation that prompted me to write this."},{"Title":"National Audubon Society Field Guide to African Wildlife","review":"This is a great reference guide to African wildlife. It could be used on safari to identify some animals or acquire additional information about already well know animals. It can also be used at home to read about the animal behavior, habitats and national parks of Africa. The book has wonderful collection of photographs useful for identification of many species. It also lists national parks and other sanctuaries by country. There are photographs of different wildlife habitats and a chapter explaining the geography of African continent. This is a very useful book, which could be used in many different ways to enjoy or gather information about the wildlife of the African continent. I recommend this guide to anybody interested in the natural history of Africa."},{"Title":"National Audubon Society Field Guide to African Wildlife","review":"It is relatively compact. It has a sturdy vinyl cover. It has beautiful, vibrant pictures of the animals. It has easy to find, to the point descriptions of each species' habitat, mating/birthing, typical prey or food, etc, which is what you want when you're on a bumpy game drive. I bought this, The African Safari Companion and the Safari Journal and this was the only book I actually used on safari in E. Africa.

Excellent photos, educational descriptions and, a bonus since it was not why I bought the book, a large section on birds. Not by nature or hobby a birder, I became one, thanks not only to this book but with the solid support of David,our safari guide, who knows he must find the \\"Big Five\\" for his clients - we were not, by the way, counting - and so was delighted also to find interest among us in a passion of his: birds. Compact, readable, it went everywhere with us."},{"Title":"National Audubon Society Field Guide to African Wildlife","review":"I took this on a 2 week safari in Tanzania and was so glad I did. The images are excellent and the information helped clear up a number of debates regarding which type of snake or antelope we were looking at.

For covering such an extraordinary diversity of wildlife, this book is remarkably compact and portable too.

This guide is so wonderful (especially the photos) that on two of these trips, our guides (in Rwanda and Namibia) have been so fascinated with it that we have given it to them at the end of our safari. This will be the third copy of the book I have bought!"},{"Title":"National Audubon Society Field Guide to African Wildlife","review":"I ordered this book thinking it was a guide to African Mammals. In fact, it attempts to cover mammals, birds, and reptiles - for the whole continent! To any serious wildlife observer, the very notion of a field guide covering at best 11% of the species in the area is ludicrous. Condensing 1,100 mammalian species to under 200 is least egregious (most of us are not looking for mice and shrews). But covering fewer than 300 of 2,300 avian species and about 24 of the 1,300 reptilian species renders these sections absolutely useless to anyone who is serious about identification. All but beginner birders and herpers also have long condemned the Audubon format - 4 to 6 photos per pair of facing pages, with each photo depicting a single animal. This format prevents grouping of similar species, showing all the relevant field marks (esp. in flight), and showing different plumages (races, male/female, summer/winter, etc). Also, vagaries of lighting and photographic technique make it hard to truly compare species. A serious wildlife observer expects to pack multiple references to a region when traveling. If you are a very, and I repeat very, casual/beginner wildlife observer and want Everything in Africa in one teeny-weeny book, you'll probably be happy with this - if only b/c you don't know what's been left out. But I think even beginners would still be better off with a regional or country-specific guide for each class (mammals, birds, reptiles) that is more comprehensive."},{"Title":"National Audubon Society Field Guide to African Wildlife","review":"We received the Field Guide the day before we departed for a photo safari to Tanzania and Kenya. It proved to be an invaluable quick reference guide to wildlife we saw during the day, as well as an encyclopedic work on each species, including countries where they're found, coloration, mating habits, foods, and myriad other details. You can take a cursury view of an animal or a deep dive into each one. I recommend spending a little time learning the cross-referencing system to get the most out of the book.

The mammal and bird sections are the strongest and most complete. There is also sufficent information on crocodiles, and very little on insects.It's a great book to take on safari because it contains all the essential information that you would want: good descriptions of the most important animals, descriptions of major ecosystems, and descriptions of each african nation and what wildlife is available in each.

I agree that the descriptions are too brief for a serious wildlife person, but it suited our purpose. I liked that all the pictures are in the middle so you can thumb through all the pictures and then look up the details later.

Even when your luggage weight is severely restricted (as when you use small airplanes), this doesn't get left behind!!

This gives countries, habitats, and many pictures plus essays about the wildlife in question plus a map including its range. Outstanding! If you buy nothing else, buy this.

I much appreciated the discussion it provided of the various habitats--the savanna, the Great Rift Valley, Ngorongoro, the Sahara, the Kalahari, and the myriad of other habitats that cover this sprawling continent.One of the most valuable parts of this book is the extensive selection of color plates on several hundred species living in Africa.

If I were doing it over again, I'd still get both books, but if you're short on space, I'd only get Wildlife of East Africa and skip the Field Guide. The Pocket Guide to Mammals was largely redudant of both of the other books and if I were doing it over again I'd skip that book.I was a little disappointed in the layout of the book. I have the Audobon Society guide to birds of North America and I expected a similar format with pictures on each page. This book has about 100 pages of pictures in the middle of the book, but the remaining 600-700 pages are just printed words without pictures in very small font and very think paper.

The story takes Garrett from his Southern childhood, to his days as a buffalo hunter on the Texas frontier, thru his tenure as a federal lawman and Sheriff of Lincoln County, New Mexico. Metz addresses the mysterious death of Garrett . It was in that position that he became embroiled in the infamous Lincoln County War. The book also provides in-depth coverage of Henry McCarty - alias Billy the Kid. Thoroughly researched and entertainingly written, Metz's story of Pat Garrett will stand as the standard resource work on this noteworthy Old West character. James P. O'Connor - Nov. \`9"},{"Title":"Pat Garrett: The Story of a Western Lawman","review":"The story of a Western Lawman is well written and researched. Pat Garrett as most know was made famous mostly for his pursuit and shooting of Billy The Kid. Billy and Pat crossed paths many times before that fateful day though. Sometimes working side by side and other times after the Santa Fe Gang hired Pat to track down Billy with the notion that it \\"takes one to catch one\\", and a little of money on Billy's head, puts the two equally efficient cowboys on opposite sides. Pat and the Texas Cattleman's Association team up on the first search for Billy, with Cowboys from the LX, LIT and other ranches that Billy relieved of cattle in the hazzardous trip on a Christmas day in the snow. Lies were told, men were shot and in the end Billy crosses a second time the path of his would be shooter, Pat Garrett. Later in life though Pat gets a death sentence by some of the greedy men who hired him in the first place. Only to end up dead in the desert in the company of supposed to be business relationships, and a bullet in his back. Pat never did really live up to the famous life that followed the killing of Billy the Kid. People romantic by nature, made Billy a Robin Hood of the West. Songs have been composed, movies made and books written. Billy probably didn't do anything more than the man-hunters that chased him."},{"Title":"Pat Garrett: The Story of a Western Lawman","review":"Pat Garrett was a good man hunter. He had a good start long before he quit buffalo hunting. He had gained the reputation of man hunter long ago.

I believe that any serious angler would pay extra for this as it is an invaluable resouce."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"I used to live on the Gulf Coast, and I still go down to fish whenever possible. I looked quite a while for a good identification guide and was extremely pleased to finally find this book. It has everything you need, from clear illustrations (kudos to artist Kevin Brant on an outstanding job) to well-organized, complete information. You get expert knowledge on common sizes, common names, food value, and game qualities. In addition, the book provides range and habitat information for the fish and explains the best ways to go after them. Thanks to Vic Dunaway and Florida Sportsman for this long-needed reference that no fisherman should be without."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"The content of this book is outstanding. Everything you need to know about identifying what you have pulled up. The problem is the binding. It is not assembled well. The book started to fall apart almost right away. Forget putting it in your tacklebox. The pages will blow away. Too bad, because it really is a very very informative book."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"This book is an awesome guide for those who fish these waters. I just got back from a week of fishing in the Bahamas and the book was invaluable. My partner and I were able to make quick assessments on the food quality of the variety of fish we caught. We threw back the ones that were dangerous or bad for a meal. The upshot is we fed a lot of happy folks while avoiding the perils of ciguatera. Can not recommend this book enough....wish there was one just like it for California."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"Don't know what the problem is others are having with their editions, mine's held up just fine. Of course, I leave mine on board when I dive in to spearfish, and I tend to avoid submerging it when I stay on to drop a line in the water, but even when some water has hit it, it's stayed fine. No problem. That's going on quite some time too.That said, this is an outstanding resource. You simply cannot do wrong by getting ANY book Vic has done. I have grown up with his books, and still have his Pacific, Gulf, Fresh Water and Bait, Rigs and Tackle books in my library. They are absolutely invaluable and provide the best source of downright no-nonsense information I've ever found, this side of my father and grandfather.Do yourselves a favor and get this without hesitation. It gets no better than these."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"If you have anyone in your life you are thinking of getting interested in Florida fishing ... don't be without this book. My fiance is new to fishing and it gives her a great sense of belonging and pride to be able to identify different species of fish as she pulls them in.No more.. oh what did I catch now? .. now its' &quot; look I just caught a blue runner&quot; or &quot;look another sand perch&quot;. We are estatic about Sport Fish of Florida. Also, kudos to &quot;Baits, Rigs &amp; Tackle&quot; and &quot;2000 Fishing Planner&quot;."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"Color ID, food value, habitat &amp; range etc. this book has it all.The book was written in a humorous style. I would recommend this book to any fisherman."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"This book is truly the only one of its kind for identifying sports fish in Florida waters, and provides great information. The one problem I had with the book was the same as everyone else, which is the poor quality of the binding and construction of the book. Otherwise, I recommend it to every Florida fisherman."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"This book is both informative and entertaining. I could not put it down. The color illustrations and the expert analysis make this book very interesting reading for any angler. Sport Fish of Florida is a great book."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"I keep it in a back pack in a ziplock bag with fishing gear on ever trip. picture and info was great too."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"I have owned this book for a decade or so and it is incredible. If you fish in Florida or just have an interest in fish, this is a tremendous resource. Dunaway seems to have an intimate and inexhaustible knowledge of every species of Florida fish and how to catch them, where to catch them, when to catch them, etc. I cannot imagine a more helpful comprehensive guide than this one. The information is presented in a very organized and succinct way, making it easy to find exactly what info you need. Each fish gets a description if its physical attributes, size range, habitat range and habits, food value, game qualities, and catching methods. I bought this when I first got into kayak fishing in FL and it opened a lot of doors for my fishing pursuits. The illustrations are also tremendous and serve as a great reference guide for identifying your catch.I have literally poured over this book for the last 10 years because of the wealth of information it contains and can't imagine fishing in FL without it. Some have complained about its construction by the way, but it makes no claim to being waterproof. Mine has been read countless times for over a decade and is holding up just fine. Short of hiring a professional guide to show you the ropes, this is the best fishing investment you can make for FL fishing."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"I used to live in the Keys and worked as a park ranger at one of the state parks there. I fished nearly every day from the Channel 5 Bridge and snorkeled throughout the northern Keys and did a lot of research as to which field guide would help me the most. I found this one to be the most helpful.1. Easy-to-understand drawings (drawing are often best in guide books rather than photos of individual specimens)2. Food value (often entertaining)3. Range information lets people know at what time of year the fish will be running in one area4. Size information and official records5. Best method of angling6. Book is tough enough to be stuffed in and out of a bag, put up with bloodstains, and doesn't fall apart when it gets splashedFor fish specific to Florida and the Keys this is a must-have book. Would be great to keep on your boat or carry with your tackle. I ended up writing in it where I had caught each fish and when; now when I look back at it I can remember where I was and what the fight to land the fish was like.Invaluable if you like to fish or if you like fish!"},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"A wonderful book to have for the Florida fisherman. The pictures of each species are wonderful, as well as the write up for each fish. I could see any florida fisherman being happy after receiving this book since one catches such unique varieties in Florida."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"This book is ideal for anyone planning on fishing in South FL. even if you've been fishing your entire life or just picked up a rod...the information is easy to understand and very useful."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"Good, well organized information. I wish all authors of fishing books were as competant as Vic Dunaway."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"Nice for most fish in Florida but not all....Saltwater and freshwater species listed."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"This book is a must to have with you when you are fishing in the Florida Keys. We check off each different kind of fish we catch. Lots of fun."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"Great pictures and knowledge. Just dont know where to start, have to go through the whole book."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"My husband really enjoys this reference book. Has all the info a fisherman will ever need for this area."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"The product was in great shape, just as promised, and showed up right on time. I would definitely buy from them again."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"Answers to almost any questions about any fish caught in and around Florida. From baitfish to billfish with freshwater too, this is a book that is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"A must for every tackle box and boat in and around Florida waters, Excellent pictures and information on each species."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"This is a great and really informative book. I would highly recommend it to any Florida fishermen or women! We loved looking up and reading all the great information and really loved that in included the food value of the fish. The one and only reason it doesn't get the 5 stars for me is because as I read earlier in a review and from my own experience, this book can NOT get wet!! Mine I only had it 3 weeks and now it's unusable! It turned into a thick chuck of welded together mass of paper. So after spending nearly $20 for mine, I have nothing. But I thoroughly enjoyed reading the wealth of information it contained! And I plan to get another, but DON'T leave it in the tackle box!! Or exposed to humidity!"},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"I really like the way the book is organized and the information presented. As a fillet and release angler who loves to eat good seafood I appreciate the edibility ratings. Suggested baits, methods and locations are really helpful too!"},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"Almost 250 pages of very informative material. Dunaway covers both salt water and fresh water South Florida fishing and further classifies the &#34;families&#34; of the fish ie Bass, Snook, Porgies etc. The illustrations are all in color and covers both &#34;Gamefish&#34; (the good-eatin' ones) and the &#34;Sportfish&#34; (the good-fightin' ones). If you are an Angler that likes to toss a line in the water, here in South Florida, this is a very handy and informative volume."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"The book is about what I expected. Bought it for my dad and he really liked it, so I'm happy with it."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"Up to date reference on the current most popular sport fish in Florida. The popular and available species have changed over the years. It's sad that some of the old time favorites are kind of out of the picture now, but this book helps you know which ones are in the picture if you are taking up or retaking up the sport now."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"I also bought this book for my husband. He carves fish out of wood and the photos in this book are true to life & help with his carvings."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"I'm somewhat new to saltwater fishing. I just bought an offshore boat and will be fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. This book has great information on all species of fish in and around Florida. It gives a picture and desription of each fish, it's food value (which I find most helpfu), what region of Florida you will see the fish, what is used mostly to catch the fish, etc. I will have this book with me (in a zip lock bag) on the boat with me each time I go out."},{"Title":"Sport Fish of Florida","review":"I bought this book for myself last year while on a fishing trip near Panama City Beach, Florida. Very good information and excellent pictures. My 14 year old grandson is an avid fisherman and I decided to get the book for him. It was a Christmas present. He loves it."},{"Title":"The Pizza Gourmet: Simple Recipes for Spectacular Pizza","review":"I am looking to expand the basic menu items at our restaurant and found this book to be very very helpful. I reviewed quite a few other books at the library and none really had what I was looking for. This book has proven to be easy to use whether you're cooking for yourself, a family of five, or up to as many as 400 people a day. It offers a variety of ways to serve the same dish, yet appear different, while still being able to give it your own personal touch, whether you are trying to work with a picky eater child or that impossible to please customer. Bon Appetite!"},{"Title":"The Pizza Gourmet: Simple Recipes for Spectacular Pizza","review":"Many interesting, unique and tasty combinations throughout the book. It is definitely not for those who feel pizza MUST have tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and pepperoni.The recipes I've used, I return to again and again. Many have also been a jumping off point for my own creations/experimentations. Several different crust recipes, good basic starter sauce recipes and pizza that run the gamut from simple to sublime.If I could take only 5 cookbooks with me as the house was in flames, this would definitely be one of the 5."},{"Title":"The Pizza Gourmet: Simple Recipes for Spectacular Pizza","review":"An excellent book for family pizza night or when you are having company and want to be a little more creative. Easy to follow directions making preparation uncomplicated. Pizza crust recipes are simple for beginners like myself. I like simplicity with excellent, tasty results! Delicious ideas with room for your creative self too. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Pizza Gourmet: Simple Recipes for Spectacular Pizza","review":"Fantastic book, gives many variations and recipes that are easy to make! The kids love this book! It's the second one I've had because somebody \\"borrowed\\" the first one!"},{"Title":"The Pizza Gourmet: Simple Recipes for Spectacular Pizza","review":"Although it arrived later than I expected the book is fine. It was a gift for someone so I didnt really read it but it looks good."},{"Title":"The Pizza Gourmet: Simple Recipes for Spectacular Pizza","review":"Lots of different recipes which look like fun to try, book was used and in excellent condition, like new. While there were no colored pictures for the price it was a very good recipe book."},{"Title":"The Pizza Gourmet: Simple Recipes for Spectacular Pizza","review":"I have owned this cookbook for over ten years now and use it often. It has the most amazing recipes for pizza. At the beginning of the book are recipes for different types of dough, followed by various sauces. The actual pizza recipes are divided roughly by geographic region. The variety is fantastic. Recipes use beef, chicken, pork, seafood, tofu, beans, or just vegetables. Fresh herbs are often included in the ingredients, as well as a wide variety of cheeses. The author includes a glossary of ingredients in case you come across one that you are unfamiliar with. If you are looking for an unusual and impressive pizza recipe, then you will find it in this cookbook. I highly recommend it."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},A={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],J={key:0},W={key:1};function B(n,o,s,c,r,i){const u=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",A,[(e(!0),t(g,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(e(),w(u,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",W,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",J,"See more"))],8,H)):y("",!0)])}const q=d(F,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-2bb735b1"]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/7.md","filePath":"library/7.md"}'),C={name:"library/7.md"},L=Object.assign(C,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(q)]))}});export{N as __pageData,L as default};
