Irwin Shaw was a star of the New Yorker s fiction pages in the 1930s and  40s. His prose helped shape the landscape of post-war fiction, and his work drew from a remarkable life that spanned from American football fields to European battlefields, Broadway to Hollywood, Depression-era saloons to the McCarthy hearings. Among these sixty-three stories are iconic works such as  The Eighty-Yard Run,  a tale of an American dream crippled on Black Monday, and  Main Currents in American Thought,  in which a hack radio copywriter is tormented by the glitz of show business. Through the decades, Shaw s writing  as demonstrated in these pages maintains the clear-eyed moral purpose, rich in wit and startling insight, of a tough kid with a philosopher s soul.

Passed down from father to son, this gift offers the ability to look into the future or back into historyfor some it is considered a blessing, for others a curse. No matter the outcome, each generation records its astonishing, vivid, and revelatory visions into a battered journal that becomes known as The Book of Fathers. For three hundred years the Csillag family line meanders unbroken across Hungary's rivers and vineyards, through a land overrun by wolves and bandits, scarred by plague and massacre, and brutalized by despots. Impetuous, tenderhearted, and shrewd, the Csillags give birth to scholars and gamblers, artists and entrepreneurs.

An  outstanding new intellectual biography of John Maynard Keynes [that moves] swiftly along currents of lucidity and wit  (The New York Times), illuminating the world of the influential economist and his transformative ideas  A timely, lucid and compelling portrait of a man whose enduring relevance is always heightened when crisis strikes.  The Wall Street Journal WINNER: The Arthur Ross Book Award Gold Medal ? The Hillman Prize for Book Journalism FINALIST: The National Book Critics Circle Award ? The Sabew Best in Business Book Award NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY PUBLISHERS WEEKLY AND ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY Jennifer Szalai, The New York Times ? The Economist ? Bloomberg ? Mother Jones At the dawn of World War I, a young academic named John Maynard Keynes hastily folded his long legs into the sidecar of his brother-in-law s motorcycle for an odd, frantic journey that would change the course of history. Swept away from his placid home at Cambridge University by the currents of the conflict, Keynes found himself thrust into the halls of European treasuries to arrange emergency loans and packed off to America to negotiate the terms of economic combat. The terror and anxiety unleashed by the war would transform him from a comfortable obscurity into the most influential and controversial intellectual of his day a man whose ideas still retain the power to shock in our own time. Keynes was not only an economist but the preeminent anti-authoritarian thinker of the twentieth century, one who devoted his life to the belief that art and ideas could conquer war and deprivation. As a moral philosopher, political theorist, and statesman, Keynes led an extraordinary life that took him from intimate turn-of-the-century parties in London s riotous Bloomsbury art scene to the fevered negotiations in Paris that shaped the Treaty of Versailles, from stock market crashes on two continents to diplomatic breakthroughs in the mountains of New Hampshire to wartime ballet openings at London s extravagant Covent Garden. Along the way, Keynes reinvented Enlightenment liberalism to meet the harrowing crises of the twentieth century. In the United States, his ideas became the foundation of a burgeoning economics profession, but they also became a flash point in the broader political struggle of the Cold War, as Keynesian acolytes faced off against conservatives in an intellectual battle for the future of the country and the world. Though many Keynesian ideas survived the struggle, much of the project to which he devoted his life was lost. In this riveting biography, veteran journalist Zachary D. Carter unearths the lost legacy of one of history s most fascinating minds. The Price of Peace revives a forgotten set of ideas about democracy, money, and the good life with transformative implications for today s debates over inequality and the power politics that shape the global order.

With the end of World War I, an array of dizzying inventions and trends pushed American society from the Victorian era into modernity. The New Era provides a history of American thought and culture in the 1920s through the eyes of American intellectuals determined to move beyond an older role as gatekeepers of cultural respectability and become tribunes of openness, experimentation, and tolerance instead. Recognizing the gap between themselves and the mainstream public, younger critics alternated between expressions of disgust at American conformity and optimistic pronouncements of cultural reconstruction. The book tracks the emergence of a new generation of intellectuals who made culture the essential terrain of social and political action and who framed a new set of arguments and debates over women s roles, sex, mass culture, the national character, ethnic identity, race, democracy, religion, and values that would define American public life for fifty years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EQ8WUWZUvagC&dq=A+New+Era&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Actual Adventures of Michael Missing: Stories","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Monet or the Triumph of Impressionalism (Midi Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l_dwHQAACAAJ&dq=Monet+or+the+Triumph+of+Impressionalism+(Midi+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Basic Gourmet Entertains: Foolproof Recipes and Manageable Menus for the Beginning Cook","description":"Includes recipes, complete menus, decorating ideas, dinner party themes, and suggestions for making guests feel at home","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EJSSPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Basic+Gourmet+Entertains:+Foolproof+Recipes+and+Manageable+Menus+for+the+Beginning+Cook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE WORLDS OF CLIFFORD SIMAK.","description":"Twelve short stories reprinted from science fiction magazines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DpqRAAAAIAAJ&dq=THE+WORLDS+OF+CLIFFORD+SIMAK.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mission Earth Pb Vol 10","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How Home Theater and HDTV Work","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bill Nye the Science Guy's Great Big Book of Tiny Germs","description":"Provides readers with an informative look at germs, the various types, and the different purposes they serve (both good and bad) and includes eleven easy-to-follow experiments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nl_5nQEACAAJ&dq=Bill+Nye+the+Science+Guy%27s+Great+Big+Book+of+Tiny+Germs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Teacher's Secret Life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat (Combat Aircraft)","description":"So formidable an opponent did the Iraqi airforce consider the F-14 that during the Iran-Iraq war, they ordered their pilots not to engage F-14s and the presence of one in an area was usually enough to empty it of Iraqi aircraft.

Kroto, FRS Although the discovery of C60 is now almost 15 years old and the extraction occurred 60 nearly ten years ago it is amazing that the range of spin-off research still seems to expand without limits. The birth of the Fullerenes has spawned fascinating research programmes in almost every area of chemistry and physics and this monograph explores a particularly interesting and important area - the behaviour of these pure carbon cages in the presence of high-energy radiation. The C molecules must also be in the space 60 between the stars (albeit in quantities too small to detect at this time) as the conditions in the atmospheres of some carbon stars appear to be almost identical to the plasmas generated in the Kratschmer-Huffman system for making C60. The conditions in space 60 are very varied as it is pervaded by a plethora of high-energy particles (photons, cosmic rays, etc.) and the chapters in this book discuss, among other things, the response of C60 and various derivatives to probing by a range of high-energy particles. Various fullerenes and fullerene salts have been examined by positron annihilation techniques, revealing details of their electronic and structural properties as well as phase transition behaviour. Muons have been implanted to enable mSR techniques to probe with high sensitivity the endohedral electronic structures of fullerenes including those in superconducting systems. Mossbauer spectroscopy can give valuable information about the interactions in certain types of organometallic complexes and in particular it can reveal the degree of charge transfer in endohedral species. Nuclear irradiation/radiochemical analytical techniques have been applied resulting in information ranging widely from the stability of the fullerene cage containing endohedral metal atoms in various oxidation states to pharmaceutical studies of the distribution of fullerenes in the internal organs of animals. Time resolved pulsed radio lysis provides information at high sensitivity enabling micromolar concentrations to be probed e.g. C60 in water in which it is almost insoluble! Redox and rate constant measurements have given useful information on photolytically generated radical ion pairs involving a variety of fullerenes. Interesting accounts of observations involving the production of rare gas endohedral species by nuclear recoil have revealed information about the recoil mechanism. From the first moment of its discovery the unique cage structure of C60 initiated thoughts about the interesting possibility of encapsulation of atoms and molecules. One possibility that immediately suggested itself was the isolation of chemically toxic radionuclides by encapsulation in the (supposedly chemically innocuous) cage for pharmaceutical purposes. The possibility of creating cages carrying a radioactive atom inside the cage and moieties outside with molecular recognition capabilities is a most exciting prospect and discussion is included of some important first steps aimed at achieving this fascinating breakthrough. Another problem dealt with in this monograph is the effect of elemental impurities which has, as our studies progress, become more and more a matter of concern and interest. Impurities can have important effects on the observed physical and chemical behaviour of fullerenes, especially when very sensitive probe techniques are applied. This valuable book reviews some detailed studies of fundamental properties of fullerenes, which are leading to a deeper understanding of their behaviour in the presence of high energy radiation. The information obtained already and that which will be garnered in future studies of the kind described here is an absolutely necessary prerequisite for success in applications.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pbf7CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","description":"Argues that despite increasing levels of government action, illicit drugs are more readily available than ever, and analyzes the failure of our drug policy","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DhphQgAACAAJ&dq=Smoke+and+Mirrors:+The+War+on+Drugs+and+the+Politics+of+Failure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Catholics, Politics, and Public Policy: Beyond Left and Right","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Southeast Asian Urbanism: The Meaning and Power of Social Space","description":"This book is based on the results of over two decades of field research on cities and towns of Thailand, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.

Although modern thought has evolved since that era, the significance of the harvest has hardly been lost. From the New Yam Festival in Africa to the Jewish Sukkot to Thanksgiving Day in the United States, the majority of cultures throughout the world have set aside days to celebrate times of bounty. Thanksgiving and Other Harvest Festivals looks at how the regions of Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, and North America pay homage to the harvest and everything it represents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3Xde_E7-r50C&dq=Harvest+Festivals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unwilling Germans?: The Goldhagen Debate","description":"Few works of the past 50 years have stirred the German public as Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's HITLER'S WILLING EXECUTIONERS, which argues that Germans allowed the Holocaust not because they were forced to but out of conviction that killing Jews was morally just.

Hate never felt so good. I first met Tristan Miles at a meeting where he was trying to take over my late husband's company. He was powerful, arrogant, and infuriatingly gorgeous, and I hated him with every cell in my body. In the shock of the century, he called me three days later and asked me on a date. I would rather die than date a man like him--though I do have to admit it was good for the ego. Turning him down was the highlight of my year.

The consciousness of being the linguistic and cultural descendants of the Classical Greeks, and of inhabiting the same space in which the ancients had lived and dreamed, was real enough in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Greece, even though it was confined to a small intellectual elite. But it was during the decades leading up to the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821 that, under the influence of neo-classical and Romantic movements in the West, it became de rigueur for the Greeks to discover and take pride in the ancient history, culture and mythology of the land in which they lived. Since then, Greek poets have constantly used the ancient myths as a warp on which to weave their poetry, whether the mythical heroes and heroines are treated as human archetypes or as pseudo-divine beings to be demythologized and brought down to earth. This volume contains essays by fifteen scholars, some of them long-established critics and translators such as Edmund Keeley, Peter Bien and the late Philip Sherrard, some of them academics in mid-career, and others having recently completed their doctorates. One essay deals with myth in the Cretan Renaissance (sixteenth-seventeenth centuries), while the rest cover the use of ancient myth by nineteenth- and twentieth-century poets. Some essays deal with individual mythical figures such as Odysseus, Orpheus, Prometheus and Aphrodite, while others deal with the problematic issue of the use of myth by Greek women poets. Peter Bien rounds off the discussion by comparing attitudes to the ancient Greeks as embodied in English and modern Greek poetry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tnf2Ac1MlTgC&dq=Modern+Greek+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anniversaries: From the Life of Gesine Cresspahl","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sisters","description":"Raina Telgemeier s #1 New York Times bestselling, Eisner Award-winning companion to Smile!

But at his mansion east of New York City, in West Egg, Long Island, where the party never seems to end, he's often alone in the glittering Jazz Age crowd, watching and waiting, as speculation swirls around him--that he's a bootlegger, that he was a German spy during the war, that he even killed a man.

The daughter of one of New York s most influential families, niece of Theodore Roosevelt, and wife of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt witnessed some of the most remarkable decades in modern history, as America transitioned from the Gilded Age, the Progressive Era, and the Depression to World War II and the Cold War. A champion of the downtrodden, Eleanor drew on her experience and used her role as First Lady to help those in need. Intimately involved in her husband s political life, from the governorship of New York to the White House, Eleanor would eventually become a powerful force of her own, heading women s organizations and youth movements, and battling for consumer rights, civil rights, and improved housing. In the years after FDR s death, this inspiring, controversial, and outspoken leader would become a U.N. Delegate, chairman of the Commission on Human Rights, a newspaper columnist, Democratic party activist, world-traveler, and diplomat devoted to the ideas of liberty and human rights. This single volume biography brings her into focus through her own words, illuminating the vanished world she grew up, her life with her political husband, and the post-war years when she worked to broaden cooperation and understanding at home and abroad.

Although its participants are still in grade school, Pop Warner football is serious business in Miami, where local teams routinely advance to the national championships. Games draw thousands of fans; recruiters vie for nascent talent; drug dealers and rap stars bankroll teams; and the stakes are so high that games sometimes end in gunshots. In America s poorest neighborhood, troubled parents dream of NFL stardom for children who long only for a week in Disney World at the Pop Warner Super Bowl. In 2001, journalist Robert Andrew Powell spent a year following two teams through roller-coaster seasons. The Liberty City Warriors, former national champs, will suffer the team s first-ever losing season. The Palmetto Raiders, undefeated for two straight years, will be rewarded for good play with limo rides and steak dinners. But their flamboyant coach (the  Darth Vader of youth football ) will face defeat in a down-to-the-wire playoff game. We Own This Game is an inside-the-huddle look into a world of innocence and corruption, where every kickoff bares political, social, and racial implications; an unforgettable drama that shows us just what it is to win and to lose in America.

Baseball is the greatest of all American games. No other sport has the tradition, the mythology, the heroes, and the heroics. Yet baseball is also in the midst of an upheaval unprecedented in its glorious history. Many of its traditions have been discarded, much of its mythology has been disproved, and too many of its heroes have entered drug clinics or let greed triumph over team spirit. What makes baseball what it is the good as well as the bad? Who are the game's heroes, and who its villains? What roles do managers play, and umpires and announcers and mascots and the media? What is the game's future? These are the questions that John Feinstein bestselling author and sports journalist extraordinaire examines in Play Ball: The Life and Troubled Times of Major League Baseball. As he did in his classic books on professional tennis (Hard Courts) and college basketball (A Season Inside), Feinstein spent one entire season examining the game from the inside. He had access to general managers, who gave him never-before-revealed information on trades and the maneuverings behind these trades. He looks at managers Tony LaRussa and Jim Leyland to examine strategy and the psychology of success; he puts Tommy Lasorda under the microscope, showing the frustrating decline of a once-great franchise and the pain resulting from the tragic death of Lasorda's son. Feinstein answers questions about escalating salaries, reveals the identities of the real controlling forces in the game, explains why the owners so totally despised commissioner Fay Vincent, and graphically illustrates the financial state of the game as well as the pressures, the politics, and the joys that come with playing, managing, negotiating, and simply surviving a 162-game season. Above all are still the players, and this is what makes Feinstein's book so special. He gives us intimate portraits of such longtime superstars as Cal Ripken, Jr. and George Brett, as well as revealing glimpses some flattering, some not so flattering of such newer stars as Gary Sheffield, Bobby Bonds, and Ken Griffye, Jr. Beyond the obsession with money and salaries, Feinstein knows it's the players who make and break the game. In Play Ball, we hear stories of how they were shaped; see how stardom or lack of stardom further shapes them; we finally understand what it means to be a major league baseball player, in every possible sense.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sDdSzHweL40C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Autodesk Inventor R4 : Conquering the Rubicon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y6y7AQAACAAJ&dq=Autodesk+Inventor+R4+:+Conquering+the+Rubicon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Water Seekers","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Simple Art of Perfect Baking","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Teenage Entrepreneur's Guide: 50 Money-Making Business Ideas","description":"BUSINESS/ECONOMICS","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GVjctAEACAAJ&dq=The+Teenage+Entrepreneur%27s+Guide:+50+Money-Making+Business+Ideas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lives of the Artists: A Selection (Biography)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Reaching Beyond: A Space Thriller","description":"A conspiracy of the greatest proportions, threatening to destroy mankind...

He starts, as do so many spiritual teachers, with simple questions: Who am I? What do I love? How shall I live, knowing I will die? What is my gift to the family of the earth? He then takes us deeper, exploring each question through transformative true stories. We meet men and women--Wayne's neighbors, friends, patients--who have discovered love, courage, and kindness even in the midst of sorrow and loss. And through them we glimpse that relentless spark of spiritual magic that burns within each of us.

Levine pairs with award-winning illustrator Kevin Hawkes to offer a mythical, magical take on the way Jewish families came to give and receive gifts over Hanukkah, just as their Christian neighbors do at Christmas, thanks to a loving spirit named Nate Gadol working behind the scenes together with a certain jolly old soul.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a6n9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Are you fun to live with?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eqvdAAAACAAJ&dq=Are+you+fun+to+live+with%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Palms Throughout the World","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The New Texas Cuisine","description":"A guide to Texas cuisine features more than two hundred recipes for such dishes as Chilled Yellow Pepper Soup, Black-Eyed Pea Crab Salad with Ruby Grapefruit, and Barbecued Duck Tacos with Black Bean Orange Sauce.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=37ZQAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+New+Texas+Cuisine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Queen of Battle","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A pinprick of light: The Troy & Greenfield Railroad and its Hoosac tunnel (Hearthstone book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mNweAQAAIAAJ&dq=A+pinprick+of+light:+The+Troy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CHRISTIAN MYSTICISM","description":"This brief, accessibly written volume introduces key figures, texts, and themes of the mystical tradition and shows how and why the mystics can speak to the church today.

Sarah had been dying of cystic fibrosis since the day she was born. The disease quickly ravaged her lungs and little body bit-by-bit. Fragile and frail, she had only weeks to live, when her mom realized the reality of Sarah s situation: transplant laws, restricting access to lungs based on arbitrary age restrictions, meant Sarah s options were limited. The injustice of her daughter s fate spurred Janet to start a public battle against outdated health care regulations and a battle to save Sarah s life. Janet transformed her pain and desperation into a voice for Sarah and other kids using social media to broadcast the unfairness, which was robbing Sarah of her right to life with the help of friends and family who emerged as Sarah s army.

Affiliated with discontinuity, alarm, and silence, it raises fundamental questions about the constitution of self and other, the stability of location, systems of transfer, and the destination of speech. Profoundly changing our concept of long-distance, it is constantly transmitting effects of real and evocative power. To the extent that it always relates us to the absent other, the telephone, and the massive switchboard attending it, plugs into a hermeneutics of mourning. The Telephone Book, itself organized by a \\"telephonic logic,\\" fields calls from philosophy, history, literature, and psychoanalysis. It installs a switchboard that hooks up diverse types of knowledge while rerouting and jamming the codes of the disciplines in daring ways. Avital Ronell has done nothing less than consider the impact of the telephone on modern thought. Her highly original, multifaceted inquiry into the nature of communication in a technological age will excite everyone who listens in. The book begins by calling close attention to the importance of the telephone in Nazi organization and propaganda, with special regard to the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. In the Third Reich the telephone became a weapon, a means of state surveillance, \\"an open accomplice to lies.\\" Heidegger, in Being and Time and elsewhere, elaborates on the significance of \\"the call.\\" In a tour de force response, Ronell mobilizes the history and terminology of the telephone to explicate his difficult philosophy. Ronell also speaks of the appearance of the telephone in the literary works of Duras, Joyce, Kafka, Rilke, and Strindberg. She examines its role in psychoanalysis Freud said that the unconscious is structured like a telephone, and Jung and R. D. Laing saw it as a powerful new body part. She traces its historical development from Bell's famous first call: \\"Watson, come here!\\" Thomas A. Watson, his assistant, who used to communicate with spirits, was eager to get the telephone to talk, and thus to link technology with phantoms and phantasms. In many ways a meditation on the technologically constituted state, The Telephone Book opens a new field, becoming the first political deconstruction of technology, state terrorism, and schizophrenia. And it offers a fresh reading of the American and European addiction to technology in which the telephone emerges as the crucial figure of this age.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SAfJEptUvMUC&dq=The+Telephone+Book:+AT&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Envy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sisters in Crisis: The Tragic Unraveling of Women's Religious Communities","description":"Ann Carey looks behind the depressing figures to find the causes, and maybe the solutions as well for the drop in vocations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uWJYswEACAAJ&dq=Sisters+in+Crisis:+The+Tragic+Unraveling+of+Women%27s+Religious+Communities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cosmo's Moon","description":"Cosmo loves the moon, and the moon loves Cosmo.

Excerpt: ...drug's safety in humans and to begin determination of appropriate dose levels and routes of administration. In phase II trials researchers gather additional information about the most effective way to administer the drug and about possible adverse effects, and they begin to assess its clinical potential. Phase III clinical trials are controlled field studies with larger numbers of patients to develop reasonable estimates of safety and efficacy. Two approaches have been used by scientists in the United States and abroad to accelerate the development of anti-AIDS drugs without bypassing established testing procedures. The first has been to examine the susceptibility of HTLV-III/LAV to drugs originally developed for other purposes. The benefit of this approach is that researchers can bypass toxicity studies in animal models and some of the early stages of clinical trials because they already know how the drug affects human tissues. The second approach has been to develop rapid screening systems for new chemical agents, followed by carefully monitored laboratory and early clinical studies of any promising candidates. In the United States this process has been characterized by ongoing collaborations involving scientists from the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, numerous academic medical centers, and the pharmaceutical industry. Constant communication between research scientists and the FDA has accelerated this process even further. Drugs Developed for Other Purposes A variety of existing antiviral drugs have been found to inhibit HTLV-III/LAV in the laboratory, but clinical results have been discouraging.

Cancer occurs in multi-celled organisms when cells escape the body's controls and behave like their single-celled ancestors. Such changes, triggered by oxidative damage, result in faulty cell division. Animals and plants have developed ways to stop their cells reverting to primitive forms. Hence, anticancer substances are common throughout nature. Therapies based on these take advantage of metabolic differences between cancer cells and healthy cells, to destroy cancer while helping healthy cells. Clinical trials are needed to test such non-toxic therapies. Biological research suggests that cancer is a treatable condition. Although current data is not sufficient to indicate the degree of life extension achievable, many terminal patients might die of other causes, before the cancer kills them.

Race and the Invisible Hand is an important book that will be widely read and cited.\\" William Julius Wilson, author of The Bridge Over the Racial Divide \\"As acute in its analysis as it is rich in ethnographic detail, Royster's captivating study shows in telling detail how inequalities in the securing of good working class jobs are reproduced in the anything-but-colorblind contemporary United States.\\" David Roediger, author of Colored White: Transcending the Racial Past \\"An unflinching look at the experiences of young blue collar job-seekers on both sides of America's color line. This book powerfully demonstrates the hidden workings of racial discrimination today.\\" Chris Tilly, co- author of Stories Employers Tell: Race, Skill, and Hiring in America \\"Timely and challenging, this book exposes race as the key arbiter of employment outcomes for young black and white men. This beautifully written study is absolutely essential for policy makers, educators and researchers.\\" Mary Romero, author of Maid in the USA \\"An important study. As policymakers keep trying to improve blacks' employment opportunities with new versions of job training programs, Royster shows how irrelevant such efforts are as long as blacks lack access to essential social contacts.\\" James E. Rosenbaum, author of Beyond College for All: Career Paths for the Forgotten Half \\"A powerful and original empirical account that persuasively demonstrates how visible hands invisibly reproduce racial inequality in the blue collar trades. Systematically comparing young black and white men who share the same educational credentials, grades, attendance records, commitment to hard work, motivation and character, Royster convincingly illustrates the process through which white students gain the inside track to jobs. Differential employment outcomes, she demonstrates conclusively, are the result of bad old-fashioned race discrimination in new guises.\\" David Wellman, author of Portraits of White Racism \\"Accessibly written, Race and the Invisible Hand makes visible the powerful role of racially segregated and race-conscious social networks in creating labor market inequality. This important book is theoretically sophisticated and empirically rich--a must read for students and scholars interested in social networks, employment inequality and how race really works in the United States today.\\" Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, author of Gender and Racial Inequality at Work \\"A vitally important contribution to the literature on employment opportunities and race. In a period in which affirmative action is under increasingly bold attack from those who argue that market forces alone should shape employment decisions, this book provides strong empirical support that racially-homogenous acquaintance networks routinely trump the market.

Although some of the book is dated, its conviction that \\"the church's meaning lies in its fulfillment of the sufferings of Christ\\" and that \\"every part of its history is intelligible in terms of the Passion\\" remains perceptive and challenging. Examining Scripture, doctrine, and history, Ramsey paints an intricate portrait of the church as an example of Christ's death and resurrection. He explores Eastern orthodox doctrine; explains the purposes and preconditions of the Reformation; and calls for a renewal of liturgical worship and reconciliation within the communion of the saints. Originally published in 1936 while he was serving as sub-warden of Lincoln Theological College, this was Ramsey's first book. After more than seventy years, its wisdom concerning the relationship between Catholic and Evangelical, and the underlying complementarities and tensions which characterize the Anglican tradition, remains theologically sound and biblically astute.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RACb6TICT4QC&dq=The+Gospel+and+the+Catholic+Church,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spinning Off Bukowski","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8yShngEACAAJ&dq=Spinning+Off+Bukowski&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anna Karenina - translated from the Russian by Constance Garnett","description":"\\"Anna Karenina\\" is the tragic story of Countess Anna Karenina, a married noblewoman and socialite, and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky. The novel explores a diverse range of topics throughout its approximately one thousand pages. Some of these topics include an evaluation of the feudal system that existed in Russia at the time politics, not only in the Russian government but also at the level of the individual characters and families, religion, morality, gender and social class. Leo Tolstoy (18281910) was a Russian writer who is regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time. Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828, he is best known for the novels War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877), often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction. Constance Garnett (18611946) was an English translator of nineteenth-century Russian literature. Garnett was one of the first English translators of Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Anton Chekhov and introduced them on a wide basis to the English-speaking public.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3VBODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Picts & the Martyrs: Or Not Welcome at All","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Language Instinct (Talking Science)","description":"The classic book on the development of human language by the world s leading expert on language and the mind.

Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by \\"an enormous thing,\\" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreams of a Woman (Renewing the Heart)","description":"Bringing insight into the desires of today's women by exploring the lives of women in the Bible whose dreams were shattered, then restored and answered, Jaynes offers a reassuring perspective, reminding readers that God has not forgotten them or their dreams.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YRQKAAAACAAJ&dq=Dreams+of+a+Woman+(Renewing+the+Heart)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Double Date","description":"No girl in her right mind would say no to a date with Bobby Newkirk.

Anthony Gill's controversial book not only explains why Catholic leaders in some countries came to oppose dictatorial rule but, equally important, why many did not. Using historical and statistical evidence from twelve countries, Gill for the first time uncovers the causal connection between religious competition and the rise of progressive Catholicism. In places where evangelical Protestantism and \\"spiritist\\" sects made inroads among poor Catholics, Church leaders championed the rights of the poor and turned against authoritarian regimes to retain parishioners. Where competition was minimal, bishops maintained good relations with military rulers. Applying economic reasoning to an entirely new setting, Rendering unto Caesar offers a new theory of religious competition that dramatically revises our understanding of church-state relations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MCXJnAmnfFAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Large Meteorite Impacts and Planetary Evolution (Special Paper (Geological Society of America))","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Spoken and Written Hindi","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y1kNjwEACAAJ&dq=Spoken+and+Written+Hindi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bird Girl and the Man Who Followed the Sun: An Athabaskan Indian Legend from Alaska","description":"With the publication of Two Old Women, Velma Wallis firmly established herself as one of the most important voices in Native American writing.

As Joseph Califano points out in his searing indictment of America's irresponsible attitude towards drug abuse, by failing to act on this lesson, we have lost untold lives and resources. Califano deftly demonstrates how substance abuse is implicated in poverty, violent crime, soaring health care costs, family dissolution, child abuse, homelessness, teen pregnancy, and AIDS. With alcohol and tobacco interests buying political protection with campaign contributions and helping seed a culture of substance abuse, Califano illustrates the dire need for parental engagement, proposes revolutionary changes in prevention, treatment, and the nation's criminal justice, health care, and social service systems, and sounds an urgent cry to address the plague responsible for the death of more Americans than all our wars, natural catastrophes, and traffic accidents combined.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lt3oCEg_PdYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Eternal Way: The Inner Meaning of the Bhagavad Gita : A New, Comprehensive Commentary in the Light of Kriya Yoga by a Direct Disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda","description":"One of the earliest commentaries on the popular and highly respected yoga scripture known as the Bhagavad Gita.

In Uncas: First of the Mohegans, Michael Leroy Oberg integrates the life story of an important Native American sachem into the broader story of European settlement in America. The arrival of the English in Connecticut in the 1630s upset the established balance among the region's native groups and brought rapid economic and social change. Oberg argues that Uncas's methodical and sustained strategies for adapting to these changes made him the most influential Native American leader in colonial New England.Emerging from the damage wrought by epidemic disease and English violence, Uncas transformed the Mohegans from a small community along the banks of the Thames River in Connecticut into a regional power in southern New England. Uncas learned quickly how to negotiate between cultures in the conflicts that developed as natives and newcomers, Indians and English, maneuvered for access to and control of frontier resources. With English assistance, Uncas survived numerous assaults and plots hatched by his native rivals.Unique among Indian leaders in early America, Uncas maintained his power over large numbers of tributary and other native communities in the region, lived a long life, and died a peaceful death (without converting to Christianity) in his people's traditional homeland. Oberg finds that although the colonists considered Uncas a friend to the English, he was first and foremost an assertive guardian of Mohegan interests.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f3abK1urVK4C&dq=Uncas:+First+of+the+Mohegans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disaster Recovery Planning: Strategies for Protecting Critical Information Assets (2nd Edition)","description":"The Internet Encyclopedia in a 3-volume reference work on the internet as a business tool, IT platform, and communications and commerce medium.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ACfBmYiNaTcC&dq=Disaster+Recovery+Planning:+Strategies+for+Protecting+Critical+Information+Assets+(2nd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Family of Women : Voices Across the Generations","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Best Bible Crafts","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ksZO8aXjSk0C&dq=Best+Bible+Crafts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arizona Canal, north of the Salt River, Phoenix vicinity, Maricopa County, Arizona: Photographs, written historical and descriptive data, reduced copies of drawings (HAER)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zbe07sXfEAEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Silence: The Role of Silence in Determining Authority","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5zfEAAAACAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Silence:+The+Role+of+Silence+in+Determining+Authority&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Running with the Reservoir Pups: Eddie and the Gang with No Name: Book One (Eddie & the Gang with No Name)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ksnfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Running+with+the+Reservoir+Pups:+Eddie+and+the+Gang+with+No+Name:+Book+One+(Eddie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silent Guides of the Divine","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Frenchie Kisses","description":"Lively black-and-white photographs by a leading animal photographer and author of Greyhounds Big and Small reveal the special spirit and appeal of the French bulldog, celebrating the playful disposition, curiosity, and sometimes stubborn personality of these popular little dogs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n2mIQgAACAAJ&dq=Frenchie+Kisses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pocket Idiot's Guide to German Phrases","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Adventures of a Suburban Boy","description":"John Boorman came of age as a filmmaker in the 1960s--the golden age of world cinema. Then as now, his celebrated films embrace the spirit of the era: challenging authority, questioning accepted morality, and examining the thin line between civilization and savagery. In Adventures of a Suburban Boy, Boorman delves deeply into these themes, applying his subversive sensibility to his life story as well as to some of the most important political and cultural events of the twentieth century. The result is a heady fusion of personal memoir and cinematic study, as a child of the London Blitz becomes the influential director known for films such as Point Blank, Excalibur, Hope and Glory, Deliverance, and The General--discussing the cultural role of the motion picture and the art of filmmaking along the way. With a vividly depicted supporting cast that includes Sean Connery, Richard Burton, Burt Reynolds, and Cher, among others, this entertaining and witty tour through the life, times, and works of one of the cinema's great practitioners is not only essential for anyone seeking a fuller understanding of Boorman's incredible body of work, but is also indispensable resource for anyone who is fascinated by film's impact on our lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7IGW-EbHiH4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Irish Cream: A Nuala Anne Mcgrail Novel","description":"Becoming suspicious about facts surrounding a tragic vehicular homicide for which a young man mournfully blames himself, psychic fey Nuala Anne McGrail and her haphazard husband find the case complicated by a modern-day scandal involving the diary of a nineteenth-century priest.

A charming and clever traditional mystery debut set at a bucolic Welsh convent, The Shadow of Death introduces Sister Agatha, a mystery-loving nun who finds herself in the midst of a real-life murder case. The sisters of Gwenafwy Abbey have cherished their contemplative life days spent in prayer, reflection, tending the Convent s vegetable gardens and making their award-winning organic cheese, Heavenly Gouda. Life seems perfect, except for Sister Agatha, a die-hard mystery fan who despairs of ever finding any real life inspiration for her own novel. That is, until the Abbey s sexton is found dead under an avalanche of gouda. Despite the reservations of the local constable, Sister Agatha is convinced it s murder and the game is afoot. Armed only with the notes she s scribbled during her favorite podcast, How to Write a Mystery Novel, as well as a lessons learned from crime heroes ranging from Hercule Poirot to Stephanie Plum, Sister Agatha leads the nuns of Gwenafwy Abbey (and her unwitting sidekick, Father Selwyn) as they begin a race against time to resolve the death of Jacob, save the Abbey, exonerate a beloved postulant, and restore the good name of their cheese.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rfU4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"J.

Fighting under the command of Lady Evadine Courlain, a noblewoman beset by visions of a demonic apocalypse, Alwyn must survive war and the deadly intrigues of the nobility if he hopes to claim his vengeance. But as dark forces, both human and arcane, gather to oppose Evadine's rise, Alwyn faces a choice: can he be a warrior, or will he always be an outlaw? \\"This makes a rich treat for George R.R.

Wages of Violence is a startling account of how the city's atmosphere, dominant public languages, and power structures have changed since the 1960s. The book centers on how Shiv Sena, a militant Hindu movement, has advanced a new, ''plebeian'' political culture and has undermined democratic rule in India's premier city. Drawing on a large body of archival material and conversations with people from all walks of life, Thomas Blom Hansen paints a vivid picture of this dynamic and violent movement. Challenging conventional views of recent trends in Indian politics, Hansen shows that the xenophobic public culture of today's Mumbai has deep roots in the region's history and its contested identities. We are also given revealing insights into the city's Muslim communities and the authorities' understanding and control of the ethno-religious subcultures in the city. Hansen argues cogently that Shiv Sena's success represents the violent possibilities of the ''vernacularization'' of democracy in India. Unfolding at a juncture where the globalization of India's economy is having a deepening impact on the lives of ordinary people, this is a story that resonates with the directions urban growth is taking both elsewhere in India and beyond.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Bf5ZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beating Heart: A Ghost Story","description":"This house is mine and I am its beating heart.

Writing with wit and wisdom, Cameron Stracher describes the grueling rite of passage of an associate at a major New York law firm. As Stracher describes, Harvard Law School may have taught him to think like a lawyer, but it was his experience as an associate that taught him to behave--or misbehave--like one. Double Billing is a biting glimpse into the world of corporate law from the perspective of the low man on the totem pole. In Double Billing, Cameron Stracher reveals a shocking nonfiction account of the ordeal of a young associate at a major Wall Street law firm. Fresh out of Harvard Law School, Stracher landed a coveted position at a high-powered corporate law firm and thus began his grueling years as an associate, a dreaded rite of passage for every young attorney. Only about five percent survive long enough to achieve the Holy Grail of partnership in the firm. As the author vividly describes, law school may teach you how to think like a lawyer, but it's being an associate that teaches you how to behave like one. Or misbehave. Stracher doesn't mince words about the duplicitous behavior and flagrant practices of many lawyers in his firm, which is one of the premier partnerships in America. In a stylish and witty manner that has earned him comparison to an early Philip Roth, Stracher does for the legal profession what Michael Lewis's Liars' Poker did for the financial industry. The result is a tell-all glimpse into the cutthroat world of corporate law from the perspective of the low man on the totem pole.

You cannot surrender your pain and suffering to God if deep in your heart you persist in clinging to psychological defense mechanisms which shield you from that very pain. There is nothing wrong with psychological defenses. In fact, they help to protect us from emotional injury. But if you cling to the defense mechanisms that were created in your childhood and carry them on into adulthood-as most everyone does unconsciously-your quest for spiritual healing will be thwarted by overwhelming resentments and conflicts. Still, God has been trying to show you that there is more to life than resentment and conflict, something so beautiful and desirable that only one thing can resist its pull: hate. So now, and in every moment until you die, you will have a profound choice between your enslavement to old defenses and the beauty of God. That decision has to come from you.

Sooner or later, everyone needs it. You may have a physical ailment that needs to be healed. Or a relationship may fail and your emotions need to be healed. David Cumes, M.D., has spent a lifetime investigating the nature of healing. In The Spirit of Healing, you will join him on his journey of discovery. You learn about the notion of the \\"wounded healer\\" as he shares his stories about his medical training. You'll learn about the nature of trance for the healer and the person to be healed within shamanic cultures. You'll even read how he experimented with powerful herbs along with Shamans in the mountains of Peru, all to become a better healer. This personal experience is mixed with training in a variety of fields. He unites his findings with concepts from the East such as kundalini, prana, and the chakras. He also blends this with the Western mysticism of the Kabalistic Tree of Life. And yes, he does discover the keys to healing. These are the interrelationship between the healer, the patient, the location (certain areas do have healing powers) and the universal force or energy (similar to kundalini) he calls the \\"Field.\\" Cumes picks up on seemingly small ideas that, psychologically, can destroy the healing process. He points out that doctors are now health care providers. He writes, \\"Synonyms given by a thesaurus for the word 'provider,' include: pimp, panderer, runner, agent, hustler, supplier, purveyor, and procurer. This kind of loose and insulting labeling of physicians goes to the very heart of undermining the essence of healing itself. Most of us need the vital healing energy a compassionate healer can give us to help trigger our Inner Healer.\\" This book can be an incredible guide to understanding the healing process. If you are going through such a process now, the information here could help you heal faster. And if you don't need the secrets revealed here now, you will in the future. Prepare for that future by reading this book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=icAMf5yfi70C&dq=The+Spirit+of+Healing:+Venture+Into+the+Wilderness+to+Rediscover+the+Healing+Force&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cheremis Literary Reader With Glossary (Uralic and Altaic)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Stress and the Art of Biofeedback","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ask Me If I Care: Voices from an American High School","description":"High school students share their views on sexuality, AIDS, racial identity, parents, sexual abuse, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, violence, death, self-image, stress, and suicide","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JyJ8QgAACAAJ&dq=Ask+Me+If+I+Care:+Voices+from+an+American+High+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yamaha Pw50 Y-Zinger, Pw80 Y-Zinger & Bw80 Big Wheel 1981-2002 (Clymer Motorcycle Repair)","description":"PW50 (1981-1983; 1985-1987; 1990-2002), PW80 (1983; 1985; 1991-2002), BW80 (1986-1988; 1990)","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ozV8-Aer4N8C&dq=Yamaha+Pw50+Y-Zinger,+Pw80+Y-Zinger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life's Little Secrets & Shortcuts for Dummies","description":"A made-for-children version of the popular gift book series, which offers an important life lesson for each day of the month.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_XJ_zgEACAAJ&dq=Life%27s+Little+Secrets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Lifetime of Peace: Essential Writings by and about Thich Nhat Hanh","description":"A Lifetime of Peace follows the successful model established by A Lifetime of Wisdom: Essential Writings by and about the Dalai Lama.

This little word is so easy to use in daily life, yet it has become the focus of intense theoretical debate. Where does my sense of self come from? Does it arise spontaneously or is it created by the media or society? Do I really know myself? This concern with the self, with our subjectivity, is now our main point of reference in Western societies. How has it come to be so important? What are the different ways in which we can approach subjectivity? Nick Mansfield explores how our understanding of our subjectivity has developed over the past century. He looks at the work of key modern and postmodern theorists, including Freud, Foucault, Nietzsche, Lacan, Kristeva, Deleuze and Guattari, and he shows how subjectivity is central to debates in contemporary culture, including gender, sexuality, ethnicity, postmodernism and technology. I am who? No topic is more crucial to contemporary cultural theory than subjectivity, and Nick Mansfield has written what has long been lacking-a lucid, smart introduction to work in the field. Professor Simon During, University of Melbourne Effortlessly and with humour, passion and panache, Mansfield offers the reader a telling, trenchantly articulate d account of the complex enigma of the self, without resorting to reductively simple critical cliches.This book, in its graceful movements between disciplines, ideas, and areas of interest, deserves to become a benchmark for all such student introductions for some time to come. Julian Wolfreys, University of Florida Nick Mansfield is Senior Lecturer in the Department of Critical and Cultural Studies at Macquarie University. He is co-author of Cultural Studies and the New Humanities (Oxford 1997) and author of Masochism: The art of power (Praeger 1997).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qp3yDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Washington Gladden;: Prophet of the social gospel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8mvZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Washington+Gladden%3B:+Prophet+of+the+social+gospel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Greats","description":"Renowned American writers and historians evoke America at its best--from Thomas Paine's \\"Common Sense\\" to the \\"Gettysburg Address\\", from barbed wire to baseball diamonds--in a compelling, spectacularly designed and illustrated volume. 254 photos, many in color.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NQvCAAAACAAJ&dq=American+Greats&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"the devil's laughter","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Measle and the Wrathmonk","description":"Twelve-year-old orphan Measle Stubbs is shrunk down to half an inch tall and placed in a train set by his evil guardian, the Wrathmonk.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rq7NgseJiBQC&dq=Measle+and+the+Wrathmonk&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moving the mountain: Women working for social change (Women's lives, women's work)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Oral Arguments and Decision Making on the United States Supreme Court (American Constitutionalism)","description":"How oral arguments influence the decisions of Supreme Court justices.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gi-mP7gCfkwC&dq=Oral+Arguments+and+Decision+Making+on+the+United+States+Supreme+Court+(American+Constitutionalism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Custom Rod Thread Art","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KnGlvVhv63gC&dq=Custom+Rod+Thread+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Commodify Your Dissent: Salvos from the Baffler","description":"From the pages of The Baffler, the most vital and perceptive new magazine of the nineties, sharp, satirical broadsides against the Culture Trust. In the \\"old\\" Gilded Age, the barons of business accumulated vast wealth and influence from their railroads, steel mills, and banks. But today it is culture that stands at the heart of the American enterprise, mass entertainment the economic dynamo that brings the public into the consuming fold and consolidates the power of business over the American mind. For a decade The Baffler has been the invigorating voice of dissent against these developments, in the grand tradition of the muckrakers and The American Mercury. This collection gathers the best of its writing to explore such peculiar developments as the birth of the rebel hero as consumer in the pages of Wired and Details; the ever-accelerating race to market youth culture; the rise of new business gurus like Tom Peters and the fad for Hobbesian corporate \\"reengineering\\"; and the encroachment of advertising and commercial enterprise into every last nook and cranny of American life.

Maya Angelou s debut memoir is a modern American classic beloved worldwide. Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local  powhitetrash.  At eight years old and back at her mother s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors ( I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare ) will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned. Poetic and powerful, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read.  I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings liberates the reader into life simply because Maya Angelou confronts her own life with such a moving wonder, such a luminous dignity.

Built in India of teak, she is now beautifully restored at Hartlepool, and can justly claim to be the last of Nelson's frigates. As is the case for many historic ships, however, there is a surprising shortage of informative and well illustrated guides, for reference during a visit or for research by enthusiasts - ship modellers, naval buffs, historians or students. This new series redresses the gap. Written by experts and containing more than 200 specially commissioned photographs, each title takes the reader on a superbly illustrated tour of the ship, from bow to stern and deck by deck. Significant parts of the vessel D for example, the gun decks, her mast, spars and rigging, and her aft accommodation D are given detailed coverage both in words and pictures, so that the reader has at hand the most complete visual record and explanation of the ship that exists. In addition, the importance of the ship, both in her own time and now as a museum vessel, is explained, while her design and build, and her career prior to restoration and exhibition are all described. No other books offer such superb visual impact and detailed information as the Seaforth Historic Ship Series D a truly groundbreaking concept bringing the ships of our past vividly to life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dWhhCgAAQBAJ&dq=Trincomalee&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Earth Angels: Stories of Heavenly Encouragements Through Earthly Vessels","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Practical Stylist, The","description":"Based on the premise that all writing involves arguing a thesis, this classic, authoritative rhetoric presents the essential tools for writing graceful, persuasive essays.

Informed through thousands of conversations over a 20-year period in education, Mary shows the lessons that school management teams can learn from leaders in a wide range of other sectors and points to the conditions which these leaders create to allow colleagues to engage with difficult issues enthusiastically and wholeheartedly. This book makes the case that any leadership role is concerned primarily with the relationships between individuals. It is the quality of these, whatever the size of the organisation, which make the difference between organisations which thrive, and those which stagnate. This is not to argue for soft, easy and comfortable options. Instead it considers how top leaders manage to walk the line between the impossible and the possible, between the undoable and the doable, and to create conditions for productive work which transcend the difficulties which come towards us every day. Instead of dodging them, they embrace them. And by navigating high challenge, low threat, they show how others how to do the same.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=amGfDAEACAAJ&dq=High+Challenge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Century of Slaughter","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Gospel according to St. John: An introduction with commentary and notes on the Greek text","description":"In this useful work, C.

Before the Wilson years, as southern states and localities enshrined Jim Crow--in law and custom--and systematic racial discrimination infiltrated the North, the executive branch of the federal government moved in the opposite direction by opening federal employment to thousands of African Americans, appointing blacks to federal and diplomatic offices throughout the country and the world. Finding support from the federal government, many African Americans, supported Wilson's democratic campaign, dubbed the \\"New Freedom,\\" with hopes of continuing advancement. But as president, the southern-born Wilson openly supported and directly implemented a Jim Crow policy in the federal departments unleashing a firestorm of protest. This protest campaign, carried out on a level not seen since the abolitionist movement, galvanized a vast community of men and women. Blacks and whites, professionals and laymen, signed petitions, wrote protest letters, participated in organized mass meetings, lobbied public officials, directly confronted Wilson, made known their plight through publicity campaigns, and, in at least one case, marched to express their opposition. Patler provides a thorough examination of the two national organizations that led these protests efforts - the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and William Monroe Trotter's National Equal Rights League - and deftly contextualizes the movement, while emphasizing the tragic, enduring consequences of the Wilson administration's actions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-n2GAAAAMAAJ&dq=Jim+Crow+and+the+Wilson+Administration:+Protesting+Federal+Segregation+in+the+Early+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Pain in the Gut","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lord of the Air (Aslan Paperbacks)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 Unleashed","description":"This book is the most comprehensive reference on Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 today.

Rosenblatt has been leading some of the nation's best and brightest minds through the Bible, from Wall Street boardrooms to weekly sessions in the U.S. Congress, in what William Safire has called \\"the best Bible class for the layman.\\" Drawing upon insights into human nature gleaned from decades of private practice and a lifelong study of the Bible, she sifts through the Bible's epic stories, filled with vivid characters in dramatic circumstances, to show how the lessons of their lives empower us today as parents, spouses, businesspeople, citizens, and lovers. In Wrestling with Angels, she and her co-author Joshua Horwitz retell and interpret the multigenerational saga of the first family of the Bible, showing how their all-too-human struggles are decidedly relevant to the issues confronting us today. The Bible? Relevant today? Many readers will be surprised by how truly relevant the Book of Genesis is. It discusses, among other things, the first recorded case of sexual harassment; surrogate parenting and the problems it raises; siblings battling over the love of a parent; rape and its consequences; and vigilante justice. The issues faced by Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, and their descendants are remarkably similar to those that arise in all of our lives, including: The strenuous demands of adulthood The challenges of faith The joys of sexuality The nature of leadership and heroism The responsibilities of parenting The role of values in building character The empowerment of a spiritual identity In this extraordinary book of timeless and profound wisdom, Naomi Rosenblatt invites both Christians and Jews to revisit our common spiritual heritage: \\"For the humanist, the religious, the agnostic, or the merely inquisitive, Wrestling with Angels is an open invitation to probe the mystery, the miracle, and the drama of adult life in an imperfect world.\\" A book to be read again and again, Wrestling with Angels is a poignant and pragmatic guide to the bestselling self-help book of all time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dvc7WYrMjWIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lion of The North : A Tale of the Times of Gustavus Adolphus (Works of G.

However, at the turn of the twenty-first century, competing narratives began to change the meaning of  pit bull.  Increasingly represented as loving members of mostly white, middle-class, heteronormative families, pit bulls and pit bulltype dogs are now frequently seen as victims rather than perpetrators, beings deserving not fear or scorn but rather care and compassion. Drawing from the increasingly contentious world of human/dog politics and featuring rich ethnographic research among dogs and their advocates, Bad Dog explores how relationships between humans and animals not only reflect but actively shape experiences of race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, nation, breed, and species. Harlan Weaver proposes a critical and queer reading of pit bull politics and animal advocacy, challenging the zero-sum logic through which care for animals is seen as detracting from care for humans. Introducing understandings rooted in examinations of what it means for humans to touch, feel, sense, and think with and through relationships with nonhuman animals, Weaver suggests powerful ways to seek justice for marginalized humans and animals together.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4rMhEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stranger Music: Selected Poems and Songs","description":"Stranger Music brings together, at last, the words of a Canadian artist who has been anything but a stranger to so many of us for so long ...

Almost more Japanese than the Japanese \\"to think with their thoughts\\" was his aim his prolific writings on things Japanese were instrumental in introducing Japanese culture to the West. In this masterful anthology, Donald Richie shows that Hearn was first and foremost a reliable and enthusiastic observer, who faithfully recorded a detailed account of the people, customs, and culture of late nineteen-century Japan. Opening and closing with excerpts from Hearn's final books, Richie's astute selection from among \\"over 4,000 printed pages\\" not including correspondence and other writing, also reveals Hearn's later, more sober and reflective attitudes to the things that he observed and wrote about. Part One, \\"The Land,\\" chronicles Hearn's early years when he wrote primarily about the appearance of his adopted home. Part Two, \\"The People,\\" records the author's later years when he came to terms with the Japanese themselves. In this anthology, Richie, more gifted in capturing the essence of a person on the page than any other foreign writer living in Japan, has picked out the best of Hearn's evocations.

Weymouth's popular translation of the New Testament into English was first published in 1903 and has been in print through numerous editions ever since with millions of copies sold.

Weymouth succeeded in rendering it into a dignified modern English edition; the absence of ecclesiastical and doctrinal bias make it accessible to Christian readers of all denominations.

Fear and Trembling and The Sickness Unto Death established Kierkegaard as the father of existentialism and have come to define his contribution to philosophy. Lowrie's translation, first published in 1941 and later revised, was the first in English, and it has introduced hundreds of thousands of readers to Kierkegaard's thought. Kierkegaard counted Fear and Trembling and The Sickness Unto Death among \\"the most perfect books I have written,\\" and in them he introduces two terms--\\"the absurd\\" and \\"despair\\"--that have become key terms in modern thought. Fear and Trembling takes up the story of Abraham and Isaac to explore a faith that transcends the ethical, persists in the face of the absurd, and meets its reward in the return of all that the faithful one is willing to sacrifice, while The Sickness Unto Death examines the spiritual anxiety of despair. Walter Lowrie's magnificent translation of these seminal works continues to provide an ideal introduction to Kierkegaard. And, as Gordon Marino argues in a new introduction, these books are as relevant as ever in today's age of anxiety.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MOw6dkC_ZGQC&dq=Fear+and+Trembling+and+the+Sickness+Unto+Death&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Echoes of the Strange (Fable Farm Vol.1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I1KotAEACAAJ&dq=Echoes+of+the+Strange+(Fable+Farm+Vol.1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Angel Will Go Before You","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Silver Lining","description":"While on the trail headed West, Low Down nurses a band of travelers through the box and ends up in an arranged marriage to an admittedly handsome man.

Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy is not only widely acknowledged to be his most important book, but also hailed a contemporary classic of moral philosophy. Drawing on the ideas of the Greek philosophers, Williams reorients ethics away from a preoccupation with universal moral theories towards  truth, truthfulness and the meaning of an individual life . He explores and reflects upon the most difficult problems in contemporary philosophy and identifies new ideas about central issues such as relativism, objectivity and the possibility of ethical knowledge. This edition also includes a commentary on the text by A.W.Moore. At the time of his death in 2003, Bernard Williams was hailed by the Times as 'the outstanding moral philosopher of his age.' He taught at the Universities of Cambridge, Berkeley and Oxford and is the author of many influential books, including Morality; Descartes: The Project of Pure Enquiry (available from Routledge) and Truth and Truthfulness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=doxKfg6gR1AC&dq=Ethics+and+the+Limits+of+Philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discovering the History of Your House: And Your Neighborhood","description":"Demonstrating how to obtain information and organize it into a lively narrative history, this practical guide helps curious homeowners chronicle the stories of their homes.

Using Indian Agency records, congressional documents, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) records, Jesuit missionary reports, and tribal accounts, historian Laura Woodworth-Ney argues that the reservation-making process for the Coeur d'Alenes reflected more than just BIA policy objectives. It was also the result of a complex interplay of Jesuit mission goals, the Schitsu'umsh chief Andrew Seltice's assimilationist policy, and political pressure from local non-Indians. Woodworth-Ney concludes that in creating the reservation, BIA officials and tribal leaders mapped boundaries not only of territory, but also of tribal identity. Mapping Identity builds on the growing body of literature that presents a more complex picture of federal policy, native identity, and the creation of Indian reservations in the western United States. It will be important to readers interested in western U.S. history, legal and administrative history, Native American history, and interior Northwest history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e9h1AAAAMAAJ&dq=Mapping+Identity:+The+Creation+of+the+Couer+D%27Alene+Indian+Reservation,+1805-1902&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The art of the chrysanthemum;: Japanese techniques for creating bonsai, cascades, giants and other potted styles","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"2nd Fiddle: A Cassiday James Mystery","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"West patent bar review","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Complete Guide to Building Log Homes","description":"It's a classic American dream: a beautiful log home nestled in the woods, standing proudly on a mountaintop, poised on a hillside, or serenely overlooking a sparkling lake or stream.

Then, as humans began dramatically reshaping North America, the continent's largest flying land bird started disappearing. By the beginning of the twentieth century, extinction seemed inevitable. But small groups of passionate individuals refused to allow the condor to fade away, even as they fought over how and why the bird was to be saved. Scientists, farmers, developers, bird lovers, and government bureaucrats argued bitterly and often, in the process injuring one another and the species they were trying to save. In the late 1980s, the federal government made a wrenching decision -- the last remaining wild condors would be caught and taken to a pair of zoos, where they would be encouraged to breed with other captive condors. Livid critics called the plan a recipe for extinction. After the zoo-based populations soared, the condors were released in the mountains of south-central California, and then into the Grand Canyon, Big Sur, and Baja California. Today the giant birds are nowhere near extinct. The giant bird with \\"one wing in the grave\\" appears to be recovering, even as the wildlands it needs keep disappearing. But the story of this bird is more than the story of a vulture with a giant wingspan -- it is also the story of a wild and giant state that has become crowded and small, and of the behind-the-scenes dramas that have shaped the environmental movement. As told by John Nielsen, an environmental journalist and a native Californian, this is a fascinating tale of survival.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xwzqy-0q3WUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"XSLT and XPATH: A Guide to XML Transformations","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The American Indian Mind in a Linear World: American Indian Studies and Traditional Knowledge","description":"Addresses current approaches to studying Native American traditional knowledge and acknowledges an Indian intellectualism that has up until now been ignored in studying Native American history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2j-bzgEACAAJ&dq=The+American+Indian+Mind+in+a+Linear+World:+American+Indian+Studies+and+Traditional+Knowledge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Crete Counrty Map (Rough Guide Country/Region Map)","description":"The Rough Guide to Crete is the essential travel companion to the largest and most diverse of the Greek islands with detailed coverage of all the top attractions.

There is a thorough discussion of metal cans, can sealers and their operation, double seam defects, and more, all supported with many images and diagrams. Pressure canners and canning in glass jars is covered in detail. In addition, there is a large collection of recipes, both for glass jars and metal cans. This work is based on the U.S. government requirements as specified in the Code of Federal Regulations, with all relevant links listed. Home canned products do not fall under the jurisdiction of government agencies so the rules are not enforced. Therefore, home canned products account for the majority of food poisoning cases. The commercial production of low-acid foods (meat, fish, vegetables) is highly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and rightly so, since people get sick and die from eating tainted food.

Fearing the conflict and strife that bubbled up in the streets all around the new family, her parents took Ale and fled to the free shores of America. Ale grew up in Chicago amid a close community of refugees who lived with the hope that one day Castro would fall and they could return to their Cuban homes. Though Ale was intrigued by the specter of Havana that colored her life as a child, her fascination eventually faded in her teens until all that remained was her profound respect for the intricacies of the Spanish language and the beautiful work her father did as a linguist and translator. When her own job as an interpreter takes her back to Cuba, Ale is initially unmoved at the import of her return-- until she stumbles upon a surprising truth: the San Jos s, ostensibly Catholics, are actually Jews. They are conversos who converted to Christianity during the Spanish Inquisition. Enlightened by a whole new vision of her past and her culture, Ale makes her way back through San Jos  history, uncovering new fragments of truth about the relatives who struggled with their own identities so long ago. Ale is finally lured back to Cuba to make amends with the ancestral demons still lurking there--to translate her father's troubling youthful experiences into the healing language of her Cuban American heart. In beautiful, knowing prose, Achy Obejas opens up a fascinating world of exotic wordplay, rich history, and vibrant emotions. As Alejandra struggles to confront what it is to be Cuban and American, Catholic and Jewish, Obejas illuminates her journey and the tempestuous history of Cuba with intelligence and affection.

He began to dictate his diaries soon after his arrival. Buster became England's most famous dog in 1996 when he defended himself against a goose in St. James's Park -- a goose which, unfortunately, belonged to the Queen. Pursued by the press ever since, he has sought solace in writing. Buster's Diaries is the comically heart-warming true story of Buster's triumph over adversity, as he describes his rescue from a paw-to-mouth existence on scraps to his new life in the lap of luxury -- and at the same time reveals the secrets of the strange relationship between dog and the Man on the other end of the lead. Never before have readers been offered such insights into the aromatic canine world. The irresistible fragrance of chicken bones picked off the sidewalk.

Nazi Germany examines the origins and development of Nazism, the establishment of the dictatorship and the impact on Germany's economy, society and culture of the regime's single-minded drive towards war and genocide. The view from above, reflected in the movement's ideology, policy and legislation is complemented by the many, often conflicting, views from below, as described in the reports smuggled out of Germany by Socialist dissidents or overheard by the regime's spies and policemen. Tim Kirk depicts a society divided, where most were initially wary of Hitler and sceptical about his party and its promises, and where even enthusiastic admirers quickly became disgruntled; but where the majority complied and few were inclined to oppose or resist the regime, or its brutalities, until disillusionment set in and the prospect of defeat was imminent. Approachable and authoritative, this is an essential introduction to one of the most significant periods in German, and modern European, history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7pJKEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Collie","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"New Perspectives on Historical Theology: Essays in Memory of John Meyendorff.

A contemporary of Luther, an enemy of the medical establishment, a scourge of the universities, an alchemist, an army surgeon, and a radical theologian, he attracted myths even before he died. His fantastic journeys across Europe and beyond were said to be made on a magical white horse, and he was rumored to carry the elixir of life in the pommel of his great broadsword. His name was linked with Faust, who bargained with the devil. Who was the man behind these stories? Some have accused him of being a charlatan, a windbag who filled his books with wild speculations and invented words. Others claim him as the father of modern medicine. Philip Ball exposes a more complex truth in The Devil's Doctor one that emerges only by entering into Paracelsus's time. He explores the intellectual, political, and religious undercurrents of the sixteenth century and looks at how doctors really practiced, at how people traveled, and at how wars were fought. For Paracelsus was a product of an age of change and strife, of renaissance and reformation. And yet by uniting the diverse disciplines of medicine, biology, and alchemy, he assisted, almost in spite of himself, in the birth of science and the emergence of the age of rationalism. \\"Ball produces a vibrant, original portrait of a man of contradictions:\\" - Publishers Weekly","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3HNpLSvH5tAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Architecture and Film","description":"Films use architecture as visual shorthand to tell viewers everything they need to know about the characters in a short amount of time.

Architecture s representational capacity contributes to the plausibility or 'reality' possible in film. The book provides an ontological understanding that clarifies and stabilizes the reciprocity of the actual world and a filmic world of illusion and human imagination, thereby shedding light on both film and architecture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CColDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Philadelphia (EYEWITNESS TRAVEL GUIDE)","description":"Make the most of your visit to the historic sights and attractions Pennsylvania's capital and countryside have to offer with this guide by your side.

Awkward in speech and movement, broken by the premature deaths of a wife and child, Meyer ruled his youngest son with a regime of rage, dependency, and helpless love that outlasted his death.

Operational from 1964 to 1998, it is still the fastest jet-powered aircraft - a Blackbird once completed a Los Angeles-to-Washington, D.C. flight in 64 minutes. Naturally, reigning in all that technology and performance required some know-how on the parts of the pilots and ground crews. This massive volume, the SR-71 Flight Manual, is a facsimile reprint of the official flight manual issued to SR-71 crew members augmented with anecdotes and and descriptions of flight procedures from former SR-71 pilot Col. Richard Graham (Ret.). Divided into seven sections, the book covers in minute detail everything from the SR-71 trainer to normal and emergency operation procedures, navigation and sensor equipment, operating limitations, flight characteristics of the Blackbird, and all-weather operation. Now the official SR-71 flight manual is not only declassified, it's (at least partially) demystified as well!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k4WTjwEACAAJ&dq=U.S.+Air+Force:+Sr-71+Flight+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Extreme Danger (Hardy Boys: Undercover Brothers, No. 1)","description":"ATAC Briefing for Agents Frank and Joe Hardy MISSION: To located Ryan Carraway, who has mysteriously gone missing while his movie star brother, Justin, was filming on location in Bayport.

Now, master teachers Wayne C. Booth, Gregory G. Colomb, and Joseph M. Williams present a completely revised and updated version of their classic handbook. Like its predecessor, this new edition reflects the way researchers actually work: in a complex circuit of thinking, writing, revising, and rethinking. It shows how each part of this process influences the others and how a successful research report is an orchestrated conversation between a researcher and a reader. Along with many other topics, The Craft of Research explains how to build an argument that motivates readers to accept a claim; how to anticipate the reservations of thoughtful yet critical readers and to respond to them appropriately; and how to create introductions and conclusions that answer that most demanding question, \\"So what?\\" Celebrated by reviewers for its logic and clarity, this popular book retains its five-part structure. Part 1 provides an orientation to the research process and begins the discussion of what motivates researchers and their readers. Part 2 focuses on finding a topic, planning the project, and locating appropriate sources. This section is brought up to date with new information on the role of the Internet in research, including how to find and evaluate sources, avoid their misuse, and test their reliability. Part 3 explains the art of making an argument and supporting it. The authors have extensively revised this section to present the structure of an argument in clearer and more accessible terms than in the first edition. New distinctions are made among reasons, evidence, and reports of evidence. The concepts of qualifications and rebuttals are recast as acknowledgment and response. Part 4 covers drafting and revising, and offers new information on the visual representation of data. Part 5 concludes the book with an updated discussion of the ethics of research, as well as an expanded bibliography that includes many electronic sources. The new edition retains the accessibility, insights, and directness that have made The Craft of Research an indispensable guide for anyone doing research, from students in high school through advanced graduate study to businesspeople and government employees. The authors demonstrate convincingly that researching and reporting skills can be learned and used by all who undertake research projects.

In this fascinating book, paranormal historian Janice Oberding shares firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters in the Goldfield and Mizpah Hotels and uncovers the history behind the mysterious cowboy ghost, the haggard hitchhiker, and other eerie local tales.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l4X8CQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Underneath New York,","description":"Describes the subways, tunnels, steam pipes, sewers, gas pipes, and rest of the mysterious life beneath the sidewalks of New York.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZnzdzAEACAAJ&dq=Underneath+New+York,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sacred Text, Secular Times.

Dr. William Kitchiner s The Cook s Oracle was an enormous best-seller upon publication in London in 1824, and the author developed an international reputation based on his eccentricities and the extravagance of his writing. Unlike most food writers of the day, he cooked the food himself, washed up afterward, and performed all the household tasks he wrote about. He traveled around with a  portable cabinet of taste,  a folding box containing all of his unique mustards and sauces, and he was well known for his invention of the popular Wow-Wow sauce. No wonder that an anonymous American  medical gentleman  (as asserted on the title page of this edition) chose to adapt Kitchiner s English cookbook for American kitchens. In addition to over 600 recipes that run the full gamut of nineteenth century cookery, the book includes information about etiquette, dinner invitations, weights and measures (one of the first attempts to standardize cookbook measurements), carving, marketing advice, and techniques of boiling, baking, roasting, frying, and broiling. This edition of The Cook s Oracle was reproduced by permission from the volume in the collection of the American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, Massachusetts. Founded in 1812 by Isaiah Thomas, a Revolutionary War patriot and successful printer and publisher, the society is a research library documenting the lives of Americans from the colonial era through 1876. The society collects, preserves, and makes available as complete a record as possible of the printed materials from the early American experience. The cookbook collection comprises approximately 1,100 volumes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=USFHAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All the Rivers Run","description":"Philadelphia Gordon is an artist, a riverboat skipper and a beautiful, independent woman.

Although they are rarely treated as a cultural phenomenon, conversions can obviously be examined for the norms, values and presuppositions of the cultures in which they take place. Thus conversion can help us to shed light on a particular culture. At the same time, the term evokes a dramatic appeal that suggests a kind of suddenness, although in most cases conversion implies a more gradual process of establishing and defining a new - religious - identity. From 21-24 May 2003, the University of Groningen hosted an international conference on 'Cultures of Conversion'. The contributions have been edited in two volumes, which pay special attention to the modes of language and idiom in conversion literature, the meaning and sense of religious-ideological discourse, the variety of rhetorical tropes, and the effects of the conversion narrative with allusions to religious or political conventions and idealizations. The present volume contains theoretical contributions on the theory of conversion, with special attention to the rational choice theory, and on the history of research into conversion. It also offers stimulating case studies, ranging from the late Middle Ages to present times and taken from Germany, Great Britain and The Netherlands. The other volume, Cultures of Conversion, offers in-depth studies of conversion that are mainly taken from the history of India, Islam and Judaism, ranging from the Byzantine period to the new Muslimas of the West.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o28vVQoNq6cC&dq=Lazaro+siempre+llora+(Coleccion+Generacion+espontanea)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mission to Tashkent","description":"Accused by Moscow of being a British master-spy, Colonel F.M.

With this case study, Susanna F. Schaller draws on more than fifteen years of research to present a direct, focused engagement with both the planning history that shaped Washington, D.C.'s landscape and the intricacies of everyday life, politics, and planning practice as they relate to BIDs. Schaller offers a critical unpacking of the BID ethos, which draws on the language of economic liberalism (individual choice, civic engagement, localism, and grassroots development), to portray itself as color blind, democratic, and equitable. Schaller reveals the contradictions embedded in the BID model. For the last thirty years, BID advocates have engaged in effective and persuasive storytelling; as a result, many policy makers and planners perpetuate the BID narrative without examining the institution and the inequities it has wrought. Schaller sheds light on these oversights, thus fostering a critical discussion of BIDs and their collective influence on future urban landscapes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FZafDwAAQBAJ&dq=Business+Improvement+Districts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intuition and Synchronicity: A Journey to Fulfillment","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IzQHPQAACAAJ&dq=Intuition+and+Synchronicity:+A+Journey+to+Fulfillment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The real world of democracy, (The Massey lectures)","description":"In his 1964 CBC Massey Lectures C.

NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE ? Look for special features inside. Join the Random House Reader s Circle for author chats and more. In boyhood, Louis Zamperini was an incorrigible delinquent. As a teenager, he channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics. But when World War II began, the athlete became an airman, embarking on a journey that led to a doomed flight on a May afternoon in 1943. When his Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean, against all odds, Zamperini survived, adrift on a foundering life raft. Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.

Cottle argues that the period known as adolescence is essentially a social construct influenced greatly by popular culture. To understand young people, therefore, is to recognize how the very consciousness of adolescents is shaped by a culture, dominated by the entertainment industry, and the power of television and the computer, constantly urging them to turn away from the normal evolution of their personal and social lives. In this fundamentally distracting environment, young people explore their consciousness, sharing it with others, as well as form their sense of identity, all the while having these most inner experiences affected as much by the culture as by their own temperaments and personalities. It is the culture that determines the forms of recognition and independence, as well as intimacy and attachment that adolescents must learn. In the end, the author argues for the value of self-reflection as a critical ingredient of identity formation and a fundamental antidote to distracting cultural influences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PeB9AAAAMAAJ&dq=Mind+Fields:+Adolescent+Consciousness+in+a+Culture+of+Distraction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Lord for Olivia (Signet Regency Romance)","description":"A fresh Signet Regency romance  with a twist  (The Romance Reader), June Calvin s popular escapade is available as an e-book for the first time.

The diversity of both subject matter and argument is the most distinctive feature of the collection, making it a much-needed and extremely accessible, interdisciplinary introduction to the study of popular media culture. The contributors, many of them leading figures in their respective areas of study, represent a number of different approaches which themselves reflect the diversity and promise of contemporary theoretical debates.

Make 'em wonder. Or maybe we do it because we figure that there's one more kid out there who's going to need a gang to be a part of. A misfit, like us. Skeezie, Addie, Joe, and Bobby -- they've been friends forever. They laugh together, have lunch together, and get together once a week at the Candy Kitchen to eat ice cream and talk about important issues. Life isn't always fair, but at least they have each other -- and all they really want to do is survive the seventh grade. That turns out to be more of a challenge than any of them had anticipated. Starting with Addie's refusal to say the Pledge of Allegiance and her insistence on creating a new political party to run for student council, the Gang of Five is in for the ride of their lives. Along the way they will learn about politics and popularity, love and loss, and what it means to be a misfit. After years of getting by, they are given the chance to stand up and be seen -- not as the one-word jokes their classmates have tried to reduce them to, but as the full, complicated human beings they are just beginning to discover they truly are.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_NrCNotDcfwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prayer: The Cry for the Kingdom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_peFPwAACAAJ&dq=Prayer:+The+Cry+for+the+Kingdom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Devil's Hand (Sentinels)","description":"In The Devil's Hand, peace efforts with the Robotech masters culminates in war with the Invid Regent, while in Dark Powers, an alien crew offers shaky hope to a stranded crew, and in Death Dance, a planet faces destruction.

This book goes inside the reform efforts of 28 high schools where educators collaborated to fundamentally change expectations for students -- in effect, to prepare all students for postsecondary education. By challenging the status quo, teachers and administrators set out to strengthen their delivery of services so that all students, especially those traditionally denied access to college, would leave their care with more options for college and for life. Reported here are the conclusions from formal evaluations over the past ten years of high school reform shepherded by the California Academic Partnership Program (CAPP). CAPP schools are each funded for three to five years, with grants of about $100,000 a year, to make fundamental changes for their students. As these schools discovered, not all changes are equally valuable, but some are simply essential. In the words of the educators themselves and through the perspectives of CAPP advisors who monitored the programs,Inside High School Reformlays out some of the apparently universal lessons of making the reform changes that matter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uEBqzx2Iad8C&dq=Inside+High+School+Reform:+Making+the+Changes+That+Matter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maisy's Rainbow Dream","description":"Maisy dreams she's going on a journey through all the colours of the rainbow - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.

(George Cheyne in a letter to Samuel Richardson, February 1742) Both Joseph Andrews (1742) and Shamela (1741) were prompted by the success of Richardson's Pamela (1740), of which Shamela is a splendidly bawdy parody. But in Shamela Fielding also demonstrates his concern for the corruption of contemporary society, politics, religion, morality, and taste. The same themes - together with a presentation of love as charity, as friendship, and in its sexual taste - are present in Joseph Andrews, Fielding's first novel. It is a work of considerable literary sophistication and satirical verve, but its appeal lies also in its spirit of comic affirmation, epitomized in the celebrated character of Parson Adams. This revised and expanded edition follows the text of Joseph Andrews established by Martin C. Battestin for the definitive Wesleyan Edition of Fielding's works. The text of Shamela is based on the first edition, and two substantial appendices reprint the preliminary matter from Conyers Middleton's Life of Cicero and the second edition of Richardson's Pamela (both closely parodied in Shamela). A new introduction by Thomas Keymer situates Fielding's works in their critical and historical contexts.

Now, as a result of studying the inner mysteries of alchemy, Donald Tyson presents a Western system of sacred sexuality in Sexual Alchemy. Here you will learn how to have erotic relationships with loving spirits. That means the methods presented here can function as a Western alternative to Eastern sexual practices. They also can be used by a solitary person and need not depend upon the participation of a partner. The first part of this book presents a history of sex with spirits. It also goes into the secrets of Eastern internal alchemy and how the books of Western alchemy often made secretive references to sexual magick. You will also learn how to create a physical representation of the spirit you are going to use as a partner. The second part of the book includes the practices and techniques which the author found to be effective from other sources or developed himself. This includes techniques of diet, exercise, breathwork, banishings, purifications, and finally, an invocation ritual to summon the spirit who is going to be your lover! Then you will learn the previously hidden secrets of having sex with a spirit lover. You'll learn how to prepare and recognize the signs that this is an actual occurrence and not simply a fantasy. And then, when you have accomplished your ritualized mating, you will learn how to collect and use the resulting, highly charged fluids for magical purposes. Everything we are, everything we have, is a gift from the Divine. Doesn't it make sense that we use all of our abilities to honor the source from which they came? That means we can even make use of our sensual natures to honor the Gods.

Simply stated, samadhi is the free flow of vital energy within the body and between the body and the universe. Moving effortlessly across traditions and techniques, Sayama discovers that sages throughout history?Greek philosophers, German mystics, Indian seers, and our own Albert Einstein among others?have taught that this experience of transcendental oneness lies at the heart of full self-realization. The first part of the book studies self-realization in Zen Buddhism. The author pinpoints its essence in Buddha?s enlightenment. The development of Zen is then traced, continuing down to living masters who in very recent times have transplanted their lineages from Japan to the United States. Sayama notes that we must choose as masters those to whom the authentic teaching has been transmitted through generations, and he examines in loving detail the sometimes strange and astonishing behaviors of those whose very presence communicates the state of samadhi. The second part of the book presents Zen therapy, a way of self-development emphasizing the cultivation of samadhi through psychophysical training. Sayama compares the effects of Rolfing, Feldenkrais, and Zen therapy on the human body and mind. He includes easy-to-follow directions for creating the inner state he describes. He tells vivid stories of extraordinary cases treated from the point of view that the best therapy is nothing less than the removal of all dualism. Four main practices are presented: zazen (meditation), hara development, circulation of the vital energy, and communication.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WZkMu_AHGDMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ken Boyer (Putnam sports shelf)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Southern Essays of Richard M.

Martin Luther (1483-1546) was the founder of the German Reformation. His 95 Theses became a manifesto for reform of the Catholic Church and led to his being tried for heresy. He remained in Germany, Professor of Biblical Exegesis at the University of Wittenburg, until his death, publishing a large number of works, including three major treatises and a translation of the New Testament into German.

I letterati, che non siano poeti, cio  scrittori stringati, si dividono in narratori e saggisti. E  facile scrivere  C era una volta .  e parlare di cazzate con nomi di fantasia. In questo modo il successo   assicurato e non hai rompiballe che si sentono diffamati e che ti querelano e che, spesso, sono gli stessi che ti condannano. Meno facile   essere saggisti e scrivere  C   adesso .  e parlare di cose reali con nomi e cognomi. Impossibile poi   essere saggisti e scrivere delle malefatte dei magistrati e del Potere in generale, che per logica ti perseguitano per farti cessare di scrivere. Devastante   farlo senza essere di sinistra. Quando si parla di veri scrittori ci si ricordi di Dante Alighieri e della fine che fece il primo saggista mondiale. Le vittime, vere o presunte, di soprusi, parlano solo di loro, inascoltati, pretendendo aiuto. Io da vittima non racconto di me e delle mie traversie. Ascoltato e seguito, parlo degli altri, vittime o carnefici, che l aiuto cercato non lo concederanno mai.  Chi non conosce la verit    uno sciocco, ma chi, conoscendola, la chiama bugia,   un delinquente . Aforisma di Bertolt Brecht. Bene.

The Celtic Tiger (circa 1995-2008) was a time of extraordinary and radical change, in which Ireland s economic, demographic, and social structures underwent significant alteration. Conceptions of the future are powerfully prevalent in women s cultural production in the Tiger era, where it surfaces as a form of temporality that is open to surprise, change, and the unknown. Examining a range of literary and filmic texts, Irish Feminist Futures analyzes how futurity structures representations of the feminine self in women s cultural practice. Relationally connected and affectively open, these representations of self enable sustained engagements with questions of gender, race, sexuality, and class as they pertain to the material, social, and cultural realities of Celtic Tiger Ireland. This book will appeal to students and scholars of Irish studies, Irish feminist criticism, sociology, cultural studies, literature, women's studies, gender studies, neo-materialist and feminist theories.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UoePCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Any Woman Can!

Die If You Must completes John Hemming\`s authoritative trilogy on the history of the Brazilian Indians and covers the fate of the Indians in the twentieth century as \`civilized\` life began inescapably to invade their world. John Hemming describes tough expeditions and thrilling first contacts with Indians, notably by the dedicated and exuberant Villas Boas brothers on the Xingu river. The book also tries to show the trauma of contact from the indigenous side and the devastating pressures on their lands and way of life. But the story of the Indians\` fightback is as exciting as the contacts deep in the rain forests and was achieved by a coalition of activists - non-governmental organisations, some government officials, missionaries (most of whom radically changed their attitudes) , and above all by the indigenous peoples themselves.

Over the past two decades, Antony Beevor has established himself as one of the world's premier historians of WWII. His multi-award winning books have included Stalingrad and The Fall of Berlin 1945. Now, in his newest and most ambitious book, he turns his focus to one of the bloodiest and most tragic events of the twentieth century, the Second World War. In this searing narrative that takes us from Hitler's invasion of Poland on September 1st, 1939 to V-J day on August 14, 1945 and the war's aftermath, Beevor describes the conflict and its global reach -- one that included every major power. The result is a dramatic and breathtaking single-volume history that provides a remarkably intimate account of the war that, more than any other, still commands attention and an audience.

However, when Harriet finally falls in love, she is overcome by a crisis of conscious. Her entire perception of herself is shaken and her beliefs are challenged, because she has fallen for an unavailable man.

Alvin Goldman explores new frontiers by creating a thoroughgoing social epistemology, moving beyond the traditional focus on solitary knowers. Social, cultural, and technological changes present new challenges to our ways of knowing and understanding, and philosophy must face these challenges. Against the tides of postmodernism and social constructionism Goldman defends the integrity of truth and shows how to promote it by well-designed forms of social interaction. He urges that social discourse promises more than the mere politics of consensus, and that suitably norm-governed debate and belief-revision can increase veridical knowledge. Goldman's aims are not just philosophical but practical. From science to education, from law to democracy, he shows why and how public institutions should seek knowledge-enhancing practices. He examines how cyberspace and other technologies expand the scope of communication, and warns of the need to safeguard content quality. He scrutinizes the free marketplace of ideas, the adversary system in the law, and media coverage of political campaigns. The result is a bold, timely, and systematic treatment of the philosophical foundations of an information society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lQdREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Archaeologies of Social Life: Age, Sex, Class Etcetra in Ancient Egypt","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Design of Solid State Power Supplies","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rafferty Street","description":"In this final, stand-alone volume of the Morton River Valley Trilogy, Annie Heaphy, beloved hero of Lynch?s classic Toothpick House, has moved to the Valley and reunited with her old crowd.

Randy Bomer speaks eloquently and honestly about his own experiences in the classroom: his successive stages of revision, his growth from a good to a better teacher. He encourages inquiry into more reflective practice, inviting you to examine your ways of thinking, your relationship to the \\"subject of English,\\" your standards for good teaching, your place in the professional community, and most significant, your attitude toward time. Time for Meaning is both thoughtful and practical. It confronts the realities of today's classrooms: overcrowded curriculums, unfriendly colleagues, choppy schedules, and resistant learners. Bomer suggests ways to transform these obstacles into opportunities to rethink the true purpose, meaning, and design of literacy education. He offers guidelines for: helping students choose topics that are important to them- so important that they'll have the energy to work through the writing process prompting initial responses to literature and moving toward polished pieces of writing using writing as a tool for thinking and inquiring-an essential habit of mind for students to develop understanding what makes for poor student research writing and how to improve it planning curriculums that focus on story in fiction and memoir. Since time is so often the crucial issue in teaching, Bomer asks you to examine your attitudes toward time and the way you use it. He writes, \\"What we do with time is what we do with our lives. When we are 'unable' to spend time on what we most value, it is because we have not found a clarity of purpose. We have lost our maps, lost our rudder, and we drift aimlessly, as if time were not passing, as if this teaching life were not ours to live.\\" Bomer is specific and persuasive without being prescriptive. Time for Meaning is a snapshot of his current thinking, a report on work that has already benefited many teachers. It speaks as powerfully to experienced reading/writing process teachers as it does to newcomers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-HXuAAAAMAAJ&dq=Time+for+Meaning:+Crafting+Literate+Lives+in+Middle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children of the Earth","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cooking with the groundhog,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1yMXnQEACAAJ&dq=Cooking+with+the+groundhog,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trees, Shrubs, & Flowers to Know in Washington & British Columbia (Trees, Shrubs & Flowers to Know in British Columbia & Washin)","description":"?

In recent years, the most popular theory of choice behavior has been rational choice theory. Developed and elaborated by economists over the past hundred years, it claims that individuals make choices in such a way as to maximize their well-being or utility under whatever constraints they face; that is, people make the best of their situations. Rational choice theory holds undisputed sway in economics, and has become an important explanatory framework in political science, sociology, and psychology. Nevertheless, its empirical support is thin. The matching law is perhaps the most important competing explanatory account of choice behavior. It views choice not as a single event or an internal process of the organism but as a rate of observable events over time. It states that instead of maximizing utility, the organism allocates its behavior over various activities in exact proportion to the value derived from each activity. It differs subtly but significantly from rational choice theory in its predictions of how people exert self-control, for example, how they decide whether to forgo immediate pleasures for larger but delayed rewards. It provides, through the primrose path hypothesis, a powerful explanation of alcohol and narcotic addiction. It can also be used to explain biological phenomena, such as genetic selection and foraging behavior, as well as economic decision making.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=08msDavsucYC&dq=The+Matching+Law:+Papers+in+Psychology+and+Economics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Civil Disobedience","description":"A Book that Transformed America  Friendship is first, Friendship last.

A cry in the night awakens ten-year-old Amy Beale and alerts her to the difficulties in her parents' marriage. Earlier that steamy evening in July 1940, her mother, Arleatha, witnessed yet another of her husband's infidelities at one of his notorious \\"rent parties.\\" Amy overhears her sobbing in the middle of the night, as Jack Beale begs for another chance.

In Ring Around the Moon, an older, wiser Amy looks back on that pivotal year as she chronicles the family's move from a small colored community to an affluent town nearby and the conflict there as she and her brothers, Lonnie and James, adjust to new friends, a new school, and interfering relatives and neighbors. As the months pass, the struggle between Jack and Arleatha continues.

The unique and supernatural characteristics of light that influenced Hall have equally served to inspire the likes of Copernicus, Ole Romer, Michelson/Morley, Sir Edwin Hubble, and Albert Einstein. Einstein, for instance, frequently envisioned what it would be like to ride on the back of a photon as it sped across the Universe at the speed of light--a speed at which Einstein calculated that time ceased to exist. Since Einstein first entertained his special theory, science has repeatedly verified the cessation of time at this singular velocity. The term \\"light speed\\" has paradoxically become the ultimate oxymoron: a velocity of 186,000 miles per second in a setting where time doesn't exist. The ramifications are profound and are the topic of this book--ramifications so profound, in fact, to convince this author, your ultimate skeptic, that an Eternal, Intelligent Power must exist. Once Lee Baumann came to fully accept these scientifically-proven, yet supernatural qualities of light, his further research only solidified the truly metaphysical nature of this ubiquitous form of universal energy. Suddenly, descriptions of \\"the light\\" in the near-death experience and the Earth's sacred texts (e.g., \\"I am the light of the world\\") required no further explanation. God shares an intimate relationship with light. Baumann's God at the Speed of Light will complement and strengthen the spiritual foundation of any religious view.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R8O1nAEACAAJ&dq=God+at+the+Speed+of+Light&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Negotiation Toolkit: How to Get Exactly What You Want in Any Business or Personal Situation","description":"\\"The Negotiation Toolkit\\" offers a fresh new approach to mastering the crucial skills of bargaining and negotiating.

Socrates denies this charge and offers an alternate reason for why he is on trial. He explains,  [w]hat has caused my reputation is none other than a certain kind of wisdom. What kind of wisdom? Human wisdom, perhaps(1).   He proceeds to tell the story of his friend Chaerophon, who once asked the Oracle at Delphi whether there was anyone wiser than Socrates. The Oracle answered that there was not. Socrates did not agree and thought that he would try to prove the Oracle wrong. And so he set about seeking out Athenians with a reputation for wisdom in various regards in order to test their claims to knowledge through questioning. He discovered many with false claims to knowledge and none with genuine wisdom and ultimately concluded that he was the wisest. He reached this conclusion not because of any special knowledge he possessed that others did not, but rather because he recognized his own lack of knowledge and strived to learn more, while others thought that they were kno- edgeable but were not.

As dashing as a modern destroyer, the frigate offered the excitement of independent service, and the prospect of glorious single-ship engagements as well as a possible fortune to be made in prize money. Their actions have been the stuff of history and sea fiction for generations, but the ships themselves are hardly documented at all. This book seeks to redress the balance and describe the design, construction, armament and fitting of individual classes; to look at the factors that influenced their development, and to analyse the way in which frigates were employed in the many roles they were expected to perform.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q4bfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Frigates+of+the+Napoleonic+Wars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot & Spicy Recipes","description":"When it comes to hot dogs, Hot Doug's head chef Doug Sohn is the master of the craft.

Over a decade ago, Simon Sinek started a movement that inspired millions to demand purpose at work, to ask what was the WHY of their organization. Since then, millions have been touched by the power of his ideas, and these ideas remain as relevant and timely as ever. START WITH WHY asks (and answers) the questions: why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over? People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with WHY. They realized that people won't truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY behind it. START WITH WHY shows that the leaders who have had the greatest influence in the world all think, act and communicate the same way and it's the opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired.

Maxene, LaVerne, and Patty charted more top ten Billboard hits than Elvis or the Beatles and went on to become the top-selling female vocal group of all time, selling approximately 100 million records. They recorded such instant hits as \\"Beer Barrel Polka,\\" \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,\\" \\"Don't Fence Me In,\\" and \\"I Can Dream, Can't I?\\" They dominated the music scene for fifteen years with some 600 recordings, appearances in seventeen films, cabaret performances, and countless radio and television appearances. Swing It! is the first published biography of this incredibly popular trio. The book includes many rarely published photos and features extensive career data, including a detailed discography, filmography, and listing of their radio and television appearances between 1938 and 1967. The Andrews Sisters had their big break with the 1937 release of the Yiddish tune \\"Bei Mir Bist Du Schon (Means that You're Grand),\\" which sold 350,000 copies in one month and established the trio as successful recording artists. The sisters are now probably best remembered for their work entertaining troops in World War II. They traveled across the U.S. and to Italy and Africa, and their recording of \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\" for the film Buck Privates became synonymous with the war effort. Part of the reason for the success of the Andrews Sisters was their ability to perform so many different types of music. They repeatedly achieved major hits with melodies derived from many different countries, becoming the first and most prominent artists of their time to bring ethnic-influenced music to the forefront of America's hit parade. The Andrews Sisters separated for two years in the 1950s as the strain of constantly living, working, and playing together for over four decades took its toll. They reunited in 1956 and continued to perform together until LaVerne's death from cancer in 1967. The Andrews Sisters remain the most successful and enduring female vocal group in the history of show business. Theirs are the voices that defined an era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7kooEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Air War in the Falklands 1982 (Osprey Combat Aircraft 28)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Selected Writings of Sydney Smith","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ORZdtAEACAAJ&dq=Selected+Writings+of+Sydney+Smith&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maple Sugar Book","description":"Chronicles the history of maple sugaring, spanning Native American traditions through modern practices, and explains the production process from tapping through marketing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YlwtAQAAIAAJ&dq=Maple+Sugar+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Legacy of the Civil War","description":"In this elegant book, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer explores the manifold ways in which the Civil War changed the United States forever.

It was not only a major instrument of warfare, but a visible emblem of a nation s power, wealth and pride. So powerful was the link between the battleship and national feeling that even into the nuclear era, some, like France s Richelieu, were held in naval reserve. The World s Greatest Battleships features 52 of the greatest warships to have sailed and fought in the last 500 years. Beginning with English king Henry VIII s flagship, Henry Grace   Dieu, the book covers all the main periods of battleship development, including the great sail ships, such as Sovereign of the Seas, Santissima Trinidad and HMS Victory. The advent of steam-driven warships provide the core of the book, beginning with the introduction of Gloire in 1859, and continuing through all the major pre-Dreadnoughts, such as Inflexible, Mikasa, Maine and Tsessarevitch. The author continues with detailed coverage of the great battleships of the two world wars, including Derfflinger, Nagato, Hood, Scharnhorst, Vittorio Veneto, Yamato and Iowa. The book closes with the last new battleship to be commissioned, Vanguard, in 1946. Included are some of the world s greatest and most powerful capital ships. Many had eventful careers and participated in famous actions  such as the Prince of Wales  and Hood s pursuit of the German raider Bismarck; others, such as the Tirpitz, are remembered as a lurking threat; yet others, such as the USS Maine, are only remembered for being sunk in mysterious circumstances. Each entry includes a brief description of the battleship s development and history, a profile view, key features and specifications. Packed with more than 200 artworks and photographs, The World s Greatest Battleships is a colourful guide for the military historian and naval warfare enthusiast.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IWs9CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gotta Have It (Harlequin Blaze)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Democracy and the Ethical Life","description":"This study goes to the heart of ethics and politics.

Riley would agree with the notion that all significant journeys are finally the same journey. Pilgrim-Tourist, he takes the reader through a landscape both public and private, secular and spiritual. These poems, varied in form and content - with a liberal dose of sly humor - respond deeply to Ireland the modern country grafted on a land almost beyond time. The touchstone of these concerns is the image of stone itself, which weaves manystrata of meaning throughout the collection, from the inertness of being itself (the absolute other) to the structures we build to shield ourselves from it (ring fort, clochan, cottage), remember our dead with (passage grave, cairn), and even to celebrate its beauty and mystery with (stone circle, menhir, church). Newgrange is the most haunting example: tomb, work of art, church of a culture with no voice but incised stone. Yet on the winter solstice, the darkest day of the year, Newgrange floods with dawn light; for exactly 1000 seconds death is put by for the promise of resurrection. Catholic in sensibility and often in imagery, these poems find grace where we expect it and where we do not. They become powerfully affirmative but do so by the light of a clear eye. It is a trip worth taking.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bJCpAAAACAAJ&dq=Circling+the+Stones:+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Campos de Castilla (Cien anos despues, 98) (Spanish Edition)","description":"The Routledge Companion to Expressionism in a Transnational Context is a challenging exploration of the transnational formation, dissemination, and transformation of expressionism outside of the German-speaking world, in regions such as Central and Eastern Europe, the Baltics and Scandinavia, Western and Southern Europe, North and Latin America, and South Africa, in the first half of the twentieth century.

This controversy has no simple, straight-forward, and uniform explanation. Part of the explanation is to be found in the successes and failure of the operation itself; part in its labyrinthine international ramifications. But the most important explanation lies in its significance as a precedent. The ability of the Organization to take \\"collective measures\\" to maintain law and order within the territory of a Member State, albeit as a means of preserving international peace, was demonstrated, challenged and criticized. So much has been reported of the details and so varied has been the commentary that only the most intrepid spirit would venture something more with which to detain interested parties. The present study does not pretend to uncover new data so as to complete or correct the his torical record; it attempts, rather, to reflect on what has already been brought out and, against that background of factual knowledge, to indi cate and examine the legal problems involved. In so doing, it has been necessary to be ruthless in deciding what are central issues and in re jecting what is often interesting but probably peripheral.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u4X1CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pete Townshend: A Minstrel's Dilemma","description":"Weaves through the various phases of Pete Townshend's career, highlighting his quest for complete artistic expression free from compromise or commercial agendas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QgUwAQAAIAAJ&dq=Pete+Townshend:+A+Minstrel%27s+Dilemma&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shaken by Scandals: Catholics Speak Out about Priests' Sexual Abuse","description":"Shaken by Scandals\\" is for both Catholics and non-Catholics who have been grieved, angered, and confused by Church scandals and are asking, \\"How did this terrible situation come about, and how should we respond to it?\\" This book offers practical, pastoral, theological, biblical, and historical insights into scandals from a variety of perspectives from key leaders of the Church.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KDQOAAAACAAJ&dq=Shaken+by+Scandals:+Catholics+Speak+Out+about+Priests%27+Sexual+Abuse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Waterloo: June 18, 1815: The Battle for Modern Europe (Making History)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Business Coach: A Game Plan for the New Work Environment","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Christianity: Two Thousand Years","description":"Christianity arrived early in Egypt, brought according to tradition by Saint Mark the Evangelist, who became the first patriarch of Alexandria. The Coptic Orthodox Church has flourished ever since, with millions of adherents both in Egypt and in Coptic communities around the world. Since its split from the Byzantine Church in 451, the Coptic Church has proudly maintained its early traditions, and influence from outside has been minimal: the liturgy is still sung to unique rhythms in Coptic, a late stage of the same ancient Egyptian language that is inscribed in hieroglyphs on temple walls and papyri. Dr. Otto Meinardus, a leading authority on the history of the Coptic Church, here revises, updates, and combines his renowned studies Christian Egypt, Ancient and Modern (The American University in Cairo Press, 1965, 1977) and Christian Egypt, Faith and Life (The American University in Cairo Press, 1970) into a new, definitive, one-volume history for the Millennium, surveying the twenty centuries of existence of one of the oldest churches in the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mFXbAgAAQBAJ&dq=Christianity:+Two+Thousand+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Fiji Islands","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"W.B.Yeats","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Spirit Dancer","description":"Photographs depict the poignant months preceding Bob Marley's death at age thirty-six, along with text that traces his life from his youth in Jamaica and his early music with the Wailers","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u4Cx1nXzqUcC&dq=Spirit+Dancer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TMI 25 Years Later: The Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant Accident and Its Impact","description":"Three Mile Island burst into the nation's headlines twenty-five years ago, forever changing our view of nuclear power. The dramatic accident held the world's attention for an unsettling week in March 1979 as engineers struggled to understand what had happened and brought the damaged reactor to a safe condition. Much has been written since then about TMI, but it is not easy to find up-to-date information that is both reliable and accessible to the nonscientific reader. TMI 25 Years Later offers a much-needed \\"one-stop\\" resource for a new generation of citizens, students, and policy makers. The legacy of Three Mile Island has been far reaching. The worst nuclear accident in U.S. history marked a turning point in our policies, our perceptions, and our national identity. Those involved in the nuclear industry today study the scenario carefully and review the decontamination and recovery process. Risk management and the ability to convey risks to the general population rationally and understandably are an integral part of implementing new technologies. Political, environmental, and energy decisions have been made with TMI as a factor, and while studies reveal little environmental damage from the accident, long-term studies of health effects continue. TMI 25 Years Later presents a balanced and factual account of the accident, the cleanup effort, and the many facets of its legacy. The authors bring extensive research and writing The authors bring extensive research and writing experience to this book. After the accident and the cleanup, a significant collection of videotapes, photographs, and reports was donated to the University Libraries at Penn State University. Bonnie Osif and Thomas Conkling are engineering librarians at Penn State who maintain a database of these materials, which they have made available to the general public through an award-winning website. Anthony Baratta is a nuclear engineer who worked with the decontamination and recovery project at TMI and is an expert in nuclear accidents. The book features unique photographs of the cleanup and helpful appendixes that enable readers to investigate further various aspects of the story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cHfknQEACAAJ&dq=TMI+25+Years+Later:+The+Three+Mile+Island+Nuclear+Power+Plant+Accident+and+Its+Impact&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Dying: Practices For Living","description":"Interweaving the intensely moving stories of those who have met death and those who have accompanied them, with stories from ancient myth and legend, and insights gained from the author's decades of experience in guiding others on their journey toward death, this remarkable book may well change your approach to life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HMORvrF5w3MC&dq=The+Wisdom+of+Dying:+Practices+For+Living&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Krazy Kat & 76 More: Collected Stories 1950 - 1976","description":"Presents a collection of essays that examines the classic comic strip and its creator, providing a history of the strip's development, biographical information, excerpts, and an evaluation of its influence on subsequent comics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6vgwQwAACAAJ&dq=Krazy+Kat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Turkish (Teach Yourself CD)","description":"Complete Turkish is a comprehensive book and audio language course that takes you from beginner to intermediate level.

Our self-awareness the very thing that makes us human also makes us realize our powerlessness and the limitations of our existence. This concept is explored in this thought-provoking guide and provides a jumping off point for this treatise on existentialism and literature. Davis D. McElroy examines how modern art the unharmonious, corrupt, dismal, and shattering effect of much of humanity s painting, music, and literature can be traced to the existentialist view of existence. McElroy uses the works of such American authors as John Steinbeck, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and William Faulkner as well of those of Kafka and Ibsen to show that literature is the work of desperate men, whose anguish and despair have driven them to see further and more clearly than is possible for most, and their warnings must be heeded. To be able to live in the chaos of the modern world, many authors have turned to existentialism as a guide, according to McElroy. Using T. S. Eliot s The Wasteland and his plays The Confidential Clerk and The Cocktail Party as examples, McElroy posits that these authors are ultimately teaching us that we must learn to live authentically, or we will not live at all; we must choose the good that is in us, or be engulfed in the evils that surround us. This is the simple message which modern writers as well as the philosophers of existentialism are trying so desperately to bring to our attention.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GJt8EAAAQBAJ&dq=Existentialism+and+modern+literature:+An+essay+in+existential+criticism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Using French Synonyms","description":"This new guide to French synonyms is the first to be produced specifically for English-speaking students of French.

Sealed off from the outside world, first by an oppressive military regime s isolationism and then by economic sanctions, Burma lives on like a lingering ghost of its colonial past. A Prayer for Burma is a beautiful, stunning portrait of the country as seen and remembered by a homecoming native battling his conflicting national, cultural, ideological, ancestral, and ethnic identities. In the tradition of Orwell, Maugam, and Theroux, Wong shows Burma as an exotic place that invites, frightens, teases, and haunts citizens and visitors alike with its unique mixture of ill-kept Edwardian structures, pockmarked English mansions, and glittering Buddhist temples. And as a former Burmese rediscovering Burma an outsider who was once an insider Wong reveals the courage, humor, and perseverance of the Burmese people and their endearing, yet mysterious way of life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TmsJAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Prayer+for+Burma&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All I Need","description":"When Skye, a hopeless romantic, meets Seth, hurt by a recent break-up, at an end-of-summer party they connect instantly, but their love is tested when she returns to high school and he begins to work his way through an Ivy-League college.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XeZvDwAAQBAJ&dq=All+I+Need&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dr. Art Does Science","description":"Take an engrossing journey to explore the awesome ideas of science, with Dr. Art as your guide.
