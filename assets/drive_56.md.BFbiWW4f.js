Can we choose who to love? Is romantic love rational? Can we love more than one person at a time? And can we make ourselves fall out of love? In On Romantic Love, Berit Brogaard attempts to get to the bottom of love's many contradictions. This short book, informed by both historical and cutting edge philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, combines a new theory of romantic love with entertaining anecdotes from real life and accessible explanations of the neuroscience underlying our wildest passions. Against the grain, Brogaard argues that love is an emotion; that it can be, at turns, both rational and irrational; and that it can be manifested in degrees. We can love one person more than another and we can love a person a little or a lot or not at all. And love isn't even always something we consciously feel. However, love -- like other emotions, both conscious and not -- is subject to rational control, and falling in or out of it can be a deliberate choice. This engaging and innovative look at a universal topic, featuring original line drawings by illustrator Gareth Southwell, illuminates the processes behind heartbreak, obsession, jealousy, attachment, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QEiPBQAAQBAJ&dq=Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dear Valued Customer: You Are A Loser","description":"To err is human.

With brilliant immediacy, Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain brings to life a towering literary figure whose dual persona symbolized the emerging American conflict between down-to-earth morality and freewheeling ambition. As Mark Twain, he was the Mississippi riverboat pilot, the satirist with a fiery hatred of pretension, and the author of such classics as Tom Sawyer andHuckleberry Finn. As Mr. Clemens, he was the star who married an heiress, built a palatial estate, threw away fortunes on harebrained financial schemes, and lived the extravagant life that Mark Twain despised. Kaplan effectively portrays the triumphant-tragic man whose achievements and failures, laughter and anger, reflect a crucial generation in our past as well as his own dark, divided, and remarkably contemporary spirit. Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain brilliantly conveys this towering literary figure who was himself a symbol of the peculiarly American conflict between moral scrutiny and the drive to succeed. Mr. Clemens lived the Gilded Life that Mark Twain despised. The merging and fragmenting of these and other identities, as the biography unfolds, results in a magnificent projection of the whole man; the great comic spirit; and the exuberant, tragic human being, who, his friend William Dean Howells said, was  sole, incomparable, the Lincoln of our literature.

Few students know before they read it that Leona Tamarkin is my grandmother, and most are surprised when I tell them that this is my family's story. Students cannot believe that, despite overwhelming adversity, the girl in the narrative grew up, had five children, that those children had children, and that I, one of those grandchildren, am standing in front of them, a living embodiment of family--and Jewish--preservation. My grandmother's story moved them to tears but more important for students of history, it gave immediacy and humanity to distant historical events. The European events of the First World War seem as ancient as the Peloponnesian War to my students, so far removed are they from this tragedy. Dear Lizzie draws them in and enables them to enter this distant world. Through Leona Tamarkin's memory, readers glimpse Europe's devastation during the First World War and gain an understanding of what it meant to emigrate to the United States in those postwar years. Leona's story sounds like many of my students' own family immigrant stories (no matter where they are from). She is self-educated, as so many immigrants of that period were, and the narrative's simplicity and naivete reveals the universality of a certain kind of childhood experience that was and is shared by many immigrants. Her writing has an easy spontaneity about it that suggests nature rather than artifice, the recounting of memory rather than the crafting of a story. Leona Tamarkin was fifteen years old when she came with her older sister to America. Her memoir begins when she was just a small girl in Brest-Litovsk, in Russian-occupied Poland. Born in 1905, Tamarkin relates her experiences as a Jewish refugee, as the German and, later, the Russian armies entered village after village, forcing inhabitants to flee their brief havens and seek sanctuary elsewhere. Tamarkin's story chronicles the hardships her family endured: her parents' divorce on the eve of her father's emigration to America before the war (decreed by the rabbi just in case her father failed to reunite the family in the New World), her mother's early death, her own and her older sister's and brother's near starvation as refugees. The reader rejoices when, finally, her father finds their names on a Jewish social service agency's list and sends them money and tickets to America. Tamarkin's memoir highlights one important truth about twentieth-century Jewish history in Europe: that it was not confined to Europe. The dislocation of European Jewry during the First World War and its later devastation in the Holocaust is fundamentally part of American Jewish history as well. In reading this powerful story, we are reminded that \\"immigration\\" cannot be appreciated without an understanding of European events. To challenge the adage on the nature of history, the past is not a foreign country; indeed, as William Faulkner wrote, \\"It's not even past.\\" As a child, Tamarkin was aware of the seismic changes she faced, and her writing transports readers back to those frightening ordeals. What makes her story exceptional is that she recollects the child's point of view so vividly. The child's perspective and voice guides the narrative, carrying readers not only to the historical time and place, but to that time in our own lives when we were small children. After Leona's father divorces her mother and leaves for America, the small girl is embarrassed when her classmates tease her about not having a father. Similarly, the agony she feels when made to wear a dress her mother fashions out of a red silk man's shirt paral","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2TzcGAAACAAJ&dq=Dear+Lizzie:+Memoir+of+a+Jewish+Immigrant+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"University of South Carolina 2007 (College Prowler)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fall and Rise","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Passions : The Wines and Travels of Thomas Jefferson","description":"This is a biography of Thomas Jefferson at leisure, enjoying two of his passions--wine and travel.

First published a year after Morris s death in 1897 by Kelmscott Press Morris s own printing company the novel follows Birdalone, a young girl who is stolen as a baby by a witch who takes her to serve in the woods of Evilshaw. After she encounters a wood fairy that helps her escape the witch s clutches, Birdalone embarks on a series of adventures across the titular Wondrous Isles. These isles are used by Morris both as parables for contemporary Britain and as vehicles for investigating his radical socialist beliefs. As Birdalone travels through the isles she slowly evolves into the embodiment of the Victorian  new woman,  embracing hard physical labor, healthy exercise, higher education, socialist values, and financial freedom, while rejecting sexual exploitation, physical abuse of both women and children, and the restrictive sexual mores of the era. This makes her unique in the fantasy fiction of the era as one of the genre s first examples of a strong female hero. This socialist-feminist allegory is presented in an Arthurian-style fantasy world complete with magic, witches, fairies, knights both chivalrous and evil, and castles (indeed, anyone doubting the allegorical nature of the work only needs to look at the name of the tale s main redoubt:  The Castle of the Quest ). The language is purposefully archaic, reveling in vocabulary drawn from the language s Anglo roots; and the prose is lent a hypnotic quality by its lack of quotation marks to offset dialog, and its short chapters characterized by a fairy-tale-narrative voice.

In No Longer Strangers, diverse voices lay out a vision for a healthier evangelism that can honor the most vulnerable many of whom have lived through trauma, oppression, persecution, and the effects of colonialism while foregrounding the message of the gospel. With perspectives from immigrants and refugees, and pastors and theologians (some of whom are immigrants themselves), this book offers guidance for every church, missional institution, and individual Christian in navigating the power dynamics embedded in differences of culture, race, and language. Every contributor wholeheartedly affirms the goodness and importance of evangelism as part of Christian discipleship while guiding the reader away from the kind of evangelism that hurts, toward the kind of evangelism that heals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=deL9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tale of the Incomparable Prince (Library of Tibet)","description":"Tibet's only novel, a parable for all time, combines intrigue, romance, war, and religion in a rousing adventure story set within the context of a traditional Buddhist worldview.

A lucid, intelligent page-turner  (Los Angeles Times) that challenges long-held assumptions about Jesus, from the host of Believer Two thousand years ago, an itinerant Jewish preacher walked across the Galilee, gathering followers to establish what he called the  Kingdom of God.  The revolutionary movement he launched was so threatening to the established order that he was executed as a state criminal. Within decades after his death, his followers would call him God. Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history s most enigmatic figures by examining Jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived. Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction. He explores the reasons the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity. Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus  life and mission. Praise for Zealot  Riveting . . .

On the tiniest of scales, the cosmos reveals to us a universe filled with quanta particles; and on the largest, a universe of planets, stars, galaxies, and life. The expanse is endless. Are we then to believe ourselves alone in the vastness of creation, or to solely occupy the crown of it? In 1975, Corky Ra, an administrative manager for a large supply company, began to experience a series of encounters with advanced beings. His first reactions of shock and disbelief led him to a period of seclusion, yet the \\"visits\\" continued, leading him to an awakening. Ra realized it was the purpose of these beings to re-introduce, in a pure form, principles of nature that have always existed and address all issues of existence, sexuality, and death. SUMMUM: Sealed Except to the Open Mind is about existence in its broadest context and delves into the forces behind cosmic rhythms and change.

He raised magnificent, fanciful Spanish Renaissance hotel palaces on what had been orange grove and salt marsh. Then he connected his creation with the outside world by building a modern railroad system. Flagler's hotels stand as monuments to innovation in architecture and engineering. They were the first large buildings in the United States constructed of poured concrete, and they pioneered use of novel amenities like electric lights, steam heat, and elevators. They are still a vital part of modern St. Augustine. The Ponce de Leon, Flaglers preeminent hotel, now houses Flagler College; the Alcazar now holds the City Hall and the Lightner Museum. Only the Casa Monica (previously called the Cordova) is presently a hotel.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y5hxDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Power Play (Spectrum)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=khuJzgEACAAJ&dq=Power+Play+(Spectrum)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playing Happy Families","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"More Shop Drawings for Craftsman Furniture: 30 Stickley Designs for Every Room in the Home (Shop Drawings series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Saint-Simon and the Court of Louis XIV","description":"The Duke of Saint-Simon (1675-1755) was a self-obsessed courtier and chronicler of court life under Louis XIV.

Alice Dreger focuses on events in France and Britain in the late nineteenth century, a moment of great tension for questions of sex roles. While feminists, homosexuals, and anthropological explorers openly questioned the natures and purposes of the two sexes, anatomical hermaphrodites suggested a deeper question: just how many human sexes are there? Ultimately hermaphrodites led doctors and scientists to another surprisingly difficult question: what is sex, really? Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex takes us inside the doctors' chambers to see how and why medical and scientific men constructed sex, gender, and sexuality as they did, and especially how the material conformation of hermaphroditic bodies--when combined with social exigencies--forced peculiar constructions. Throughout the book Dreger indicates how this history can help us to understand present-day conceptualizations of sex, gender, and sexuality. This leads to an epilogue, where the author discusses and questions the protocols employed today in the treatment of intersexuals (people born hermaphroditic). Given the history she has recounted, should these protocols be reconsidered and revised? A meticulously researched account of a fascinating problem in the history of medicine, this book will compel the attention of historians, physicians, medical ethicists, intersexuals themselves, and anyone interested in the meanings and foundations of sexual identity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=plJweDWNo3gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three big hogs (Children's Braille Book-of-the-month Club)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A fruit is born (Sterling nature series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7-IInwEACAAJ&dq=A+fruit+is+born+(Sterling+nature+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Mother's Manual A Manual of Devotions for Mothers and Expectant Mothers","description":"This little manual is presented to help today's mothers in realizing and fulfilling the dignity of their state.

What we as her audience take away from this remarkable drama is a keener sense that, while death is real and unavoidable, our lives are ours to cherish or throw away a lesson that can be both uplifting and redemptive. As the playwright herself puts it, \\"The play is not about doctors or even about cancer. It's about kindness, but it shows arrogance. It's about compassion, but it shows insensitivity.\\" In Wit, Edson delves into timeless questions with no final answers: How should we live our lives knowing that we will die? Is the way we live our lives and interact with others more important than what we achieve materially, professionally, or intellectually? How does language figure into our lives? Can science and art help us conquer death, or our fear of it? What will seem most important to each of us about life as that life comes to an end? The immediacy of the presentation, and the clarity and elegance of Edson's writing, make this sophisticated, multilayered play accessible to almost any interested reader. As the play begins, Vivian Bearing, a renowned professor of English who has spent years studying and teaching the intricate, difficult Holy Sonnets of the seventeenth-century poet John Donne, is diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer. Confident of her ability to stay in control of events, she brings to her illness the same intensely rational and painstakingly methodical approach that has guided her stellar academic career. But as her disease and its excruciatingly painful treatment inexorably progress, she begins to question the single-minded values and standards that have always directed her, finally coming to understand the aspects of life that make it truly worth living.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jbxZAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twentieth-century German verses: With plain prose translations of each poem (The Penguin poets)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lighthouses: A Book of 21 Postcards","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VAsnPQAACAAJ&dq=Lighthouses:+A+Book+of+21+Postcards&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Literary Culture in Taiwan: Martial Law to Market Law","description":"With monumental changes in the last two decades, Taiwan is making itself anew. The process requires remapping not only the country's recent political past, but also its literary past. Taiwanese literature is now compelled to negotiate a path between residual high culture aspirations and the emergent reality of market domination in a relatively autonomous, increasingly professionalized field. This book argues that the concept of a field of cultural production is essential to accounting for the ways in which writers and editors respond to political and economic forces. It traces the formation of dominant concepts of literature, competing literary trends, and how these ideas have met political and market challenges. Contemporary Taiwanese literature has often been neglected and misrepresented by literary historians both inside and outside of Taiwan. Chang provides a comprehensive and fluent history of late twentieth-century Taiwanese literature by placing this vibrant tradition within the contexts of a modernizing local economy, a globalizing world economy, and a postcolonial and post-Cold War world order.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7IAgsLtU9XIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Live and let die","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Out of Order (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to England, 4th Edition","description":"This is a comprehensive and up-to-the-minute handbook to England.

But when the ship is attacked, the Robinsons are stranded on an alien planet where they must contend with disastrous technical issues, a hostile environment, and dangerous personalities to get off world and reach their colony. One day, while exploring a remote complex of caves with his Robot, Will discovers a strange portal that allows him to travel back to Earth--to a time before the Robinsons left on their mission. Realizing the portal could be a way for the colonists to escape the planet and finally make their way to their new home, Will and his sisters decide to investigate it, triggering a series of events that not only changes their reality, but threatens the group's very existence.

Addams first created Morticia, Lurch, and The Thing in a cartoon published in a 1938 issue of the New Yorker though he hadn't named them at the time, or even conceived of a family unit. (When he did name the deadly matriarch, he was inspired by the Yellow Pages listing for \\"Morticians.\\") Other characters were born and developed in a multitude of Addams's cartoons over the next twenty-six years, before the cheerfully creepy clan debuted on ABC television in 1964 and later on the big screen, twice, in 1991 and 1993.The Addams Family: An Evilution is the first book to trace The Addams Family history, presenting more than 200 cartoons created by Charles Addams (American, 19121988) throughout his prolific career; many have never been published before. Text by H. Kevin Miserocchi, director of the Tee and Charles Addams Foundation, offers a revealing chronology of each character's evolution (for instance, did you know that Addams originally named Pugsley \\"Pubert\\"?), while Addams's own incisive character descriptions, originally penned for the benefit of the television show producers, introduce each chapter. As the presence of the Family continues to permeate generation after generation, and in celebration of the Broadway musical debuting in 2010, this book reminds us where these oddly lovable characters came from and, in doing so, offers a lasting tribute to one of America's greatest humorists. A phenomenon of rare proportion, The Addams Family is the manifestation of one artist's dark but irresistible wit, expressed with an uncommonly deft hand.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xp-eQQAACAAJ&dq=The+Addams+Family&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taino: Pre-Columbian Art and Culture from the Caribbean","description":"Organized by El Museo del Barrio in New York to coincide with a major exhibition, this is the first comprehensive English-language publication on the fascinating legacy of Taiacute;no art and culture. Showcasing over one hundred rare and beautiful ceremonial and domestic artworks and individual masterpieces of this ancient culture -- produced in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Haiti, and the Bahamas between A.D. 1200 and 1500 --Taiacute;noincludes examples of finely detailed and polished sculptures carved in wood, precious ornaments of shell and bone, and ceramics decorated with animals, birds, and intricate geometric motifs. The contributors include ten of the foremost scholars of pre-Columbian culture and art, and an appendix features writings from Spanish explorers who had contact with the Taiacute;no. Of Arawak descent, the Taiacute;no -- whose ancestors migrated to the Caribbean from the Amazon Basin in South America during the sixth century -- were the first people encountered by Christopher Columbus. Although they ceased to exist as an autonomous society within sixty years of the arrival of Spanish colonizers, the Taiacute;no -- skilled agriculturists and navigators and accomplished weavers, potters, and carvers -- developed a complex political, religious, and social system, and made a substantial contribution to the biological, cultural, and linguistic makeup of large areas of the Caribbean. To this date, Caribbean communities in the Antilles and in New York and other large American cities exhibit the survival of Taiacute;no practices in their worldviews, religious beliefs, language, music, and food.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BEh7AAAAMAAJ&dq=Taino:+Pre-Columbian+Art+and+Culture+from+the+Caribbean&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dante's Inferno","description":"Presents a verse translation of Dante's \\"Inferno\\" along with ten essays that analyze the different interpretations of the first canticle of the \\"Divine Comedy.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TPkqYo-6QwkC&dq=Dante%27s+Inferno&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell 1872-1914","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ox97jwEACAAJ&dq=The+Autobiography+of+Bertrand+Russell+1872-1914&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pancakes Paris","description":"Now a New York Times Bestseller Paris was practically perfect...

Coenen's work contains the earliest European pictures of whales, na?ve but easily identifiable, which makes it a rare visual and textual source for the natural world of his day. The Whale Book offers a representative selection of more than 100 pages from Coenen s manuscripts that deal mainly, though not exclusively, with whales. Coenen s charming, lively watercolors are reproduced in color alongside translations of his texts, and both are accompanied by modern marine-biological identifications and observations that amplify and explain his work, setting it within the wider context of this period in Northern European history. The Whale Book will appeal to all those interested in the natural world and the preservation of threatened marine wildlife, as well as those active in the fields of cultural history, art and the natural sciences. In addition, readers will gain unexpected insights into the experiences of an everyday figure caught up in the events of a turbulent period in Dutch history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q06XA90j7IsC&dq=Whale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of Poland (Palgrave Essential Histories)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sargent Portrait Drawings: 42 Works by John Singer Sargent (Dover Art Library)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The World of Nitrogen","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"SW: The Courtship of Princess Leia (AU Star Wars)","description":"Han Solo confronts a new rival for Princess Leia's affections in the person of Prince Isolder, who will ally the sixty-three high-tech worlds of the Hapes Consortium with the New Republic, if Leia will marry him","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rPkOAQAAMAAJ&dq=SW:+The+Courtship+of+Princess+Leia+(AU+Star+Wars)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Armchair Paddler: An Anthology of Canoeing, Kayaking, and Rafting Adventures","description":"A roster of experienced boaters and renowned authors make for riveting, unforgettable tales of thrilling exploration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TVPBPAAACAAJ&dq=Armchair+Paddler:+An+Anthology+of+Canoeing,+Kayaking,+and+Rafting+Adventures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Facing Nature","description":"John Updike s fifth collection of poetry faces nature on a number of levels. An opening section of sonnets touches upon death, aging, and, in a sequence of describing a week in Spain, insomnia and dread. The poems that follow consider nature in the form of seasons, of planting trees and being buried, of shadow and rain, of pain and accumulation, and of such human diversions as art and travel. The last poem here, and the longest in the book, undertakes a walking tour of each of Jupiter s four major moons, a scientific excursion that leads into the extravagant precisions of the  Seven Odes to Seven Natural Processes,  a lyrical yet literal-minded celebration of some of the earthly forces that uphold and surround us. Finally, a dozen examples of light verse toy with such natural phenomena as presbyopia, the energy crunch, food, and sex. Like the best of the metaphysical poets, Mr. Updike embraces the world in all its forms and creates conceits out of the casual as well as the moments.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M3hKFGCTFr8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LEARNING TEACHING (Teacher Development S.)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Little World of Don Camillo","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to fireproof your career: survival strategies for volati","description":"In the face of ever-diminishing job security, a handbook shows how to achieve career security through decreasing one's dependence on a single employer, developing new marketable skills, broadening one's career options, and networking.

O Brien carefully describes the design process of his chosen projects, including a downtown New York City loft, a traditional Connecticut estate, and a converted schoolhouse in eastern Long Island. Each home explores a view on the modern design spectrum he has created, as well as the individual choices that make the design unique and its mix essentially American. He explains not only what was at work to create a given style, but how readers can import those practices to their own homes and personal design sensibilities. Important design principles such as architectural authenticity, color relationships, correctness of scale, and informed collecting are threaded through a practical narrative that reads like a master class in interior design.

Presented here with Kierkegaard's notes of the celebrated Berlin lectures on \\"positive philosophy\\" by F.W.J. Schelling, the book is a seedbed of Kierkegaard's subsequent work, both stylistically and thematically. Part One concentrates on Socrates, the master ironist, as interpreted by Xenophon, Plato, and Aristophanes, with a word on Hegel and Hegelian categories. Part Two is a more synoptic discussion of the concept of irony in Kierkegaard's categories, with examples from other philosophers and with particular attention given to A. W. Schlegel's novel Lucinde as an epitome of romantic irony. The Concept of Irony and the Notes of Schelling's Berlin Lectures belong to the momentous year 1841, which included not only the completion of Kierkegaard's university work and his sojourn in Berlin, but also the end of his engagement to Regine Olsen and the initial writing of Either/Or.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rNEjpTvgAYwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The concise Oxford French dictionary","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Architecture of Affordable Housing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"La Regle de Quatre","description":"Depuis 1499, des savants tentent de d coder un chef-d'?uvre de la Renaissance, Le Songe de Poliphile.

Beginning in the mid-fifties and emanating largely form MIT, an approach was developed to linguistic theory and to the study of the structure of particular languages that diverges in many respects from modern linguistics. Although this approach is connected to the traditional study of languages, it differs enough in its specific conclusions about the structure and in its specific conclusions about the structure of language to warrant a name, \\"generative grammar.\\" Various deficiencies have been discovered in the first attempts to formulate a theory of transformational generative grammar and in the descriptive analysis of particular languages that motivated these formulations. At the same time, it has become apparent that these formulations can be extended and deepened.The major purpose of this book is to review these developments and to propose a reformulation of the theory of transformational generative grammar that takes them into account. The emphasis in this study is syntax; semantic and phonological aspects of the language structure are discussed only insofar as they bear on syntactic theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u0ksbFqagU8C&dq=ASPECTS+OF+THE+THEORY+OF+SYNTAX&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Irving Penn","description":"One of the most distinguished practitioners of portrait and fashion photography of the mid-twentieth century, Irving Penn's work is identified by its refinement of craft, by the wit and grace of its formal invention, and by its sensitivity to the quality and character of light. Backed by Vogue magazine, Penn brought a classic economy and concentration to the overblown world of fashion photography, to portraits of artists, writers, and theater people, and to ethnographic studies of style and ornament in little-known corners of West Africa, Nepal, Peru, and New Guinea. This book, published in conjunction with an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, is the first comprehensive retrospective of Penn's work. The essay by John Szarkowski follows a brilliant career, from its art-school beginnings to the provocative still lifes, photographs of cigarette butts and street detritus--works of eloquence and classical rectitude, made from the least consequential of subject matter.--From publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aVXrAAAAMAAJ&dq=Irving+Penn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"McTeague: A Story of San Francisco","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Old Mother Hubbard (Tip-top elf book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cQA9ngEACAAJ&dq=Old+Mother+Hubbard+(Tip-top+elf+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colors: A First Art Book","description":"The second entry in this innovative series introduces children to color in art.

All marriages have a breaking point. All families have wounds. All wars have a cost. . . . Like many couples, Michael and Jolene Zarkades have to face the pressures of everyday life---children, careers, bills, chores---even as their twelve-year marriage is falling apart. Then an unexpected deployment sends Jolene deep into harm's way and leaves defense attorney Michael at home, unaccustomed to being a single parent to their two girls. As a mother, it agonizes Jolene to leave her family, but as a solider she has always understood the true meaning of duty. In her letters home, she paints a rose-colored version of her life on the front lines, shielding her family from the truth. But war will change Jolene in ways that none of them could have foreseen.

This accessible but serious introduction to the design problem brings together new perspectives from prominent scientists and philosophers including Paul Davies, Richard Swinburne, Sir Martin Rees, Michael Behe, Elliot Sober and Peter van Inwagen. It probes the relationship between modern science and religious belief, considering their points of conflict and their many points of similarity. Is the real God of creationism the 'master clockmaker' who sets the world's mechanism on a perfectly enduring course, or a miraculous presence who continually intervenes in and alters the world we know? Are science and faith, or evolution and creation, really in conflict at all? Expanding the parameters of a lively and urgent debate, God and Design considers how perennial questions of origin continue to fascinate and disturb us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yX6591VNz4IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Impossible Woman","description":" Free Comic!

The Washington Post The darker vision and sexual ambiguities of this sensual, ironic tale about a m nage a quatre in a New England university town foreshadow those of The World According to Garp; but this very trim and precise novel is a marked departure from the author's generally robust, boisterous style. Though Mr. Irving's cool eye spares none of his foursome, he writes with genuine compassion for the sexual tests and illusions they perpetrate on each other; but the sexual intrigue between them demonstrates how even the kind can be ungenerous, and even the well-intentioned, destructive.  One of the most remarkable things about John Irving's first three novels, viewed from the vantage of The World According to Garp, is that they can be read as one extended fictional enterprise. . . . The 158-Pound Marriage is as lean and concentrated as a mine shaft.  Terrence Des Pres  Deft, hard-hitting . . .

Drawing on the disciplines of political science, history, law, and anthropology and written in a direct, readable style, American Indian Tribal Governments is a comprehensive introduction to traditional tribal governments, to the history of Indian-white relations, to the structure and legal rights of modern tribal governments, and to the changing roles of federal and state governments in relation to modem tribal governments. Publication of this book fills a gap in American Indian studies, providing scholars with a basis from which to begin an integrated study of tribal government, providing teachers with an excellent introductory textbook, and providing general readers with an accessible and complete introduction to American Indian history and government. The book's unique structure allows coverage of a great breadth of information while avoiding the common mistake of generalizing about all tribes and cultures. An introductory section presents the basic themes of the book and describes the traditional governments of five tribes chosen for their geographic and cultural diversity-the Senecas, the Muscogees, the Lakotas, the Isleta Pueblo, and the Yakimas. The next three chapters review the history of Indian-white relations from the time Christopher Columbus \\"discovered\\" America to the present. Then the history and modem government of each of the five tribes presented earlier is examined in detail. The final chapters analyze the evolution and current legal powers of tribal governments, the tribal-federal relationship, and the tribal-state relationship. American Indian Tribal Governments illuminates issues of tribal sovereignty and shows how tribes are protecting and expanding their control of tribal membership, legal systems, child welfare, land and resource use, hunting and fishing, business regulation, education, and social services. Other examples show tribes negotiating with state and federal governments to alleviate sources of conflict, including issues of criminal and civil jurisdiction, taxation, hunting and fishing rights, and control of natural resources. Excerpts from historical and modem documents and speeches highlight the text, and more than one hundred photos, maps, and charts show tribal life, government, and interaction with white society as it was and is. Included as well are a glossary and a chronology of important events.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Po1vsDfBCoIC&dq=American+Indian+Tribal+Governments+(Civilization+of+the+American+Indian)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventures in Black.","description":"Collects fifty-two accounts of travel by such writers as Maya Angelou, Lucinda Roy, Alice Walker, Gwendolyn Brooks, Colleen J.

The Babinski reflex is ascertained when a blunt instrument is run along the underside of the foot from heal to toe. When the toe curls under or does nothing, this is a good sign. When the big toe flexes upward and the other toes spread, this is bad and may indicate upper motor neuron damage to the spinal cord or brain disease.But Babinski contributed more to neurology than just a 'simple reflex test' and this book Joseph Babinski: A Biography provides a new look at his work, avoiding the temptation to join the ranks of his unconditional admirers and detractors. The authors stick to the facts of Babinski's life, tracing the sources in forgotten archives and the extensive library collections and, hopefully, exploring territory behind and beyond the traditional records. Above all nothing will be presented as true that cannot be proven with supporting documents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pI4UDAAAQBAJ&dq=Encyklopedia+Polski+(Polish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Royal Blood","description":"A riveting true story of murder and detection in 15th-century Paris, by one of the most brilliant medievalists of his generation. On a chilly November night in 1407, Louis of Orleans was murdered by a band of masked men. The crime stunned and paralyzed France since Louis had often ruled in place of his brother King Charles, who had gone mad. As panic seized Paris, an investigation began. In charge was the Provost of Paris, Guillaume de Tignonville, the city's chief law enforcement officer -- and one of history's first detectives. As de Tignonville began to investigate, he realized that his hunt for the truth was much more dangerous than he ever could have imagined. A rich portrait of a distant world, Blood Royal is a gripping story of conspiracy, crime and an increasingly desperate hunt for the truth. And in Guillaume de Tignonville, we have an unforgettable detective for the ages, a classic gumshoe for a cobblestoned era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_2kTjyaTmNMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Population Policy and Women's Rights: Transforming Reproductive Choice","description":"An argument for a more responsive approach to birth control in developing countries, built upon women's concern for their survival and security and strengthening their rights.

The book opens with a fascinating autobiographical essay exploring the challenges and benefits of being a Marxist scholar in the present era. Following this is a discussion of various issues in class analysis, with particular attention being paid to two overarching themes: class and inequality, and the relationship between class and power. The second section of the book engages the problem of socialism as a possible future to capitalism. Wright attempts to clarify the conceptual status of socialism, and discusses why certain reforms such as basic income grants may ultimately require the introduction of some form of socialism for their full realization. Interrogating Inequality concludes by examining the general problem of Marxism as a tradition of radical social theory. Three issues in particular are discussed: the central principles of \\"analytical Marxism\\" as a strategy for reconstructing Marxism as a social scientific theory; the relationship between Marxism and feminism as emancipatory social theories; and the prospects for Marxism in the aftermath of the collapse of communist regimes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_5S1AAAAIAAJ&dq=Interrogating+Inequality:+Essays+on+Class+Analysis,+Socialism+and+Marxism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Etruscan chimera: An archaeological mystery","description":"When antiques dealer Lara McClintoch journeys to Tuscany at the behest of a client who hires her to purchase an obscure Etruscan sculpture, she stumbles into the dark side of sunny Italy when a prominent collector turns up dead in his own Etruscan tomb.

In a White Stone Abbey, situated in a dense English forest, a scroll, which held the secret to the present day Pierce House on the opposite side of the Atlantic, lay hidden in a chamber behind an alter, protected down thru the ages by brown robed monks until the 18th Century. On the quill scripted parchment were words that foretold the future of a dwelling, its surrounding properties; and through the generations to its final location in consecrated grounds to a distant land across the seas. It also foretold of the horrendous trials set for it, and who the true owner would ultimately be. To the day she entered her ancestral home, with its promise of terror or fulfillment, The House On The Bluff maintained its enchantment and its ageless elegance, standing as a silent sentinel waiting for the one long destined to enter with her Consort, to claim ownership.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4qU3N8KZtqwC&dq=House+on+the+Bluff&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Computer-aided exercises on civil procedure (Legal exercise series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FAXDAAAACAAJ&dq=Computer-aided+exercises+on+civil+procedure+(Legal+exercise+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Closter and Alpine (NJ) (Images of America)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Eagle and the Serpent (C454)","description":"Essays on the depiction of animals, birds and insects in early medieval material culture, from texts to carvings to the landscape itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4qwyCgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Eagle+and+the+Serpent+(C454)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Descendants of Darkness: Yami no Matsuei, Vol. 8","description":"Earl Ciel Phantomhive and his invincible butler, Sebastian, have thusfar been foiled in their attempts to seek an audience with the headmaster of Weston College.

It goes deep on a handful of them, narrowly divulging exactly how a few software developers and startup founders created breakthrough tech products like Gmail, Dropbox, Ring, Snapchat, Bitcoin, Groupon, and more. It highlights and unpacks the general hero-worship that the media and our own minds practice about tech founders and tech entrepreneurs. This idealization of tech success can create a paradox, preventing average tech professionals from their own successful journeys. This book provides hard evidence that anyone in tech can create, and anyone on the peripheral of tech can break through to the center where innovation, creativity, and opportunity meet. The anecdotes, stories, evidence, facts, arguments, logic, principles, and techniques provided in this book have helped individuals and businesses engage in slow creation cycles, improve the morale of their development teams, and increased their delivery potential of their technology solutions overall. Average Joe covers: Genius - The systematic deconstruction and debunking of the commonly held assumptions in the tech industry around supreme intelligence, and how that intelligence has been worshipped and sought after, despite the facts. Slow Creation - How to force-manufacture creative ideation. How conscious and subconscious cycles of patterns, details, and secrets can lead to breakthrough innovations, and how those P.D.S. cycles, and systematic mental grappling, can be conjured and repeated on a regular basis. Little-C Creativity - The conscious and miniature moments of epiphany that leak into our active P.D.S. cycles of Slow Creation. Flow - Why it's great, but also - why it's completely unreliable and unnecessary. How to perpetually innovate without relying on a flow state. Team Installation - How teams and companies can engage their employees in Slow Creation to unlock dormant ideas, stir up creative endeavors, and jumpstart fragile ideas into working products. User Manipulation - How tech products are super-charged with tricks, secret techniques, and neural transmitters like Dopamine, Oxytocin, and Cortisol; how those products leverage cognitive mechanisms and psychological techniques to force user adoption and user behaviors. Contrarianism - How oppositional and backward-thinking leaders create brand-new categories and the products which dominate those categories. Showmanship - How tech players have presented their ideas to the world, conjured up magic, manufactured mystique, and presented compelling stories that have captured their audiences. Sustainable Mystique Triad  A simple model for capturing audiences consistently without relying on hype and hustle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DIT4DwAAQBAJ&dq=Average+Joe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Than Puppy Love: Expressions of Affection","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Red Queen.

A vast pool of knowledge, therefore, has been gleaned from research into the nature of sex, from the contentious problem of why the wasteful reproductive process exists at all, to how individuals choose their mates and what traits they find attractive. This fascinating book explores those findings, and their implications for the sexual behaviour of our own species. It uses the Red Queen from  Alice in Wonderland   who has to run at full speed to stay where she is  as a metaphor for a whole range of sexual behaviours. The book was shortlisted for the 1994 Rhone-Poulenc Prize for Science Books.  Animals and plants evolved sex to fend off parasitic infection. Now look where it has got us.

Evelyn Nakano Glenn untangles this complex history in a unique comparative regional study from the end of Reconstruction to the eve of World War II. During this era the country experienced enormous social and economic changes with the abolition of slavery, rapid territorial expansion, and massive immigration, and struggled over the meaning of free labor and the essence of citizenship as people who previously had been excluded sought the promise of economic freedom and full political rights. After a lucid overview of the concepts of the free worker and the independent citizen at the national level, Glenn vividly details how race and gender issues framed the struggle over labor and citizenship rights at the local level between blacks and whites in the South, Mexicans and Anglos in the Southwest, and Asians and haoles (the white planter class) in Hawaii. She illuminates the complex interplay of local and national forces in American society and provides a dynamic view of how labor and citizenship were defined, enforced, and contested in a formative era for white-nonwhite relations in America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9SAsEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Divorce Recovery Handbook, The","description":"Anyone going through a divorce will tell you it's a crazy time.

Unlike any earlier films, Godard s work shifts fluidly from fiction to documentary, from criticism to art. The man himself also projects shifting images cultural hero, fierce loner, shrewd businessman. Hailed by filmmakers as a if not the key influence on cinema, Godard has entered the modern canon, a figure as mysterious as he is indispensable. In Everything Is Cinema, critic Richard Brody has amassed hundreds of interviews to demystify the elusive director and his work. Paying as much attention to Godard s technical inventions as to the political forces of the postwar world, Brody traces an arc from the director s early critical writing, through his popular success with Breathless, to the grand vision of his later years. He vividly depicts Godard s wealthy conservative family, his fluid politics, and his tumultuous dealings with women and fellow New Wave filmmakers.

One of the most distinguishing features of the program is the innovative way the show's writers play with language: fabricating new words, morphing existing ones, and throwing usage on its head. The result has been a strikingly resonant lexicon that reflects the power of both youth culture and television in the evolution of American slang. Using the show to illustrate how new slang is formed, transformed, and transmitted, Slayer Slang is one of those rare books that combines a serious explanation of a pop culture phenomena with an engrossing read for fans of the show, word geeks, and language professionals. Michael Adams begins his book with a synopsis of the program's history and a defense of ephemeral language. He then moves to the main body of the work: a detailed glossary of slayer slang, annotated with actual dialogue and recorded the style accepted by the American Dialect Society. The book concludes with a bibliography and a lengthy index, a guide to sources (novels based on the show, magazine articles about the show, and language culled from the official posting board) and an appendix of slang-making suffixes. Introduced by Jane Espenson, one of the show's most inventive writers (and herself a linguist), Slayer Slang offers a quintessential example of contemporary youth culture serving as a vehicle for slang. In the tradition of The Physics of Star Trek, Slayer Slang is one of those rare books that offers a serious examination a TV cult phenomenon appealing to fans and thinkers alike.

Her characters live vividly both in their own time, and in ours' MADELINE MILLER Mary Renault is a shining light to both historical novelists and their readers. She does not pretend the past is like the present, or that the people of ancient Greece were just like us. She shows us their strangeness; discerning, sure-footed, challenging our values, piquing our curiosity, she leads us through an alien landscape that moves and delights us' HILARY MANTEL In the story of the great lyric poet Simonides, Mary Renault brings alive a time in Greece when tyrants kept an unsteady rule and poetry, music, and royal patronage combined to produce a flowering of the arts. Born into a stern farming family on the island of Keos, Simonides escapes his harsh childhood through a lucky apprenticeship with a renowned Ionian singer. As they travel through 5th century B.C. Greece, Simonides learns not only how to play the kithara and compose poetry, but also how to navigate the shifting alliances surrounding his rich patrons. He is witness to the Persian invasion of Ionia, to the decadent reign of the Samian pirate king Polykrates, and to the fall of the Pisistratids in the Athenian court. Along the way, he encounters artists, statesmen, athletes, thinkers, and lovers, including the likes of Pythagoras and Aischylos. Using the singer's unique perspective, Renault combines her vibrant imagination and her formidable knowledge of history to establish a sweeping, resilient vision of a golden century. 'There's much to say about her interweaving of myth and history and, just as interestingly, there's much to wonder at in the way she fills in the large dark spaces where we know next to nothing about the times she describes . . . an important and wonderful writer . . . she set a course into serious-minded, psychologically intense historical fiction that today seems more important than ever' - Sam Jordison, Guardian","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LH_lCQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Praise+Singer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Natural Perfumes: Simple, Sensual, Personal Aromatherapy Recipes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Doll in the Window","description":"What is that in the upper window of the old man's house?

The important aspects of script writing are then addressed. She considers the many general questions which must be answered by the playwright: the type of puppet to be used, the audience, and availability of resources and facilities. Suggestions are then given for dramatizing original ideas and for adapting well-known stories. The chapter on plot development emphasizes the importance of perspective, transitional material and the need for action. One chapter proposes various ways to develop a character through dialogue, names, and behavior. Another chapter demonstrates how the use of rhyme can add interest and humor to a puppet play. Teachers will find suggestions on how to develop a play on a specific theme or about a specific character. Some attention is also given to the mechanics of writing a play. Includes a group of puppet plays which have been successfully performed by Seattle Puppetory Theatre. Among them are Rumplestiltskin, The Princess and the Pea, The Bad-Tempered Wife, The Golden Axe, The Swineherd, and The Fisherman and His Wife. Production notes follow each script.

Kiese Laymon, New York Times bestselling author of Heavy An award-winning journalist's behind-the-scenes account from the epicenter of sports, social justice, and coronavirus, Can't Knock the Hustle is a lasting chronicle of the historic 2019-2020 NBA season, by way of the notorious Brooklyn Nets and basketball's renaissance as a cultural force beyond the game. The Nets were already the most intriguing startup in the NBA: a team of influencers, entrepreneurs and activists, starring the controversial Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. But this dynasty-in-the-making got disrupted by the unforeseen. One tweet launched an international scandal, pitting the team's Chinese owner and the league's commissioner against its players and LeBron James. The sudden death of Kobe Bryant, after making his final public appearance in Brooklyn, sent shockwaves through a turbulent season. Then came the unimaginable. A global pandemic and a new civil-rights movement put basketball's trend-setting status to the ultimate test, as business and culture followed the lead of the NBA and its empowered stars. No team intersected with the extremes of 2020 quite like the Brooklyn Nets, and Matt Sullivan had a courtside view. Can't Knock the Hustle crosses from on the court, where underdogs confront A-listers like Jay-Z and James Harden, to off the court, as players march through the streets of Brooklyn, provoke Donald Trump at the White House, and boycott the NBA's bubble experiment in Disney World. Hundreds of interviews with Hall-of-Famers, All-Stars, executives, coaches and power-brokers across the world provide a backdrop of the NBA's impact on social media, race, politics, health, fashion, fame and fandom, for a portrait of a time when sports brought us back together again, like never before.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v9HvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex (User's Guides)","description":"Everything you always wanted to know about the more curious aspects of sex but were afraid to ask: the history of sex; sex and religion; sex and the law; sexual customs around the world; the biology of sex; the physiology of sex, anatomical curiosities; Gay and lesbian sex; sex and the animal kingdom; the great sex manuals; sex in literature, film and art; sex aids and toys; aphrodisiacs; masturbation; pornography; famous sexual athletes (and famous flops); the language of sex; kinks and fetishes; perversions; urban myths, tales of outrageous behaviour and a catalogue of bizarre facts and figures.

The authors describe and analyze the spiritual life of three ancient civilizations: the Egyptians, whose thinking was profoundly influenced by the daily rebirth of the sun and the annual rebirth of the Nile; the Mesopotamians, who believed the stars, moon, and stones were all citizens of a cosmic state; and the Hebrews, who transcended prevailing mythopoeic thought with their cosmogony of the will of God. In the concluding chapter the Frankforts show that the Greeks, with their intellectual courage, were the first culture to discover a realm of speculative thought in which myth was overcome.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tSECAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Debating Diversity: Clashing Perspectives on Race and Ethnicity in America","description":"In the nineteenth century Herman Melville wrote, \\"America was settled by peoples of all nations....You cannot spill a drop of American blood without spilling the blood of the whole world. We are not a narrow tribe.\\" At the beginning of the twenty-first century, America is more ethnically diverse than ever before. Will we fear this expanding diversity as the disuniting of America, or will we embrace a more inclusive re-definition of our national identity? As the nation's preeminent scholar of multicultural studies, Ronald Takaki invites us to address this question by \\"debating diversity.\\" The overarching theme of his new anthology is the clash of perspectives over the master narrative of American history--the powerful but mistaken story that this country was settled by European immigrants and that Americans are white. The collection opens with the lively intellectual exchange between Nathan Glazer and Ronald Takaki on ethnicity versus race; it then turns to the contrasting interpretations of the frontier by Frederick Jackson Turner and Takaki. Other debates include: Samuel P. Huntington and Elizabeth Martinez on the diversity of civilizations; Irving Kristol and William Julius Wilson on inner-city blacks; Robert J.

In a few years he led his army as far as the gates of Vienna, made himself master of the Mediterranean and established his court in Baghdad. Faced with this redoubtable champion, who regarded it as his duty to extend the boundaries of Islam farther and farther, the Christian world struggled to unite against him. 'The Shadow of God on Earth', but also an expert politician and all-powerful despot, Suleiman ruled the state firmly with the help of his viziers. He extended the borders of the empire beyond what any of the Ottoman sultans had achieved, yet it is primarily as a lawgiver that he is remembered in Turkish history. His empire held dominion over three continents populated by more than thirty million inhabitants, among whom nearly all of the races and religions of mankind were represented. Prospering under a well-directed, authoritarian economy, Suleiman's reign marked the apogee of Ottoman power. City and country alike experienced unprecedented economic and demographic growth. Istanbul was the largest city in the world, enjoying a remarkable renaissance of arts and letters; a mighty capital, it was the seat of the Seraglio and dark intrigue.

Charlaine Harris, author of Dead to the World, on Ghosts of Albion: Accursed Before you can save Albion, you must destroy the poison in its black heart. William and Tamara Swift s newfound sorcerous powers as Protectors of Albion pale before the demonic forces threatening Britannia. But William and Tamara have formidable allies in Lord Byron, Queen Bodicea, and Lord Admiral NelsonEngland s noble, notorious Ghosts of Albion. Responding to a plea from Cornwall, Tamara discovers that the rumors of young women, both human and fairy, vanishing without a trace are horribly true. Instead of hard clues, she uncovers only whispers of witches, infernal abductions, and a pyre of innocents planned for the solstice. Indeed, Tamara has never faced a more dangerous taskfor the legendary land of King Arthur s Camelot also harbors dark, bloody deeds and a waking evil. Soon nothing, not even mighty Albion, will be safe from the deadly peril.

His career as a film-maker began in the 1930s when he escaped the stifling culture of Fascist Italy to work with Jean Renoir in the France of the Popular Front. Back in his native country in the 40s he was one of the founders of the neo-realist movement. In 1954, with Senso, he turned his hand to a historical spectacular. The result was both glorious to look at and a profound reinterpretation of history. In Rocco and His Brothers (1960) he returned to his neo-realist roots and in The Leopard (1963), with Burt Lancaster, Claudia Cardinale and Alain Delon, he made the first truly international film. He scored a further success with Death in Venice (1971), a sensitive adaptation of Thomas Mann's story about a writer (in the film, a musician) whose world is devastated when he falls in love with a young boy. A similar homo-erotic theme haunts Ludwig (1973), a bio-pic about the King of Bavaria who prefers art to politics and the company of stableboys to the princess he is supposed to marry. Geoffrey Nowell-Smith's classic study of the director was first published in 1967 and revised in 1973. It is now updated to include the last three films that Visconti made before his death, together with some reflections on the 'auteur' theory of which the original edition was a key example.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N-XxDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taps and Sighs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oHWOzgEACAAJ&dq=Taps+and+Sighs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confiscated Conception","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gambito Turco (Spanish Edition)","description":"When a young student from a wealthy family unexpectedly commits suicide in the Alexander Gardens, Erast Fandorin of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Moscow Police to investigate the supposedly open-and-shut case and discovers that the student's suicide is not an isolated case.

He is rushed to a nearby hospital where he floats, comatose, between dreams, reliving the fairytales of his childhood and the secrets that made him run away in the first place. After the accident, Sam a thirteen-year old synesthete with an IQ of 144 and an appetite for science fiction waits by his father s bedside every day. There he meets Eddie Tomlin, a woman forced to confront her love for Henri after all these years, and twelve-year old Madelyn Zeidler, a coma patient like Henri and the sole survivor of a traffic accident that killed her family.

Gregory B. Lee suggests that the response can be seen in a proliferation of hybrid lyric forms and cultures--from both within China and beyond--and that China's \\"culture of lyricism\\" contributes in powerful, significant, and often resistant ways to the nation's sense of itself and its encounter with modernity. Lee's broad definition of lyric includes the work of poets, amateur versifiers, and all manner of popular songwriters, and his inclusive sense of nation refers to all Chinese communities regardless of geographic location. Whether examining the globalized consumption of satellite-broadcast pop music or the heroic efforts of little-known poets on the margins of the Chinese diaspora, he finds a questioning and contesting of both the Orientalist construction of a mythic monolithic China invented by the West and the Chinese obsession with ideas of authenticity and purity of nationhood. Lee explores the lyrical transgression of these ideological boundaries in China, in the Chinese communities of America and Britain, and in other marginalized communities, before using the examples of Hong Kong and other non-nationalistic sites to discuss the creative possibilities of hybrid cultures and societies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3ESfnUSmsuwC&dq=Troubadours,+Trumpeters,+Troubled+Makers:+Lyricism,+Nationalism,+and+Hybridity+in+China+and+Its+Others+(Asia-Pacific:+Culture,+Politics,+and+Society)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Week with no Friday","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Let's Go 2003: Israel","description":"A budget guide to the region describes the sights, nightlife, and food, and offers tips on saving money on travel and accommodations","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fGpie-adnd8C&dq=Let%27s+Go+2003:+Israel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Growing a Beautiful Garden: A Landscape Guide for the Coastal Carolinas","description":"Growing a Beautiful Garden is a full-color gardening guide for the unique growing conditions found along the North and South Carolina coasts.

With unique and rarely seen images, Karl Ludvigsen presents the dramatic story of these racers with their tubular space frames, inboard brakes and fuel-injected desmodromic-valved, eight-cylinder engines.

For leaders, emotional intelligence is almost 90 percent of what sets stars apart from the mediocre. As Goleman documents, it's the essential ingredient for reaching and staying at the top in any field, even in high-tech careers.

How do political ceremonies establish authority? Why does repetition characterize anthems and ritual speech? Why were circular forms favored for public festivals during the French Revolution? This book answers these questions using a single concept: common knowledge. Game theory shows that in order to coordinate its actions, a group of people must form \\"common knowledge.\\" Each person wants to participate only if others also participate. Members must have knowledge of each other, knowledge of that knowledge, knowledge of the knowledge of that knowledge, and so on. Michael Chwe applies this insight, with striking erudition, to analyze a range of rituals across history and cultures. He shows that public ceremonies are powerful not simply because they transmit meaning from a central source to each audience member but because they let audience members know what other members know. For instance, people watching the Super Bowl know that many others are seeing precisely what they see and that those people know in turn that many others are also watching. This creates common knowledge, and advertisers selling products that depend on consensus are willing to pay large sums to gain access to it. Remarkably, a great variety of rituals and ceremonies, such as formal inaugurations, work in much the same way. By using a rational-choice argument to explain diverse cultural practices, Chwe argues for a close reciprocal relationship between the perspectives of rationality and culture. He illustrates how game theory can be applied to an unexpectedly broad spectrum of problems, while showing in an admirably clear way what game theory might hold for scholars in the social sciences and humanities who are not yet acquainted with it. In a new afterword, Chwe delves into new applications of common knowledge, both in the real world and in experiments, and considers how generating common knowledge has become easier in the digital age.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cMUMPcDJiHkC&dq=Rational+Ritual:+Culture,+Coordination,+and+Common+Knowledge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Critical Meaning of the Bible","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Infrared System Engineering","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"AQUARIUS RISING THE ROCK FESTIVAL YEARS","description":"This book looks back at the days of the late 1960's and early 1970's when huge rock festivals were planned and held throughout the United States.

Bailey doesn't realize he is about to fulfil his tragic destiny when he walks into a US Army recruitment office. Secretive, damaged, innocent, trying to forget a past and looking for a future, Bobby is the perfect candidate for a secret US government experiment, an unholy continuation of a genetics program that was discovered in Nazi Germany nearly 20 years earlier in the waning days of World War II. Bailey's only ally and protector, Sergeant McFarland, intervenes, which sets off a chain of cascading events that spin out of everyone's control. As the monsters of the title multiply, becoming real and metaphorical, the story reaches a crescendo of moral reckoning. A 360-page tour de force of visual storytelling, Monsters' narrative canvas is copious: part familial drama, part thriller, part metaphysical journey, it is an intimate portrait of individuals struggling to reclaim their lives and an epic political odyssey that plays across two generations of American history. Monsters is rendered in Barry Windsor-Smith's impeccable pen-and-ink technique, the visual storytelling, with its sensitivity to gesture and composition, the most sophisticated of the artist's career. There are passages of heartbreaking tenderness, of excruciating pain, of redemption and sacrifice, and devastating violence.

The Turing Test is part of the vocabulary of popular culture it has appeared in works ranging from the Broadway play \\"Breaking the Code\\" to the comic strip \\"Robotman.\\" The writings collected by Stuart Shieber for this book examine the profound philosophical issues surrounding the Turing Test as a criterion for intelligence. Alan Turing's idea, originally expressed in a 1950 paper titled \\"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\\" and published in the journal Mind, proposed an \\"indistinguishability test\\" that compared artifact and person. Following Descartes's dictum that it is the ability to speak that distinguishes human from beast, Turing proposed to test whether machine and person were indistinguishable in regard to verbal ability. He was not, as is often assumed, answering the question \\"Can machines think?\\" but proposing a more concrete way to ask it. Turing's proposed thought experiment encapsulates the issues that the writings in The Turing Test define and discuss. The first section of the book contains writings by philosophical precursors, including Descartes, who first proposed the idea of indistinguishablity tests. The second section contains all of Turing's writings on the Turing Test, including not only the Mind paper but also less familiar ephemeral material. The final section opens with responses to Turing's paper published in Mind soon after it first appeared. The bulk of this section, however, consists of papers from a broad spectrum of scholars in the field that directly address the issue of the Turing Test as a test for intelligence. Contributors John R. Searle, Ned Block, Daniel C. Dennett, and Noam Chomsky (in a previously unpublished paper). Each chapter is introduced by background material that can also be read as a self-contained essay on the Turing Test","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LL9NEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Turing+Test+:+Verbal+Behavior+as+the+Hallmark+of+Intelligence+(Bradford+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cheapskate in the Kitchen","description":"Big Savings begin at home-- in your very own gourmet kitchen!

Yet one of the rationales supporting the deployment of UK forces in Iraq was the wish to export democracy to the Middle East. The Emperor would appear to have mislaid his clothes (see Gordon Graham's Case Against the Democratic State). Judging from the lack of ministerial resignations in the wake of the Butler enquiry, Britain is no longer a parliamentary democracy. The classical doctrine of joint and several ministerial responsibility is revealed to be a fiction, and Lord Hailsham's verdict of 'elective dictatorship' is a better assessment of the British constitution. By contrast unelected bodies like the BBC are now far more accountable for their actions. The reason of this paradox is the monopoly power of the ruling party, controlled by the Prime Minister. The UK political party started off as a loose association of like-minded MPs. However, in recent years the tail has been wagging the dog - politicians now have no alternative but to choose and then fall in line behind a strong leader with the charisma to win elections. This book examines the historical forces that gave rise to the modern political party and questions its role in the post-ideological age. If we all now share the liberal market consensus, then what is the function of the party? Parties in America are a lot weaker, so the book considers Graham Allen's argument to emulate the US system of checks and balances, but concludes that we would be better off reinterpreting our own constitution more literally. When the Chancellor really was a minister of the crown, every line of the budget was meticulously scrutinized. The key to the changes advocated in the book is the replacement of the Victorian ballot-box with a modern system of representation, based on the jury-selection principle.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=26a7BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Body Massage: A Hands-On Manual","description":"Provides step-by-step instructions for using massage to promote relaxation, relieve stress, and alleviate pain in different areas of the body","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S6jywAEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Body+Massage:+A+Hands-On+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The necessary angel;: Essays on reality and the imagination","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Someone Like You","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Alpha Man (Postcards From Europe) (Harlequin Presents)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"When a Woman Loves a Man: Poems","description":"These poems capture the romance, irony, and pathos of love; they movingly chronicle days in post-9/11 New York and bring a fresh perspective to an array of subjects -- from the Brooklyn Bridge to Gertrude Stein to Buddhism.

The ranks of the Union forces swelled by more than 100,000 of these men known to their friends as \\"loyalists\\" and to their enemies as \\"tories\\". They substantially strengthened the Union, weakened the Confederacy, and affected the outcome of the Civil War. Despite the assertions of southern governors that Lincoln would get no troops from the South to preserve the Union, every Confederate state except South Carolina provided at least a battalion of white troops for the Union Army. The role of black soldiers (including those from the South) continues to receive deserved attention. Curiously, little heed has been paid to the white southern supporters of the Union cause, and nothing has been published about the group as a whole. Relying almost entirely on primary sources, Current here opens the long-overdue investigation of these many Americans who, at great risk to themselves and their families, made a significant contribution to the Union's war effort. Current meticulously explores the history of the loyalists in each Confederate state during the war. Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia provided over 70 percent of the loyalist troops, but 10,000 from Arkansas, 7,000 from Louisiana, and thousands from North Carolina, Texas, and Alabama volunteered as well. The author weaves the separate state stories into an intriguing and detailed tapestry. The loyalists served in a variety of capacities--some performing mundane tasks, some fighting with valor. Whatever his individual role, each southerner joining the Unionconstituted a double loss to the Confederacy: a subtraction from its own ranks and an addition to the Union's. Undoubtedly, this played an important role in the Confederate defeat.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RIbFlZS5V6oC&dq=Lincoln%27s+Loyalists:+Union+Soldiers+from+the+Confederacy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Learned About Flying from That","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Eating Problems for Breakfast: A Simple, Creative Approach to Solving Any Problems","description":"The author applies his steady faith to the task of creative problem-solving, denying that simply becoming a believer makes problems disappear.

You will be introduced to Tantra as the essence of yogic practice and philosophy.

Generally known in the West as \\"the yoga of sex,\\" in this book, you will encounter a more integral form of Tantra. Some yogis call this ancient wisdom \\"the yoga of everything.\\" Because, Tantric yoga is about seeing and realizing that everything we do can become a sacred, spiritual act. This form of alchemical spirituality is insightfully and poetically articulated in this book by Ramesh Bjonnes, a popular yoga blogger, workshop leader and cofounder of the Prama Institute. \\"An insightful, balanced approach to the frequently misunderstood pursuit of spiritual growth and personal well-being.\\" --Kirkus Review \\"This book is a source that any person, lay or scholar, will benefit from reading, because here is a practitioner whose fine mind reaches into his heart, converging one into the other.

Practiced in many countries across Africa and Asia, this ritual is hotly debated. Supporters regard it as a central coming-of-age ritual that ensures chastity and promotes fertility. Human rights groups denounce the procedure as barbaric. It is estimated that between 100 million and 130 million girls and women today have undergone forms of this genital surgery. Female Circumcision gathers together African activists to examine the issue within its various cultural and historical contexts, the debates on circumcision regarding African refugee and immigrant populations in the United States, and the human rights efforts to eradicate the practice. This work brings African women's voices into the discussion, foregrounds indigenous processes of social and cultural change, and demonstrates the manifold linkages between respect for women's bodily integrity, the empowerment of women, and democratic modes of economic development. This volume does not focus narrowly on female circumcision as a set of ritualized surgeries sanctioned by society. Instead, the contributors explore a chain of connecting issues and processes through which the practice is being transformed in local and transnational contexts. The authors document shifts in local views to highlight processes of change and chronicle the efforts of diverse communities as agents in the process of cultural and social transformation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JO_SBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Collected Poems of Wendell Berry, 1957-1982","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vySpAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Collected+Poems+of+Wendell+Berry,+1957-1982&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Write Your Will In a Weekend (In a Weekend (Premier Press))","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6h4wAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heraldry Custom, Rules and Styles","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2OxtHAAACAAJ&dq=Heraldry+Custom,+Rules+and+Styles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La Fuerza de La Razon (Spanish Edition)","description":"BESTSELLER #1 DEL NEW YORK TIMES Mark R.

It also chronicles her life's work and records, in detail, the important lessons in international women's reproductive health that she learned while working in other countries and cultures. Individual stories about the lives of women in developing countries are told by the women themselves and by the author. These are stories of the neglect of women's health care needs and the illness and death that result. Most neglected are the darker-skinned women in developing countries. The author's experience in numerous developing countries documents racism by lighter-skinned people; an increased awareness of the neglect of women's health in developing countries; and the need to continue to address the challenges of population and environmental issues. The American public and US government leaders have not been adequately informed about or credited with the effective work in international women's health that Johns Hopkins University and other international agencies have provided through support from the United States Agency for International Development.

Reveals compelling new archaeological and genetic evidence for the engineered origins of the human species, first proposed by Zecharia Sitchin in The 12th Planet ? Shows how the Anunnaki created us using pieces of their own DNA, controlling our physical and mental capabilities by inactivating their more advanced DNA ? Identifies a recently discovered complex of sophisticated ruins in South Africa as the city of the Anunnaki leader Enki Scholars have long believed that the first civilization on Earth emerged in Sumer some 6,000 years ago. However, as Michael Tellinger reveals, the Sumerians and Egyptians inherited their knowledge from an earlier civilization that lived at the southern tip of Africa and began with the arrival of the Anunnaki more than 200,000 years ago. Sent to Earth in search of life-saving gold, these ancient Anunnaki astronauts from the planet Nibiru created the first humans as a slave race to mine gold--thus beginning our global traditions of gold obsession, slavery, and god as dominating master. Revealing new archaeological and genetic evidence in support of Zecharia Sitchin s revolutionary work with pre-biblical clay tablets, Tellinger shows how the Anunnaki created us using pieces of their own DNA, controlling our physical and mental capabilities by inactivating their more advanced DNA--which explains why less than 3 percent of our DNA is active. He identifies a recently discovered complex of sophisticated ruins in South Africa, complete with thousands of mines, as the city of Anunnaki leader Enki and explains their lost technologies that used the power of sound as a source of energy. Matching key mythologies of the world s religions to the Sumerian clay tablet stories on which they are based, he details the actual events behind these tales of direct physical interactions with  god,  concluding with the epic flood--a perennial theme of ancient myth--that wiped out the Anunnaki mining operations. Tellinger shows that, as humanity awakens to the truth about our origins, we can overcome our programmed animalistic and slave-like nature, tap in to our dormant Anunnaki DNA, and realize the longevity and intelligence of our creators as well as learn the difference between the gods of myth and the true loving God of our universe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=clkoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sailor Moon, Vol. 2","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JsXkxwEACAAJ&dq=Sailor+Moon,+Vol.+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Their Own Voices: A Century of Recorded Poetry","description":"Presenting a diverse cross-section of the 20th centurys best poets, this classic poetry anthology has now been revised with added essays and poems.

The detailed evidence assembled here shows that eighteenth-century Americans almost never invoked this principle. Although Thomas Jefferson and others retrospectively claimed that the First Amendment separated church and state, separation became part of American constitutional law only much later. Hamburger shows that separation became a constitutional freedom largely through fear and prejudice. Jefferson supported separation out of hostility to the Federalist clergy of New England. Nativist Protestants (ranging from nineteenth-century Know Nothings to twentieth-century members of the K.K.K.) adopted the principle of separation to restrict the role of Catholics in public life. Gradually, these Protestants were joined by theologically liberal, anti-Christian secularists, who hoped that separation would limit Christianity and all other distinct religions. Eventually, a wide range of men and women called for separation. Almost all of these Americans feared ecclesiastical authority, particularly that of the Catholic Church, and, in response to their fears, they increasingly perceived religious liberty to require a separation of church from state. American religious liberty was thus redefined and even transformed. In the process, the First Amendment was often used as an instrument of intolerance and discrimination.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q6Axd76IE1UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tight","description":"\\"When Olivia Brookes calls the police to report that her husband and children are missing, she believes she will never see them again.

In a work of pioneering scholarship, Patai weaves together Biblical stories, Talmudic lore, and Midrash literature to bring alive the world of these ancient mariners. As he did in his highly acclaimed book The Jewish Alchemists, Patai explores a subject that has never before been investigated by scholars. Based on nearly sixty years of research, beginning with study he undertook for his doctoral dissertation, The Children of Noah is literally Patai's first book and his last. It is a work of unsurpassed scholarship, but it is accessible to general readers as well as scholars. An abundance of evidence demonstrates the importance of the sea in the lives of Jews throughout early recorded history. Jews built ships, sailed them, fought wars in them, battled storms in them, and lost their lives to the sea. Patai begins with the story of the deluge that is found in Genesis and profiles Noah, the father of all shipbuilders and seafarers. The sea, according to Patai's interpretation, can be seen as an image of the manifestation of God's power, and he reflects on its role in legends and tales of early times. The practical importance of the sea also led to the development of practical institutions, and Patai shows how Jewish seafaring had its own culture and how it influenced the cultures of Mediterranean life as well. Of course, Jewish sailors were subject to the same rabbinical laws as Jews who never set sail, and Patai describes how they went to extreme lengths to remain in adherence, even getting special emendations of laws to allow them to tie knots and adjust rigging on the Sabbath. The Children of Noah is a capstone to an extraordinary career. Patai was both a careful scholar and a gifted storyteller, and this work is at once a vivid history of a neglected aspect of Jewish culture and a treasure trove of sources for further study. It is a stimulating and delightful book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vcQIEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stories and Poems from Kipling","description":"'Hear and attend and listen...' Rudyard Kipling is a supreme master of the short story in English and a poet of brilliant gifts. His energy and inventiveness poured themselves into every kind of tale, from the bleakest of fables to the richest of comedies, and he illuminated every aspect of human behaviour, of which he was a fascinated (and sometimes appalled) observer. This generous selection of stories and poems, first published in the acclaimed Oxford Authors series, covers the full range of Kipling's career from the youthful volumes that brought him fame as the chronicler of British India, to the bittersweet fruits of age and bereavement in the aftermath of the First World War. It includes stories such as 'The Man who would be King', 'Mrs Bathurst', and 'Mary Postgate', and poems from Barrack-Room Ballads and other collections. In his introduction and notes Daniel Karlin addresses the controversial political engagement of Kipling's art, and the sources of its imaginative power. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qaI1CgAAQBAJ&dq=Stories+and+Poems+from+Kipling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fractured Crystals","description":"Fury Falls Inn in 1821 Alabama.

Since the 1980s, the Thakali of Nepal have searched for an identity and a clarification of their \\"true\\" culture and history in the wake of their rise to political power and achievement of economic success. Although united in this search, the Thakali are divided as to the answers that have been proposed: the \\"Hinduization\\" of religious practices, the promotion of Tibetan Buddhism, the revival of practices associated with the Thakali shamans, and secularization. Ironically, the attempts by the Thakali to define their identity reveal that to return to tradition they must first re-create it but this process of re-creation establishes it in a way in which it has never existed. To return to \\"tradition\\" to become Thakali again is, in a way, to become Thakali for the very first time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=34OHk4KOiSkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GURPS Cabal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xEEBAAAACAAJ&dq=GURPS+Cabal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Left Leg: A Leonidas Witherall Mystery,1988 Paperback","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Great Church in Captivity : A Study of the Patriarchate of Constantinople from the Eve of the Turkish Conquest to the Greek War of Independence","description":"This is Sir Steven Runciman's established and widely admired classic account of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, first published in 1968.

In the first major book on this influential artist, Hayden Herrera brings new insight to Snyder's mixed-medium works and their combination of female imagery, dynamic brush strokes, and accomplished formalism. Through rich illustrations and illuminating text, Joan Snyder details the complex evolution of the artist's works, from her evocative brush strokes in Symphony and Summer Orange, which drip with 'rivulets of feeling,' to her slow progression toward the formal structures of grid landscapes like Symphony III, to her bold historical and political works like Women In Camps. Since the 1980s, Snyder's paintings have taken on an autobiographical and often deeply personal tone, as expressed in Love's Pale Graves. Her latest paintings, such as the majestic Women Make Lists, represent a culmination of the grief, jubilation, and, finally, transcendence that reside in the heart of Snyder's work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nWClswEACAAJ&dq=Joan+Snyder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The PN Junction Diode: Volume II (2nd Edition) (Modular Series on Solid State Dev., Vol 2)","description":"This text builds a firm foundation in PN junction theory from a conceptual and mathematical viewpoint.

However, the impossibility and impracticality of completely watertight arguments make it possible for errors to slip by the most watchful eye. They are often subtle and difficult of detection. When found, they can teach us a lot and can present a real challenge to straighten out. Presenting students with faulty arguments to troubleshoot can be an effective way of helping them critically understand material, and it is for this reason that I began to compile fallacies and publish them first in the Notes of the Canadian Mathematical Society and later in the College Mathematics Journal in the Fallacies, Flaws and Flimflam section. I hoped to challenge and amuse readers as well as to provide them with material suitable for teaching and student assignments. This book collects the items from the first eleven years of publishing in the CMJ. One source of such errors is the work of students. Occasionally, a text book will weigh in with a specious result or solution. Nonprofessional sources, such as newspapers, are responsible for a goodly number of mishaps, particularly in arithmetic (especially percentages) and probability; their use in classrooms may help students become critical readers and listeners of the media. Quite a few items come from professional mathematicians. The reader will find in this book some items that are not erroneous but seem to be. These need a fuller analysis to clarify the situation. All the items are presented for your entertainment and use. The mathematical topics covered include algebra, trigonometry, geometry, probability, calculus, linear algebra, and modern algebra.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G947nAecRaQC&dq=Mathematical+Fallacies,+Flaws+and+Flimflam+(Spectrum)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The tangled web","description":"Modern web applications are built on a tangle of technologies that have been developed over time and then haphazardly pieced together. Every piece of the web application stack, from HTTP requests to browser-side scripts, comes with important yet subtle security consequences. To keep users safe, it is essential for developers to confidently navigate this landscape. In The Tangled Web, Michal Zalewski, one of the world s top browser security experts, offers a compelling narrative that explains exactly how browsers work and why they re fundamentally insecure. Rather than dispense simplistic advice on vulnerabilities, Zalewski examines the entire browser security model, revealing weak points and providing crucial information for shoring up web application security. You ll learn how to: Perform common but surprisingly complex tasks such as URL parsing and HTML sanitization Use modern security features like Strict Transport Security, Content Security Policy, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Leverage many variants of the same-origin policy to safely compartmentalize complex web applications and protect user credentials in case of XSS bugs Build mashups and embed gadgets without getting stung by the tricky frame navigation policy Embed or host user-supplied content without running into the trap of content sniffing For quick reference, \\"Security Engineering Cheat Sheets\\" at the end of each chapter offer ready solutions to problems you re most likely to encounter.

The novels of Henry Fielding and Henry James may be instructive in the art of moral living. Some go further and argue that Emile Zola and Harriet Beecher Stowe played a part in ameliorating the lives of those existing in harsh circumstances. However, as Derek Attridge argues in this outstanding and acclaimed book, none of these capacities is distinctive of literature. What is the singularity of literature? Do the terms \\"literature\\" and \\"the literary\\" refer to actual entities found in cultures at certain times, or are they merely expressions characteristic of such cultures? Attridge argues that this resistance to definition and reduction is not a dead end, but a crucial starting point from which to explore anew the power and practices of Western art. Derek Attridge provides a rich new vocabulary for literature, rethinking such terms as \\"invention,\\" \\"singularity,\\" \\"otherness,\\" \\"alterity,\\" \\"performance\\" and \\"form.\\" He returns literature to the realm of ethics, and argues for the ethical importance of literature, demonstrating how a new understanding of the literary might be put to work in a \\"responsible,\\" creative mode of reading. The Singularity of Literature is not only a major contribution to the theory of literature, but also a celebration of the extraordinary pleasure of the literary, for reader, writer, student or critic. This Routledge Classics edition includes a new preface by the author.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BTUlDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Singularity+of+Literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jesus for a New Generation: Putting the Gospel in the Language of Xers","description":"What does the gospel look like through RayBans?Born in the 1960s and 1970s, today's generation of young men and women is in crisis. Many grew up in broken homes. They face skyrocketing college costs and the prospect of underemployment--not un employment--after college. They have never known a time not plagued by ethnic strife, rampant crime and public scandal. Generation X has been bred on skepticism and cynicism. That's why it's difficult to reach them with gospel. But Kevin Graham Ford, born in 1965, refuses to give up on his peers. Instead, in this often gripping book, he offers some of the most innovative and pracitcal guidance available on introducing a new generation to Jesus.Touching on postmodernism, narrative evangelsim, life in cyberspace and a host of other timely topics, Ford's book will be welcomed by evangelists, pastors, campus fellowship workers, seminary students--all who teach, minister and live among Generation X.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H5QdP5p5xI8C&dq=Jesus+for+a+New+Generation:+Putting+the+Gospel+in+the+Language+of+Xers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lost Tribe: A Harrowing Passage into New Guinea's Heart of Darkness","description":"Two years before this story begins, the Liawep were living deep in the jungle of Papua, New Guinea, long forgotten by the outside world. Numbering seventy-nine men, women, and children, the tribe worshipped a mountain, dressed in leaves, and hid when planes flew overhead, believing them to be evil sanguma birds. Their discovery by a missionary hit the headlines in 1993. Galvanized by the reports of people living in Stone Age conditions, Edward Marriott set out to find the Liawep. Banned from visiting the tribe by the New Guinea government, he assembled his own ragtag patrol and ventured illegally into the wilderness in search of his quarry. Nothing could have prepared him for what he found or for the dramatic events that followed. A thrilling, superbly written adventure, The Lost Tribe is a memorable account of what happens when good intentions go awry, when rational man meets primal beliefs, and when a small, primitive people are ensnared by the predations of civilization.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gR4lCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1998 U.S. First Day Cover Catalogue & Checklist (Annual)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"An American Tragedy","description":"The author's classic vision of the dark side of American life looks at the failings of the American dream, in the story of the rise and fall of Clyde Griffiths, who sacrifices everything in his desperate quest for success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=STXxjgEACAAJ&dq=An+American+Tragedy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"RARAMURI SOULS (Smithsonian Series in Ethnographic Inquiry)","description":"In his sensitive portrayal of the Raramuri (or Tarahumara) Indians, Merrill examines the ways in which a society, lacking formal educational institutions, produces and transmits its basic knowledge about the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DvsVAQAAMAAJ&dq=RARAMURI+SOULS+(Smithsonian+Series+in+Ethnographic+Inquiry)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Et-Human Link","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Chief!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sailor Moon, Vol. 3","description":"Sailor Moon continues to fight evil and enforce justice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sl-mKQEACAAJ&dq=Sailor+Moon,+Vol.+3&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baskets in Miniature","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jkMaygAACAAJ&dq=Baskets+in+Miniature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mightier Than the Sword: Powerful Writing in the Legal Profession/Legal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WAM7AQAAIAAJ&dq=Mightier+Than+the+Sword:+Powerful+Writing+in+the+Legal+Profession/Legal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Your Child's Medical Journal; Keeping Track of Your Child's Personal Health History for Conception Through Adulthood","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Embracing Your Inner Critic: Turning Self-Criticism into a Creative Asset","description":"Hal and Sidra Stone are the creators of \\"Voice Dialogue\\" process, a therapy that transforms the inner critic from crippling adversary to productive ally.

Now a mysterious wizard seeks to awaken the mad Tharn and unleash his terrifying power into the world. If he succeeds, the god s insane fury could rip apart the fabric of existence and give the diabolical magician what he seeks most of all: the scepter of domination over the forces of chaos. Only the young scholar Calandryll has the knowledge and skill to stop the evil wizard s plan. Accompanied by a cynical mercenary, protected by an enigmatic magic, he must journey across a war-torn countryside, facing terror and treachery both real and magical, to find the ancient book whose incantations can bring the evil god back to life   and destroy it forever.

It shows how these two remarkable emperors were chiefly responsible for the Empire surviving and emerging largely intact from a period of intense crisis. It was Aurelian who first united the breakaway regions, including Zenobia?s Palmyra, and it was Probus who then secured his achievements. The reigns of Aurelian and Probus have been subjected to many studies, but none of these have approached the extant material purely from the point of view of military analysis. Most importantly, the previous historians have not exploited the analytical opportunities provided by the military treatises that describe the strategy and tactics of the period Roman army. It is thanks to this new methodology that Ilkka Syv?nne has been able to reconstruct the military campaigns of these two soldier emperors and their other contemporaries in far greater detail than has been possible before.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8nD1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Noble Traveller","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"It's Easy to Play Beatles","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Combinatorics: Set Systems, Hypergraphs, Families of Vectors and Combinatorial Probability","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"All together now: The first complete Beatles discography, 1961-1975","description":"Details chronologically all records with which the Beatles were associated, collectively or individually, as performers, composers, or producers and lists all their albums and single records","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YzU5AQAAIAAJ&dq=All+together+now:+The+first+complete+Beatles+discography,+1961-1975&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Film Fatales: Women in Espionage Films and Television, 1963-1973","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lonely on the Mountain (The Sacketts)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Kalevipoeg (Estonian Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blue Guide Southern Italy: South of Rome to Calabria (8th ed)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Slow Down: Five-Minute Meditations to de-Stress Your Days","description":"In today's fast-paced, work-driven, never-slow-down world, there often just isn't any time to de-stress, much less devote any time at all to spiritual development.

The most devastating weapons will be those that target an enemy's infrastructure - air-control systems, electrical grids, and communication networks, to name just a few potential targets. By hacking into computer systems, the United States could override programmed commands and thus shut down air traffic control systems, and open floodgates and bridges. Misinformation could even be broadcast, for example, by using imaging technology to simulate a television appearance by an enemy nation's leaders. This type of combat puts civilians at more risk than ever, as financial, communications, transportation, and other infrastructure systems become prime military targets.

An Unperceived Revolution: Cracking the Code of the Ultimate Enigma. [Primers for the Age of Inner Space, VI].","description":"Official U.S. edition with full color illustrations throughout. NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Yuval Noah Harari, author of the critically-acclaimed New York Times bestseller and international phenomenon Sapiens, returns with an equally original, compelling, and provocative book, turning his focus toward humanity s future, and our quest to upgrade humans into gods. Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style thorough, yet riveting famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda. What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus. With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller, Harari maps out our future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H2t_CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"20.

Fifteenth-century France, the French Revolution, and contemporary Britain all come together in this sharp-eyed novel of political expediency and intrigue. Quentin Durward is a young adventurer and soldier of the Scottish guards seeking fame and fortune in the France of Louis XI (1461-1483). Embarking upon a dangerous journey through the forest of the Ardennes seeking a name, a partner (there is a romance involving his love for Isabelle, Countess of Croye), and a position in the world, he knows little and understands less, but Scott represents his ignorance and naivete as useful to \\"the most sagacious prince in Europe\\" who needs servants motivated solely by the desire for coin and credit and lacking any interest in France, which would interfere with the execution of his political aims. Meanwhile, the Machiavellian King Louis XI of France, maneuvers his realm out of the hands of feudal barons and into centralized control -- which Scott believed to characterize the modern state. In Quentin Durward Scott studies the first modern state in the process of destroying the European feudal system at a time when the feudal system, which had been the sinews and nerves of national defense, and the spirit of chivalry, by which, began to be innovated upon and abandoned by those grosser characters, who centered their happiness in materialism. The reception accorded Quentin Durward astounded Scott, his friends and his publishers. France, Germany and Italy went mad over him, realizing then, as now, that this miracle worker had given to European literature an unsurpassed picture of Louis XI and his age. His fame, the world over, was thenceforth permanently fixed. It was cheering news for Scott. - Publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x9OIvgEACAAJ&dq=Quentin+Durward+(Waverly+novels)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Location, Location, Location: How to Select the Best Site for Your Business (PSI Successful Business Library)","description":"\\"Location is the most important ingredient for success for any business that depends on customers finding it.

On February 13, 1991, at the age of seventy-four, Kirk Douglas, star of such major motion-picture classics as Champion, Spartacus, and Paths of Glory, was in a helicopter crash, in which two people died and he himself sustained severe back injuries. As he lay in the hospital recovering, he kept wondering: Why had two younger men died while he, who had already lived his life fully, survived? The question drove this son of a Russian-Jewish ragman to a search for his roots and on a long journey of self-discovery -- a quest not only for the meaning of life and his own relationship with God, but for his own identity as a Jew. Through the study of the Bible, Kirk Douglas found a new spirituality and purpose. His newfound faith deeply enriched his relationship with his own children and taught him -- a man who had always been famously demanding and impatient -- to listen to others and, above all, to hear his own inner voice. Told with warmth, wit, much humor, and deep passion, Climbing the Mountain is inspirational in the very best sense of the word.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=auKQ2xVBVSQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nclex 2000: Review Software for Nclex-Rn","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Churches of Rome","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hip Hop Divas","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Take Control of Your Game","description":"Describes a four week program to conquer video addiction by replacing screen time with constructive activities","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NxtFAAAAYAAJ&dq=Take+Control+of+Your+Game&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prayers for People Under Pressure","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Olinda's Dream","description":"One part of the book covers the highlight history of the Middle East mainly from 1860 to the present time.

In many areas of the country, marijuana production or sale is the largest moneymaker by far. In Florida, for ex ample, it ranks ahead of every business except tourism. It is also a widely misunderstood substance. An en tire generation of Americans grew up believing that marijuana was virtually risk-free. This belief persists, despite growing evidence of physical, psychological, and social harm that is caused by the drug. The worst victims of this misinformation are young people. They, of all groups, are the least equipped to uncover and objectively evaluate the evidence regarding marijuana. At the same time, they are the most at risk for long-term problems resulting from marijuana use. v PREFACE vi As physicians we must make every effort to guide young people away from this drug. There are very significant dangers in young people experimenting with marijuana. The drug detoxification center at our hospital-and centers throughout the country-are packed with middle-class young people who started out smoking pot. None of them intended to become addicted, but the fact is that young people are more vulnerable to the influence of the drugs and become dependent easily.

GIS technology is used to identify the optimal routes for emergency vehicles, to determine the best locations for various businesses, schools, and facilities, to monitor the growth and expansion of urban areas as a way to manage natural resources, and much more. Principles of Geographic Information Systems by John Jensen and Ryan Jensen is an ideal introduction for those who know very little about geographic information systems and spatial analysis. Relatively complex GIS principles are introduced in basic terms, often using graphics to communicate principles rather than complex mathematical equations. Content is not geared toward any single commercial GIS software program, and the book's timely, practical examples and extensive visual format appeal to today's students. This text can be used at the undergraduate or graduate level in one or two semester courses in Introductory and Intermediate GIS, yet can also be useful for professionals looking to increase their knowledge in this subject area.

What is space? Are time machines physically possible? What is quantum mechanical reality like? Are there many universes? Is there a  true  geometry of the universe? Why does there appear to be an arrow of time? Do humans play a special role in the world? In this unique introductory book, Dean Rickles guides the reader through these and other core questions that keep philosophers of physics up at night. He discusses the three pillars of modern physics (quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and the theories of relativity), in addition to more cutting-edge themes such as econophysics, quantum gravity, quantum computers, and gauge theories. The book s approach is based on the idea that philosophy of physics is a kind of  interpretation game  in which we try to map physical theories onto our world. But the rules of this game often lead to a multiplicity of possible victors: rarely do we encounter a simple answer. The Philosophy of Physics offers a highly accessible introduction to the latest developments in this exciting field. Written in a lively style, with many visual examples, it will appeal to beginner-level students in both physics and philosophy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O6bIDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Burlington Zephyrs Photo Archive: America's Distinctive Trains","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Visual Developer Building NT 4 Web Servers, 2nd Edition: Support the Web and Corporate Intranets with Windows NT 4's New Features","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Evidence of Blood","description":"A murder from the past - but the story lives on . . .","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mDiPPwAACAAJ&dq=Evidence+of+Blood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At the Foot of the Story Tree: An Inquiry Into the Fiction of Peter Straub","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The structure and distribution of coral reefs,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Living happily ever after : couples talk about lasting love","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Beautiful Losers","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cover of Darkness","description":"It is hot and dry--the middle of a heat wave.

For Daisaku Ikeda, whose words these are, education has long been one of the fundamental priorities of his work and teaching. His emphasis on the intellectual legacy bequeathed to humanity by the great teachers of civilization is in this volume encapsulated by the notion of a 'new humanism': a significant residue ofwisdom that in the right circumstances may be passed on to future generations, expanding horizons, making connections between different cultures and encouraging fresh insights and new discoveries across the globe. These circumstances are perhaps most fully realised in the context of universities. In promoting his core values of education and peace, the author has delivered lectures and speeches at more than twenty-five academies, colleges and research institutes worldwide. This stimulating collection, which includes the author's most recent lectures, ranges widely across topics as diverse as art, religion, culture and time, and draws creatively on the sages of ancient India, China and Japan as well as on visionary thinkers from every nation, including Tolstoy, Victor Hugo and Gandhi.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=17aKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Travolta: The Life","description":"No Hollywood star has risen so brightly, after so big a fall, as the man who returned from a decade in straight-to-video Hell to reclaim adultation as a lovable hit man in Pulp Fiction. At the time, Travolta never really did go away. His white-suited finger-pointing disco stud in Saturday Night Fever became a part of the West's mythic landscape - a pop culture Statue of Liberty - as surely a Grease, Urban Cowboy and Staying Alive cemented his status as an idol of the Me generation- a sensitive soul in a streamlined body, lashed on by the call of self-fulfilment. He then obeyed that call in his own life. After being all things to all audiences in the late 70s and early 80s, Travolta spent his years of movie oblivion becoming all things to himself. His bizarre receptiveness of spirit turned sudden fads - flying, Scientology, food, fatherhood - into near-mystical obsessions. And those obsessions nourished the new, improved Actor Travolta who returned in Pulp Fiction, Phenomenon and Primary Colors. Nigel Andrew wittily scans the mother-dominated childhood in New Jersey; the years of life-endangering fan assault; the refuge in Scientology; the night his pilot exploits brought three major airports to a standstill; and, with unique insights and revelations from film-makers who have worked with him, the 'comeback' years of high achievement as an actor. Travolta is the Peter Pan of modern cinema. He flies; he fights for good against evil; and more dramatically than any actor before, he has been to Neverneverland and returned to tell the tale.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KQ24wAEACAAJ&dq=Travolta:+The+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing the Research Paper: A Handbook (with Revised MLA and InfoTrac)","description":"A truly portable reference guide, offering coverage of all of the topics that you would expect to find in a bigger and more expensive handbook.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xvo-y7OjSzwC&dq=Writing+the+Research+Paper:+A+Handbook+(with+Revised+MLA+and+InfoTrac)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visions of Heaven and Hell","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hen, a Chick, and a String Guitar","description":"A cumulative tale from Chile that begins with a hen and ends with sixteen different animals and a guitar.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ampVPgAACAAJ&dq=Hen,+a+Chick,+and+a+String+Guitar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare Volume 1 (Handbooks in Economics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"You Can Write and Publish a Book: Essential Information on How to Get Your Book Published","description":"You Can Write and Publish a Book: Essential Information on How to Get Your Book Published details the exact steps that you will need to take you from choosing a topic to the published book.

It is neither democratic nor authoritarian, with rights and capabilities depending primarily on ethnic origin and geographic location. In Ethnocracy: Land and Identity Politics in Israel/Palestine, he presents a new critical theory and comparative framework to account for the political geography of ethnocratic societies. According to Yiftachel, the primary manifestation of ethnocracy in Israel/Palestine has been a concerted strategy by the state of \\"Judaization.\\" Yiftachel's book argues that ethnic relations both between Jews and Palestinians, and among ethno-classes within each nation have been shaped by the diverse aspects of the Judaization project and by resistance to that dynamic. Special place is devoted to the analysis of ethnically mixed cities and to the impact of Jewish immigration and settlement on collective identities. Tracing the dynamics of territorial and ethnic conflicts between Jews and Palestinians, Yiftachel examines the consequences of settlement, land, development, and planning policies. He assesses Israel's recent partial liberalization and the emergence of what he deems a \\"creeping apartheid\\" whereby increasingly impregnable ethnic, geographic, and economic barriers develop between groups vying for recognition, power, and resources. The book ends with an exploration of future scenarios, including the introduction of new agendas, such as binationalism and multiculturalism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W510BAAAQBAJ&dq=Ethnocracy:+Land+and+Identity+Politics+in+Israel/Palestine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tropic of Creation","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Monet: Catalogue Raisonne","description":"This book contains 81 paintings from the 40 years Monet spend at his country home in Giverny, accompanied by a narrative on Monet's life, loves, and influences.

Chartres alone, of all the great medieval churches, has survived into the 20th century almost intact, not only architecturally but with its vast inconographic program in 12th-and 13th-century stained glass and sculpture. Medieval art was intended not just to embellish the church but to instruct the people, for there was no printing. Scholars could therefore teach their students, the clergy preach sermons and parents read the lives of the saints to their children using the 'texts' in stained glass and sculpture. The sister churches of Chartres have been sadly vandalized to varying degrees by Reform, revolution, war or natural disaster. Here in Chartres the 'text' is virtually complete. A concise glossary of symbolic images has been included as well as a complete plan of all the windows in the cathedral, and an index.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KFzqAAAAMAAJ&dq=Chartres+Cathedral&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harrowgate","description":"A chance encounter with dead blonde beauty Ashley Herrin leads an artist to paint the entrance to Hell and then follow Ashley on a dark journey.

Langer, our age clings to the stable relics of faded eras, as if ideas like natural innocence, innate dignity, the inviolable spirit, and the triumph of art over reality were immured in some kind of immortal shrine, immune to the ravages of history and time. But these ideas have been ravaged, and in Admitting the Holocaust. Langer presents a series of essays that represent his effort, over nearly a decade, to wrestle with this rupture in human values--and to see the Holocaust as it really was. His vision is necessarily dark, but he does not see the Holocaust as a warrant for futility, or as a witness to the death of hope. It is a summons to reconsider our values and rethink what it means to be a human being. These penetrating and often gripping essays cover a wide range of issues, from the Holocaust's relation to time and memory, to its portrayal in literature, to its use and abuse by culture, to its role in reshaping our sense of history's legacy. In many, Langer examines the ways in which accounts of the Holocaust--in history, literature, film, and theology--have extended, and sometimes limited, our insight into an event that is often said to defy understanding itself. He singles out Cynthia Ozick as one of the few American writers who can meet the challenge of imagining mass murder without flinching and who can distinguish between myth and truth. On the other hand, he finds Bernard Malamud's literary treatment of the Holocaust never entirely successful (it seems to have been a threat to Malamud's vision of man's basic dignity) and he argues that William Styron's portrayal of the commandant of Auschwitz in Sophie's Choice pushed Nazi violence to the periphery of the novel, where it disturbed neither the author nor his readers. He is especially acute in his discussion of the language used to describe the Holocaust, arguing that much of it is used to console rather than to confront. He notes that when we speak of the survivor instead of the victim, of martyrdom instead of murder, regard being gassed as dying with dignity, or evoke the redemptive rather than grevious power of memory, we draw on an arsenal of words that tends to build verbal fences between what we are mentally willing--or able--to face and the harrowing reality of the camps and ghettos. A respected Holocaust scholar and author of Holocaust Testimonies: The Ruins of Memory, winner of the 1991 National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism, Langer offers a view of this catastrophe that is candid and disturbing, and yet hopeful in its belief that the testimony of witnesses--in diaries, journals, memoirs, and on videotape--and the unflinching imagination of literary artists can still offer us access to one of the darkest episodes in the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TXqufnk9EMUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Sense Out of Suffering","description":"Peter Kreeft observes that our world is full of billions of normal lives which have touched by apparently pointless and random suffering.

This \\"standard formula\\" works for some people but leaves most of us feeling disengaged and frustrated. As much as we might dislike the standard formula, it seems like there's no other practical path to financial security and a fulfilling life. But what if there is? In the Dark Horse Project at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, bestselling author and acclaimed thought leader Todd Rose and neuroscientist Ogi Ogas studied women and men who achieved impressive success even though nobody saw them coming. Dark horses blaze their own trail to a life of happiness and prosperity. Yet what is so remarkable is that hidden inside their seemingly one-of-a-kind journeys are practical principles for achieving success that work for anyone, no matter who you are or what you hope to achieve. This mold-breaking approach doesn't depend on you SAT scores, who you know, or how much money you have. The secret is a mindset that can be expressed in plain English: Harness your individuality in the pursuit of fulfillment to achieve excellence. In Dark Horse, Rose and Ogas show how the four elements of the dark horse mindset empower you to consistently make the right choices that fit your unique interests, abilities, and circumstances and will guide you to a life of passion, purpose, and achievement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LbZFDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Higher Education","description":"What's gone wrong at our colleges and universities and how to get American higher education back on track A quarter of a million dollars.

Renowned sociologist Andrew Hacker and New York Times writer Claudia Dreifus make an incisive case that the American way of higher education, now a $420 billion-per-year business, has lost sight of its primary mission: the education of young adults. Going behind the myths and mantras, they probe the true performance of the Ivy League, the baleful influence of tenure, an unhealthy reliance on part-time teachers, and the supersized bureaucracies which now have a life of their own. As Hacker and Dreifus call for a thorough overhaul of a self-indulgent system, they take readers on a road trip from Princeton to Evergreen State to Florida Gulf Coast University, revealing those faculties and institutions that are getting it right and proving that teaching and learning can be achieved and at a much more reasonable price.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gAX7swEACAAJ&dq=Higher+Education&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Priceless Florida: Natural Ecosystems and Native Species","description":"Ellie Whitney grew up in New York City, was educated at Harvard and Washington universities, and has lived in Tallahassee since 1970.

There s nothing left for Adelia Cunnane in Ireland. The aunt she cared for has passed, and the family farm has been sold for taxes. But her uncle Paddy has written her: Come to America... The Maryland horse farm where Paddy lives and works is more than Dee dared to dream about. She has always had a magical touch with animals, and her she finds employment in the stables and a chance to fly, on the muscular back of Travis Grant s chestnut Thoroughbred. It s easy to put aside a passing pang of homesickness when she can spend her first paycheck which feels like a veritable fortune on the feminine frivolities that were never a part of her life in the old country. But the most unfamiliar territory of all is her relationship with her boss, the man who has made all this possible. Spirited but innocent, Dee is disconcerted by the way he treats her and the way she responds. America may be the land of opportunity, a place where even those from the humblest background can pursue what they want and, perhaps, even find themselves one day attending the Kentucky Derby.

From his early career as a printer and journalist to his scientific work and his role as a founder of a new republic, Benjamin Franklin has always seemed the inevitable embodiment of American ingenuity. But in his youth he had to make his way through a harsh colonial world, where he fought many battles with his rivals, but also with his wayward emotions. Taking Franklin to the age of forty-one, when he made his first electrical discoveries, Bunker goes behind the legend to reveal the sources of his passion for knowledge. Always trying to balance virtue against ambition, Franklin emerges as a brilliant but flawed human being, made from the conflicts of an age of slavery as well as reason. With archival material from both sides of the Atlantic, we see Franklin in Boston, London, and Philadelphia as he develops his formula for greatness. A tale of science, politics, war, and religion, this is also a story about Franklin's forebears: the talented family of English craftsmen who produced America's favorite genius.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KranDwAAQBAJ&dq=Poor+Richard+(A+Biography+of+Benjamin+Franklin+for+Young+Adults)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ford Ranchero: 1957-1979 Photo History","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Visual Developer Creating Visual Basic 5 Add-Ins: Extending the Power of Visual Basic 5","description":"How To Build A Successful International Web Site provides the information you need to go multilingual.

But they encounter obstacles that prevent them from following the path seriously, and especially from persevering on it. Time for God was written with these desires and difficulties in mind. In Time for God, author Jacques Philippe mainly concentrates on mental prayer: prayer that consists of facing God in solitude and silence for a time in order to enter into intimate, loving communion with him. Practicing this kind of prayer regularly is considered by all spiritual masters to be an indispensable path that gives access to genuine Christian life a path to knowing and loving God that empowers us to respond to his call to holiness addressed to each individual. Philippe draws on years of experience as a spiritual guide to illuminate the fundamental principles of mental prayer and describes some common mistakes and misconceptions that can lead it astray. With simplicity and clarity he explains the foundational principles for a healthy prayer life and gives advice for overcoming the various obstacles that arise when one sets off on the path of interior prayer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Dg4vx9P7fpMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Stone of the Heart","description":"'But I, being poor, have only my dreams; / I have spread my dreams under your feet...'

Rothko also wrote a number of essays and critical reviews during his lifetime, adding his thoughtful, intelligent, and opinionated voice to the debates of the contemporary art world. Although the artist never published a book of his varied and complex views, his heirs indicate that he occasionally spoke of the existence of such a manuscript to friends and colleagues. Stored in a New York City warehouse since the artist s death more than thirty years ago, this extraordinary manuscript, titled The Artist s Reality, is now being published for the first time.Probably written around 194041, this revelatory book discusses Rothko s ideas on the modern art world, art history, myth, beauty, the challenges of being an artist in society, the true nature of  American art,  and much more. The Artist s Reality also includes an introduction by Christopher Rothko, the artist s son, who describes the discovery of the manuscript and the complicated and fascinating process of bringing the manuscript to publication. The introduction is illustrated with a small selection of relevant examples of the artist s own work as well as with reproductions of pages from the actual manuscript.The Artist s Reality will be a classic text for years to come, offering insight into both the work and the artistic philosophies of this great painter.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OqZ2dZ90qlAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shadows in the Sun: Travels to Landscapes of Spirit and Desire","description":"Set in locales from the wilds of British Columbia to the jungles of the Amazon to the frigid Arctic regions, essays and stories examine the variations of native cultures and the interactions of their societies with the natural world","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dDKuGqaSj7cC&dq=Shadows+in+the+Sun:+Travels+to+Landscapes+of+Spirit+and+Desire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Sunday Surprise (Christopher Churchmouse Classics)","description":"The tales and travels of Christopher Churchmouse in the Christopher Churchmouse Classics have been helping young readers learn about God and their faith for more than ten years.

One of the program's highlights occurs during the first intermission, when invited speakers offer live, stimulating commentary on the opera aired that day. And for the last twelve years one of the most popular guests on this program has been M. Owen Lee, a Catholic priest and classics scholar, who has emerged as a brilliant and engaging speaker with a gift for making opera relevant to modern concerns. Now, in First Intermissions, Father Lee presents twenty-one of his finest radio talks, analyzing some of the best loved operas in the current repertoire, including masterworks by Mozart, Verdi, Wagner, Puccini, and Strauss. This is a book that brims with opera lore, with the love of fine music, and with an abundance of good humor. Father Lee writes brilliantly about the music itself, offering insights into composition that even a novice can grasp and enjoy. But for Father Lee, opera is more than beautiful music. Opera is about the human condition, our capacity for good and evil, our unconscious thoughts and conscious actions, our sorrows and our joys, our stories, our myths, and our personal triumphs and tragedies. It is great art confronting life head on: the conflict between fathers and children in Verdi, the irreversibility of time in Strauss, or the quest for self-realization in Wagner. Father Lee brings the real story of opera to life--great stories that make us see beyond the plot and feel the music as a blow to the heart. What also strikes the reader about Father Lee's style is that it is very intimate, not only sprinkled with personal anecdotes (such as saving pennies in Depression-era Detroit to buy sheet music from Sears and Roebuck), but informed throughout by his open-hearted response to opera's magic. Father Lee's love of opera shines through these pieces, and his enthusiasm is contagious, sending readers straight to their record collections--or the nearest record store--to savor once again the marvels of opera. When Father Owen Lee first appeared on the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts, he was given two criteria. \\"I could say anything I pleased,\\" he recalls, \\"so long as (1) it was instantly intelligible to the little old lady in Dubuque and the little old gentleman in Des Moines and (2) it was something no one anywhere, of either sex or any age, had ever thought of before.\\" Whether discussing Puccini's La Boheme or Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier or Gounod's Faust, Father Lee remains utterly original and always in touch with the little old lady in Dubuque.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jfz-DkPeyv0C&dq=First+Intermissions:+Twenty-One+Great+Operas+Explored,+Explained,+and+Brought+to+Life+From+the+Met&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charting the Stock Market: The Wyckoff Method","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Johnny Appleseed: The Story of a Legend","description":"Recounts the story of John Chapman, the man behind the legend of Johnny Appleseed, who went on a great adventure across the land planting apple seeds everywhere he went.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ezNODwAAQBAJ&dq=Johnny+Appleseed:+The+Story+of+a+Legend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Before the Dinosaurs: Indiana's Fossil Mysteries (The Hoosier Heritage Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ECAxAAAACAAJ&dq=Before+the+Dinosaurs:+Indiana%27s+Fossil+Mysteries+(The+Hoosier+Heritage+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wireless Digital Communications: Modulation and Spread Spectrum Applications","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Essential Jesus: Original Sayings And Earliest Images","description":"After his definitive The Historical Jesus, John Dominic Crossan delivered Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography--a popularized, bestselling account of what we can know about the life of Jesus.

This impromptu journey is a response to an S.O.S. from Sammat to Kadi; and Mrs. P., reluctant to allow the girl to venture alone into what she fears may be grave danger, crashes the party. Sunny little Ubangiba is no great shakes as nations go. Under Sammat's selfless leadership it is recovering from the devastation wrought by two greedy presidents-for-life who preceded him in office. But Sammat has dangerous enemies. Everywhere rumors are springing up that he is a sorcerer and that his evil power is responsible for a rash of shocking murders in which the victims appear to have been clawed to death by a lion. These crimes are especially terrifying because there are no lions in Ubangiba. Without the comforting backup of the CIA, Mrs. Pollifax wades into the fray, hunting for the source of the bloody terrorism that threatens Sammat and Ubangiba. Not to mention Kadi and Mrs. Pollifax.
