The book was great and I only wish that more of it could have been included in the film. I had seen Cosmos, Carl Sagan's TV show, and it's great to see his ideas and views expressed in great piece of contemporary fiction. One of the few books that I can't help but read over and over."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"First let me say that unlike most who apparently have posted here I'm not going to talk about or rate the movie version of this novel. I'm also not going to base my rating on a comparison of the two.I found this book in the late 80's on a local bookstore shelf and decided it sounded interesting. I had actually read an excerpt, I reallized, several years before. The book laid out the &quot;BASIC&quot; themes of contention between fact and faith. Within this discourse the autor found a way to introduce the reader to some amazingly interesting characters. How easy it would have been to go heavy on the science and forget that you're writting about people. Sagan takes us into the &quot;soul&quot; of Dr. Arroway. Yes, her soul was the very thing that eventually drove her to each new accomplishment. The author lets us see that her mind was only the vehicle. This story is her story of discovery and because of that the ending is especially important. The story shows the frailty of the human species when mind and soul are at odds or simply not allowing the other to exist.Sagan goes to a great expense of the English language though to tell his story. Although I didn't count there seemed to be &quot;millions and millions&quot; of extra words thrown in needlessly. Alot of the science though was explained well enough for even me to grasp. I appreciate that. The storyline is well crafted and engaging. The characters are interesting and the book is still the second best novel I've ever read. I'm about to order it again.A MUST READ"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"read the book after seeing the movie 7 times. surprised how much better the movie's plot was. Sagan's vision of the aliens as bored galactic engineers was a real let down compared to the movies vision of the aliens as enlightened and spiritual. The whole treatment of the spiritual angle, though, is confused in both the movie and the book"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I would never have guessed that Sagan, a hardheaded, agnostic, scientific type would have in him a book with such a fine sense of character development and emotional pitch. Having read many of his nonfiction books, I was not surprised by the social and religious commentary, which I found to be both perceptive and very even-handed.The science was interesting -- particularly the mode of travel described -- and I found the use of messages buried in irrational numbers to be an imaginative concept that I've never seen before. As a sci-fi story, I would compare this favorably with some of Arthur C. Clarke's best work, including 2001 and Rendezvous With Rama, in terms of the scope and majesty of the universe he creates. My only problem with the story, in fact, is that it is a little bit too derivative of Clarke; the space/dimensional traveling sequence seems to be imitative of 2001, and there are other similarities to Clarke novels, such as Childhood's End, that were a little distracting (this is why Contact gets a 9, rather than the full 10 rating).Nonetheless, I found this a very moving story that has more genuine feeling in it than almost any S-F story I've read. This is a novel that is visionary and almost religious in its awe of the universe, and I only hope that the movie version coming out next month does it justice."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"He became so famous as an astronomer that it's easy to forget he was one heck of a fine wordsmith as well. Yes he was. You've watched six shows, at most, on PBS. Sesame Street, Are You Being Served, Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy, Red Dwarf, and Cosmos with Carl Sagan. If you're brighter than me, throw in The McNeil-Lehrer Report or its sequel. But that's it.Why COSMOS? Well, if I type \\"billions and billions\\" in quotes, you hear his voice in your head. Yes you do. The man made astronomy interesting because he was a wordsmith.CONTACT is a novel by Carl Sagan. Copyright 1985, which works for me. I read it when it was new. Back in my security guard days, down in Tampa Florida. (Yo Bob!) I later saw the film, very well done, with Jodie Foster, but I can't remember it. One of the advantages of getting old.How does the book stand the test of time? So well that I'm gonna recommend you get it right now. Of course the science is spot on, since this is Carl Sagan. If we ever do hear from somebody not of this earth, this is how it'll happen. But that's a given. What's easy to forget is that Sagan gave us some very well-drawn characters from his world in an eminently readable style. And, as always, accessible science that makes you marvel at the possibilities. Keep in mind that I've probably never used the word \\"marvel\\" in a book or movie review before. I'm too old and jaded to marvel. But heck, I marveled.As if that weren't enough, he had so much fun predicting the future. This far down the road, we can see where he misfired, which was almost never. We can enjoy how accurate he often was. This is where he let his subtle humor roam free, and we can love him for his wit. These are the traits I didn't catch 20 years ago, because I was looking for aliens. Which he also delivers, somewhat, but I don't even care at this point. I just know I love this book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"In the year 1999, one astronomer makes a discovery that would shake the very foundations of the world. Eleanor Arroway, a graduate of Harvard and California Technological University and a native of Wisconsin, would make such a discovery. Working in a radio telescope compound known as Argus, she searches the sky constantly, in hopes of receiving a message from a distant civilization. Dedicated to her work, she finally makes progress when one of her telescopes receives an overwhelmingly strong signal from a star named Vega. Looking at the screen of 1's and 0's, she discovers that it is a video clip of Adolf Hitler welcoming the world to the 1936 Olympics! After further studying this awkward transmission, she discovers that there is a message underneath the video clip. Quickly, the rest of the world joins in the effort to collect this message and hopefully decipher it. As the message continues, members of the Soviet Union make the discovery that the message may be a blueprint for the construction of a machine. This novel follows the life of Ellie Arroway during this fictional period of discovery. Playing a vital role in the construction of the Machine, she also becomes the representative of the United States to the alien race that sent them the Message. She always believed that there were other intelligent beings in the universe, and for the first time, she has her proof.I enjoyed this book. It was full of exciting \\"what-ifs.\\" Also, Carl Sagan did an excellent job with the character of Ellie, who was both extremely smart and very much human, unlike other genius characters in other stories that seem to be above everyone else. He gave all the characters deep emotions and backgrounds that kept me interested in the book. I would not recommend this book to those who cannot stand reading anything that isn't full of action. Though there are some exciting points in the book, I would not say it was full of action. Also, the language used in the book was highly scientific, and with my \\"junior in chemistry class\\" understanding of science, I could barley understand it. I did, however, have some idea of what was going on at all times. In short, I recommend this book for the open minded and the scientific, otherwise, I suggest staying away from it until you figure out what isomers, harmonic oscillators, and erbium dowels are."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"If you haven't yet read this novel by Carl Sagan, then immediately PUT DOWN what you are doing and start reading one of the greatest books I've ever read. In any case, you have probably seen the movie, which I thought was ok, but the book provides a much deeper and important experience. Let me just go through a few of the reasons I enjoyed this book so much.First, any book worth reading should be both entertaining and thought provoking, and hopefully at the end it will have changed or added to how you think about the universe and your life. Well, this book is undoubtably entertaining and is hard to put down, but more importantly there is much to learn and ruminate over within. Whether there is intelligent life out there in the universe is one of the most important unanswered questions left for humanity. Here Sagan explores the implications of finding an intelligent message: how it unites humanity for a common cause and how it changes our view of our place in the universe. On another level, Sagan's book is about one person's quest for meaning. Ellie Arroway travels across the galaxy to find answers, but in the end she finds even more surprising revelations from her step-father back on earth. On yet another level, there is the issue of religion in our society. The characters are very rich in Contact, and each voices their unique opinion on these issues. Here is a book that can be read many times over with new insights each time.Some highlights of this book are the great writing and dialogue as well as the depth of the characters - a rarity in a SF novel. Also, the science is very well presented. In particular, the chapter on Hadden's final departure is near perfect. Sagan also included many future predictions for 1999 and many of them hit quite close to home.There are a few downsides as well, but they don't really detract from the overall experience. One is Sagan's prediction of the continuing Cold War gets a little tiresome. Another is why would Hadden (who helped decipher the primer) choose to leave for space rather than waiting to see what happened to the crew? If he was really looking for immortality, wouldn't he be curious to see what the aliens had said?Finally it is interesting to realize that 1999 has come and gone and there has been no messages received by SETI. What would the implications be of Earth being the only planet in the universe with intelligent life? I recommend this great article if you are interested in reading more about this topic: http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/88aug/easterbr.htm.Go read Contact!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan was a wonder and this abridged audio version of Contact is the only version I've ever gone through. I saw the film, but never read any of his other books. I've since ordered them all. Amazing.Wow. I literally didn't want to get out of my car. As good as Jodie Foster was in the film, her audio read was remarkable. She really is as good as they get on screen and in my car stereo. Her talent was to convey the wonder of the book and make me care about the issues and she really delivers.If you are thinking about buying this, you won't regret it. The only regret you may feel is that Carl is now gone and there won't be any more of his wonderfully educating stories."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"CONTACT is a great book. The main character, Ellie, is a radio astronomer looking for extraterrestrial intelligence, and the result makes all heck break loose. She makes enemies, is betrayed, is double-crossed, yet manages to make some friends along the way. CONTACT is not only about aliens and space and technology, but a book which makes us realize just how tiny we are. Wonderfully crafted by Carl Sagan, creator of COSMOS; CONTACT feeds the dreamer in all of us. Or, depending on who you are and what you believe, the person just waiting for some proof."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I read the book Contact by Carl Sagan. It would probably be considered a science fiction book because it has a lot to do with space and \\"other forms of life\\". I gave it four stars because it was very interesting and it made me want to keep reading further and further. The main plot of Contact is about a doctor that works at a satellite monitoring station. She is always listening for sounds form outer space and comes up empty handed every time. Finally she gets her big break; she hears a loud heart-beat type sound coming from a distant star. Soon they start to receive sound and video waves. I will not go into anymore detail because it would make the book a lot less exciting to read and give away the ending if you knew anything more about the book. Overall, thought it was a great book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who finds space and science interesting or who has a little bit of an imagination and curiosity about space."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I loved Sagan on TV and I loved Cosmos, but I didn't love Contact. Sagan is a great scientist but he's a pedestrian novelist. I'd call him a poor man's Michener. The characters in Contact are stereotyped and dull. Some sections lag such as the exposition of Ellie's childhood which, apart from being banal, was unreasonably long notwithstanding that it ties in with the ending. I also found the &quot;real science&quot; aspect -which other readers have said is the books strength -to be a little elementary and a little skimpy. Seems to me that Sagan spent a lot more time in musing on religion vs science than on the technology or the science of SETI (and he does this via too many unauthentic long speeches). All in all a great disappointment"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"The performances are excellent and the scenes memorable. Though the filmed version lacks the key points in Sagan's novel, Contact is one of the most realistic science fiction films ever produced with many real newscasters (almost too many, at times)lending their hands. Aside from its special effects and mysteries revealed, Contact presents a very believable story ofworldwide reactions to the discovery of life beyond.I strongly recommend the novel to anyone interested in this topic. Reading the book is well worth the time."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Think about it. What would the pope have to say? How would world leaders weigh in? This incredible book suggests what might happen. I've read the book twice and enjoyed every page.While the movie was also quite good, the storyline was changed to accommodate Matthew McConaughey. I imagined Palmer Joss to look and sound like Jerry Falwell. I have no doubt that Sagen wrote the novel with Falwell in mind -- though I doubt Falwell has tattoos.This book is so good that I enjoyed my second read as much as the first."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This is one of my all time favortie Sci-Fi books. The characters are three deminsional and believable, and their problems are. I'd almost call this book a cultural collage of society. There is everything from history, to religion, to politics, to science, to humanity crammed into this book. I also liked it because it seemed like the story could be going on now. (Besides that Russia was called the Soviet Union). it wasn't campy or futuristic like most Sci-Fi.The story is that Ellie Arroway finds messages from the planet Vega and the earth builds a machine to get to these aliens. But there is so much more. I couldn't possibly explain it all. I love the imagery of human feeling Sagan gives you, and also the science in it is very strong, since its written by Carl Sagan. Just read it!Also, if you've seen the movie, don't think you've seen it all. The movie only skimms the surface of this complex and enjoyable book. I mean, you couldn't possibly cram that much meaning into a hour and a half movie!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Before I read this book, I did not have just one, single favorite book. I had multitudes of favorites, and my favorite for the time was only determined by which book I had read the most recently. This book tops them all, in the story, the emotions, the basic ideas, it's just completely awesome. I highly reccomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"The lead in was great. Good details, very interesting suspenseful story. I just thought the end was way too fast, almost if he said, enough of this - lets end it. I am looking for the second half of the story. The book was better then the movie."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Arguably, this is the greatest science-fiction book ever written. Nearly impossible to put down once you've picked it up, its blend of extremely plausible fiction and sociological prediction is, in my experience, unmatched. You will find when you read it, that you are swept away in how real it all seems.The movie is similar to the novel, but the ending is far better explained and more believable.Contact also provides a profound, soul-searching question to all of us, spiritually and scientifically, from the first chapter to the last awe-inspiring page."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Well, it's like this...I really enjoyed the book (so much better than the movie), I just think it ended abruptly. Otherwise, I would have given the full 5-star rating."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Definately the most awe inspiring novel I have ever read. The imagery given as I was dragged into the story by your words is just beautiful. I was caught up for weeks on your theories on how likely life is out there and I will forever be caught up in the mystery. Three cheers for the high master Carl Sagan! Thank you sir and you are correct. We Are Not Alone!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"There are few books that leave you with the disire to discuss life, the universe and everything and this is one of them. Thought provoking and engaging at the same time. The book has some flaws that the the film was able to repair (one of the few times I think a movie improved on an already great book) - the book has a tendency to be a little too technical and plods occasionally and the ending is slightly weak. But it's a facinating, well thought out tale by one of the greats of science and science fiction."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book is pure magic. I very rarely read science fiction (I tend to think it's a genre best left to adolescent boys), but \\"Contact\\" is no mere adventure story. Rather, it's a soaring achievement of intellect and imagination -- and a love letter to the human race. So much better than the movie, which was already quite good. It's like the movie, squared."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I'm glad I saw the film first.I read the book to find details missing from the movie, and I was somewhat disappointed. The text lacked the excitement that I expected, and the writing was long-winded at times. Not enough hard SF details for me."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I read this book when I was in the 7th Grade. I understood most of what Sagan was refering to, but since I still had a few questions I read his equally great non-fiction novel, Cosmos. These two novels have had a profound impact on my views of life."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact is one of the most intelligent SF books ever written. The first contact with alien life is described so vividly and so believably, that one thinks that it could happen any moment, or even better, that it already did! Contact is not just a story of a contact between humans and aliens, but also of contacts between humans themselves, which are too often not as they should be and even less intense as the ones with beings from other worlds. The novel Contact is to it's author, Carl Sagan, both what he describes in last two chapters: his way to eternity and the finishing touch to his rich and creative life. A must."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"It is an engaging novel, that explores the depth of human reality. I'm only 16 yrs old, but this novel invoked great feeling of enchantment that will stay with me for a lifetime."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"A sci-fi book from an author who knows what he's talking about, and isn't afraid to show it.Coming from a scientific background, I wasn't scared off by the book's depth of explanation, which was interesting, and corresponded easily with astronomy and cosmology textbooks used by universities, such as &quot;Explorations&quot; by T.Arny.Another thing I enjoyed (since I'm not a sci-fi fan) was the dose of realism, lack of furry creatures with unpronouncable names, and a fair amount of political and religious/moral debate that seems to be contemporary at the moment.If I had to pick a flaw, its the love life of the main character, which I originally thought a Hollywood addition of the film. Although originally different, it nonetheless feels a little tacked-on, and fades as quickly as it emerges.All in all, its a heck of a good read for those interested in space exploration and discovery."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Somebody pinch me, I must be dreaming: The book is good, especially if you HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET!!! Imagine to my surprise that I saw the movie in the theatre first and then was given a copy of this book: I read it, liked it when I had my trusty Webster's Dictionary on hand and so on and so forth... But, considering as any 16 year old would, between book and movie, the latter seemed to win out-- I had only one major query out of the entire experience... The blind physicist, Dr. Kent Clark (played magnificentlly by the talented actor William Fichtner) was a much-needed key in tying the emotional matter to the scientific-- His character and Ellie (Jodie Foster) had much more on screen character and even flow that with McConaughey's Joss-- It was believable, a good pairing, and would have done a book in this subject a world of good HAD HIS CHARACTER BEEN FEATURED IN THE BOOK!! then again, that's just my opinion."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"An incredible tale held by a plausible context of a possible and near future of communications with another life species in the cosmos. Dr. Sagan created a lovely and dazzling storyline, part fantasy, part fact, part autobiography and completely amazing, where the whole world and the main character (Dra. Eleanor Arroway) face the most wanted and last possible big discovery of now a days: knowledge of existence and contact with other life species. The book have many citations of new discoveries of science and existing institutions and research companies, what makes the story more realistic. This book is a must for who wants to read a science fiction story that can become a science fact someday, just as the tales of Verne, Wells and many other classic writers who dreamed of today common science discoveries and revolutions, such as travel to the moon and artificial organs. READ IT!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I have read both the book and the movie, and was impressed by both. Each form of the story did its job well. Since both the book and the screenplay were written by Carl Sagan (who died during filming) the movie does not suffer from the total evisceration of the plot so common in many book-based movies.One thing movie-watching book-lovers must realize is that it is literally impossilbe to cram all of a 400 page book into a 2 hour movie. Especially if you want to have your movie viewed by someone with the intelligence of your average American. (i.e. The the ones who pen (in another review): &quot;Carl Sagan can't right [sic] worth anything!&quot; and others expound on the glories of the movie, apparently not even realizing that it is a book too.)I think it is obvious that the movie did not even try to duplicate to plot lines of the book, as that would be too tedious and would not be the best choice for a movie. For instance, Ellie's long affair with the National Science Adviser, while it could have been duplicated in the movie, would have consumed a large chunk of the screen time (much longer than a one-night stand with Joss.) and Ellie's love life was certainly not the point of either form of the story, although in the book, it served to add character depth. The debates with the religous characters in the book would have consumed a good 20-30 minutes of valuable movie time, which needed to be spent in other places.Now for some biased opinions. I believe that Carl Sagan developed a greater animosity toward religion as he grew older. In the book, he certainly does not view religion as a friend, but he seees to have ambivilence about it. His view seems to be, &quot;If not carried to extremes, what's the harm?&quot; I recently read &quot;Demon Haunted World&quot; (written by him in 1996) I get the impression that he views religion as the enemy of reason and a scourge to be struck from the earth. (Perhaps I exaggerate a little.) In the book, religious groups are connected only fuzzily to the killing of Dummond, et al. In the movie, the bomb is exploded by a wild-eyed, hellfire and brimstone madman. (Although McConaughey's Joss is thrown in in the spirit of moderation.) I read &quot;Contact&quot; after reading &quot;The Demon Haunted World&quot; and seeing the movie. I remember thinking during the movie, (my only Sagan experience beforehand being &quot;The Demon Haunted World&quot;) &quot;This is a very 'Sagan' plot.&quot; I was not shocked in the least when he had a religious fanatic blow up the machine.A little sidebar:One of Ellie's questions on page 367 of the paperback is rather amusing. Look at this passage, near the bottom of the page:&quot;And the zero's and ones finally stop? You get back to a random sequence of digits?&quot; Seeing a faint sign of encourgement, she raced on. &quot;And the number of zeros and ones? Is it a product of prime numbers?&quot;Uh, sorry to reduce your sense of wonder sports fans, but if you remember 6th grade math correctly, all non-zero integers are a product of prime numbers.In conclusion, while the book isn't as epic as the &quot;Odessey&quot;, and the movie isn't &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, both are worth experiencing."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This novel was written for everyone to enjoy but for a select few to love. Carl Sagan is well known as a scientist and a non-fiction authur. If you have ever read any of his previous work you will truly understand where Carl is coming from with this book. If you are used to reading paperback,&quot;could never happen&quot;, type of contact or space books then please do not waste your time. You will think as many who replied here that the book has too much true science and is very slow. Contact has less to do with the actually contact with others as our own humility. Such topics as the debate between religion and science are probed very deeply at the noneducated readers expense. I think this is a wonderful book written by A true scientist is a time when they are very hard to find."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I decided to read the book before renting the movie. The story line is pretty good but the ending is weak; the outcome of the &quot;contact&quot; is unsatisfying and a surprising, but irrelevant, revelation about the heroine is used to provide a philosophical last paragraph. The book was written in the 80's but set at the end of the millenium, giving us the opportunity to review Carl's predictions. Not many have come to fruition. The National Enquirer, ABC, NBC and CBS are all still here. The Soviet Union and apartheid -era South Africa aren't. We don't have a two-term female president...er, okay, a split decision on that one...and there are no millionaire retirement homes orbiting the earth. The strike-out rate for Carl's predictions tended to make me think his predictions for first contact with aliens was probably way off, too. This is the kind of book you can read on a long flight or during a vacation, but it's a stretch to tag it a &quot;classic&quot; of any genre."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Like most of his work, Sagan puts across the sciences and professions of astronomy and astrophysics across for the lay reader with great ability and an obvious feeling for his subject and his readers. I enjoyed the humanness of his characters, the realities of their work world, and the science in which they were involved. I read the book before watching the video and felt, as I usually do, that the book was better. One can always create more side plots and develop to a greater extent the individual characters in a volume of so many pages, which the reader can set aside at will and return to as needed. The director must stick to a central theme and be constantly mindful of budgetary constraints. I also thought the relationship of the heroine with her father was more intense and surprising in the book than in the movie."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"The only science fiction novel by a prominent astronomer who was the late twentieth century's foremost popularizer of science was bound to be something special, and Carl Sagan's &quot;Contact&quot; certainly is. No other science fiction novel is quite like it in its thrilling realism; one can easily believe that a sequence of events similar to that in the book could begin taking place tomorrow. The book is filled with a plethora of wonderful plot twists, fascinating details of scientific fact and speculation, and unexpected bits of characterization that only Sagan could have thought to include. Sagan, who apparently considered himself a &quot;spiritual agnostic,&quot; explored religious as well as scientific issues in this work, and the result is arguably heretical if seen from a traditional religious standpoint -- but not heretical in the specific way a reader might initially expect. Indeed, the story's climactic twist makes &quot;Contact&quot; into a twentieth-century equivalent of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; -- a work which, while subtly heretical, is one of the most awe-inspiringly religious books ever written.Jodie Foster's reading of &quot;Contact&quot; on this recording is absolutely superb. She differentiates between the voices of all the characters and her own voice as narrator -- even her voice for Ellie Arroway, the character she played in the movie of &quot;Contact,&quot; is a subtly more energetic and characterful version of her normal voice. Foster also employs about seven different accents (counting her usual American accent) in the course of the recording, moving effortlessly from one to another when characters from several different countries have conversations. At one point, when Sagan's text describes a character as having an almost (but not quite) non-existent Russian accent, Foster even manages to produce exactly that! She also evokes all the varying moods of the story, conveying Sagan's sense of awe and wonder at the beauty and majesty of the universe. Foster's performance on this recording is probably the best reading of a book which I have ever heard.I listened to this recording over several nights, and was in suspense from one night to the next, wondering what would happen next. This superb example of the intelligence and artistry of Carl Sagan and Jodie Foster is highly recommended. Six out of five stars."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact is grand, it is epic, and it is vast in it's hypotheses and plotline. However, it is also one of the most touching and personable books you will ever read.I agree with others who have said that the twists and turns in the plot are fantastic. No doubt. But my favorite thing about this book is Ellie's character - her tenacity, her passion, and her undaunted *faith* while yet an athiest and a scientist. Sagan develops an array of interesting characters, with different backgrounds and belief systems, who respond to the first-contact experience in unique ways. As much as Contact is a story about first-contact with aliens, it is as much or even moreso a pondering about humanity, our strengths and weaknesses, and the delicate differences through which we strive to find common ground.You should know that there are a few significant differences between the book and the movie (I did like the movie very much by the way, and felt Jodie Foster did a superb job as Ellie). The following are \\"minor spoilers\\". In other words, they are subtle hints at what you may have missed if you only saw the movie, but, I have not outright told you what is in the book either:1) Palmer Joss's character looks quite different in the book, and has a different background, than the hot-bodied heart-throb portrayed in the movie by McConaughey (McConaughey did well with the part written for him, in my opinion).2) Ellie and her dad's relationship is much more personal than the short snibets depicted in the movie.3) Ellie is not the only person who meets the Caretakers (aliens) in the book version.4) During the first contact with the alien (\\"her dad\\"), the conversation is much longer and more detailed. The alien shares paragraphs of information about the outside universe, what they have discovered, an intriguing discussion on pi and the secrets this number holds, and what they feel the future holds for other worlds in the galaxy. This was a significant difference from the movie, though I can see why Zemeckis needed to shorten some of it due to its extensiveness.5) The book has a fantastic twist at the end which the movie did not include. It revolves around something Ellie learned about pi during her conversation with the alien. I was surprised the movie did not include it, as it was such a creative and masterful conclusion.There are other differences but these were the most significant ones for me.If you are on the lookout for books with a similar theme/feel, try Jack McDevitt's \\"The Engines of God\\" and \\"The Hercules Text\\", especially the latter.And on a side note - Hey Nick, How about a SEQUEL?"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"For those who loved the movie, you should have read the book first- and then you'd have hated the movie. The movie's ending was anti-climactic, whereas the last page of the novel presents one of the most mind-boggling concepts I have ever encountered- a picture built into a number. And not just any picture! I found this to be a genuinely moving book- a distinct rarity in the science fiction world. And for the lost soul who rated the book a \\"1\\" because Carl is an \\"atheist\\"- you totally missed the point of the book! Like Einstein, Carl was an agnostic- but he was profoundly and deeply \\"religious,\\" in his way, as the ending of the book makes so clear. Carl's reverence and concern for this planet and for its future generations should qualify him for sainthood, in any religion. As Carl said of Euclid's Geometry, this book is \\"a great read.\\""},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I read this book shortly after I saw the movie, just after completing my sophomore year in high school. The book went much more in depth than the movie; something that usually makes books better than the movies that are based on them; which is true in this case.If you can understand the complex math and science that is interwoven into the chapters (I didn't, but I read it anyway :) you'll probably enjoy it that much more. Otherwise I would have rated it five stars. A must for for the obsessive sci-fi reader (such as myself :)."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I have seen the movie, read the book, and listened to the audio cassettes (in that order), and I am happy to admit that I am responsibly obssessed with this literary work by a brilliant man, Carl Sagan. Using the book's main characters as a mouthpiece for many of his personal views, Carl Sagan is successful in revealing that science and religion are NOT necessarily mutually exclusive. And Jodie Foster's performance as Ellie Arroway in the movie as well as the reader in the audio version is unsurpassed. The ending in the book made me weep big ole soppy tears, not because it is sad, but rather because it is so incredibly uplifting. If only there were such definitive proof of .... (well, I won't spoil it for you). Perhaps someday we will be ready to handle such evidence. In the meantime, wouldn't it be nice to actually make Contact? Perhaps then we could set aside our petty global differences and unite with a single purpose to join the cosmic family - if indeed &quot;they&quot; would let us in. Carl Sagan presents us with a glimpse of such a reality, although it is still perhaps just beyond our ability to convince ourselves that it could actually come true. Thank you Carl ... wherever you are."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact is a *very* believable story of humans detecting and decoding the first signal recieved from aliens. I don't want to reveal much more than that for if you are to read this book, there are so many exciting moments of mystery and discovery that unfold throughout the story. This book is captivating from the first page to the very last sentence. I highly recommend it to all.For those that have seen Contact the movie already, in my opinion, the book is much better, and that is saying a lot since I thought the movie was excellent. If you enjoyed the movie, the book will dive deeper and reveal so much more that the movie did not.One note... Sagan spends a good deal of time setting up and knocking down anything to do with religion. This is nothing new for Sagan (see almost any of his other books). For some, this might feel like old hat and a bit slow compared to the rest of the book. But it just made me crave more and more to get to the parts about the message and the amazing events that unfold after it is decoded."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"ContactCarl SaganCongratulations,You are about to embark on a journey through time and space, and get the opportunity to observe and evaluate the very thoughts of the author and ppreciate the author's scientific intuition.

Our distinguished author has many credits to his name. He was the Director of the Laboratory for Planetary Studies and David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences at Cornell University. He was part of the team responsible for the Viking, Mariner, and Voyager Expeditions. He received NASA medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement and for Distinguished Public Service. He was past chairman of the Division for Planetary Sciences and the Astronomy Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Four hundred of his scientific and popular articles have been published. Additionally, he was the author and co-author of several other books including : \\"Intelligent Life in the Universe,\\" \\"The Cosmic Connection,\\" \\"The Dragons of Eden,\\" \\"Murmurs of Earth,\\" \\"Broca's Brain,\\" \\"Comet,\\" his most famous - \\"Cosmos,\\" \\"A Path Where No Man Thought,\\" an expose' of the nuclear winter scenario, and his last - \\"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.\\" He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in literature in 1978; he was also a champion of both human and Earth rights. But for all his brilliance, intuitiveness, and achievement, Carl Sagan recognized his own mortality and insignificance in the Universe.Contact. Only Carl Sagan could devise this simple, one word name for his first fiction novel; the title so eloquently and completely describes the central plot of his story - contact with an advanced galactic civilization and, perhaps, more - the identity of which is: to be announced!Given his credentials, it is not surprising to me that Carl Sagan chose the subject of extraterrestrial contact for his first fiction novel; it so perfectly reflects his own interests: Cosmology, SETI, and CETI activities; SETI and CETI, incidently, refer to 'Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence' and 'Contact with Extraterrestrial Intelligence' respectively. His novel names real places, among them: the Arecibo facility in Puerto Rico and the Argus Array in Socorro, New Mexico. He conducted SETI activities at both these facilities. Indeed, his first fiction novel is a reflection of his own fantasies and ambitions of locating alien intelligence. With his collaborator and colleague, Ann Druyan, he achieved excellent results with \\"Contact.\\"STORY SYNOPSISIn the late 1980's, an intelligent radio source (a message)is received from the vicinity of the Vega star system in the constellation of Lyra. The signal contained many levels of information encoded by various modulation methods and astronomers found: a re-broadcast of the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, a set of prime numbers, and finally, elaborate instructions to build a machine. It's the \\"Machine.\\" Extraterrestrials are telling us they know we're here. Several years were needed to decode the instructions and build the Machine. During this time, great political, philosophical, religious, and scientific debates took place to determine the purpose, implications, and ramifications of the now controversial Machine. The Machine is eventually determined to be a vehicle by which five Earth travelers would be able to journey to Vega and be greeted by the Message senders. The Machine, do decahedron in shape, is completed and, on New Year's Eve - 1999, it is activated with 5 selected travelers on board. Within a matter of minutes, the travelers visit several spectacularly beautiful star systems before finally reaching their destination and meeting the Message senders, the \\"Caretakers.\\"The travelers find that the Caretakers are a conglomeration of cultures that have been around for half a billion years. After determining that the expanding Universe will eventually spread itself too thin to allow for the formation of new stars and galaxies, the Caretakers decided they would harness and corral extraneous matter using the gravity effects of black holes and other devices, and cause a sufficient concentration of the matter to insure the continued rebirth of new stars and galaxies. At times, they \\"closed off\\" sections of the Universe until needed.Does Dr. Sagan have an imagination, or doesn't he?! The Caretakers are certainly the ultimate ecologists. Like a galactic version of Johnny Appleseed, they have taken the task of re-planting the Universe! The Caretakers' true appearance is never revealed because they appear to each of the Earth travelers as the travelers' loved ones. Dr. Ellie Arroway, our heroine and main character, talks with her dead \\"father\\" and learns that the Caretakers have an \\"emerging civilization division\\" that makes contact with cultures such as Earth, and invites them for a visit and tour. The Caretakers have watched many civilizations come and go but believe the Earth has hope for survival.Dr. Arroway's assigned host, her \\"father,\\" talks with her about the possibility of a hidden message buried deep with the value of \\"Pi,\\" perhaps 10 to the 20th power digits beyond the decimal point. Dr. Arroway ponders the idea. But visit time is almost up! The Caretakers escort the travelers back to their craft and, without proof of their visit, send them home. Ellie later investigates the properties of Pi and makes a gargantuan discovery!A WORD ABOUT STORY ACCURACYAbove all, Carl Sagan is a scientist. Based on what I know about him from his previous works, he apparently assumes nothing and questions everything. He is a stickler for detail. He retains that child-like wonder and imagination of the world around him - and of the Universe in which we reside. Accordingly, he left little to chance while weaving his story.A transmission emanates from the Vega star system. Vega is about the right age, the right size, and the right spectral range to spawn a planetary system conducive to supporting an advanced civilization. It is also 26 light years away. The transmission, received about 1988, contained an encoded re-broadcast of the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. The period between 1936 and 1988 is 52 years; a round-trip radio transmission from Earth to Vega and back would take 52 years. Dr. Sagan later weaves the speed of light limit into his story when the Earth travelers are accused of perpetrating a hoax by government officials. The travelers are informed that the Message stopped at the moment the Machine was activated. With their limited minds, the government officials \\"know\\" that it should take 26 years for news of Machine activation to reach Vega. They refuse to believe that the Vegans could have broken the speed of light barrier. Dr. Sagan shrewdly used his \\"writer's license\\" with respect to the speed of light issue. As Isaac Asimov put it in his book The Roving Mind: \\"What do science fiction writers do?......better writers know of the speed of light limit and get around it by assuming that in the future, new technologies will be available. They talk about moving through 'hyperspace,' or through 'subspace'; they make use of a 'subetheric drive' or a 'space warp'.But let's get back on track. Our distinguished author's work is more accurately described as a science and philosophy text book with a story woven in to connect these things. I estimate that 65 percent of the book would remain if the story were removed. Among the multitude of scientific notions \\"Contact\\" explores are the descriptions of various radio transmission modulation methods and the properties of exponential growth. Through his Ellie Arroway character, Dr. Sagan points out that one cubic centimeter of water (about one thimble full) contains 3 x 10 to the 19th power molecules whereas the entire Universe contains 1 x 10 to the 80th power elementary particles. A numerical difference of only 61 (in terms of powers of ten) is the difference between a few drops of water and all the matter in the entire Universe! In addition, the reader learns about worm holes, black holes, the birth and death of stars, bright infrared and x-ray emission sources, precession of the Earth's axis, Keppler's three laws, and much more. Speaking of Johannes Keppler, Dr. Sagan - the little devil - cleverly and surreptitiously slipped Keppler's proposed model of the solar system into his story. Dr. Sagan's Machine took the form of a do decahedron enclosed by three concentric rotating, mutually perpendicular hemispheres he calls benzels. In his paper entitled Mysterium Cosmographicum, published in 1596, Keppler borrows the Greek Mathematicians' discovery of the five - and only five - regular solids. A regular solid is one in which all sides are the same. In Keppler's model, the five solids are nestled one-in-the-other, separated by concentric spheres. One of these regular solids is a do decahedron, formed of twelve pentagons. Is the similarity between Keppler's model and Dr. Sagan's Machine a coincidence? I don't think so. Dr. Sagan is not only brilliant, he's sneaky. \\"Contact\\" may someday be used as a textbook.Speaking of textbooks, consider the following riddle. What does one get when one combines the fundamental parts of the book \\"Cosmos\\" with a fictional story? Answer: \\"Contact.\\" As I previously mentioned, \\"Contact\\" IS Dr. Sagan's way of telling us his dreams. Consider the following examples:Contact: p.77 - Ellie imagines the Message as the \\"Encyclopedia Galactica\\" when it is first received.Cosmos: pp.291-315 - An entire chapter is entitled \\"Encyclopedia Galactica.\\" This chapter is a speculative accounting of how another civilization might communicate with us.Contact: p.100 - Ellie explains to the President that the transmission from Vega has messages over messages in different levels of modulation - what she calls a \\"palimpsest.\\" Cosmos: p.314 - \\"But the most likely case is that interstellar communication will be a kind of palimpsest, like the palimpsests of the ancient writers short of papyrus or stone who superimposed their messages on top of preexisting messages.\\"These are but a few of the many parallels that exist between \\"Contact\\" and \\"Cosmos.\\" Is there any doubt that Dr. Sagan is telling us his greatest ambition - his greatest dream?SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTS EXPLOREDScientific insight is an understatement in \\"Contact.\\" Dr. Sagan wasted no time with the development of his Ellie Arroway main character and our heroine. As a champion of civil and human rights, he naturally gave us a female astronomer and a female President. He meticulously describes Ellie's hard struggle to overcome harsh prejudices and resistance to her achieving her goal of becoming a radio astronomer and scientist in this male dominated profession. He also took great care to give her a perpetually inquisitive mind that questioned everything. She is a master of \\"Why?\\" From child through adulthood, she wondered about everything from the way vacuum tubes worked to - the Bible's compatibility with science to - the physical makeup of the Universe. Her curiosity parallels Albert Einstein's comment that a passion for comprehension is a necessary component of the scientific mind.Dr. Sagan's Ellie character also follows in the best traditionsof women devoted to space exploration: Henrietta Leavitt, the Harvard astronomer who devised a stellar distance measuring method in 1912; Jocelyn Bell, the Cambridge astronomer who discovered what we now call \\"pulsars\\" in 1967; Linda Morabito, the JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) engineer who discovered active volcanos on Jupiter's moon, Io in 1988; and, most poignantly, astronauts Judy Resnik and Christa McAullife who gave their lives in the pursuit of space exploration.Through his various characters and situations, Dr. Sagan also poses the questions of technical civilizations being self limiting through self destruction; the probable numbers of other cultures in the Universe based on favorable conditions; are we too dumb for other civilizations to bother with; are we really fundamentally happier with the benefits of science - each of these concerns shared by Isaac Asimov, among others. A religious leader in the book offers these criticisms of scientists: scientists keep findings to themselves; only share information in bits and pieces; over-estimate what they know, under-estimate what people know; taught us how to annihilate ourselves. This same religious leader attempts to identify God as the source of the Message. He incredibly points out that Vega was the \\"North Star\\" about ten thousand B.C. when the Earth's axis was at the other side of its precession cycle (precession is a wobble in the Earth's rotation axis). This era marks the emergence of civilization and the concept of gods. It is Divine Providence that the guiding star then is the origin of this message now, he claims. Does Dr. Sagan dig into the depths of detail, or doesn't he?Dr. Sagan, again through his Ellie character, does not allow the Bible to escape scrutiny. Ellie, in conference with not one but two prominent religious leaders, chairs a great marathon debate that scrutinizes biblical accuracy. Pro Bible arguments from the religious leaders focus mainly on claims of fulfilled Bible prophesies: \\"The coming of the savior is foretold in Isaiah fifty-three, in Zechariah fourteen, in First Chronicles seventeen. That He would be born in Bethlehem was prophesied in Micah five. That He would come from the line of David was foretold in Matthew one.....the Ministry and Suffering of Jesus are foretold in Isaiah fifty-two and fifty-three, and the Twenty-second Psalm. That He would be betrayed for thirty pieces of silver is explicit in Zechariah eleven....and the Bible speaks of our own time. Israel and the Arabs, Gog and Magog, America and Russia, nuclear war - it's all there in the Bible.\\" Undaunted, Ellie waits for the right moment to return fire. Among her first salvo of rebuttals: The prophecies are often abstract and vague, ambiguous and imprecise - open to a wide range of interpretations.....even straightforward prophecies don't seem to jibe - like Jesus' promise that the Kingdom of God would come within the lifetime of some people in his audience.....passages that seem fulfilled are highlighted and the rest are ignored.She continues by asking why God's communication with us in contemporary times isn't made perfectly clear. Why doesn't the Bible contain information that no mortal person would have known at the time - such as the Sun is a star....or Mars is a rusty place with deserts and volcanos....or a body in motion tends to remain in motion....or nothing travels faster than the speed of light? Why is there no mention of such things like \\"Two strands entwined is the secret of life\\"....or why hasn't He put a giant crucifix in orbit around Earth....or place the Ten Commandments across the face of the moon? Why no more burning bushes or pillars of fire or a thundering voice from the sky saying \\"I am that I am?\\" Why does He remain so cryptic - why doesn't He rattle our cages each generation or so? The marathon philosophical debate ends with all participants adjourning, satisfied with their respective offerings but not swayed by the others' positions.ADDITIONAL COMMENTSStrikingly, \\"Contact\\" contains a table of contents not unlike that of an omnibus text book. \\"Contact\\" takes us on a tour that introduces us to the unique properties of Pi .. scientific investigation and hypothesis .. contributions of Greek science and mathematics .. our solar system .. the known properties of the Universe .. black holes .. do decahedrons .. exponential powers .. the Milky Way .. stars' life-cycles .. the Renaissance astronomers .. probability of extraterrestrial intelligence .. probability of our survival .. our insignificance .. our propensity toward greed and corruption .. our pollution problems .. our place in the Universe .. and much more. Science, religion, politics, psychology, philosophy, and their relationships to each other - it's all there - in \\"Contact.\\"Dr. Sagan's message to his readers is multi-faceted. He tells us who we are, where we've been, what were doing, and where we're going. He tells us we need to make the right decisions now if we are to have a desirable future; he tells to be scientists, to have an open mind; he counsels us to control our arrogance; he demonstrates the distinct possibility of life elsewhere in the Cosmos; but most significantly, he tells us WHO HE IS. Although Dr. Sagan is no longer with us, I feel his message is still very much alive.But for all his brilliance, scientific knowledge and intuitiveness, skepticism, and resourcefulness, Dr. Sagan still held the door open to the idea that there may be a . . . Hey - read the book!\\"Contact\\" isn't for everybody . . . but . . . it should be.SOME PERSONAL THOUGHTSI first enjoyed reading this book when it was first published. I recently read it again to enhance my appreciation of it because I was able to convert my increased knowledge of the sciences from my schooling into a greater understanding of Dr. Sagan's \\"Message.\\"Dr. Sagan issued a disclaimer at the end of his book, telling the reader that no character in the book is a close portrait of a real person. I don't think this is entirely true. I can't help believe that there isn't at least a smidgeon of similarity between the persona of the Ellie Arroway character and that of Dr. Sagan or, perhaps, his colleague and collaborator, Ann Druyan.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I saw the movie first. Having been a Sagan admirer since before adolescence, I knew there would be ideas of enormous complexity and scope presented in a language that was accessible to almost any reasonably intelligent person. It took less than a half hour of the movie for me to know without hesitation that it had been drastically dumbed down from a book I hadn't even read. I bought the book the next day and will never bother with another film adaptation of Sagan ever again (and will be hard pressed to justify seeing anything made by those who defiled Sagan in this movie).There are three profound strengths to this book, and the movie only got close to approximating one of them:1) The translation of elaborate concepts and hypotheses of physics and astronomy into lay terms. This is the only area where the film even made a notable attempt. But they still didn't even pretend at nailing it the way the book did.2) The discourse between science and religion. Sagan explored this enduring quandry with a fairness, maturity and intellectual honesty that few authors (and probably no filmmakers) have ever achieved. He also explored the debates with a sense of drama and nuance, while the filmmakers focused more on the fact that the debates were occuring between pretty people with sexual chemistry/tension. Shame.3) The Arroway character was one of the most complete and believable characters I have ever read and, to be frank, the first female lead character I have ever connected with in any way. She was strong and brilliant and confident and hungry while remaining distinctly female and even vulnerable at times. This could only have been achieved by an author with an innate shared passion and sympathy for his character's purpose - in this case science and the search for the answers to some of the ultimate questions about life. The movie made her a sanctimonious whiner. Most of the rest of the characters were tragically dumbed down too.I recommend you read this book. Two or three times. And don't bother with the movie."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"No, I don't know the movie. But the movie cannot be much better than the book. This is Science Fiction at its best: demonstrating the impact of technology and research on our societies. Astronomer Ellie is participating in the search for extraterrestial intelligence and discovers a message sent to earth from the stars. The decoding of the message reveals the plans for building a machine of unknown purpose. And after the construction is finished, Ellie finds herself as part of a crew going boldly to unknown worlds where nobody has gone before (sorry about the comparison).Of course, the entire project encounters several difficulties: Ellie's education as an astronomer (hey, she's a girl), some problems getting the research grants, diplomatic difficulties (the book was written in the early 1980s - before Glasnost and Perestroika), religious fundamentalism, political issues, the power of big industrial companies etc. One might argue that Sagan drags the story's flow a bit when he describes the problems decoding the message and building the machine, but he probably knows far too well that scientific progress is slow, tedious, and not always a straight path.I am amazed that none of my fellow reviewers complained about the scientific content. Here Sagan is the good old educator again, fighting for popularizing science: Several technical details are described and explained; and the funny thing is, of course, that most of the stuff is at least scientifically possible. (If you are more interested how it works, try Jim Al-Khalili's &quot;Black Holes, Wormholes, and Time Machines&quot;. I have also a review on that...)Sagan's book has a strong emphasis on the relation between religion and science which still seems to be of particular importance in the United States. The novel suggests (especially the ending) that science and religion are not opposites but complement each other and that there are signs of the divine (the numinous, as Ellie calls it) in science as well as scientific moments in religion.Read the book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Sagan had the knack of getting his humanistic point of view out without being offensive to the general populace. He was also a great explainer of scientific ideas in a simple way, to make it easy to understand and interesting. I wish he would have lived longer so he could've written more novels. I think novel writing could have been his best skill. He died too young.Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of &quot;Our Brown Eyed Boy&quot;"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"The classic science fiction theme of humanities' first brush with alien intelligence occupies center stage in Sagan's adequate, but not artful, novel.First the bad: In terms of literary style, \\"Contact\\" isn't especially impressive. Indeed, the prose is often awkward and this tends to give the characters a dry, not-quite-believable quality. \\"Contact\\" borders on the verbose---I am confident at least 50 pages worth of dialogue and \\"character development\\" could easily (and beneficially) been omitted. I'm sorry to say that after about 150 pages I very nearly lost all interest in the book. I'm glad I persevered however, because the last half was worth it. And on that note......The good: The scientific foundation and superstructure Sagan builds in this book is solid, credible, believable and interesting to read. Sagan has described a perfectly plausible and substantial \\"real world\\" scenario for first contact. As already mentioned, the second half of the book is where the real strength lies. Sagan takes themes and characters that were rather boring and predictable in the first half and actually makes them interesting, and thankfully, even thought-provoking. For example, I enjoyed the irony of Dr. Arroway having to defend her experience in the Machine vis a vis her antagonism toward other people's religious experiences. Dr. Arroway became a more believable and interesting character in the second half, some situations in her personal life approaching poignancy were very effective in that regard. The completion of the Machine is interesting enough, as well as its subsequent use. All told, \\"Contact\\" finishes strong---read it for yourself and decide!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I saw the movie before reading the novel. In the novel, Ellie Arroway isn't as annoying as the movie's Ellie Arroway: she is not constantly criticizing religion. The movie spent too much time focusing on the question of religion versus science. It is a theme in the novel, but the theme is not as in-your-face as in the movie (for example, Hadden and his Preachnix device).Unfortunately, the novel is very awkward at introducing backstory: a character is introduced and then the next few paragraphs give a quick biographical sketch of the character. Personally, I'd rather have the backstory of a character introduced in pieces and in surprises. For example, Palmer Joss could have been a much more interesting character if his backstory were introduced much slowly. These sketches should have been editted out.The last chapter of the novel, was much better than the movie's end. It would've been nice to see what Ellie did with that information from her mother's letter."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"\\"Contact\\" came to my attention after watching the film, which I dearly love. As books are usually better than films I was elated to finally settle in and begin the journey. I will say that the book and movie are dramatically different in many respects and I love both for different reasons, but this novel surpasses the film in a great many of those respects.Just short of the new Millennium (1999), the Earth receives its first message from intelligent life in outer space. Ellie Arroway is the romantic, ambitious scientist at the center of Sagan's tale and her personal struggles and beliefs, as well as those of her colleagues, magnify the sentiments of the world around them. They are faced with meeting a new alien intelligence, new tests of faith, many of which they would've never expected within the realms of science, and they must come to terms with their new knowledge in order to make sense of an ever-changing world.How would a society react to such a realization of life beyond our planet, how would it affect the everyday lives of those involved, and how would it change the way science and religion function? All of these questions are addressed in Sagan's staggering, uplifting, poignant piece of fiction.Steeped in technical and scientific terms, the book is challenging, but incredibly fulfilling. I came away from the last page with a deep sense of satisfaction, awe, and a great regard for Sagan's method of bringing science to the masses. This book really makes you evaluate the harmony of science and faith and points out that the two, indeed, can work together."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan's Contact is a very well-written, enjoyable books that manages to get a point across and be educational at the same time. Many books have approached the problems of first contact, but few have examined it as thoroughly as Sagan does here. Also, he approaches it in a different way from most. Rather than have the aliens visit the earth, the human race instead picks up artificial radio signals, and... well, I won't spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that Sagan's deep involvement with Project SETA carries over into this book and gives it a highly realistic feel, that along with the well-drawn cast of characters and pseudo-documentary narrative style. Another thing that makes this book worthy is that Sagan weaves his views on such issues as religion (on which he raises some very valid flags), science, government, nationalism, sexism, and aliens. You might not agree with everything he says, but you have to at least allow that he raises some truly tangible points. This is a fine book: well-thought out, info-packed, believable, and readable. My highest reccommendation (and a lot better than the movie, by the way.)"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Yes, I admit, I saw the movie before I read the book. The movie took some serious liberties with the book, presumably to make it translate better to a film (i.e. stepped-up sex, violence, and controversy). The written word, however, can go to depths that the film can not.The character of Ellie Arroway is fleshier and juicier when we are allowed into her most intimate thoughts. A friend of mine, upon seeing me reading the book remarked that the movie was &quot;boring&quot; and that it &quot;dragged&quot;. I found the movie and the book intriguing because Sagan delves deeper into questions I've pondered about in the wee hours of the morning with roommates and close friends and asks the questions that never even entered our minds. Sagan probes the relationship between religion and science and the mutual animosity its respective champions have for each other and their doctrines.The building of the Machine sent (by extraterrestrials from Vega) as a plan over radio waves is almost a secondary plot thread, taking a back seat to more pressing political, theological, and scientific concerns. Imagine receiving this plan in today's world. How many people would assume it was a doomsday machine, or from the devil, or that it was a summons that could not be ignored from a higher technology? How many people would insist we build the Machine, and how many would insist that we should not? How does the world-wide community reconcile its differences, and &quot;get along&quot; so the Machine, which can not be done by one country alone, be built? Fascinating and thought-provoking for me, apparently 'boring' for others, I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I saw the film Contact based on this novel and was totally blown away, so I went out and bought the book, and I'm very glad I did.Unlike other novel to film conversions, the film remains largely faithful to the novel. But, if you've already seen the film, not to worry as reading the novel is not merely repeating what was in the film - there's enough unique (and slightly more technicaly involved) material in the novel, along with a slightly different plot, to make reading the novel quite worth it.Unfortunately, I think the film was slightly dumbed down to be better suited to the movie-going audience - this book is smart, intelligent and thought provoking. And of course the film leaves out a lot of details. For instance, Sagan devotes quite a bit of the beginning of the novel to Elle's childhood - while the film spends some time here, Sagan goes into far more detail in the book, talks at length about Elle's mother etc. In fact, Elle's character in the novel is even better developed than in the film, which is impressive because the film really does an excellent job focusing on Elle and her beliefs.Lastly, without giving anything away, I think reading the novel is worth it just for the ending, which is a bit different than the book and explores a really cool idea relating to the fundamental nature of the universe (or at least our perception of the universe) which I found to be really intruiging."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Historically, intellectuals have philosophized their ideas about god. Hitherto, those philosophies have gained popularity in many's minds. The soul of one's spirituality, faith, and belief is similarly touched in this single work of fiction by one of those former intellectuals. Carl Sagan shows us the universality of faith and spirit in all of our lives, and whole-heartedly encourages us to frame our own ideas of faithful reasoning. Ellie Arroway, the main character, shows the puzzlement of our minds and Palmer Joss, her friend, lover at times, is it's firm-minded, though not closed minded, mediator. Her journey from agnostic to enlightened agnostic occurs with this truth seeker throughout lighting the way and proving connections, comparing the scientific mind with the religious, showing that fine line which separates them. The end of the book shows no conclusion, merely the importance of being open-minded and having an astute mind, an accepting spirit and a rational sould as their parent."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact is a great book that is completely satisfying in the end. I would not say that the plot is completely original but the themes are thought provoking.Does intelligent life exist outside the earth? That is not a controversy in this book because the book is one, fiction and second, SETI is really just a setting for the greater theme of faith, expansion of the mind, etc. It would be like arguing the historical accuracy of \\"War and Peace\\" when the real theme is the growth and changing of the human character.Sagan challenges the reader to think out of our own limited minds when dealing with expansive/infinite concepts like the universe or even God."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I don't know what these one star raters are thinking. If nothing else this book and movie give you some very important things to think about. We are not alone be it an alien civilization or an omnipresent, omniscient God. I like to think that both exist together. There is also the hope that we may be reunited with our lost loved ones, be it in a tropical Pensacola paradise or the Paradise that Christ describes for us in the Bible. Either way it would be wonderful. I can't think of a better way to spend an evening or two reading this book or watching the movie.

She's what we call a &quot;ball of rice&quot; here....no brains, no acting....anyway, CONTACT RULEZ!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I was so awed by the 1997 movie &quot;Contact&quot; with Jodie Foster that I had to read the book. Am I ever glad I did! Carl Sagan weaves together a brilliant story with characters that are true to life, with faults and all. The questions he raises in regards to faith, science and religion are honest ones. Many of them we may never know the answers to until we meet God. I only wish Mr. Sagan had continued on with the story of Ellie in a follow-up novel. It would be wonderful to re-visit her again."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I'm 15 years old and I read many books by Larry Niven And Paul Anderson. But most exiting of all I think was &quot;Contact&quot;. Yeah, I saw the movie, but the book differs a little bit from it. I think that Carl Sagan really knew what he was writing. He discussed some real-life problems, like religion and politics, and he REALLY showed the good and the bad sides of the Human first encounter with an alien race. I really loved the book and I would recommend it for High-School students like me and everyone from that age above!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book (and movie) are at the top of my very long must-read, must-see list. Carl Sagan weaves a brilliant science fiction story that makes us step back and take a look at our faith, whether it is faith in science, God, or humanity. And he tells us that through all of the stuff that we have to muddle through each day, the only thing that matters is love. This is a rare occurrence where both the book and movie are superb and they will leave you enthralled to the very end."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I saw the movie and then read the book. They both were intelligently done. The book is not only entertaining but it also provokes many thoughts about science and religeon. It is full of creativity."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"With my respect to TITANIC's lovers, CONTACT is one of the most fabulous movies I have seen. - People most hungry for meaning : &quot;The one science as valuable give them&quot; ...i.e &quot;science killed GOD&quot;, what if science simply revealed and doesn't exist on the first place.- Okam Rayzer : &quot;Basic Scientific Principal&quot;&quot;All things being equal, the simplest explanation is the right one&quot;===&gt; All powerful mysterious GOD created university and decided not to give any prove of his existence OR Have simply doesn't exist at all and we created him so we don't have to feel so small alone.I like this game.Thomas Al-Hamad"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"First of all let me tell you that I read this book in 1986, very much before the movie. In fact, I've read this book four times since then and it's sincerely the best science fiction I've ever read. I realize that religious and narrow-minded people may not wellcome Mr. Sagan's thoughts. This is quite understandable, since these fellows will hardly be capable of following the book till the end. There's lots of science and little fiction in &quot;Contact&quot; and even the most talented layman will eventualy be led astray. Well, that's life. Sometimes things get complicated. I've been expecting the movie version since I read this book but it was a bit disapointing. On the one hand, Jodie Foster, altough an excelent actress, is not Eleanor Arroway. On the other hand, the story is too complex to fit the big screen and what we saw was a mutilation. Other point is that even Mr. Sagan couldn't predict the fall of the comunism and Contact's soviets are here no more. Except for this and some other minor points the future depicted in &quot;Contact&quot; remains a viable one. The only thing that bother me is the Fermi Paradox: &quot;If life in galaxy is so widespread, where are they ? Why are they so shy ?&quot;"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I hardly give 10 to a book. This one deserves it.Whenever a movie based on a book is released, the book gains attention. Usually, movies are better then their book couterparts. This is not the case. The book is much more complete then the movie, it has a scientific approach. Things that couldn't be used on the movie are available on the book.The ending, for example, is fantastic. I won't tell you how things end, but the feeling you have after finishing the book is that you left the movie in the middle. It's something you just can't imagine. It makes the book worth to read."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I've devoured every Sagan book I could ever get my hands on, but this one did some serious mind numbing. Try this, get out under the summer night sky with a flashlight and read this book. Vega is overhead most of the night and it feels like it is watching you.This book is not about aliens -- it is about how we see ourselves. Carl was underhanded in his writing because your ordinary moke would think it is supposed to be about his view of the future or some factual account. Only it wasn't. Carl wanted to make the reader think about their own life and humanity from a human perspective. I am a true believer that life exists in the Cosmos, but that is completely irrelevant to this book. It is an excellent account of humanity - our flaws (many as there are) AND our triumphs. It is unfair to Carl to subject it to literary or factual critique. What is fair to say is that it most assuredly will make you think. Carl will definitely be missed."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan captures your interest the moment the book begins, not with the science of it mind you, but with the main character, whom one automatically recognizes is a exceedingly gifted, and yet compassionate person. The book details her trials in life, including discrimination, death, and domestic family problems, as well as romance. Sagan of course has a healthy mix of technicality within the book, virtually all of of which is based in fact. Between the characters, which seem all to real, and the actual story line and discovery of extra-terrestrial life, this turned out to be my all time favorite book which has something for everyone to enjoy! Its almost larger than life, and should be considered a classic by future generations."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I loved how Sagan pieced together this novel with telling the reader about Ellies life and gave us all a common bond with her. The detail and the philosophical parts of the book made it intellectual and believable. I loved how he starts with things like her drives on the road with the rabbitts. Then goes on to talk about such things like singularities, but brings us back to the rabbitts.I expected a message from E.T. to come from this book, but I admit from God I didn't. This book isn't for the Roswell fan. It's for the person that likes to think about why we are here, what's right, religion, and ethics. Read this book"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Forget about little green men, flying saucers, and anal-probing experiments! Sagan's &quot;Contact&quot; is the most believable science-fiction I've encountered, and by far the most enjoyable. The political, religious and emotional arguments surrounding the construction of an extraterrestrial device are all considered in detail, leading to an emotionally-charged climax that left me wondering, &quot;What if...?&quot"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"A really great book! I especially like how Sagan emphises the important role of women in science, enginering and in politics, with out trying to fill some &quot;PC&quot; quota. Even though it was probably more entertaining to see clips of Pres. Clinton in the movie, I wasn't suprised to find that the movie version conspiciously edited the part out about the President being a woman. The book is more philosophical and makes more predictions of events that are likely to occur towards the milienium. Really liked both the movie and the book and would highly recommend either! Thank you Carl Sagan"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Enjoyed the book. I would recommend it conditionally to a friend. The story itself was not as important as the interesting and provacative decisions and positions taken by those faced with the real possibility of contact with extraterestrials. I kept wondering if it might be better if Ellie and friends could be removed from the text. It still could stand up as worthy non-fiction book"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan never failes to amaze me. Highly entertaining and enjoyable.

This is one of the best sci-semi-fi novels ever written!&amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;-Jason Conra"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"The book was moderately interesting, but for the most part was slow moving, even plodding, and the ending was very weak--&quot;proof&quot; that God exists appears in the value for pi"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact was the first book in a very long time to touch my soul and make me seriously question what we are all doing here and why? My head tells me one thing, while my heart tells me another. I believe Ellie faced the same dilemna. Without giving away any of the plot, Ellie searches for answers about the eventual whereabouts of loved ones after they have passed from our Earth. Although the book has a lot of technical language (consider it a learning experience) it is well worth the read"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"..and this is from a guy who dropped out of first semester physics. I don't agree with the reviews that have made it sound like Sagan was trying to show off the breadth of his knowledge, or achieve some literary standing that remained out of his range. It was a rare pleasure to read a novel written by someone who expressed (and revived in me) the far-reaching curiosity I knew as a child and teenager.The novel did have a &quot;flat&quot;, restrained feel to it, similar to Sagan's nonfiction, but I felt that this was not inappropriate, given the context (it certainly did not read like a textbook--the reader who said that needs to see some textbooks!). There were some minor unnecessary features, but fewer than I have seen in other authors who turned the experiences of a prior career into a novel (recently I've read a lot of Grisham, for instance), and I wasn't bothered by them.I read the novel after seeing the movie, and recommend this sequence, since I enjoyed the book far more, and particularly because the third act of the book is significantly longer, more scientifically interesting, and more detailed than the one in the movie (although not having read the book beforehand, I enjoyed the movie's version). Although I enjoyed the entire book, the part involving Pi really won me over. I don't know if it was Sagan's idea, but it is the most original sci-fi concept I have read about in years (I haven't gotten a tingle like that for a long time, probably because I keep seeing the same ideas rehashed).He does have some of the same appeal as Crichton. While he is less skilled as a storyteller, he more than makes up for it by having such a well-performed climactic section of the book; he does not suffer from Crichton's typical pattern of amazing and thought provoking openings, an even stretch in the middle, and a formulaic, disappointing wrap-up."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I could tell you why I liked this book, but I think you really need to read it yourself to appreciate it. If you haven't seen the movie yet ---read the book first---!!! The book is a million million times better. A 'must-read' even for those who don't like Sci-Fi"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I'm no literary critic, so I cannot give a good criticism on the structure of the book. However, the book, at the very least, would be a gem for an aspiring wordsmith. It is lovely to see the English language used so eloquently. I sat for hours, with Contact in one hand and a good dictionary in the other.For me, the Message is what's important: Making contact within by making contact without, theology relating to science and science resonating with theology, politics as the ever-present reminder of the egocentrics on all sides. I hope this book moves my fellow readers as it moves me.Contact is a great gift from a great man"},{"Title":"A life for a life (Library of select novels)","review":"I hope this is an integral text, but it contains no information about publication date, copyright, edition, printer, publisher, quality of paper, or even an original title page.The publisher seems to have hired someone to type the title and author's name and 2 copies of a table of contents, the second of which spills over onto the first page of the first chapter. Altogether this is a pretty shoddy presentation for the money. The paper, at least, for now is more or less white, but I doubt that anyone will enjoy this book for long.One doesn't expect -- or want -- a critical apparatus, but there is nothing about this volume to suggest that it reproduces, more of less faithfully, a volume that was widely read and highly popular when it was first published. According to one source, in 1859 it was borrowed from lending libraries as often as Adam Bede.Readers who are interested in Dinah Craik probably have access to interlibrary loan and are advised to seek a librarian's help rather than purchase this book. In future I plan to befriend a librarian and not rely on Kessinger Publishing."},{"Title":"Peterson's Graduate Programs in Arts and Architecture 2001","review":"although it's pretty rare to find any specific information on graduate schools for architecture, i was pretty disappointed with this book. if you're looking for gradute schools for fine arts i think you would be more pleased. i could find much more information on the web about architecture schools than in this guide. the information in pretty limited and i don't think it mentions all of the schools. also, it would have been more helpful if the authors included a ranking of schools."},{"Title":"Red Hills and Cotton: An Upcountry Memory","review":"An English professor I had in college once berated me at a poker game for recommending this book. He had never heard of it. I gave him a copy. I can only imagine the sardonic moment in which he finally picked it up. He loved it. The book was given to me by a Capitol Hill policeman from North Carolina. This is the sort of book that will help Yankee's (like me)to understand the Old South; a truly liberal and enlightened view. This is one of those books, whose author was struck down early in life, that makes you wonder what might have come from his pen had he lived. These are memoirs, memoirs of the old folks that made up the backbone of the South after the Civil War up to the Great Depression, real, living people whom, thorough these pages, become a delight to get acquainted with."},{"Title":"Red Hills and Cotton: An Upcountry Memory","review":"My first contact with &quot;Red Hills and Cotton&quot; was in 1973; I was 4 years old, and my mother had been given the book as a birthday present by my aunt. When I was old enough, I read the book for myself. Ben Robertson is buried in my hometown, and I recognized much of the geography of which he writes. I also recognize much of the human spirit about which he writes - the spirit of the Southern small farmer.Although many of the circumstances of the South have changed since this writing (in the early 1940s), the nature of the people has not changed to a great extent. We may not work the fields each day, but our love of God, family, homeland, adventure, loyalty -- all these things remain close to our hearts and lives. Ben Robertson would still have reason to be proud. Would that he had lived longer and written more!"},{"Title":"Red Hills and Cotton: An Upcountry Memory","review":"This is one of my all time favorites. Being raised on a cotton farm in Texas in the depression, I can relate to it entirely.

It was the main topic of conversation all year."},{"Title":"Red Hills and Cotton: An Upcountry Memory","review":"From a member of the next generation with recollections and experiences of a similar nature, I can assure you that this book gives a highly accurate account of what it was like growing up in the rural South. The next best book of this nature, and one similar to it is \\"Run With the Horsemen\\", by Ferol Sams. Although \\"Run With the Horsemen\\" is classed as a novel, it accurately portrays life in the rural South during the Great Depression. Please don't miss reading either of these great books concerning events that occured at a special time and in a very special place."},{"Title":"Red Hills and Cotton: An Upcountry Memory","review":"I live in the 'red hills' of this book.

Aside from plain information about the artefacts, the book also pays a lot of attention to the social background of the time. As the modern scope of archaeology lies mainly in explaining the past rather than just discovering pots and pans, this information is very welcome. Overall I find that Biers has done an excellent job in writing the book. His information is thorough and detailed and you never get the feeling that something is unclear. The illustrations are superb: you'll find a lot of nice pictures inside that are not just decoration but an essential part of the text.Yet, I take one star off because the presentation of the book isn't always as good. First, there is very little \`division' in each chapter. Each of the ten chapters has a division into art, architecture, sculpture, painting and mosaics and miscellaneous stuff. But it is not enough. For example, one of the chapters is about a few late-classical sculptors, among them Praxiteles, Skopas and Lysippos. All you see though, is one long batch of text under the header \`sculpture'. Especially for students like me, it would be so much more helpful to divide \`sculpture' into more parts and put more heads in the text, for example one with \`Praxiteles' and one with \`Lysippos', etcetera. Now it sometimes becomes unclear what the author is really talking about. Additionally, the author gives a lot of information about different sculptors and styles, but he seldom compares them. And IF he does, the lack of any heads makes the information very difficult to find.Another strange thing was the connection between pictures and text. It often happens that the picture a text refers to, is one or two pages ahead of the text itself. So if page 167 refers to figure 9.25, you have to turn the page before you know what it is about. I think this problem could have been avoided easily with some better editing. Alas, the book has some typographical problems but on the level of information it's very useful and informative. I just hope these flaws will be removed in the next edition, but still recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Archaeology of Greece: An Introduction","review":"If you want a nice introduction to the archaeology of the Greek world, this book is a must.

Besides an astute observer of foreign cultures, we see Miller as a wife, mother and friend.

With her husband and two children in tow, she travels from China through the verisimilitude of mainland Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos). Like THE GUTTERED DOG, Miller achieves a splendid balance between history, politics, current affairs, travel, local color and humor.

Flavel's \\"Keeping the Heart\\" is, in my opinion one of the best books written since the close of the Apostolic age. Flavel is a man who walked with his God - you can sense that as you read. I think this is the most important and also most ignored aspect of the whole of the Christian life: The keeping and right ordering of the heart. Flavel shows that heart work is not only the most important but also the hardest work. THIS heart work is what separates those Christians who go about their business for decades without giving thought to their hearts and those who commune with the Lord in all that they do. Read this book Christian! You will be so blessed."},{"Title":"Keeping the Heart","review":"Puritan John Flavel (1630-1691) in Keeping the Heart (originally titled: A Saint Indeed or The Great Work of a Christian Opened and Pressed) has proven to be a steady and timely friend to me over the last year. This book has been a near constant companion during that time and I have made my way through it a number of times. I suppose that I am familiar enough with the book now to write a review so that others may be encouraged to spend time with this heart-shepherding work as well; however, I in no way do I feel that I have mastered its contents or the practice of them. I am convinced though that this book will prove to me to be a lifelong companion whose true worth I could only underestimate.Using Proverbs 4:23 (\\"Keep your heart with all vigilance for from it flow the springs of life.\\"), Flavel creates a treatise designed for all professing Christians. The aim is that the contents of the heart be laid bare, so that sin which is present is seen as sin and dealt with as a believer should and that the heart be guided to be pure in its devotion and affection for God. He does this, not with law, but by constantly pointing the believer to God's grace as the grounds and means for his sanctification. Flavel is not content to merely convey information, rather, with each point he carefully takes aim at your very soul and deftly fires shot after gospel-saturated, God-glorifying shot. Make sure you read this book slowly and prayerfully, allowing each purifying blow to have its full affect on your heart.The treatise is basically broken down into four sections:1.\\"What keeping the heart presupposes\\" (Six statements describing what is basic in keeping the heart).2.\\"Why keeping the heart is a great business\\" (Six statements and their exposition explaining why the life of a Christian should be described as a life of \\"keeping their heart\\")3.\\"Special seasons for keeping the heart\\" (104 specific pieces of advice particularly tailored for 12 seasons of life in which special diligence is necessary to guard the heart)4.\\"Uses\\" of means in keeping the heart (Examples and guidelines on using information, exhortation, direction, and consolation in the keeping of the heart).Keeping the Heart is a work that is difficult to navigate without seeing the \\"big picture\\" of what Flavel is setting out to do. I therefore recommend you acquire a copy that includes the \\"Outline\\" by Maureen Bradley. Each of the statements, seasons, or uses alluded to in describing the structure of the work has many subpoints underneath it. I would recommend in your reading that you decide to either read one statement/season/use at a time (roughly 10 pages a piece, although they vary dramatically), or to use it devotionally in much smaller chunks by reading one subpoint at a time. After your first time through the work, you will then be able to quickly navigate to the heart-shepherding help that is particular to your struggle or circumstance.You will be well-served to read Keeping the Heart, working through the 17th century language (Flavel is not nearly as difficult as many other Puritans and the Soli Deo Gloria edition has helpfully modernized spelling, formatting, and grammar)."},{"Title":"Keeping the Heart","review":"This is very good work by the fearless Puritan John Flavel. The whole book is basically a discourse on Proverbs 4:23: \\"Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life\\". There are wonderful insights and powerful exhortations dealing with the subject of heart-keeping, and the writing style is easily understood, the sections concise and straightforward. The only drawback is the particular edition Amazon sells - the fascimilie is full of technical errors in punctuation, words cut-off, sentence jumbling. It can get to be a little distracting, like a trainwreck in the middle of a paragraph, severing your concentration till you figure out and try and piece together the typographical error.Otherwise, a very helpful book for believers concerned with keeping their hearts pure before God. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Keeping the Heart","review":"This little Puritan classic is an antidote for hearts torn by the contest of values in the public square, and too much &#34;getting and spending.&#34; It points to the One for whom the earth longed in expectation, but whom we also rejected when He lived among us, &#34;a Man of Sorrows, acquainted with grief.&#34; This book is a primer to help point to the narrow but saving way."},{"Title":"Keeping the Heart","review":"\\"The heart of man is his worst part before it is regenerated, and the best afterward,\\" Flavel writes. \\"It is the seat of principles, and the fountain of actions. The eye of God is, and the eye of the Christian ought to be principally fixed upon it.\\"But what ought we to look for in our self-assessment of our heart? And what dangers assail it given certain seasons in our lives? Flavel is a master physician, giving us the answers to both those questions using as his diagnostic tool the word of God. Indeed every pointer, every prescription, cites Scripture to lend it authority and sends the reader back to the word of God wherein lies our ultimate health. Distilled here is the wisdom of a man of God in whose company we will recharged to \\"keep our heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life\\" (Prov. 4:23)."},{"Title":"Post Office Jobs: Explore and Find Jobs, Prepare for the 473 Postal Exam, and Locate All Job Opportunities","review":"My daughter and I recently took the postal exam for carrier/clerk/sales.

Mencken was a genius in using the English language, and this book was fascinating from that standpoint alone. His views on women, men, and their interactions (both sacred and profane), are challenging to the modern mind and revealing in their historical context. The book is just plain FUN to read.However ... and this is a BIG flaw ... this entire Kindle edition is filled with the most absurd and aggravating typographical errors.

But surely the bad reputation is unjustified, for whether one approves of Mencken's conclusions or not, it would seem hard to deny the nobility of the his intentions in publishing them. He simply wished to help us rid ourselves of some harmful and incorrect stereotypes. To wit: men think they are intelligent and clear-headed while women are emotional and sentimental. But in reality, Mencken explains, it is men who are prone to sentiment and women who are intelligent and clear-headed. Of course many things follow from both the misconception and the \\"truth.\\" Although it may be useful to some people to know Mencken's ideas about the sexes (I find this knowledge useful), perhaps the best reason to read \\"In Defense of Women\\" is that it is incredibly entertaining. If you are not amused by Mencken's style, or if you are afraid that you might encounter an uncomfortable truth or two, then by all means keep safely away."},{"Title":"IN DEFENSE OF WOMEN","review":"This is not a book for faint of heart. No one was better at invective than Mencken, and his defense of women is far more of an attack on men than a defense of the &quot;unfair&quot; sex, as Ambrose Bierce signified our better half. Mencken's basic argument goes something like this: women are pretty bad; men are worse; therefore, women are better than men. This is, to be sure, a gross over-simplification. Mencken's argument is really much more sophisticated and ingenious. He picked it up, he tells us elsewhere, from a madame of a bordello. It contains a great deal more truth than most people would be willing to admit. Mencken's hillarious presentation is recommended only to hardened cynics (which is to say, hardened realists). Sensitive people with &quot;beautiful&quot; souls are well advised to avoid this brilliant book."},{"Title":"IN DEFENSE OF WOMEN","review":"Reading this book made me wonder &quot;where are the men of today who are writing like this on these topics?&quot; -- things like soul mates, monogamy/polygamy, affairs, prostitution, romance novels, Darwin's theory of sexual selection, the double standard, the &quot;Madonna/whore complex&quot; (not called that then), sexual harassment, employment discrimination, abolishing marriage, and declining marriage and birth rates all make an appearance in the book. And much of it retains its essential truth. The more things change...It's especially interesting to see where HLM was right and where he turned out to be wrong. For instance: the book was written just before men gave women the vote (i.e., during World War I, when Mencken was in his mid-to-upper thirties and still a bachelor); Mencken thought women voting would cure politics of rampant corruption -- because women wouldn't allow such shenanigans. This is not to say that he had any kind things to say about the suffragettes. He didn't, and some of what he wrote was outrageously funny. One can extrapolate in a straight line to some of today's feminists.His basic thesis -- which may or may not have been meant to be taken seriously -- is that women are more intelligent than men, the proof being the ease with which they typically defeat men in the war between the sexes:&quot;I am convinced that the average woman, whatever her deficiencies, is greatly superior to the average man. The very ease with which she defies and swindles him in several capital situations of life is the clearest of proofs of her general superiority. She did not obtain her present high immunities as a gift from the gods, but only after a long and often bitter fight, and in that fight she exhibited forensic and tactical talents of a truly admirable order. There was no weakness of man that she did not penetrate and take advantage of. There was no trick that she did not put to effective use. There was no device so bold and inordinate that it daunted her.&quot;It would be fifty years before Esther Vilar's &quot;The Manipulated Man&quot; continued with many of the same themes. But Mencken was quite prescient in the section on women's martyrdom, which today we'd call their claim to victimhood or being &quot;oppressed&quot;. I could go on at some length about how close his description of marriage is to what prevails today (based on reports which come to my attention), but I'll spare you.I'm sorry I waited so long to get around to this book, as it's truly a classic written by a great mind -- a highly recommended trip above the stratosphere for all men and, especially, bachelors."},{"Title":"IN DEFENSE OF WOMEN","review":"Undoubtedly, HL Mencken was the greatest American mind of the 20th century. It is my opinion that he was possibly the greatest man of letters in the world during the 20th century. He seems to me to be a combination of his two predecessors, Mark Twian and Ambrose Bierce, with all the bad alloyed out.Shaw? Orwell? Pikers all, compared to the Holy Terror from Baltimore. This book is simply fantastic. Simply reading the preface for the first time left me breathless and in amazement.The writing is so good, let me illustrate- a black writer was assigned a story on Mencken, because it was heard Mencken was a racist (which he was). Upon reading Mencken for the first time, the man said his original purpose melted away to be replaced with a single question. &quot;How does one write like that? How can I write like that?&quot;. I concur- HL Mencken was the finest purveyor of ideas in any man during the 20th century.By this book. Then buy all his others, starting with the Mencken Chrestomathy's and his Prejudice series.

Do not purchase this edition."},{"Title":"IN DEFENSE OF WOMEN","review":"Mencken wrote that \\"Nothing could be plainer than the effect that the increasing economic security of women is having upon their whole havit of life ... The diminishing marriage rate and the even more rapidly diminishing birth rate show which way the wind is blowing . . . large numbers of them [women] now approach the business [of marriage] with far greater fastidiousness than their grandmothers.\\" So as a result, only relatively skilled men are marriageable, and lower-class men go without. By contrast, in the past \\"even marriage with a fifth-rate man was better than no marriage at all.\\"Mencken also correctly predicted that even after the influx of women into the workplace, women will still lag behind men economically: he writes that \\"it is impossible to imagine a genuinely intelligent human being becoming a competent trial lawyer, or buttonhole worker, or newspaper sub-editor, or piano tuner, or house painter. Women, to get upon all fours with men in such stupid occupations, will have to commit spiritual suicide, which is much further than they will ever actually go. Thus a shade of their present superiority to men will always remaijn, and with it a shade of their relative inefficiency, so marriage will remain attractive\\".Mencken also predicts loosened sexual mores: \\"With the decay of the ancient concept of women as property there must come inevitability a reconsideration of the whole sex question.\\"And of course all these things have come to pass, both in America and in Europe: well-employed women marry later or not at all and get divorced more quickly, and low-income women have virtually abandoned marriage altogether.Mencken only runs aground when he looks at war and peace. He correctly predicted World War II (in particular predicting wars between France and Germany, and between Japan and America) but thought that it would be so devastating, and wipe out so many of the world's men, that women would vastly outnumber men, which in turn would radically modify marriage- perhaps by causing the reinstitution of polygamy. Had WW 2, like WW 1, killed only soliders, Mencken might have been right. Instead, of course, millions of civilians were killed- including many women, thus limiting the male/female imbalance."},{"Title":"IN DEFENSE OF WOMEN","review":"I have read numerous accounts (most notably in the journal of the Mencken Society) that assume that Mencken was being ironic in the pages of this book, but I am gladdened and relieved to see that the other reviewers here got it right. The omniscient Mr. Mencken simply observes that men are forever being bamboozled by women.But there's a great variety of Mencken's wisdom on tap in this slim volume -- such as,\\"The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.\\" (Page 53 of the 1926 edition)"},{"Title":"IN DEFENSE OF WOMEN","review":"H.L. Mencken has done us all a favor here with his remarkably eloquent and well-mannered discussion of one of the most polarizing issues out there. Mencken proves his ability to think outside the masses with this pithy manifesto on the nature of man and woman's dynamic. The writing is just plain entertaining. He writes what he thinks, which is something almost unheard of in this day and age. We are now tasked to write what we can support with \\"stats and hard evidence,\\" rather than what we observe in the real world.Male readers will be surprised by his disgust with their small mindedness and wayward industriousness. Female readers will be similarly off put with his casual unearthing of their deviousness, and remarks on their capacity for male production. I will resist giving away too much of his argument because this piece could be read almost entirely on a lazy Sunday.This book will leave you much more informed when encountering the modern male/female books which resoundingly declare females as the future of our species. What we will find is that the situation is much more complex, as we may not all be reduced to workers competing for financial success.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"IN DEFENSE OF WOMEN","review":"In his inimitable style the Sage of Baltimore trenchantly analyzes the relationship between the sexes and concludes that women are the superior gender. Before feminists get too excited, it should be noted that most people would probably regard Mencken's analysis as a backhanded compliment, for he doesn't praise women for some preternatural goodness or nobility, but for their Nietzschean Will to Power, clear eyed realism, Machiavellian calculation, lack of sentimentality, and ethical apathy. Men may regard themselves as superior because they've mastered one of the various idiotic trades, like business or politics- to which the women of Mencken's time rarely lowered themselves- but in the battle where it counts, women almost invariably end up the victor over a defeated and enslaved man.

Lady Potford introducing her grandson by his first name? Going down to the kitchen herself to see how dinner preparations are coming?? Balogh seems to be slipping on both her research and her segues.I'm missing something here. Balogh has been going on and on about Bedwyns marrying only for love so why is it that Lady Freyja believes she has to take what's offered? Then there's the nonsense of the fake betrothal. Sure, she's a duke's daughter and sister so the normal rules of chaperonage can be somewhat ignored but sex before marriage is not one of those rules that can be ignored no matter one's station. So just how does Freyja justify making love with Joshua while having no intention of staying with him??In spite of this anomalies, this has definitely been a lively romance with a strong-willed heroine and a hero whose sense of humor I very much enjoyed. The cheeky boy! I did enjoy Joshua's compassion for his cousins.The StoryA chance encounter in the middle of the night when a strange gentleman invades her room is followed up in Bath with a second chance encounter in Sydney Gardens that results in two punches to Hallmere's nose by Lady Freyja. She has threatened to expose him and so she does at full volume the very next morning when she meets him at the Pump Room. Whereupon the tables are turned and it is Freyja's turn to be embarrassed.Hallmere and Freyja share too much in intelligence, humor, and a low threshold for boredom and when Hallmere jokingly requests Freyja's aid in thwarting his aunt, she leaps into the spirit of the thing and consents to a faux betrothal. A betrothal that is always going to end tomorrow only tomorrow never seems to come. And the more Freyja sees of Hallmere's true nature, the less she wants to lose him.The CharactersLady Freyja Bedwyn is the eldest of the old Duke's daughters and close to being on the shelf. Her first betrothal ended when her fianc&eacute; died. Her second betrothal never quite got off the ground. Now, she's more interested in enjoying herself and avoiding being home at Lindsey Hall when the love of her life's wife has their baby. Wulf Bedwyn, the Duke of Bewcastle is seen as a cold, aloof man. Her brothers, Lords Aidan and Rannulf have just married this past year and are very happy in their brides, Eve and Judith. Lord Alleyne is still single and the baby, Lady Morgan, is to have her come-out next Season.Kit Butler, angry over Freyja's rejection, brought home his own bride, Lauren Edgeworth, who has just given birth to a baby boy.Miss Martin's School for Girls on Sutton Street in Bath is led by Miss Martin, the one governess who walked away from the Bedwyn employment and refused any aid from the Duke. Lady Freyja arranges for a position there for Miss Anne Jewell.Miss Charlotte Holt-Barron invites Lady Freyja to spend some time with them in Bath thereby enabling Freyja to meet Joshua when he comes to meet his grandmother, the Dowager Lady Potford. The Earl of Willet is interested in Freyja, poor thing.Joshua Moore, Marquess of Hallmere, inherited his title when his uncle died. He returns to Penhallow when he receives notice that his aunt has found someone to accuse him of murder.Joshua's cousins all like him and include Lady Constance, the eldest daughter; while she likes Joshua she does not love him or want to marry him. Lady Chastity has some nasty secrets she's hiding while Lady Prudence is 18 and will always be much younger. The Rev. Calvin Moore is Joshua's heir. The Dowager Marchioness of Hallmere, Joshua's Aunt, is a frail-appearing bitch while Mrs. Lumbard was his aunt's bosom bow and neighbor in Penhallow, Cornwall and hated Joshua with a passion especially after he taught her daughter Petunia a word he learned in the stables when he was 10.The CoverA bit dull really in spite of its bright royal blue background. The title is somewhat inaccurate for if society ever found out, it would be a great deal more than Slightly Scandalous!"},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"I loved reading about Freyja Bedwyn.

Freyja was different in this book than the others. She was more...haughty. But not really. It was written that she was, but I couldn't believe it because she never struck me as conceited. Honestly, I admire Joshua's patience for her. She was rude in this.I must comment one one particular thing. In the beginning, we see a glimpse of Miss Martin's school, which ends up becoming a series later on. Miss Martin was extremely rude to Freyja in this little scene. I never understood why Freyja wouldn't let Miss Martin know that she was helping her."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"Freyja Bedwyn, I must confess, irritated me profoundly at first; as did Joshua; but there you go.However, anyone can experience a change of heart and I began to feel more kindly towards Freyja on her visit to Miss Martin's school, finding there was more to her than grumpiness and being disagreeable.It took a little longer to get into Joshua, but that occured when he bested Lady Freyja in the Pump Rooms, when she confronted him about his behaviour towards a young girl in Sydney Gardens. It was enjoyable to see her getting a deserved come-uppance.Then we were off at the gallop on the slightly well-worn path of a spurious engagement, but it is charmingly done and convincing, the protagonists subsequent adventures amusing but also revealing of their deeper characters. They could not, after all, go on being haughty/disagreeable and a perpetually twinkling charmer, as with Freyja and Joshua, without becoming a bore. Thankfully, they did not and their eventual happy ending was a satisfying conclusion.I did enjoy this novel but not quite as much as the others in the series.I have one small caveat. Unusual in the Mary Balogh books I've read there is an inaccuracy in describing the Circus. There would not have been 'magnificent ancient trees' in the Circus at that time. Initially, the Circus was paved over, allowing an unobstructed view of, and for, all the houses. There was a central reservoir beneath the stone slabs to supply the houses with their water, although it was not piped in. It still had to be fetched in buckets. The plane trees were not planted until several decades after the King's Circus was completed so would have been relative striplings at the time of which Mary Balogh writes. In fact, Bath purists are still debating to this day whether the now majestic trees should be removed in order to adhere to John Wood's original intention of a panoramic sweep! So far, the trees have won the argument.Patricia R Olds. Author."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"This book is great. I love Freyja she is such a spit fire.

Lady Freya found the marquess's audacity and devil may care attitude too much to bear; on the other hand, the marquess found Lady Freya's quick temper and high handed attitude far too amusing for words. And yet, when the confining Bath society practically forces the pair to cross paths over and over again, neither can deny the attraction that each feels for the other. So that when the marquess proposes that Lady Freya pretend to be his fiancee in order to avoid the matrimonial plans that his aunt has for him, Lady Freya finds herself agreeing to the scheme. After all it will cause her nothing to extract herself from this pretend engagement with a gentleman she considers to be a care-for-naught fribble, and in the meantime she would really enjoying thwarting the marquess's aunt's schemes! The last thing she expected was for her brother, the Duke of Bewcastle, to hear about her 'engagement' or for her to learn that there was a lot more to the Marquess of Hallmere than meets the eye -- things that would make him a lot more appealing and lovable to Lady Freya. But Lady Freya has already decide that she has no intention of falling in love with the marques or of marrying him. Will the marquess change Lady Freya's mind, or will Lady Freya stubbornly cling to course that she has decided on?What made this novel really readable (aside from the compelling storyline) was the manner in which both Lady Freya's and the marquess's characters were 'fleshed out.' From the previous few books (as well as the first few chapters of this one) you get an impression of Lady Freya's character that is not always admirable -- or at the very least you could say that Lady Freya is not the typical romance heroine. And yet as the book progresses and Lady Freya's character is laid out for us to see and appreciate, we get to appreciate the humour, courage, steadfastness and strong moral center that this character possesses. So that in spite of her quick temper, pride and autocratic behaviour, one comes to root for Lady Freya to find the happiness and contentment that is her due. Similarly with the marquess, who first comes across as a rakish fribble but whom we come to realise is a lot more honourable and noble than we had been originally been led to believe.Storywise \\"Slightly Scandalous\\" is a little more complex than the previous to books in the series -- but I won't go into this so as not to spoil things. True, things do get bogged down a little towards the end, esp since of Lady Freya's insistence on holding the marquess at arm's length makes very little sense. On the whole though, \\"Slightly Scandalous\\" proved to be a really worthwhile and enjoyable read, and definitely one that should not to be missed."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"I really didn't expect to like this book since Freyja was not very likeable in previous books. Plus authors often don't present the story of the sisters in a family series too well. Don't know why that is. However, we are dealing with Mary Balogh here, so.......Even though it took me awhile to warm up to Freyja, I loved Joshua right of the bat. Their arguments were great although I feel there was too much fist throwing by Free. Once, to prove she was a Bewcastle, would have been plenty. Well, the one toward the end of the book was satisfying. But beating up on the hero more than once was too much.All in all, I enjoyed the book a lot. Now, I want to read the stories of the other 3 Bewcastles. Even though Wulfric reminds me a lot of Jo Beverly's Rothgar, I'm sure he'll be my favorite. I love a good brooding, emignatic hero.I did like the fact that the three &quot;Slightly....&quot; books were published one month after another. At no loss of quality. Ms. Balogh is truly at the top of her field."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"I really disliked Lady Freyja Bedwyn when she was first introduced in the wonderful \\"A Summer to Remember\\". She was haughty, disdainful, spoiled and downright nasty! But Slightly Scandalous takes us into the heart and mind of this feisty, proud and complex woman and by the end of this book, I admired the woman she became once she let herself love and be loved by the unconventional and decidedly unstuffy Josh.Freyja had been engaged to Kit Butler, her neighbor, childhood friend and, for one summer, her first love. But Kit had other plans, bringing home his own bride (lovely and perfect Lauren) whom Freyja chooses to despise. Now their first child is due any day and Freyja cannot bear to be around to witness their happiness. And so she makes for Bath to stay with friends until after the birth and ensuing festivities. While staying the night at an inn, a man bursts into her room asking her to hide him then steals a kiss and earns a punch in the nose for his efforts before being forced out the window.Once in Bath, routine and tedium take hold until Freyja meets up again with her midnight visitor from the inn. He is Joshua Moore, Marquess of Hallmere. He constantly has an amused, mischievous twinkle in his eye and he loves to push Freyja's buttons. He may be infuriating, but she quickly realizes that he is the most interesting and enjoyable company she's had since coming to Bath. Together they become the talk of the town and when a plot is discovered to marry Josh off against his will, he asks Freyja to enter into a fake betrothal to thwart his aunt. She agrees thinking it will be a fun and temporary lark.How wrong they both are and soon things have gone way too far when Freyja's brother, the Duke of Bewcastle arrives in Bath demanding to know what is going on. Each time they try to end the betrothal something comes up that causes them to keep up the charade. And the more time they spend together, the worse it gets, for they are slowly becoming quite attached to one another. Freyja starts to see that Josh is more than just a shallow, handsome, enjoyable companion. He's kind, generous, down-to-earth and seems willing to take on his responsibilties to his estate and his female cousins. And Josh more than admires Freyja's spirit, intelligence, and new-found open mindedness and wonders why they must part at all. But will Freyja be willing to risk giving her heart a second time? Can she trust Josh with it?An enjoyable couple who brought out the best in one another and were truly friends as well as lovers. A highly recommended read!"},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"Ms. Balogh accomplishes what a talented few can... three wonderful books in a series, with each and every one standing firmly on its own merits as exceptionally entertaining romances!I won't give a synopsis of the plot, since other reviewers have done so in detail, but I will just say that, I love Joshua, the hero in this book! He is a strong character, quite capable of handling the conflicts that arise throughout the book, but it's his witty repartee and wonderful sense of humor with which he views life and his &quot;fiancee&quot; that captured my attention, kept me grinning with each passing page, and made me fall in love.And I must give Ms. Balogh an A+ for managing to turn around my opinion of the oh-so-serious tomboy sister-of-a-Duke, known as &quot;Free&quot; to her family. Joshua's ability to &quot;take her down a peg or two&quot; is so well written, you just have to laugh! She becomes the perfect balance to the fun-loving Marquess and their initial encounters, which ultimately lead to a full-blown relationship that's very real indeed, were an absolute joy to read!I highly recommend this series: Just in case, for those who don't already know... the order is Slightly Married, Slightly Wicked and Slightly Scandalous... so far. Can't wait for Wulf's tale!"},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"Lady Freyja Bedwyn is not the usual Regency romance haute ton beauty. In fact she is not a beautiful woman at all, although many would call her handsome, with her prominent nose, dark brows, olive complexion, and mass of fair unruly hair. Her high spirits, independence and competitive ways are anything but ladylike. She was raised with her four older brothers, Wulfric, Duke of Bewcastle, Aiden, Rannulf, Alleyne and younger sister Morgan, and matched her male siblings in all their sporting activities. She was definitely not one to sit still and play the fragile female.The story opens with Lady Freyja visiting friends in Bath. She has escaped the christening of her ex-fiance's son back home and is depressed by old memories of a time when they were betrothed. She hides her vulnerability behind a veneer of icy pride. In an outrageous encounter on her journey to Bath she meets Joshua Moore, Marquess of Hallsmere, when he barges into her bedroom at a local inn and begs her to hide him. The two meet again in Bath under extremely funny circumstances. This brash, adventurous young man is fleeing his aunt's matchmaking schemes and is much taken by the strongwilled Freyja. There is obvious chemistry between them. In a spontaneous moment the two decide to fake a betrothal - he to get away from his aunt's matrimonial plans, she to prove to the world that she need not remain a spinster. Obviously fate intervenes and the couple is unable to announce their break-up within the week as they originally planned.This is the last book in the Bedwyn family trilogy. &quot;Slightly Scandalous,&quot; as with the first book &quot;Slightly Married,&quot; makes for a light and pleasant romantic read. The plot is not very original, although it is much more complex than the storyline in book one. I did like Josh as a hero. He appears quite cavalier at first, but then the depth of his character becomes obvious. I also enjoyed the scenes with their families at their different estates - Freyja's at Lindsey Hall and Josh's in Cornwall. The other characters are charming if predictable. Ms. Balogh writes in her usual warm, emotional style which enhances the somewhat over-used plot. I enjoyed reading &quot;Slightly Scandalous&quot; and do recommend it as long as potential buyers/readers realize that this is not Ms. Balogh's best effort.JANA"},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"If you've been following the Bedwyn series, you'll already know Lady Freyja Bedwyn. Haughty, shrewish, with the prominent Bedwyn nose and, at best, referred to as 'handsome', her best feature is her family name and wealth. She's refused suitors galore and frozen others out long before they've had a chance to get close to proposing. Up to this point, you might be forgiven for thinking that she doesn't have a lot to recommend her as a heroine. You might be forgiven for actively disliking her.Balogh goes some way to change readers' perceptions of Freyja in the first chapter. She's travelling to Bath, to stay with people she doesn't really like very much, but then she doesn't want to be anywhere near the Bedwyn family home at the moment because their neighbours, the Ravensburgs, are about to have their first child... and Freyja was all-but jilted by Kit Ravensburg (A Summer to Remember) and she hasn't yet got over that. En route to Bath, her bedroom is invaded by a man who begs her not to reveal his presence and then hides in the wardrobe. She doesn't give him away, but when he kisses her she gives him a bloody nose. Well, we find out that she's no shrinking violet, certainly. Next, we get an intriguing glimpse of her visiting a school to enquire after its well-being and being sent away with a flea in her ear by the owner... who we discover was a former governess of Freyja's and whom she treated badly. Unknown to the governess, Freyja has been secretly funding the school ever since - another insight into her character.Freyja's mysterious inn encounter turns out to have been with none other than Joshua, the Marquess of Hallmere. They clash again in Bath, but then begin to find that they actually enjoy each other's company. Then, as Joshua is being actively pursued and almost compromised into marrying a cousin, Freyja agrees to 'rescue' him by pretending to be his fiancee, an arrangement they will call off once Joshua feels safe. All's well that ends well - until someone gossips in the Duke of Bedwyn's hearing. The Duke hurries to Bath to find out what his sister is up to and insists that she bring her fiance home to meet the family. All is still well, as they plan for Freyja to break off the engagement with some excuse later... and yet she doesn't. When Joshua finds himself accused of murder, Freyja and most of the Bedwyns decamp to his home to help him clear his name, and he and Freyja are even more cast into each other's company. Can Freyja trust Joshua enough to overcome her determination that he's not a good husband? Does he really want to marry her anyway, or is he just teasing?By this time, I was getting a little tired of the 'fake betrothal' plot; we've had it three times, what with A Summer to Remember, Slightly Wicked and now this book, plus the marriage of convenience in Slightly Married. Yet I should have trusted Balogh. The execution of the plot isn't at all cliched, and the characters sparkle. It didn't take me long at all to feel empathy and then liking for Freyja - if you're tired of prim-and-proper heroines, then she's perfect. She's forthright, which means she puts her foot in it, but her heart's in the right place. Joshua is irreverent, with a huge sense of fun, which leads Freyja to think that he can't take anything seriously - which isn't true, but he enjoys letting her think that it is. Their dialogue sparkles, and Joshua himself is a worthy hero. Probably the best of the first three books."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"We meet Lady Freyja Bedwyn in \\"A Summer to Remember\\" and she is haughty, stuck-up and insufferable. Throughout the first two Bedwyn books she remains so, although she does eventually grow on the reader. In \\"Slightly Scandalous\\" we finally get a glimpse into Freyja's mind, and what a mind it is. FINALLY, a heroine who does not simper or whine or play coy. Even though all of Balogh's heroines are wonderful in their own way, Freyja is simply the best. And, oh my, the hero of the novel, Joshua Moore, Marquess of Hallmere! What a catch. FINALLY, a man who laughs at the woman, instead of getting into a snit because she doesn't fawn over him. Both leads are remarkable. There are no frustrating misunderstandings in this novel. When Freyja gets uppity, Josh laughs at her, forcing her to laugh at herself. The characters are multi-dimensional and just so wonderfully human. The comraderie and loyalty of the Bedwyns has never been stronger than in this book. It was nice to see them all interact and play with each other. I appreciated their bond, even Wulfric seemed human.I have read five of Mary Balogh's novels and not one of her heroines has been like the other. Nor her heroes either. Often romance authors stick with stock characters and they are all interchangeable (Julie Garwood and Judith McNaught for instance...but hey, they found a formula that worked for them.) It is refreshing though to pick up a romance novel and read it and know that I am going to be reading a NEW story, one that hasn't been retold a thousand times over.I did not want to finish \\"Slightly Scandalous\\" because I didn't want to be finished with Freyja and Josh. Hopefully I will see them at least three more times as I read the rest of the novels in the series.Thank you, Ms. Balogh, for giving your readers a heroine and a hero to cheer for."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"Lady Freyja Bedwyn is staying in an inn on her way to Bath when Joshua Moore, Marquess of Hallmere bursts into her room and hides in the wardrobe.

Further meetings take place in Bath and after clearing up their misunderstanding Freyja agrees to pose as Joshua's fiancee to thwart plans by his aunt to get Joshua to married to his cousin. As time goes by their betrothal becomes more and more real as do their feelings for each other.This book was a wonderful regency romp. The hero is a mischievous rogue with a heart of gold and the heroine is a headstrong lady with a punch that packs. Freyja is not a typical beauty but Joshua sees her as his beautiful untamed lady anyway. It was great to see the two antagonists fall in love with each other and realise that their betrothal is more than a fake one. A very good read indeed and I can't wait to read the other books in the series.Lealing"},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"Oho ... who would think that the &quot;slightly&quot; series could get even better? Well it just has!Honestly, this is the first (sorely waited) story for a side character, Freyja first appeared in 'a summer to remember', that has actually exceeded my expectations and had exactly the kind of exciting, interesting story I have believed the portrayed character, Freyja, would have (or rather demand)!!Freyja Bedwyn and Joshua Moore (Marquess of Hallmere) are two thoroughly interesting characters who embark on numerous adventures together and end up falsely bethrothed along the way ..... the question for Freyja is does she want a real bethrothal with &quot;the man&quot;?? I won't ruin all the wonderfully witty things that occur in this story, but let you delve into the depths of this excellent book yourself.If you love &quot;fresh&quot; story-lines, conversations that make you laugh out loud, and characters that are honest to themselves with their own feelings (and not simpering idiots) .... then this is definitely a book you will love! Freyja is the most entertaining, unique &quot;leading lady&quot; that I have EVER read about in a romance novel ........ she is simply fabulous!This is definitely worth your trouble .... buy it/borrow it, do whatever needs to be done to get your hands on it and read to your hearts content ...... you will not be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!! .... you have my guarantee ... good reading, Kristina"},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"Wow - I wasn't sure that even Mary Balogh could make Lady Freyja Bedwyn someone I would like as a heroine; but she did it in spades!We have seen Lady Freyja in 'Summer to Remember' and the two previous Bedwyn books and know her as a tomboy (hoyden), not pretty (how can she be with the family hooked nose) and we have had hints that she is far more vulnerable than surface appearances might suggest. 'Slightly Scandalous' lets us enjoy watching her deal with her past and her insecurities, this kind of character development the Balogh does extremely well and which I thoroughly enjoy.Briefly, the book starts when Lady Freyja is on her way to Bath - to escape the family home during the celebration of Kit and Lauren's (Summer to Remember) first child - and meets the charming and bold Joshua Moore (Marquess of Hallmere) who is escaping the clutches of a fortune hunting \\"young miss\\" who is trying to compromise him. This hilarious (to us the reader!) encounter ends with considerable misunderstanding on the part of our H/H. Watching them meet again in Bath and get acquainted is delicious. I especially liked the \\"big scene\\" in the Pump Room. Besides learning about the people, we get an excellent \\"portrait\\" of Bath as a slightly pass&eacute; summer retreat for Society.Enter Joshua's aunt (the villain of the piece) and her grand scheme to coerce her nephew into marrying his cousin Constance (her eldest daughter) just to keep control of the estate and money. Joshua and Freyja enter into a mock betrothal to foil her plans, with all sorts of ramifications! ( I found it a bit hard to swallow the characterization of Lady Hallmere - but was able to suspend judgment to further the \\"plot\\".)Our protagonists then move back to the Bedwyn family home due to the intervention of Wulfric, the Duke (who else). Here we are treated to a glimpse of family life and see Freyja begin to face her true feelings about Kit. Further machinations on the part of Lady Hallmere (she dreams up an accusation of murder against Joshua) move Joshua, Freyja, Lord Alleyne and Lady Morgan all to Cornwall and Joshua's estate. There is not a great deal of tension or mystery involved; Joshua pretty competently sorts everything out. There are, however, some excellently drawn secondary characters in this part of the book for example, Joshua's younger cousin Prudence (who is mentally handicapped) and even the deceased Albert.All in all a book rich in character -best of the three Bedwyn books so far. I recommended it"},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"Again, I have to play both sides of the coin, as I have done with the other Balogh books that I have read. I've got some good things, and some bad things that I can say.Overall, the book wasn't too bad. I ended up not disliking Freyja as much as I did in the previous books, but I still didn't quite like her. She was a bit too much of a snob. I really enjoyed Josh, though. The romance was fairly nice between Josh and Freyja, and the overall storyarc made sense and all that. I liked the parts surrounding Josh's family. It added some nice depth to the story. So yeah, overall, I didn't mind the book so much.On the flip side of the coin, I became increasingly aware during reading the book, that Balogh really likes to recycle her own ideas. It got annoying. Part of the main hook in the book was a fake betrothal between Freyja and Josh. That was by far not original for Balogh, and especially this series. In the prequel, A Summer to Remember, Lauren and Kit do the exact same thing for pretty much the exact same reasons. And in Slightly Married, Aidan and Eve enter into an almost fake marriage - one of convenience. So having that same hook used for Slightly Scandalous was tedious and repetitive.And even aside from that Balogh, has a tendency to recycle even simple things. The characters tend to have almost the exact same thoughts or phrasing on something that should be original to them. And she's ended the books almost all the same. I think it was in A Summer to Remember where Lauren speaks about the sea, calling it wild and uncontrollable..and all these other more poetic descriptions. Then in Slightly Scandalous, Freyja says almost the exact same thing. It struck me as ridiculously unoriginal. She also likes to have her characters say something like \\"no, I do not want happily-ever-after; I just want happiness\\" or something to that effect. It's a nice line, but having too many characters in too many books repeat it takes away it's effectiveness. Then there's the endings of the books. They all seem to end with a wedding scene followed by the bride and the groom standing outside the church before all the revelers, wondering if they should just mosey on along to their carriage, or whether they should make a spirited run for it. It was cute the first 1 or 2 times...but as an ending to every book? Not so much. It's unrealistic and silly. And one of the biggest annoyances? The use of the word \\"haughty\\". I'd hate to see a word count of it. It'd be astronomical. I think the word comes up in every sentence Wulf is mentioned, and if not haughty, then cold. By the end of Slightly Scandalous, I wanted to bang my head into a wall.I think if a person read the books in the series over a longer course in time, instead of one after another like I'm doing, these things could probably be overlooked. But when read quickly together, the faults really stand out. Even so, it wasn't really a bad story. I didn't mind it so much."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"sometimes a rogue with a hellraising reputation can actually be so much more. Lady Freya is from a haughty - high in the instep family , which often seem way too severe, to critical and too reserved to be of interest. Joshua Moore, a marquess could not appear to be more opposite as a mate to Freya. They meet on the way to Bath, as he burst into her inn room, escaping from a marriage trap. Everything goes down hill between them, as they meet again in Bath. Freya gives him a royal set down in front of many witnesses, for improper actions toward a serving girl. Well, sometimes opposites attract and these two begin to spar, they begin to chat and each time they come together they find that to releave the bordom of Bath, they actually are enjoying each others company. Joshua then finds he needs her help, to get out of a betrothal announcement by a pushy relative to his cousin. So he and Freya pretend to become engaged - just temporarily. Both families get involved and the engagement takes a life of its own. The longer it lasts, the more these two find there is much more to the other, and of course passion gets involved! I think one of the best parts was Freya realizing there was so much more to Joshua, she might actually be able to love this man. Of course she is so afraid to give her heart again and be rejected. The longer Joshua is with Freya he realizes he wants this for his future, but seems uncertain as to how to convince her of his true feelings. As the passion become very real, and they both come to grips with their feelings, this book indeed evolves into a beautifully written love story!"},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"The Bedwyns are modelled on the Mallorens by Jo Beverly, and I have to say that neither famil has ever appealed to me. Freya is the least likable of all the Bedwyns, and the tired predictable ploting just make this book plod along. The secondary characters are far more interesting than the hero and heroine, and the fake engagement is taken straight out of A Summer to Remember which was how this whole turgid series got started. Either the author is really running out of ideas, that she has to keep repeating herself or copying others' series, or the state of the romance industry is so sad that only the same kinds of books over and over again sell. Or maybe they just cash in on the author's name and reputation and assume they can give any old schlock to readers and they will spend money on it. Whatever the reasons, I long for a good juicy romance with characters who really know and understand each other, and who can have a good happy romping love scene without constant undertones of violence and depravity. Where is the sensuality and love? It is all animal passion and not even respect or regard for the other person as a human being most of the time. Thank goodness this series is over. I was dreading having to sit through the rest of the horrible Bedwyn brood."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"You have the opportunity to read more indepth reviews, mine will be succinct. Freyja is a difficult heroine but I think could have been made more likeable if those glimpses of humor were fleshed out more. Joshua was a likeable rogue with a quick wit. Freya's character needed to loosen up. The storyline got tiresome and it was a chore to finish the book. I understand pride but Freyja's became mulish. I would have given 2 stars but I liked Josh's character. He had many layers without being brooding and sullen"},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"I would have liked the book more, if the whole plot about the Bedwyns had been more original.It seems to me that the author is trying to imitate Jo Beverley's Mallorens (I prefered the Mallorens a whole lot better than the Bedwyns!) Look at the similiarities in the two series: four brothers and two sisters, including an intimidating eldest brother( Rothgar in the Mallorens case and Wulf in the Bedwyns case). Even their names are similar. Rothgar's actual name is Beowulf and Wulf's is actually Wulfric. My, what a coincidence!I'm quite disappointed in mary balogh this time round. The Bedwyns will never take the place of the Mallorens."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"We last saw Lady Freyja Bedwyn in Ms. Balogh's captivating gem A Summer To Remember and she is now the central protagonist in the conclusive episode to the Slightly series. A haughty and spirited character, Freyja is seen retreating to Bath to avoid the christening of the son of ex-flame Viscount Ravensburg who spurned her for icy maiden Lauren Edgeworth. A brief sojourn turns into an adventure as she meets Joseph Moore, Marquess of Hallsmere in her inn bedroom as he hides in the cupboard to escape a bunch of wedding schemers. A misunderstanding ensues when Freyja chances upon Joseph with a screaming lady on his way to visit his grandmother at Pulteney Street. She denounces him as a libertine in front of the ton at the Pump Room.You would never expect this two to turn up allies in a scheme to thwart a marriage-foisting ploy concocted by Joseph's aunt. They recklessly engage themselves to each other and Freyja's protective brother Bewcastle arrives to prevent further mischief. Freyja and Joseph feel growing attachments as understanding develops; Freyja's insecurity with love after her devastating rejection and Joseph's hidden secret in shouldering his cousin's disgrace.Slightly Scandalous wraps up the Bedwyn series beautifully and is a renewed testament to Balogh's ease and fluidity in her character sculpting. The sparks fly between the oddball couple. It brims with emotions as Joseph takes responsibility of his mentally-challenged cousin Prudence and makes us laud when they outsmart Joseph's aunt. This Regency Series is consistently entertaining and this ending is no exception - even when it is slightly inferior to her masterpiece A Summer To Remember."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"Like her five siblings, Freyja Bedwyn enjoys independence, freedom, and adventure, the very traits that the Ton detests in a woman. Still with four wild brothers as role models, Freyja does her own thing in spite of the aristocracy frowning at her scandalous behavior. His family believes he needs to be married, a state they ignored until he gained the title when his uncle passed away. However, as he visits his grandmama in Bath, Lord Joshua Moore is tired of his family's effort to find him a wife.While Joshua flees the latest matchmaking machination, he meets and pleads with an amused Freyja to hide him. When they talk, he offers her a deal. She pretends to be his fiancee so that he can have a little relief from the marriage mart and she can use that cloak to go on an adventure. Freyja accepts. However, neither Freyja nor Joshua expected to fall in love, an emotion putting a cramp on what they thought they desired.The third \\"Slightly\\" Regency romance is a fun tale headlined by two strong, stubborn, yet seductive stars. The story line is amusing, as neither Freyja nor Joshua wants to fall in love. Though in many ways, Freyja is a female version of her brother Rannulf (see SLIGHTLY WICKED), fans of Mary Balogh, the sub-genre, or just a delightful entertaining novel will appreciate this fine tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"I really disliked her in A Summer to Remember. In the next two books, she improved somewhat, but here, in her own story, she blossoms. One reason is that we finally get to see some vulnerability in her; the other favorable factor is her marvelously sarcastic sense of humor. When Josh arrives in Bath, Freyja makes a scene that results in a fake betrothal-- one that her brother, the Duke, insists be maintained for a time.Josh is intrigued by this little hoyden and is one of the few who can put her in her place. She naturally resents that, but even worse is his seeming inability to take anything seriously. He's always winking at her, calling her &quot;sweetheart,&quot; and making kissing gestures, all the sorts of things he knows will infuriate her. But he is far too frivilous to be taken seriously...or so she thinks.The story deals little with the Bedwyn family, although Wulfric appears just enough to make you long for his story. The book focuses more on Josh's family and to good result--we need to see Freyja away from her usual surroundings. When Josh goes to meet his fiance's family, he fits right in. The stranger thing is how close Freyja becomes to his family.It's different (as the series goes) and it works. A Summer to Remember is still my favorite (and worth far more than 5 stars), but I liked this one a great deal."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"Although very much a fan of Mary Balogh's Regency romances I have been a little disappointed in some of her more recent books, mainly in the \\"Slightly\\" series. Chronologically \\"Slightly Married\\" (the story of Aidan) and \\"Slightly Wicked\\" (Rannulf) come before this book, although \\"A Summer To Remember\\" introduced this family. In many of these books Lady Freyja appears and she was always a character I found difficult to like - she was positively nasty to the heroine in \\"A Summer To Remember\\" and seems to go around punching people; not very endearing.Slightly Scandalous is Freyja's story and it's actually very good. It starts off as she is on her way to Bath to stay with a friend, ostensibly to be social but really to get away from her home and her neighbours as Viscount Ravensberg, the man she loved, is expecting a child with his wife (the characters from \\"A Summer To Remember\\"). Despite these events having happened almost a year ago Freyja is most certainly not over them - Bedwyns love only once, of course, and she loved Kit Ravensberg. What hope is there for her future?But in Bath, and in fact before, she bumps into Joshua Moore, Marquess of Hallmere, who seems to be about the only man who can match her in fun, humour and derring do. They have great fun together (despite Freyja's lamentable tendencies to punch him in the nose) and it ends up that they will both help each other out by a fake betrothal. But fake betrothals are rather difficult to handle when people get more and more involved, especially when one of the two is accused of murder.This book was excellent in terms of plot and character. Joshua, Marquess of Hallmere, slowly reveals to Freyja that he's not just a wastrel laughing lad but also has hidden depths. Freyja is revealed as someone who can have her heart broken and who has her own secrets - some of which are very honourable (she is the benefactress of a school, which is the school featured in the most recent \\"Simply\\" series). The rest of the Bedwyns make quite a showing in this book - it's evident that Mary Balogh loves these, her creations, but I find them a little trying at times. Still they worked well in this book, even Wulfric, who sometimes seems too cardboard a villainous character.My reservations about this book were its similarities to \\"A Summer To Remember\\" - fake betrothal etc. Also I couldn't separate out the characters of Kit Ravensberg and Joshua Hallmere - they seemed almost identical; if I were Josh I'd worry his wife was trying to find the man most like her lost love. But these are minor niggles in what is otherwise an excellent story and something for the keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"We last saw Lady Freyja Bedwyn in Ms. Balogh's captivating gem A Summer To Remember and she is now the central protagonist in the conclusive episode to the Slightly series. A haughty and spirited character, Freyja is seen retreating to Bath to avoid the christening of the son of ex-flame Viscount Ravensburg who spurned her for icy maiden Lauren Edgeworth. A brief sojourn turns into an adventure as she meets Joseph Moore, Marquess of Hallsmere in her inn bedroom as he hides in the cupboard to escape a bunch of wedding schemers. A misunderstanding ensues when Freyja chances upon Joseph with a screaming lady on his way to visit his grandmother at Pulteney Street. She denounces him as a libertine in front of the ton at the Pump Room.You would never expect this two to turn up allies in a scheme to thwart a marriage-foisting ploy concocted by Joseph's aunt. They recklessly engage themselves to each other and Freyja's protective brother Bewcastle arrives to prevent further mischief. Freyja and Joseph feel growing attachments as understanding develops; Freyja's insecurity with love after her devastating rejection and Joseph's hidden secret in shouldering his cousin's disgrace.Slightly Scandalous wraps up the Bedwyn series beautifully and is a renewed testament to Balogh's ease and fluidity in her character sculpting. The sparks fly between the oddball couple. It brims with emotions as Joseph takes responsibility of his mentally-challenged cousin Prudence and makes us laud when they outsmart Joseph's aunt. This Regency Series is consistently entertaining and this ending is no exception - even when it is slightly inferior to her masterpiece A Summer To Remember."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"I am reading it now can't put it down already read the other two book I have 3 more in the series can't wait"},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"The book looked great but I opened it to the second page and it is seperated from the spine of the book.

I think she is very talented and she writes her characters so well that they become alive. However, in this case, I felt like reading a documentary rather than a love story. It was all very believable, but the romance was too slow-paced for me and though it was nice to see Freya and Joshua becoming first friends and then to love each other, it just didn't work for me. I felt it was more about the Bedwyns, Kit (from A summer to remember) and about Joshua's family than about Joshua and Freya. It was necessary, of course, but it was too much and it just killed the romance for me. There was not a moment for the heroes to be only on their own, without some side stories and some people around. I didn't even finish it. But I really liked Slightly Married, Slightly Wicked (my favourite) and Slightly Dangerous."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"Great book! Well written and a good story line. This is a great author and I've enjoyed everything I've read by her."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I could barely make my way through it, and I only did because I kept thinking \\"this is going to get better.\\" I was wrong. I really liked Freyja's character development in a Summer to Remember, and I had hopes for the hero that win her over. This hero is foppish with his colored coats and teasing and constantly grinning manner. I don't like this type of hero, but if you do, then maybe you would enjoy this book. The characters talk a lot, but there is no buildup of any desire. I though a Summer to Remember was fine, not great, but I have no desire to read this author's other books."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"I did not like Freyja or Joshua. I thought he was too shallow and she had a nasty disposition. I only read the book because it is part of a sequence and I needed to pass through these characters in order to get to Wulfric. So far I have liked Aiden the best and look forward to Wulfic's story. There is nothing wrong with the story or the way the book is written. I just did not like the characters."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"this was the first book i read of the Slightly series and i liked it enough to pick up and read the rest. i liked the plot of the story even if it was a bit interesting. Freyja however was a hard character for me to decide if i liked or not. up until she and Joshua begin to have feelings for each other i liked her enough as a person. she was different than your ordinary heroine and the change was nice. i thought they made a very loveable pair of friends and how they met just added to their friendship. but after they have feelings for each other i began to like the book a little less as it continued. Freyja was just too haughty and difficult to be a lover. as another reviewer mentioned i too couldn't really see how anyone could love Freyja.Joshua on the other hand was what held my interest. he was such a loveable character, someone i would want as a friend. he was always teasing Freyja and calling her &quot;sweetheart&quot; which i thought added to his fun character. some of my favorite parts of this book were his reactions to when Freyja would punch him. even though it was hard to see the two as lovers i though Balogh did a very good job making it work and making the book enjoyable.some patterns i have noticed since reading more of her books are that the characters don't confess their love for each other until within the last few chapters, so a warning that it does take a while. the love scene are always short and brief too.i'm looking forward to reading Alleyne's and Wolf's stories and despite the reviews for them i think that all of our hopes for them, Wolf's especially, have been kept very hight and it would seem understandable if it turns out they don't meet with our hight hopes. if it does turn out that they aren't everything we hoped for i do wish that they will be statisfying at least."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"Unlike many romance novels, where the heroine is always described positively, Balogh has made it clear that Freyja is merely handsome and extremely spirited.However, readers need to suspend belief for the premise of the book: that Freyja, always strong-willed, would would want to flee to Bath to escape the birth of her love's first child, or agree to a fake engagement because of it. If she could spurn someone she loved in the name of duty, she should have been able to face the situation later on, again in the name of duty.In fact, she didn't come across very well in A Summer to Remember or in fact the other Slightly.. books. It really wasn't clear in AStR that she had been in love with Kit, even when Kit asked her point-blank; and it wasn't explained till Slightly Scandalous that she had agreed to getting engaged to Jerome out of duty while wanting Kit the whole time. In fact, Kit tells Lauren that Jerome and Freyja \\"had an understanding\\" for a long time that he didn't know about. Where did that idea come from?Taken as a standalone story though, Slightly Scandalous is wonderful, wickedly Balogh. Buy it and keep it."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"Having read the first two of the Slightly series, this is my least favorite so far. Although most people had trouble liking Freyja in this one, I can't say I disliked her -not liked her especially either- and I feel I understood her hurt at being rejected by Kit in A summer to remember, where she was actually the vilain in the story.However, it was Josh's character that infuriated me mostly. Laughing, winking and having a twinkle in his eye in every other page, actually drove me nuts! Ok, we get it, he's a fun-loving guy (despite the required touches of dark, unhappy childhood that try to add depth to him). Why does he have to wink in every other page for the reader to get that message? And ----SPOILER ALERT--- a man who finds himself accused of murder and thinks what a jolly good time and entertaintment proving his innocence will be (especially with no solid alibi in sight), is not fun-loving; he is irresponsible and plain stupid. After reading how amusing he found the whole thing I just couldn't wait for the book to end and his love for the handicapped did not add enough depth to his character to save him in my eyes.All in all, I liked the first half of the book very much, the scenes in Bath were funny, amusing and sparkling. Freyja was nicely portraited but also true to her first appearence in A summer to remember -Balogh did not change her to make her likable. But I felt that after they left Bath, the book almost went downhill from there. There are some matters that simply can't be laughed at and a man can only have so much fun before becoming a bufoon."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"4th in series a fake betrothed turns to love.the bedwyn are a great clan balogh makes you feel like a part of the family.will read on."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"I really don't know how so many people have rated this book so highly. To me Freyja is totally unlikeable. She is too proud, too unyielding, too haughty, too full of herself, too selfish and too hard, none of which are qualities that I admire. Freyja didn't have a soft or feminine fiber in her body. I frankly can't understand how could Joshua (or anyone for that matter) fall in love with her, since she seems to be forever punching him in the face and mistreating him. She seemed to be angry with the world for no good reason. OK, she was once rejected by someone she thought she loved in &quot;A Summer to Remember&quot;, but even then it was originally her fault, and she acted despicably when she didn't get her way. She is just a spoiled brat who thinks she can do as she pleases and look down on everybody simply because of her powerful family. Ach!The hero-Joshua- was the reason I gave this book at least 2 stars. He is a very pleasant character. Cheerful, kind, sensible, intelligent, but also firm when he had to be. I liked Joshua very much since despite his cheerful and carefree manner he conceals hurts and a less thant happy chilhood, but he hasn't allowed this to turn him bitter and resentful. He is a very possitive character and the only thing that makes this book bearable.I think this is my least favorite of the Bedwyn series so far. I quite liked Morgan, but after reading her book, she is only &quot;slightly&quot; better than Freyja. I just hope Mary Balogh does better with Alleyne and Wulfric's stories, although I don't really expect much from this series anymore, after all, I disliked Freyja since the beginning and my opinion of her didn't improve after reading her story.Alleyne is quite different, I think he is the only Bedwyn I have always liked, so maybe his story will be my favorite of the series. Wulfric needs a serious thawing to get me to like him even a little."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"I loved this book! I started the series with A Summer to Remember and was at first disappointed that the Bedwyns seemd to have such a small part in that book. Then I continued on with Slightly Married and was thrilled to really meet the Bedwyns. I like that the subsequent books refer back to characters we've gotten to meet and we are able to know how their lives have progressed. I find myself anxious for Mary Balogh to give us Wulf's story. I'm hoping she doesn't save him for last because the more we get to know him, the more interesting a character he becomes. He also needs to let loose and I cannot wait to see how it happens. These books are simply wonderful, with the stories easily flowing into one another. I enjoyed Slightly Scandalous, although at times it seemed hard to imagine Freyja being so brokenhearted over Kit, when she is painted a such a strong character. Since I didn't like her when she was introduced in Summer to Remember, this book completely changed my view of her. Again, I am enjoying the Bedwyn family and their stories - I am hopeful that the next book will finally get Wulfric a woman. Considering how proper he is and seems so disinterested in marrying and being in love - the woman who claims his heart will be an interesting one indeed. As much as I am enjoying all the Bedwyn's, Wulf's story should be next. I look forward to it."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"The cover was not bent or worn and the pages were not earmarked or wrinkled. The book was in very good condition."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"I think the author didn't put more than skill into this novel, and I was very disappointed. I had hoped that she would turn the spoiled superior supercillious heroine into a real character but aside from a few superficial feints, Balogh added nothing to her. She did slightly better for the hero, partly because he had more background. I had been expecting a Freyja with the relative depth and resonance of her novelistic predecessors, who became full individuals in their own novels. Because I had anticipated a lot of depth and dimension that Freyja might have had, based bare hints in the earlier novels, I was expecting a much better book, not one in which the author seemed more fond of her hero than of the series-character whose story we readers had anticipated. This book reads almost (not quite) as if it were written to a plug-in formula."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"I love this \\"slightly\\" series. (The second one on Rannaulf, slightly wicked, is my favorite!) Balogh continues her witty dialogue and strong characters in this story about a pretend betrothal to save face (that goes on and on until its real).However I intensely dislike the amount of attention given to Freyja's \\"ugliness\\".......and don't much like that the hero is admittedly \\"prettier\\" than the heroine! That ruined a good book for me."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"I am a fan of Mary Balogh, and I had already read the first two novels in this trilogy. I had adored Slightly Married and was a little disappointed with Slightly Wicked. So I wasn't sure what to expect my reaction would be to Slightly Scandalous. However, it turned out to be one of those books that I couldn't put down. Lady Freyja, although not always likeable when she appeared previously in Balogh's novels, has a certain charisma from the beginning that has you rooting for her. One can certainly understand her pain and reluctance to trust from what happened in A Summer to Remember, but I loved that she doesn't really let it get in the way of the romance that progresses in such a humorous and fun-filled fashion with Joshua Moore. Both characters are fairly deeply drawn without becoming too dark to be likable. Add the rest of the Bedwyns, who are all entertaining, and you've got yourself a first rate read by the indomitable Miss Balogh."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"After reading \\"Slightly Married\\" by Mrs. Balogh, the bar was set pretty high. I skipped over the second in the series simply because the plot didn't appeal to me, but I was really looking forward to Freyja's story- and I wasn't disappointed.Once again, I was really impressed with the quality of writing displayed by Mrs. Balogh. Partly through \\"Slightly Married\\" I stopped to marvel at the fact that I was actually reading a romance novel- no offense to the genre, of course. Her characterizations are some of the best in the genre- no cookie cutter typecasts here. Mrs. Balogh is quite good at extracting emotions from her readers in a seamless fashion. Unlike some other novels where the authors seem to inject emotion where it is needed, Mrs. Balogh simply weaves it expertly into the plot and cast.One of my favorite aspects of Mrs. Balogh's novels is the realistic approach she takes to writing love scenes. I want to scream every time a dewy-eyed virgin is debauched in some novel and has no idea what's going on. Honestly, even the most ignorant girls have some idea. I also appreciate the fact that immediately after making love, the characters don't suddenly fall in love, like in other novels of the genre. The characters in this novel are far too complex for such simple romantic devices.I gave the novel only four stars for a few reasons. My two main complaints are pretty picky, so the novel is still definitely a worthwhile read. First of all, while I think Mary Balogh is quite adept at building chemistry, the love scenes are a bit too much wham-bam for me. After the tension has built and built, in both novels Mrs. Balogh favors the mantra \\"more is less\\" when the love scene finally takes place. While that may convey the urgency, it was leaving me a little let down. Second picky complaint concerns the \\"evil villain\\" of the novel. While most of the author's characters were complex and compelling, this one was a little too typical to me. I continue to serach in vain for a complex villain in a romance novel. :)Other than that, it was a good read, and I even found myself tearing up at a few points. Be warned, it does drag a bit towards the end, where you will probably find yourself shouting \\"Just sat it, already!\\" at both characters, but the ending is pretty and happy so it's worth it."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"I have had the pleasure of reading several of Balogh's other titles, but this is my first foray into the Bedwyn family. While I did enjoy the book, I found it to be repetitious. Everything was \\"haughty\\". Freyja had a haughty tone, a haughty manner, haughty expressions, she conducted herself haughtily. By the time I finished reading the first few chapters, I was heartily sick of the word \\"haughty\\".And apparently, in order to make the reader believe that Freyja is spirited and strongwilled, she must punch people in the nose. It was amusing the first time because it could be deemed unexpected. But after she punched the hero twice, and tried to smack him a few other times, it got silly. By the time she decks the marchioness, instead of being the satisfying scene that it should have been, it was just tired (it didn't take a rocket scientist to see that punch coming from a mile away).There are other repetitive devices throughout... Josh grins and winks alot... Wulf isn't just cold and aloof, he's wooden, and seems to be having a love affair with that quizzing glass...the marchioness is shrill, simpers and falsely appears weak despite the fact that no one seems to fall for her act. And just how many times do the various Bedwyn siblings have to verbally state their superiority? \\"We ARE Bedwyns\\"... I kept waiting for someone to add \\"Hear us roar\\" every time someone said that.Despite how it might sound, I actually enjoyed the story for the most part, but it pales next to many of other Balogh's other works. I am still curious to see how other Bedwyn titles pan out even though I found this one to be subpar."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"Mary Balogh's &quot;Slightly..&quot; series is great. I have to admit that I loved Joshua, the hero in &quot;Slightly Scandalous&quot; the best. But if you like your heroes to be brooding and gloomy, Josh may not be your cup of tea.From the previous &quot;Slightly&quot; books, I had a strong prejudice against Freyja Bedwyn, the heroine, who seemed rude and obnoxious. But as the story progresses and ones sees beyond the surface haughtiness, one realizes that Freyja is actually nice!Freyja and Joshua, Marquess of Hallmere, first meet under unusual circumstances. Upon meeting again in Bath, they have a lot of fun sparring with one another. Due to Josh's aunt's machinations, Josh and Freyja decide to enter an engagement of convenience. As matters progress, Freyja and Josh start realizing that they actually love each other but because of the way the betrothal began, have difficulty admitting their feelings. Freyja especially has a hard time as she has to come to terms with her past amours before realizing how special her relationship with Josh really is.Josh at first seems to be just a happy go lucky guy with the face of Adonis. I liked how Balogh lets the reader get to know Josh on a deeper level as the book progresses. I liked Josh in the beginning (who doesn't like a handsome Adonis with a sense of humor!) but I loved him even more in the end because his actions showed he is more than just a pretty face."},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"This is a very enjoyable book. The sparring between Freyja and Joshua is wonderful and it's funny seeing her lose her temper with him - sometimes in very public places. They have very different personalities, but complement each other very well and seem destined for one another (and the chemistry between them is great!). One of the highlights is encountering the other members of the Bedwyn family again; they contribute greatly to a few of the entertaining and humorous scenes.SUMMARY (Bedwyn Family, Book 3):Lady Freyja Bedwyn goes to stay with a friend in Bath to avoid the birth of a past flame's child (Kit Butler, hero ofA Summer to Remember). Joshua Moore, Marquess of Hallmere, is in Bath to visit his grandmother after gallivanting around Europe (and doing unofficial spy work) for five years. They meet and enjoy several *very* amusing incidents, leading to an impulsively created fake betrothal to help Joshua avoid an undesired forced one. While the betrothal was only supposed to stand for a few days, it ends up lengthening all the way to Lindsey Hall (Bedwyn home) and then to Penhallow in Cornwall (Hallmere's home). Balogh includes the usual villain subplot (this one is well-employed), dastardly relatives, past ghosts and demons to be faced and overcome, but in the end the book is an enjoyable read and as always, it's a treat to see the hero and heroine get their happily-ever-after.MAIN CHARACTERS, Freyja and Joshua:Lady Freyja Bedwyn is the third youngest Bedywn sibling and is 25 years old at the time of the story. If you have read previous Bedwyn family books, you may not be predisposed to like her; she's arrogant and haughty and in the aforementionedA Summer to Remember, she's horribly malicious and unfriendly towards Lauren.Slightly Scandalousshows a different side to her, however, and we find that she's also a lonely woman with a sensitive side, who hides this in order to not appear vulnerable or be hurt again. A plus in my opinion is that she's not the normal beauty - well, actually she's not a beauty at all, and is considered ugly at worst, and somewhat handsome and interesting-looking at best.Joshua Moore, Marquess of Hallmere is 28 years old and comes off at first as a devil-may-care blond Adonis whose laughing eyes show him to be the rogue he is and nothing more. Of course (surprise, surprise!), this is not the case, and although he is a cheerful man whose teasing grin comes easily, his childhood was an unhappy one and his past is riddled with painful secrets. He is a very charming and engaging character who initially comes off as shallow and unable to take anything seriously, but is actually a very thoughtful and kind man.Neither Freyja nor Joshua expect their light flirtation to turn into anything serious and due to this, they are actually a little afraid to get to know each other on any other level. She doesn't want to see beyond the laughing roguishness and he only wants to have fun by teasing her into losing her haughty temper. Of course, love gets in the way!FAVORITE LINE:\\"Freyja,\\" he said, \\"what are you doing for the rest of your life?\\" ::sigh::BOTTOM LINE:Although if you read many of Balogh's books you'll start to experience deja vu quite frequently (some of the lines, the idea of a fake betrothal that will later be called off, etc.), she's an excellent writer and this is a highly enjoyable read and must-have if you're going through the whole Bedwyn family series. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Slightly Scandalous","review":"The first book I ever read by Mary Balogh, Was * A summer to remember* in which you meet the Bedwyn family, in which I met Freyja ...and thought she was mean, most unromantic girl in romance fiction.

Joshua is every bit of a carefree, do it my own way type as Freyja and it made for a good read to bring the two of them together. They match wits and take romance to another level.

I did not care what the names of the people were, who decided to design the World Trade Center in a more modern way. Nor did I care, where the business owners protesting against its building ate lunch. Yet then, as I read further into the book, I actually became quite enthralled with the almost Lord of the Rings type quest that these men went through to get the World Trade Center.As a whole, all of these tiny, seemingly boring problems that they ran into, began to amaze me. I had no idea that there was so much hatred toward the building of what I thought to be a beloved national monument.The negative two stars are for a lack of interest in the beginning of the book and a tiny bit of unneeded babble.On the other hand, the positive 3 stars, and actually I'd give it more of a 3 1/2, are for a great, flowing writing style, that while consisting of facts and plain history, reads like a novel.In the end you will be left thinking, &quot;Wow, there's more to those buildings than I thought there was.&quot;"},{"Title":"City in the Sky : The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center","review":"While a book about the technical aspects of the construction of the World Trade Center ideally shouldn't be written by authors without credentials in construction or engineering, the authors present a thorough history of the towers and pose some interesting theories."},{"Title":"City in the Sky : The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center","review":"As a child, I watched the World Trade Center go up. As an adult, I had been through the Center thousands of times and ate many a lunch in the plaza between the two beautiful towers. Although I worked only three blocks north of the WTC, I was nowhere near them on 9/11, and thank God for that. I don't think I could have been able to bear witnessing their destruction.To fill the void, I began reading everything about the World Trade Center that I could. Eric Darton's book, &quot;Divided We Stand&quot;, published before 9/11, was okay but I found the second-person narration and its choppy presentation too distracting. Several other books were published after the devestation, but they all seemed like rush jobs trying to cash in on the disaster. However, &quot;City in the Sky: The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center&quot; by James Glanz and Eric Lipton is by far the best of the bunch. Meticulously researched without being too scholarly, the authors present a biography of the center that was filled with controversy, behind-closed-doors intrigues, political wrestling and, ultimately, the construction and engineering marvels that allowed the towers to rise. The pacing is remarkably swift but nothing is glossed over. The final quarter of the book is about 9/11 and afterward. I began this section with dread and was tempted not to read it at all. Fortunately, Glanz and Lipton handled it with incredible sensitivity.&quot;City in the Sky&quot;, like the towers themselves, is a remarkable collaboration: the narrative is seamless--like Burrows and Wallace's &quot;Gotham&quot;. And, ultimately, this book is a lively and poignant tribute to the World Trade Center they must have loved.Rocco Dormarunno,author of &quot;The Five Points&quot;"},{"Title":"City in the Sky : The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center","review":"It is all right here. From the germ of the idea at the 1939 New York World's Fair to the design and planning of a project unlike any other in the history of mankind to the cataclysmic events of September 11, 2001. New York Times reporters James Glanz and Eric Lipton have pieced together the complete history that needed to be told. \\"City In The Sky: The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center\\" is the remarkable story of how the World Trade Center came to be. This is a riveting tale from start to finish.In the opening chapters of \\"City In The Sky\\" Glanz and Lipton reveal who first envisioned this incredible project way back in the late 1940's and of the considerable role politics would play in this saga over the ensuing decades. You will meet several of the key players in this saga including one Lawrence A. Wien, owner of the Empire State Building, who fought this project tooth and nail. Meanwhile you will also be introduced to Oscar Nadel, owner of a small appliance business that would be displaced by the World Trade Center. Put yourself in his shoes and in the shoes of hundreds of other small business people who were to be evicted in the wake of this massive project. This was definitely a David vs. Goliath scenario from this man's point of view.Meanwhile, Glanz and Lipton also devote a considerable amount of time to the struggle between the City of New York and the New York and New Jersey Port Authority for control of this enormous project. You will learn why the WTC was located where it was and about all of the people who made this concept a reality from the visionary David Rockerfeller to the unconventional architect Minoru Yamasaki to powerful Port Authority chairman Austin Tobin. And of course, you will read once again of the tragic events of 9/11 and see how decisions made decades earlier may have helped decide who would live and who would die on that fateful day. Were corners cut during construction? Was the fireproofing used adequate? And were the consequences of an airliner crashing into the Twin Towers ever seriously considered? So many questions.In my view, \\"City In The Sky: The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center\\" is an extremely important book that will help you to unravel some of the complex issues involved here. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"City in the Sky : The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center","review":"\\"City in the Sky\\" is a well- researched, well -documented account of the site acquisition, construction, and eventual collapse of the New York World Trade Center. (There are other WTCs). It is immediately obvious that the authors have conducted extensive interviews and research. Full disclosure: This reviewer worked at the facility for 24 years for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Most of the anecdotes retold in CIS are just as I originally heard them years ago. (With some exceptions: On Austin Tobin's first trip on the newly acquired Hudson and Manhattan Railroad, the sleeping drunk supposedly woke up long enough to bid the Executive Director \\"good evening\\" before passing out again. Also, some of the PA titles are inaccurate, though not wrong. There was one obvious leg-pull about a \\"mailroom worker\\".) CIS in really 3 stories in one: The first is the strongest: That tale encompasses the struggle to condemn the surrounding real estate, overcome local opposition and secure Governmental cooperation for the project. Those who enjoyed such works as Robert Caro's \\"The Power Broker\\" will be in their element here. The second is concerned with the actual construction of the 2 towers and satellite buildings. The authors manage to include just enough technical details to tell the story without allowing this section of CIS to become too technical. The final part deals with that tragic day we now call 9/11. This reviewer does not wish to minimize that awful event but this tale has been told better, or as well, elsewhere. One assumes its' inclusion was virtually mandatory in a 400+ page work on the Trade Center but it emerges, perhaps strangely, as the weakest section of CIS. This reviewer hopes he was mistaken when he read that some of the victims who jumped to their deaths were in fact pushed by co-workers needing window space. A major difficulty with the text is that the authors appear too inclined to blame the Port Authority for inadequate fireproofing of the towers. This may-or may NOT! -be so but this serious charge is not substantiated here. Furthermore the PA executive most of the allegations are heaped upon has been dead for some 20 years and is hardly in a position to defend himself. CIS' strength is the relating of the struggles to build the Towers in the light of another era. Those were the days of Radio Row, a vastly different New York City, the maximum power of the Rockefeller Family and what those a bit older that this reviewer fondly remember as the \\"good old days\\" at Mother PONYA. CIS is entirely worthwhile but far from urgent reading. Amazoners may wish to wait for the more moderate prices of a paperback edition. That event would warrant a 4th star."},{"Title":"City in the Sky : The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center","review":"A genuine page turner.

I could'nt but the book down."},{"Title":"City in the Sky : The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center","review":"Factual, thorough and well-written. The authors praise the engineering and construction (e.g. \\"Carl Weber produced something that was a cut above ordinary floor trusses ... stout floor trusses.\\") and recognize that the ultimate cause for the towers' demise belongs with crazed terrorists and several hundred thousand pounds of jet fuel, but they also advance some interesting ideas to suggest some reasons for unnecessary loss of life (e.g. \\"The Port Authority (had)... a longstanding lack of concern for fire (displaying) a serious disregard for the safety of the thousands of people who came to work in its grand buildings every day.)"},{"Title":"City in the Sky : The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center","review":"City in the Sky gives us a balanced and fascinating look at the conception, creation, life and destruction of the World Trade Center. The human interest inherent in the story of the construction and loss of the Twin Towers is balanced with a detailed, yet easily understandable explanation of the physics involved in both.

What came across: the authors cared about the subject matter and the book was well researched."},{"Title":"City in the Sky : The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center","review":"I enjoyed this book, mostly because I had many, many questions about the politics and the economics of the WTC. If that's your purpose in picking this book, you'll do fine.However, \\"The Rise and Fall\\" certainly implies a lot of coverage of the collapse of the towers. This, while covered, is not dealt with in as thorough a manner as in many other documentaries. So, as with many things, your pleasure with the book is a function of your expectations. I liked it a lot, but, from what other reviewers say below, I can understand why others feel much less enthusiastic."},{"Title":"City in the Sky : The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center","review":"Everything about the twin towers of the World Trade Center was outsize, from their conception to their creation and their destruction. New York Times reporters James Glanz and Eric Lipton have provided an admirable overview of their story in \\"City in the Sky.\\" The two authors deftly weave together the political, economic, architectural, engineering and human issues that were central to the towers' rise and fall.The story began in the 1950s with an idea advocated by David Rockefeller of the Chase Manhattan Bank. The project came under the sponsorship of the Port Authority of New York, the only public agency with the resources or clout to accomplish it; the use of public funds to build two giant office buildings was justified as providing a \\"port on land\\" for importers and exporters, foreign divisions of businesses and the like. The autocratic boss of the Port Authority, Austin Tobin, did battle with the political and business leaders who potentially stood in the way of the project as the 1960s unfolded. Tobin assigned Guy Tozzoli of his staff to oversee the project, and he was there until the unimaginable day of their destruction almost four decades later.A rising young architect named Minoru Yamasaki was commissioned to design the largest buildings ever built. While Yamasaki and his staff were at work in their Midwestern studios, the merchants who would be displaced by the project fought--and almost won--a desperate struggle for survival. Meanwhile, researchers in distant parts of the country were trying to answer the questions about how the buildings and the people inside them would react to the forces of wind and what might happen if they were ever struck by an airplane.The towers finally opened, but in the economic climate of the mid-1970s, they became half-empty white elephants. But as things improved, the center was soon full (although the original concept of a \\"port on land\\" had to be abandoned) and the structures that had once been seen as alien and oversized now became a symbol of New York's, and the nation's economic might....a symbol that provided an inviting target for terrorists. The heroic rescue and demolition efforts that followed 9-11 bring the book, but not the story of the World Trade Center, to a close. Various theories have been advanced, but a federal report on the cause of the towers' collapse is still to come; and although a design has been chosen, the debate over the form the memorial at the site should take still continues.Glanz and Lipton have written a compelling and informative book.--William C. Hall"},{"Title":"City in the Sky : The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center","review":"An amazing story about people more than buildings. Truly unputdownable.

So when he crosses the lines of friendship by turning to neighbor, and friend, Mariah Kelly for comfort in a dark moment, he is determined to reestablish their friendship in the hopes that nothing has changed. Unfortunately for Rhys, nothing will ever be the same again.Mariah Kelly has loved her friend Rhys for years and she dares to hope that having their baby inside of her will help him to confront his past and move on. Since she knows a child is the last thing he wants, however, she is fully prepared to care for their child on her own. But she isn't going to give up hope that he'll come to love her, and the child they made together, without a fight.Anne McAllister has written an emotionally stirring tale of two friends who must deal with the ramifications of a long-developed, and mutual, passion. Rhys begins as a man who is determined to be a distant, even uninvolved, father, Despite his original intent, he can't seem to let go of his concern and affection for Mariah as a friend or his attraction to her as a woman. Mariah is a strongly drawn character who is unafraid to face the prospect of single parenthood even though it is not her method of choice. She loves Rhys but knows she is taking a huge risk by hoping he will come to love her and their child. In a story full of wit, humor, and hope Anne McAllister brings together two friends who eventually come to love the family they have created together."},{"Title":"Rhys's Redemption (Harlequin Presents, No. 2126)","review":"I've enjoyed every one of this series.

McAllister does a wonderful job of keeping her readers on the edge of their seat until the absolute end. I highly recommend this one!"},{"Title":"Rhys's Redemption (Harlequin Presents, No. 2126)","review":"I first discovered Anne McAllister years ago when I read her Harlequin novel Fletcher's Baby. That was the time during which I had just discovered the amazing abundance of romance novels that Harlequin provides for voracious readers and Fletcher's Baby was one of those reads that you remember even after a long time. The impact the story has on the senses (not because of any explicit or otherwise sexual content in the story) but rather because of the emotional wrangling content of the book, even my elder sister who has never been much of a fan of romances read and liked the story that unfolded. The dogeared copy of Fletcher's Baby on our bookshelf is a testament to how well liked the story is. Even though this is a review of Rhys's Redemption, my second book from Anne McAllister, if you haven't already read Fletcher's Baby, I highly advise you to do so. It is a great book for a good cry!Rhys Wolfe is a man haunted by memories of the tragic death of his childhood love and wife Sarah and their unborn 4 month old baby. Born and raised in New York, Rhys had tried hard to please his family by going into the family business. Working long hours had kept him away from his pregnant wife and the fire that had taken away his Sarah eight years back haunts him even to this day. Yes, Rhys has moved on to the best of his ability, quit his job at the firm which had pissed off his father, and taken a job in a specialized unit of firefighting that deals with oil well and rig fires. And it is an extremely commitment phobic Rhys that emerges from the tragedy of losing his beloved who has no intention whatsoever of getting married or having children ever again. His one steadfast rule, one he had made up as an act of self preservation was to sleep only with women who knew exactly what they were getting into - that is until he breaks his rule during the night he turns to comfort in the arms of Mariah, his friend and neighbor for the past 3 years.31 year old Mariah Kelly comes from a large family from Kansas. She had been a small town girl with a determination to make it in the big city world in the field of journalism when she had first moved to New York 8 years back and was quite comfortable with her achievements. Mariah first meets Rhys during a cookout she holds on her terrace by inviting all her neighbors, and over time within Rhys Mariah finds all the qualities she had ever wanted to find in a man. And regardless of telling herself that falling for a man who has his heart locked away and the key thrown away into the dungeons, Mariah finds herself doing just exactly that - falling head over heels in love with the wrong man. When the one night of intense passion they share ends up in Mariah getting pregnant, Mariah hopes against hope that Rhys would come around and start to care for her and love her as much as she does for him.When Rhys wakes up with a warm and sleeping Mariah in his arms, all his survival instincts kick in and he does the only thing he knows how to save his battered emotions. Two months without a word and Rhys returns home after an intense job planning all the while in his head how he and Mariah would move on and forget about the night that changed everything only to receive the bombshell that Mariah is pregnant with his child. Betrayal, pain and anger all course through Rhys when he first hears the news and the only thing Rhys is willing to offer Mariah is financial support and nothing more. Avoiding Mariah at all costs is what Rhys sets out to do, but Mariah makes it damn hard for him to do just that when she refuses to condemn him for his actions, calmly accepting what Rhys is able to give and never asking for more. But staying away and just completely wiping away Mariah from his mind seems to be an impossible task for Rhys which eventually makes for a really heart wrenching read.Likes:1- Mariah Kelly. I loved her for so many things as this story unfolded. Her unchanging love for a man who has immersed himself so deeply in his gut wrenching pain over the loss of the only woman he has ever loved, a love that doesn't turn into resentment because Rhys is unwilling to give her his everything once he learns of her pregnancy. I loved her because she doesn't turn bitter, nor does she hold it against Rhys that he is selfish enough to want to protect his heart from being broken to pieces all over again. Her courage, unwavering love and hope that Rhys would turn around makes her one of the most endearing heroines I have come across.2- The magic that this story weaves as it is told from both Rhys and Mariah's viewpoints. There is so much emotion packed into it that the lump that applied for permanent residency in my throat refused to fade away even long after the story was through. Even though I cannot afford to pull an all-nighter reading a book these days, I couldn't bring myself to part with the story and get my much needed sleep before work today. And thank God for the fact that this one is not a long novel or otherwise I would have found myself in a whole lot of trouble reporting to work all bleary-eyed today. ^_^3- How this book made me all teary-eyed - in a good way. Honestly, I am not one to cry and bawl over a story, well most of the time anyway. But last night, I found myself with tears in my eyes as I reached towards the end, tears of frustration at times on Rhys's stubbornness in refusing to let go of Sarah, tears of sorrow for Mariah who loves Rhys quietly all along and in the end, tears of happiness for the happily ever after.4- This story definitely whetted my appetite to read Dominic's story, the calm and controlled older brother of Rhys, and Sierra the younger sister of Mariah and her exact opposite in every way. That book is definitely going to end up in my wish list!Dislikes: Though I loved this story to bits, I found myself at times a bit disappointed because Rhys and Mariah spends so much time apart from one another in the story. But in the end it all works out because this story ends up being different to your usual Harlequin pregnancy romances such that the hero doesn't find himself just a changed man overnight, but rather takes the long road to find himself taking the second chance he has been offered at loving and being loved once again. But I would have loved a bit more interaction between Rhys and Mariah, just a tad more.Reviewed by: Maldivian Book Reviewer ([...])"},{"Title":"Wyrmhole","review":"Jack Stein is a psychic investigator. He receives clues in dreams and visions, then puts them together to solve cases. He has been hired by Outreach Industries to investigate the disappearance of one of their mining crews. Jack lives in an enclosed city called the Locality which has three sections Old, Mid and New. Jack's circumstances have him living in Old, not somewhere you necessarily want to be. Being a psychic investigator doesn't pay well and doesn't garner much respect. Add to that the fact that Jack isn't very good at it.The deeper Jack gets into his investigation of the missing miners, the more people lie to him and want to hurt him, until he's not sure what the truth is. An old \\"friend\\" who he had enlisted to help him gets killed and Jack finds himself taking care of Billie, a clever, smart, but old-before-her-years 12 year old girl who was living with the friend under unsavory circumstances.Wyrmhole is pretty well written and moves along at a decent pace but ultimately has problems. Jack is not good as an investigator. In fact, I'm not sure he figured any part of it out himself. Someone else was always helping him and pushing him in the right direction. There is also little reason given for you to care about Jack; he's a loser of his own making. When the whole mystery is finally revealed in the end, I was left feeling, 'That was it? That's what took 300 pages to get to?'This isn't a bad novel and it did keep my interest, but it needed work."},{"Title":"Wyrmhole","review":"I really like this book, plot was a bit lazy, but the writing style was good. Good character interaction, very good emoting of the central characters. The only thing was that even though he's suppose to be solving things on an unconscious, intuitive level, it does make it seem as if this PI doesn't really solve things so much as been given strategically placed plot movers to make the story progress. Still, this book is more about the journey rather than the end trip. Entertaining just to read and go with it. Like it much better than his 2nd novel in this series."},{"Title":"Wyrmhole","review":"Jay Caselberg's \\"Wyrmhole\\" starts out with a lot of promise: an interesting concept and setting coupled with good, clear writing. But, that promise quickly deteriorates. The further you get into the book, the more you're aware that the main character, a variant of an investigator, has no people skills, no organizational skills, no technical skills, and no INVESTIGATIVE skills. He basically moves through the book by thrashing around and luckily finding others to follow up on the hints he gets from his psychic skills. How we're supposed to believe that he could ever put food on the table as an investigator I don't know. Couple this with a lack of a logical progression through the plot and I can only charitably give it a Pretty Bad 2 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Wyrmhole","review":"Reading this book, it's not hard to see what the writer was going for. However, it isn't hard to see that he didn't quite get it, either. The quoted reviews on the book lead one to believe this is a tense thriller, and an intriguing lead-in dangles a promise of delivering. Unfortunately, the story grows ever more flaccid and relies more heavily on hard-boiled cliche to advance the story.Unlike the masters of the detective genre, the author neglected to weave a cohesive story, or convincing motivations for the various players. Credibility is stretched thin as the author asks us to believe that there is a credible need for psychic detective services for this problem; that those involved in the coverup are dangerous folks, even while they're paying for the investigation and never do more than render the investigator unconscious to keep him from the truth; that the psychic investigator in question is clued in to the answers by visions connected tenuously (at best) and so obtuse as to defy any rational explanation.The author certainly has some good ideas, but this story certainly wasn't polished enough to warrant publishing in this form."},{"Title":"Wyrmhole","review":"Jack Stein, Psychic Investigator. It's a great hook, and Caselberg brings in some wonderful ideas over the course of the book.Stein is hired to investigate the disappearance of a miner. He's also hired to learn more about a lost handipad (PDA) that comes into his possession. Naturally, the cases are related, leading him into a web of business deals and betrayals.I wanted this book to be more than it was. I never felt all that connected to the protagonist, or to any of the characters, really. The plot also felt a bit forced. Of Stein's psychic abilities, Caselberg writes, \\"Things didn't happen by chance to Jack Stein. Coincidence was always loaded. Events seemed to coalesce around Jack.\\" Unfortunately, that means the plot relies pretty heavily on these coincidences, which strains the credulity of the reader.One of the most fascinating concepts for me was the Locality, the self-contained city which constantly rebuilds itself, leaving the old portion to fall into decay and ruin. Thematically, it was a powerful symbol, in addition to being a downright nifty idea. I hope he does more with it in future books.I did finish the book, and I was relatively satisfied at the end. As a first novel, it's not bad, and Caselberg clearly has a great deal of potential. I just don't think this book completely fulfills that potential."},{"Title":"Wyrmhole","review":"Jack's supposed to be supernaturally intuitive, but instead he comes off as lazy, unaware, and stupid. Part of this is bad writing; he puts it all together on one page and three pages later, he's putting the very SAME thing together. I don't think he forgot; the writer did. The world around him is full of people with the same short attention span as Jack, too. The setting itself is a lackadaisical world-view made manifest. In the end Jack wants to break out of all that, but he won't; he'll take it with him."},{"Title":"Wyrmhole","review":"In the distant future, humanity lives in domed areas the size of cities that are bioorganic, self-perpetuating structures. The rich live in the newest areas and the not so wealthy reside in the old section that will disintegrate in a decade or so. Jack Stein, a former black ops agent, works as a physic detective, a person with the gift of psychometry and the ability to find clues in his dreams.Outreach Industries, a very powerful and wealthy corporation, hires Jack to learn what happened to the miners on Daril III who disappeared without a trace. A lover of one of the lost miner's works in the home office of Outreach. He gives Jack the missing Miner's hand held computer. It is password protected so he goes to someone who can crack the code. When he returns, the person is dead, the eleven-year-old child who was staying there goes home with Jack and the police pay him a visit. There is obviously more going on than some missing miners and the conspiracy of silence coaxes Jack to keep tying to solve the case.Fans of futuristic crime thrillers like J.D. Robb's Death series will definitely enjoy WYRMHOLE. The protagonist is a complex man who wears blinders until he is forced to take them off and see the world as it really is (sort of like the Matrix but more mental than physical illusion). Once he does that, the audience sees his inner strength and moral compass emerge and appreciate the man he has become. Science fiction fans and readers who like private investigator talesm, especially those who appreciate a strong convergence, will enjoy this futuristic urban noir.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wyrmhole","review":"A bewitching read. In WYRMHOLE, Caselberg presents the reader with a human god figure, Van der Stegen, who builds a utopian city, The Locality. He bequeaths to the inhabitants of this city a controlled, fake environment, much like a computerized biosphere. Ceiling panels provide pseudo skies, moon, sun, stars, clouds and rain. The hero, Jack Stein, psychic investigator (PI), lives in the Locality. Van der S has also discovered how to transport matter through wormhole gates. His beautiful daughter, however, is trying to squeeze him out. All good stuff except the reader must spend the entire novel inside the head of PI Jack. That can be a bit of a chore.One of the characters, an almost twelve year old girl, Billie, a super hacker, is more mature than any of the adults, and, thus, stretches one's credibility. But as screwed up as the adults are, perhaps she can be viewed as a breath of fresh air.The ambiance is one of film noir, complete with a fake Hollywood set, PI Jack, who begins the story as a wimpy character, having lost hold of his old, violent, military training, is twice beaten to a pulp. Later, amazingly, his skills return and he can kill his opponents with a single blow. PI Jack is concurrently hired by three different parties in this convoluted story. But PI Jack's brilliant resolution of this case not only satisfies two of his three bosses but also allows him to free himself, and Billie, from the \\"mindless, patterned consumption\\" of the Locality&Ntilde;&Ntilde;from the confines of his own tortured soul.

It is well structured and explains the design process in a very clear manner. The design project management part of the book gives good practices that are applicable in any type of projects. Just for this I strongly recommend this book. However, I would have stayed away from the drafting and sketching technics, as well as the computer illustration. I found it steered the reader away from how a design project is conducted."},{"Title":"Engineering Design: A Practical Guide","review":"The first four chapters of this book are very useful, but they are short and jumbled. The information in the appedicies is more useful than the rest of the text. It provides an entires methodology for using programs to complete projects.'The biggest problem I see with this book is the grammatical errors, at least two per chapter as well as spelling mistakes such as wonder. ie \\"people continuously wonder to and away from the presenter.\\" the word is wander. These are doctors at Penn. State, they should be able to spell.anyway there is probably better books out there but this one was fairly inexpensive and does have alot of information."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Turkic Languages","review":"My first thought on seeing the book was that it wasn't nearly big enough. About an inch thick, and I'd expected a huge volume. Looking into it confirmed this. I was specifically looking for the word &quot;eclipse&quot;, and it wasn't there. On the plus side, GREAT comparative study between these languages. Separate sections for each language, then a comparative word list. Overall not bad, but wish it were a little more comprehensive."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Turkic Languages","review":"My greatest thanks to the authors for compiling an admirable comparative study of modern Turkic languages.

The photographs are superb and excellent examples. Clear direction is given for building the stream and there are plenty of plant suggestions to make the stream look natural. This book complements Water in the Garden by James Allison - which in my opinion is the best pond book on the market. Both of these books combine inspirational photographs with practical knowledgeable directions."},{"Title":"The Stream Garden: Create Your Own Natural-Looking Water Feature","review":"I can't complain too much because I got this from a seller on Amazon literally for one penny. Had I not, I probably wouldn't be nearly as happy though.I am in the process of creating a backyard utopia, as a do-it-yourselfer. Because we have the misfortunate of having a very sloped yard, I thought I'd turn that into fortune and utilize its slope for a flowing waterfall that looks natural.This is a very thin book and, although it does offer some good information, it has very few pictures and less information as compared to just simple free instructions I found on the internet.However, if you are looking for what plants are best to put around your pond or waterfall, this would be helpful as almost half the book is just about plants, in spite of its small size.I can't say I won't utilize any of the information as it had some useful notes...mainly in the plant section, and with a few tips, however, we went to Home Depot the next day and I started flipping through one of their own do-it-yourself books on ponds and found more information than I'd located anywhere on the net, or in this book. So I made a second purchase.This book is more sketches and line drawings or type, than photographs of the steps and how it should look and some may prefer that. However, I'm a better learner with visuals in addition to the written explanations...I find that more easily understood in do-it-yourself steps I've never done before. And this has mostly black and white drawings in addition to the type.Conclusion: It was worth it for the price I paid from a used book seller on Amazon, but if I'd gone to Home Depot first I probably would have skipped this purchase all together.Now pray for me that I don't kill a bunch of goldfish in the near future. That's my biggest fear of this pond building...there will be small lives at stake to test how well I do. My neighbor's fish have been romancing one another too often for their small pond so we're getting lots of free babies.Tip: If you are looking for inexpensive pond supplies, check Craigslist. We found a fiberglass pond form for our base that was HUGE and only 35 bucks...also free stone, a used pump, new liner, etc. It's a good place to start. But be wary of the pumps...most we have found are too small for a large pond and we've been unable to find a pump/filter combo which is what we really want so I think we may pass on the pumps from there."},{"Title":"Dari: Dari-English English-Dari Dictionary & Phrasebook (Hippocrene Dictionary & Phrasebooks)","review":"Initially I wasn't very impressed with this book, but, as I'm about halfway through an intensive Dari first-year course right now, I've come to appreciate it more for its easy use in conversation.The first half of the book, as other users have mentioned, is a Dari-English and English-Dari set of brief dictionaries. The second half has topical vocabulary and phrases -- travel, shopping, education, relief & aid work, etc (As well as some less useful phrases - all the parts of a car?!).My general sense is that I went through the phrases when I first got the book then found them to be less useful, but as I learn more grammar it's helpful to go back through the phrases and see how they're actually used. I'm required to write in Dari, so I would definitely have appreciated a book that had the script as well as the transliteration of sounds, but when I need a mental break from the Arabic script, working with the English is an easy way to absorb vocabulary. Bulkin'sDari-English/English-Dari Practical Dictionaryis better for in-depth mastery, but for a good and portable way to learn some vocab, Awde's not a bad place to start."},{"Title":"Dari: Dari-English English-Dari Dictionary & Phrasebook (Hippocrene Dictionary & Phrasebooks)","review":"This, for me, is better than the more advertised language learning product.

It's an excellent phrase book, but many of the Dari terms used would raise eyebrows from Mazar to Kabul. If you don't mind occasionally being in the position of a guy walking into a biker bar and saying, \\"Ho, good innkeeper, willst thou draw me a draught of your finest ale?\\", this book provides an interesting, and indeed useful, introduction to Dari. Provided the barman gets beyond your initial, \\"Ho . . .\\" The pronounciations sometimes follow the Iranian more than the Afghan model, many of the words use the Iranian rather than the Afghan varient (q.y., beer, strawberry), many of the phrases are far more flowery than commonly used, and the pronunciation guide and the verb forms used -- well, an additional expression that could well have been used in the book is \\"be-resh\\" which literally means \\"beardless\\" but the metaphorical meaning transcends \\"campy.\\" Go ahead and buy this book if you are heading toward Afghanistan; your ear will quickly atune you to the pronunciation and verb forms commonly used. Think of Dari as probably the easiest language for a native English speaker to learn, perhaps the second easiest after Malay, study the book, and be confident in your conversation with Afghans. Most of them are pretty forgiving in matters of language."},{"Title":"Dari: Dari-English English-Dari Dictionary & Phrasebook (Hippocrene Dictionary & Phrasebooks)","review":"This is an excellant book for travel.

This book is a wonderful book for families!"},{"Title":"The Invisible String","review":"The Invisible String is THE most requested book in our house, and has held this status for quite some time. The book was a lifesaver for our family when my husband was deployed for a year with the Air Force. The description of how people are connected by love over long distances is so well done and understandable that it helped my 3-year-old and 5-year-old know that they were still connected to their dad even though they couldn't see him. It sparked a nightly ritual of \\"pulling Dad's strings,\\" and we could feel him pulling back. I recommend this book highly for any family that finds themselves separated from each other for any reason, and I think it should be standard issue to the families of any deployed military personnel. You won't regret buying this one -- in fact, you should buy two so you can give one as a gift!"},{"Title":"The Invisible String","review":"I highly recommend this book. A friend of mine bought it for my 4 year old son during our first Christmas without Daddy, who we lost to cancer. It was very comforting to my son and to me as well. I also really like the book because it is more about love than separation or loss and it gave my son a comforting way to think about his dad, even though we can't see him or talk to him anymore. It is a wonderful story and I highly recommend it to any parent who needs a way to comfort a child after a loss."},{"Title":"The Invisible String","review":"This book is good for small children as well as those up to about 9 or 10.

When a family member or loved one is physically far from the child (living in another state, in the military, divorced, passed away, etc) THE INVISIBLE STRING always keeps them connected. I gave this book to my niece when she was young, with a map of the U.S.A. taped inside and a line (string) drawn from California to Tennessee, as we lived many miles apart, but were always connected with THE INVISIBLE STRING of love."},{"Title":"The Invisible String","review":"This is a very sweet book for children -- my kids and I enjoyed it immensely. It opened up a nice discussion about loving a parent who is not in the same country, as is the case for my children. I would highly recommend it for any child facing separation from a parent for any length of time. There are also no religious overtones, which is helpful, and the story features a mom and her twins, a boy and a girl, so the 3-member family structure is accepted as a given. My children identified with the kids, who want to be near their mother during a thunderstorm, and the mother came across as warm and loving. All in all a very nicely done book."},{"Title":"The Invisible String","review":"Although this book is meant to be read to children, I have given it as a gift to all of my closest friends and family members as a way to say \\"I'm so gald we're connected!\\" I also used its basic message to reassure my daughter that even though she was going off to all-day kindergarten, we would still be connected by our invisible strings. This is a very heart-warming story with a bigger message than appears on the surface."},{"Title":"The Invisible String","review":"I found The Invisible String recommended for children dealing with loss, separation, or grief; in our family, it has been very useful! We did change one bit of text: from \\"Uncle Brian in Heaven\\" to \\"Daddy in Heaven\\", to make it more applicable to the children involved. After reading through the book just once, all of the children (a set of five cousins, all 3 to 6 years old) had multiple cheerful conversations where they discussed all the invisible strings that connect each of them to those they love, even to those who have recently died. The concepts in the book are very gentle and kind, and the book uses a great amount of child-like hyperbole as the children in the story set out a series of far-fetched situations they think could pass the reach of their mother's invisible string... and of course, Mother assures them there is nowhere they can go that will be out of reach of her love. The story ends in a happy way, with the children reaching their own conclusions about being connected to loved ones.I have a feeling this book will be a family favorite; it's a great addition to the family shelf, whether the children are dealing with mild separation anxiety, deployed loved ones, or the death of friends or family members. It will open doors to discuss loss in a framework of faith, as well, though the book is not specifically religious in nature. I found myself encouraged by the conversations that followed reading the book, in our little troupe of cousins. It seemed to give them a useful vocabulary to discuss their grief and sense of loss, while giving them a useful tool (that invisible string of love!) to verbalize their feelings."},{"Title":"The Invisible String","review":"I gave this book to my cousin's child who just turned 3 years old. I brought the book, unwrapped, to his family birthday party. On the end pages I wrote \\"We are all connected to you, Cooper, by invisible strings of love\\" Then I had his parents grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and others write their names on the pages. I hope his mother passes the book to others who were not there for them to sign. I hope this book will be a valued treasure for him in the next 40+ years, when some of us who signed are gone. When his mother read the book aloud to Cooper and the other children, they listened in rapt silence. I have already ordered copies for the other children in the family."},{"Title":"The Invisible String","review":"I bought and read this book to my granddaughter as a way to soothe her broken heart after her beloved Guinea pig Dasher died. It's a simple and beautiful way to explain the concept that, when someone very dear to us dies, the bonds of love are never broken. Death may end a life, but it does not end our relationship with the one who has died. Love can live forever in our hearts, as long as we keep our memories alive. As a grief counselor, I've recommended The Invisible String to countless clients and to my professional colleagues as well."},{"Title":"The Invisible String","review":"This is a wonderful book for everyone, but since it is really marketed for children, this is how I will comment on this book. This story will help children not to be afraid and sad when someone they are missing, whether it be through death or by distance, are still in their heart. Just the way the story is told any child will feel comforted by the fact that they are always connected by the feelings in their heart to another loved one. This book will help if a pet has died or just went to live somewhere else. If a friend had to move away or if a parent just went to work. I bought it because my sister-in-law is very sick and will not be living to much longer. She has a 6 year old daughter and I thought this book would help to know that her mommy still loves her and that she is still with her in her heart."},{"Title":"The Invisible String","review":"I was among a group of adults to whom this book was read (so I haven't seen the pictures yet).

My thanks to Ms. Karst for the powerful reminder that we are not alone, no matter what we are going through."},{"Title":"The Invisible String","review":"My best friend recently passed away. I bought this book for her three young children. It talks about two little kids who are afraid to be alone in their room at night during a thunderstorm. The mother explains how we are never alone. No matter where we are we are always connected to those we love with invisible strings. This book is not just for the loss of a loved one. I think it's great for those moments when a child is away from someone they love....like thunderstorms at night, going to school, a parent away for work or just living further away from a family member or friend."},{"Title":"The Invisible String","review":"Liked it overall, but we whited out the section with religious references.

It is beautifully explained with wonderful Illustrations through out the book. My 5 year old daughter was relieved about the subject of death after reading this book together.

It proposes that everyone that you love is connected by a string, this time it is an invisible string instead of a red string.

I bought it for my 6 year old granddaughter because she told me that I had begun to have gray hairs and that she didn't want me to get old. (She doesn't know that people dye their hair at my age) LOL. So I told her not to worry that I would take care of the gray. Then she told my daughter that she didn't want me to die.

But upon reading it we found this to be a pleasant jewel for any loss. We lost our Nanny (Grandparent to a heart attack at 62 yrs old). This charming book helps them with her death as well. Our little one talks about being able to feel Nanny pulling her string and they pull hers. It works for our long distance grandparents as well who live in another state. When I send them off to school they both (ages 5 and almost 3) talk about pulling my string. It worked wonders for her separation anxiety--now she bounces off to preschool!

It is a fun read, but not as outstanding as the other books in this series.The crew receives a message from a planet inhabited only by doves. It turns out that their beans have swollen and clogged the storm sewer drains, causing the entire planet to flood. Very far-fetched, indeed.The birds sent an SOS to Star Fleet when their wings grew tired from having no place to land. Mistaking their bird language, Commander Toad's crew brings a shipload of beans, which the birds don't really want. They just need dry ground on which to rest.In the end, Commander Toad saves the day by swimming underwater to pierce the swollen beans with his official Star Fleet gadget. Then he must hold on to a statue of the Mayor while everything unattached goes down the drain! Swallow your disbelief!The reason this book is not as good as the remainder of the series is because, in a few cases, the pictures don't mesh with the story. I.e. the text says Doc Peeper goes to the planet's surface, but the image doesn't show him in the sky skimmer. Also, the plot is even more oddball than usual.Incredibly fun series of books. Try _Commander Toad and the Space Pirates_ or _Commander Toad and the Intergalactic Spy_."},{"Title":"Me? Jewish?","review":"Wow!

The author has obviously done a great deal of study on the topic and, as well, has undoubtedly received an inner understanding.

The Revelations of a Black American Christian Jewish Woman tells of God speaking to her, regarding her background, while she was driving to work. Jews in days past were black and were dispersed throughout Africa when God became displeased with the disbelief and worship of idols. She uses scripture to prove her case and then takes it further by showing, according to scripture, that the reason black people were removed from Africa and taken to the New World as slaves was because of our wickedness; God needed to bring us back to Christ.Ms. Thomas has done considerable research in the Bible to make her points and backs all her statements with scriptures. Her comment that our slavery was our doing is eerily reminiscent of slave traders and owners who justified their abject abuse and theft of human beings as \\"bringing them to the Lord.\\" Quite frankly, I had considerable difficulty swallowing that theory.Reviewed by Alice Holmanof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Me?

The material is interesting, the style holds your attention, and draws the reader into the realm being explored.From a spiritual perspective, what a blessing you have experienced. what a task you have been given. However, the Heavenly Father would not assign you a duty, without having given you the tools needed to complete the mission. this book is an indication of that. You have shed light on a subject that has been overlooked for thousands of years. Was it overlooked or hidden?

Nibley (1910-2005) was a professor of Biblical and Mormon scripture at Brigham Young University. He was also a well-known defender of the Latter-Day Saints religion.He writes in the Foreword to this 1961 book, \\"the whole structure of anti-Mormon scholarship rests upon trumped-up evidence. We recommend a rapid reading of the following pages to bring out the peculiar flavor of their nonsense. We have chosen a shot-gun method of presentation, our witnesses testifying in rapid confusion. The reader may be annoyed that so little effort has been made to follow through numerous blunders and delicious absurdities, but this forebearance is deliberate--we see no point in laboring the obvious.\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"If they were really (Joseph) Smith's cronies, they must have been pretty low-life themselves. And if they were not his cronies, how could they have discovered the vices they know so much about?\\" (Pg. 17)\\"Well, every mine is a speculation, and every owner hopes to make money; I hardly see how that makes out the Smiths to be money-diggers. They were digging for hire, not for gold.\\" (Pg. 23)\\"Surely there are easier ways of fooling people than by composing a large and complex book which, as the book itself foretells, simply invites persecution. How do these people explain the colossally exhausting and dangerous task of writing, publishing and spreading it abroad as the enterprise of the laziest man on earth?\\" (Pg. 82)\\"No other group on earth has done more journal-writing and record keeping than the Mormons... In all the mountains of material they have turned out there should be masses of evidence for these wild and conflicting stories if the Mormons were the authors of them.\\" (Pg. 162)\\"There were altogether too many witnesses; they were too eager; they all knew Smith so very, very well, though there is not the slightest indication that Smith ever knew THEM.\\" (Pg. 189)"},{"Title":"JAM TRAX FOR HARMONICA","review":"If you haven't had the chance to play togheter with other people this could give you a clue what it's like.

There are slow blues, faster blues, rock etc and they are played in different keys so you need moore than one harmonica if you should be able to play them all(except if you play the chromatic harmonica). Some of the playing examples where good but I learned most from playing togheter with the Cd where I learned how and when bluessongs changes keys within the song.

He covers various attempts though the ages by Christians, primarily, _to locate_ the \\"garden of Eden.\\" This book's \\"usefulness\\" is in its comprehensive coverage of various authors up to about the time of the Enlightenment (18th century AD). Towards the end of his book he concludes Eden \\"is a myth\\" and gives his reasons for this position. His \\"bibliography\\" of sources consulted _is impressive_ and should be useful to those unaware of the vast number of books and treatises done on Eden over the ages."},{"Title":"History of Paradise: The Garden of Eden in Myth and Tradition","review":"In this day and age of critical theory and revisionist history, it is refreshing to have a strong, document based, historicist's account of a concept such as 'paradise'. Regretfully today the idea 'paradise' has become either an almost empty platitude for the tourist industry,and other commercial commoditities or some type of incomprehensible 'carrot' for the suicide martyr.Delumeau is able to demonstrate the evolution of the concept and today's deconstruction of paradise through an acceptance of 'evolution' but only because he first establishes the original sacred and secular constructs.The examples of 'paradise' depicted in medieval manuscripts, and medieval and renaissance art will appeal to the art history lover looking for more in depth context for the paradise narrative.Although I found there was a little too much of a bias towards the Western traditions and a subjective weighting given to certain stories such as Prestor John's Kingdom , the book overall was informative and for fact and fiction writers alike, revisiting paradise with Delumeau is a worthwhile inspirational journey ."},{"Title":"Paper Piecing Picnic: Fun-Filled Projects for Every Quilter","review":"This book has 16 projects that will appeal to kids and adults alike.

Among the many pluses of the book are understandable advice, awesome and awful photos illustrating how to photograph and how not to, a colloquial writing style, print one can read without a magnifying glass, and, this was definitely not expected, ideas for locations to visit. I especially found it valuable to learn about photographing through glass and fences. For example, on page 54 in the book are several photos of a red panda in Zoo Atlanta. The first photo could have been mine. One can see a lot of metal fencing and ask: \\"Where is the animal?\\" In the last photo is only the red panda - no cage, no fence, and no wall. I am looking forward to follow Havelin's directions: \\"Look for right angle to minimize glare, and the correct depth of field to remove disturbing fence elements in front of and behind the subject creature.\\""},{"Title":"The Greek New Testament, 4th Revised Edition","review":"I own both the UBS text and the Nestle Aland text. As noted by the previous reviewer, there are some differences in how the UBS text notes variant readings. I find the UBS method to be both more complete and easier to read. (See below on the commentary available). I also find the text to be easier to read (slightly larger print, and I think the style of print is easier to read too).A point of clarification, though, regarding the basic Greek Text. My understanding is that there is very little if any difference IN THE GREEK TEXT between these two editions. They BOTH rely and build upon the work of Wescott and Hort in textual criticism, and reach very similar conclusions about the &quot;best readings&quot; for any given variant.The companion volume (A Textual Commentary) also published by UBS is a GREAT addition. It helps you understand why the committee reached the conclusions they did about which reading may be the best reading. Note; whenever a variant reading exists in the extensive library of ancient manuscripts, it is noted in the footnotes (Critical Apparatus). There is also a note as to how comfortable the committee was about their selection of the best text. An &quot;A&quot; rating means that there is no question in their minds. A &quot;D&quot; rating might mean that the selected reading is only very slightly more likely to be the original reading than one of the other variants. (I hope that is clear). In some cases I have taken exception with their decision on &quot;D&quot; readings, and it helps to know that they were not completely comfortable with the choice they had made.One advantage of the Nestle text is that it is just slightly smaller and easier to carry (a vest pocket edition. (As noted above, you pay for the size in it being not as easy to read.) My copy of Nestle is cloth bound while the UBS text is bound in vinyl/plastic. My UBS text has proven to be very durable. A word of caution... don't leave it on the dashboard or seat of your car on a hot day. The heat WILL damage the binding."},{"Title":"The Greek New Testament, 4th Revised Edition","review":"The authoritative Greek text used by most Bible translators, scholars, and seminaries is the Nestle-Aland text, which is used in the United Bible Society's Greek New Testament, 4th edition, as well as the Nestle-Aland 27th edition. These two editions use the same text, but have different approaches to listing the variant readings found in the manuscripts. For more reviews of Greek New Testaments, lexicons, grammars, etc. see &quot;http://www.mindspring.com/~jwrobie/littleGreek.html&quot;."},{"Title":"The Greek New Testament, 4th Revised Edition","review":"Just be aware if you order from this listing or if you are selling from this listing that the description in the title does not even fit an edition of the UBS 4 Greek New Testament. It does come in leather and the listed ISBN matches that but if it has a dictionary it will not be leather as this was not printed. If you are selling a copy of this please be sure to match the ISBN on the cover page to the four digit code on the back of the cover (for the leather edition this is 5111).And to be clear I was not disappointed with the seller as much as with how Amazon allows this to be listed. Be sure you are ordering what you want before hitting buy."},{"Title":"The Greek New Testament, 4th Revised Edition","review":"The quality of print and binding is fairly decent, though I ordered the vinyl-bound version and have some doubts as to how well it will hold up to frequent use. The Greek text is clear, large, and readable, even though (like some others here) I am not too fond of the italic font used in the main text. I on the whole prefer the bold-face font used to indicate quoted passages from the Old Testament. However, I have found that even as a beginning reader of Greek one tends to prefer certain fonts, particularly those one learned Greek with or those found in older Greek texts. However, the font is certainly readable, and I have definitely seen much worse.As I am no scholar of the New Testament or of biblical textual criticism, I cannot comment much on the critical apparatus given, though it appears at least to provide a great deal of information, if perhaps presented under a somewhat off-putting code of Blackface and Hebrew letters, subscripts, superscripts, and etc. Hopefully in the future I will be able to make use of this apparatus, though as presented (certainly to save space) it appears a bit daunting.The addition of the general dictionary will be of some use to the beginner, but only as a starting point or as a general gloss. A knowledge of verb forms and noun/adjective declensions is a must, as is the use of a good lexicon, since you will most certainly find yourself searching in vain in this book's dictionary for some irregular verb form. However, the dictionary is handy in a pinch.On the whole, the quality of the book and its capacity as a general reader rates four stars in my opinion, minus one star for the unorthodox font and potentially weak binding."},{"Title":"The Greek New Testament, 4th Revised Edition","review":"This is the GNT that you want, though having the same text, this one is much more user friendly than the NA27 Novum Testamentum Graece.

The only \\"complaint\\" I would have, and reason why I have given 4 instead of 5 stars is for the italic font. You will either love it or hate it. My eyes are not the best for it. If your eyes strain even a little for some fonts, they may even more with this one.

Wonderful to work with him."},{"Title":"The Greek New Testament, 4th Revised Edition","review":"Personally, I much favor the Majority Text (MT) or even the \\"Textus Receptus\\" to the Critical Text (CT) found in this book. However, this volume is very helpful for its textual apparatus. Where there are significant variants, at the bottom of the page are notations indicating which manuscripts support the reading found in the text, along with the manuscript support for other readings. And these other readings are often found in the MT or TR. So this book is helpful for doing studies on textual variants.In fact, I utilized this book extensively when I was working on my book \\"Differences Between Bible Versions.\\" My book has a chapter looking at textual variants between the MT and the CT and another looking at variants between the MT and the TR. And in these chapters I cite the manuscript evidence from this Greek Testament.However, the conclusions I come to are often different than the ones the editors of the text came to. One reason for this difference is our differing opinions as to whether the handful of Alexandrian or the mass of Byzantine manuscripts are more reliable. The editors of this volume believe the former are while I believe the latter are. I discuss my reasons for preferring Byzantine manuscripts in my book, along with other issues separating those who favor these different Greek texts.So I would recommend this \\"Greek Testament\\" for its textual apparatus. But before accepting its conclusions on variants, consult a book like mine for a different opinion."},{"Title":"The Greek New Testament, 4th Revised Edition","review":"The apparatus of this edition lacks all variant readings which are important for someone interested in stylistic problems. The codex Alexandrinus on which this edition is heavily based is very much an atticised version of the New Testament. However, there are many manuscripts that are written in a more koine style. Like all the UBS editions this edition underestimates the importance of philological research as has been done, for instance, by Sturz and other philogists. Of course, style has never been a preoccupation of students of christianity."},{"Title":"The Greek New Testament, 4th Revised Edition","review":"Good job, but, body text is now in italics (!?)

But, still, I think this is a nice edition. I liked the introduction, which was clear and informative, and I like the footnotes, which are a big help.The inclusion of a dictionary in the back is wonderful (this is a Koine Greek edition). Previously, I had to juggle a couple of books. I've always had a problem with being too compulsive (look up meaning, even when I already know it, just in case there is a nuance I might miss).

To see favorite characters changed when faced with a lifetime of death and destruction, is a triumph to the scriptwriters of this idea &quot;Age of Apocolypse.&quot; Colossus and Shadowcat are now Peter and Kate husband and wife charged with the training of the Generation Next cast. Their bitterness exudes in every frame as they try to mold the students to be hardened and cynical fighting machines. The plight of the humans and those on the business end of Apocolypses boot seem especially tragic here. The ending still haunts me everytime I read it. If you truly enjoy the alternate reality of Age of Apocolypse this particular story is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Generation Next (X-Men: The Age of Apocalypse Gold Deluxe Edition)","review":"Generation X was one of my favorite comics in the 90's. Don't get me wrong, in those days the X-men were awesome all on their own and I loved those books. But at the time I was a teenager in the 90's so having a team of mutants that were all teenagers as well was awesome!They were X-men in training, they were my age and they had problems like I had in my life at that time! They were having trouble talking to the opposite sex, they were doing school work, and they were living away from their parents for the first time as well. All things that teenagers could relate to.There's not really much as far as spoilers that I will go into but I will say that the story is a good side story in the Age of Apocalypse that eventually is brought into the fold with the other main stories. The artwork is the same as the Generation X comics that were going on just before AoA started, the writing was also pretty good and overall it was a great comic.The only downside is that the cover is all in gold and it makes it hard to see what is going on on the cover. I much rather would have liked them to just put the cover of issue one on the cover."},{"Title":"Generation Next (X-Men: The Age of Apocalypse Gold Deluxe Edition)","review":"When the Legion Quest storyline ended, an alternate universe was created due to the fact that Legion went back in time to kill Magneto but accidently killed Charles Xavier. Since Xavier died, there was no X-Men to stop Apocalypse from taking over America and most of the world. This alternate reality, The Age of Apocalypse, put all the regular X-books on hold for four issues and replaced them with they're AoA versions. Generation Next (Generation X) is a storyline revolving around Magneto (the X-Men's founder and leader in this alternate universe) sending husband and wife Colossus and Shadowcat on a mission to save Colossus' long thought dead sister from a human slave colony. Accompanying them is the AoA version of Generation X; consisting of Chamber, Husk, Skin, Mondo, and Vincent. The gritty art brings the emotional impact of the story out even more than it should, and the emotionally charged tragic ending really makes this TPB of Generation Next excell more than it should. All in all, a great read for older fans of the X-Men or Generation X comics."},{"Title":"Generation Next (X-Men: The Age of Apocalypse Gold Deluxe Edition)","review":"Dear Evree Won,Out of all the AGE OF APOCALYPSE stories this has to been the most emotionaly charged.

Elizabeth is in a real quandary over this horse because his owner is her worst enemy! I though the storyline went well. HOWEVER people who are more knowledgeable about horses than the average Jane will cringe at a few of the scenes, especially the show. I felt the author did not do enough research on the horse show world."},{"Title":"First Place (Sweet Valley Twins Series, Book 8)","review":"I loved this book the first time I read it (being a horse lover myself) and I bought it soon after. I liked many of the parts, but I think that the horse scenes need a little work. For example, how is it that Elizabeth can canter after one lesson? Also, although a rider can learn a lot in one month, if Elizabeth was the star at Carson, who was she compared to?? Altogether, it was a good book and I think we need more horse oriented stories by Francine Pascal."},{"Title":"First Place (Sweet Valley Twins Series, Book 8)","review":"Synopsis: Lila Fowler's father just bought her a new horse recently, and she is already bored with him. Elizabeth loves horses and feels slightly jealous because Lila has one and doesn't even appreciate it. Lila suggests Elizabeth spend some time with Thunder, her horse, in return for Elizabeth writing an article about Thunder in the Sixers. At first, Elizabeth is offended that Lila just wants her name in the paper, but later agrees to the idea.At first sight, Elizabeth falls in love with Thunder. Even though Elizabeth cannot stand Lila, they start spending time together. Lila invites Elizabeth to help her with her homework. Elizabeth even agrees to take care of Thunder on a daily basis, just to be close to him.Later, Elizabeth and Jessica meet Ted, the stable boy at Carson Stables (where Thunder is kept), and Jessica gets a crush on him. However, Ted seems to be more interested in watching Elizabeth ride Thunder. Jessica is furious at Elizabeth for stealing Lila and her would be boyfriend Ted. To make matters worse, Lila invites Elizabeth to her slumber party, that for most of the time, only Unicorn members are invited to. At the slumber party, Elizabeth accidentally mentions Amy and Ken kissing at Julie Porter's party.On top of all this, Elizabeth decides to enter the beginner's round of the owner's competition by pretending to be Thunder's owner, feeling that if she won, she could give the prize money to Lila. At the last minute, things backfire for Elizabeth. Amy finds out about Elizabeth revealing her secret and tells Lila about the competition. Lila goes to stop the competition. Will Elizabeth be able to ride Thunder without losing all her friends?Review: This was a fun book to read. I enjoyed the relationship between Elizabeth and Lila, and kept wondering how far Liz would go to be on Lila's good side, just to ride Thunder. Some parts were hilarious, like when the Unicorns refer to Amy as \`hot lips Sutton' for kissing Ken Matthews.The author also gives detailed description about the horse and the stables in general. For someone who doesn't know much about these things, I found it interesting to learn about the time and energy it took to take care of a horse.The book also ends well by giving a fair punishment for Elizabeth for deceiving others. Lila is her usual self, but I found her bearable in this book because she wasn't trying her best to bring someone else down."},{"Title":"First Place (Sweet Valley Twins Series, Book 8)","review":"Lila Fowler,the richest,and snobbiest girl in Sweet Valley has a horse of her own,Thunder.She doesn't care about it at all.Elizabeth loves and cares about horses,so she desides to be friends with Lila.

Clarke, as an early Methodist, was deeply influenced by the teachings of John Wesley who held to Protestant teaching (i.e. sola scriptura, and justification by faith) while not neglecting the invaluable richness found in the Catholic and Orthodox traditions (i.e. ethics of holiness, sanctification). In this, one finds in Wesley a beautiful synthesis of the best of church thought throughout the ages. As a Wesleyan, Clarke gives a thorough and systematic explanation of Scripture which serves as a check to the imbalances of Calvinism and Reformed theology. In doing so I find him biblically accurate and refreshing. I highly recommend this author and work to the church."},{"Title":"Clarkes Commentary: Job Malachi","review":"Clarke is an Arminian, that is he denies the doctrines of protestant reformed theology as taught by Luther, Calvin and all the great names of the protestant reformation.

It contains a Perry Mason novelette and three short stories. Two predate the Perry Mason series.The \\"Crying Swallow\\" story begins when Della Street brings a pile of money to Perry Mason from a new client. Major Claude L. Winnett, millionaire playboy, aviator, and POW wants to find his new wife who has disappeared. Marcia left a goodbye letter. There had been a burglary the day before Marcia disappeared. Claude heard a swallow crying just before his wife screamed as she saw the burglar. Perry, Della, and Paul Drake will visit his estate and inspect the property. Perry looks into the swallow's nest and finds something; a stored shotgun was not loaded with ammunition. They notice tracks and signs on a road outside of the fence. Perry looks at a trash pile and concludes it was from a man (Chapter 5). Paul Drake's detectives search for the man who bought a lot of groceries early Sat. morning. Their search locates the trailer, but its occupant will not answer any questions. The search for Marcia Winnett locates her by her clothes, and Perry and Della track her to her hotel. Marcia tells how she was blackmailed, and staged a jewel robbery for a payoff to her first husband. Della takes Marcia to a private hospital for her recovery. Perry gathers the facts, and surmises what happened (Chapter 10). Complications are resolved. Unlike many other cases, the murderer is somebody who has not been introduced earlier in the story. This 1947 story is quite shorter than most other cases, as if it was written for a magazine and did not get the usual developed plot.\\"The Candy Kid\\" is about Lester Leith, a gentleman who can solve a crime from a newspaper story and then hijack the loot from the robber. Lester imagines how jewels could be hidden in a candy shop. The story tells how Sergeant Ackley plans to frame Leith. A sweet deal? Leith cleverly deduced the solution of the stolen jewels. This amusing story is from the 1920s era.\\"The Vanishing Corpse\\" is about Sidney Zoom, who can see well in the dark. Officer O'Hara captures a person in the dim light and finds a young girl! What is she doing by the deserted docks at night? Why does she have a pistol? What is in her handbag? The police investigate to learn her background. Was there a theft and a murder? The missing man is seen dead in his car, but when the police arrive the corpse has vanished from a locked automobile! The case against Mildred Kroom isn't perfect. Sidney Zoom explains why she is innocent. A wild story? A psychological trick catches the murderer. Is it \\"divine justice\\"?\\"The Affair of the Reluctant Witness\\" introduces us to Jerry Bane, the heir of a spendthrift trust. He sees the picture of a grocery store owner sued for defamation of character. Is it a scam? Will lawyer Arthur Anson take this case? \\"Mugs\\" Magoo investigates and learns the facts behind the story. Jerry talks to Bernice Calhoun. She describes the life of an owner-operated business. Jerry comes up with a ruse that will help Bernice and allow her to travel out of state. There is a happy ending for some in this clever story. [Does it mirror \\"Perry Mason\\"?]"},{"Title":"The case of the crying swallow","review":"These stories are not the caliber of the typical Gardner tale. The Perry Mason story lacks the dynamic courtroom climax; in fact it was so low-key that I didn't even realize I had reached the conclusion until I was three pages into the next story. In the second story, Lester Leith, who is a very subtle crime boss, outwits the police, although the way they are portrayed, it is not hard. The police believe that he is crooked, but they ineptly try to manufacture evidence in order to frame him. This involves trying to hide jewels in chocolate by partially melting it. Of course, it doesn't work and Leith is enriched at the end. The only good aspect of the story is that you do not know that he is a crook until the very end.In the third story, the main character Sidney Zoom is a private citizen who assists the police. Once again, the police are slow afoot and of head, and it is Zoom that puts the pieces together to solve the murder. The plot lines are a little absurd, as it involves a dummy that is taken for a corpse and a woman who poses as a man. A Japanese servant is also heavily stereotyped in behavior and in speech patterns.The fourth and final story involves a spendthrift man with a trust fund who is trying to obtain additional money from the trustee. The spendthrift manages to manipulate the trustee into thinking he is accepting stolen goods and getting away with it. The plot involves a criminal stealing some jewelry and fleeing into a small store. While in the store, the criminal hides the jewels in a can of dog food, a plot device that is not well delivered.This book was published after Gardner's death, in reading the stories; I got the impression that these were stories that Gardner didn't consider to be his best. They lack the style and tension that is a signature trait of Gardner stories."},{"Title":"The case of the crying swallow","review":"The Swallow was typical Gardner with a nicely complex plot with the identity of the &#34;bad guy&#34; shifting more than once.

This book got me hooked on Magritte!!"},{"Title":"Magritte","review":"\\"We are surrounded by curtains. We only perceive the world behind a curtain of semblance. At the same time, an object needs to be covered in order to be recognized at all.\\" -- Rene MagritteI had the pleasure of seeing Magritte on display at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2006. The exhibit was entitled, \\"The Treachery of Images,\\" and it toyed with many of Magritte's most famous surrealist images. Further intrigued, it was Suzi Gablik's book that I subsequently picked up. As Suzi Gablik explains in her Preface, she met Magritte and his wife in 1959 and that visit resulted in an eight month stay and what would become this monograph (book). Included are excellent essays on Pop and Surrealism, The Human Condition and The Use of Words, not to mention the myriad illustrations. She lifts this curtain in concise and detailed accuracy.In life, Magritte maintained an inconspicuous presence unlike the vainglorious and flamboyant Salvador Dali whose personality was as famous as his paintings.The Magritte paintings I find of particular interest are the paintings within paintings: \\"Evening Falls\\" and \\"Le Seducteur\\" (The Seducer) are two of my personal favorites because of his brilliant blend of inside and outside mental phenomena. He teaches us a new way to see and interpret the mysterious world around us. His influence can even be seen in pop culture, take for instance, Jeff Beck'sBeck-Ola (Exp)or the scene with Johnny Depp inOnce Upon a Time in Mexicothat harkens back to Magritte's \\"The Magician\\" in my opinion.Freud once said, \\"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar...\\" Not so with Magritte. If he said, \\"This is not a pipe,\\" the journey would begin there. A jumping off point. He was always on the lookout for what has never been.

But she reasoned that no doubt Lady Fitzosborne needed someone to help with the household arrangements rather than someone to help entertain her guests, and so she set off for the week-end intending to be as useful as possible.Thus begins a delightful story set in Ireland and later moving to Portugal.'"},{"Title":"George Augustus Selwyn: Pioneer bishop of New Zealand","review":"I love the work of F.W. Boreham, and I enjoyed reading about George Selwyn--however, this is an unedited raw text straight from an archive website. I bought a copy for $20 and it is full of errors, only mostly readable.I recommend finding other editions of F.W. Boreham's works. John Broadbanks Publishing is working on republishing several of them in more affordable versions."},{"Title":"Astrology and reincarnation","review":"Manly Hall's short work on reincarnation and astrology is a good read, however, one might not quite grab onto his ideas immediately if one reads this book in isolation to Hall's other works. I think to really benefit from this book, one should read Hall's other books on Reincarnation and Astrology for I think his ideals differ slightly than from what is written elsewhere. This way to get a firm foundation on what the author understands as \\"reincarnation\\" and \\"astrology\\" would make this book clearer. My personal take on Astrology is limiting which made the read for me more of a curious book than anything I can apply to my current studies. Nonetheless, he makes some interesting remarks regarding the two subjects. The basic premise is that the sign in which we are born in is the continuation of karmic cycles from our previous life. Thus, being born in the Ascendant of Gemini, the processes which I am working with most are of Taurean nature. Furthermore, the author suggests that if we take the time of death for a particular person and erect a horoscope at the moment of death, we can determine to some degree the kind of life the spirit will re-embody. If you are into astrology and are curious about reincarnation, this book is a good stepping stone to the subject and how to utilize information in regards to past and future lives."},{"Title":"Home on the Range: A Culinary History of the American West","review":"What a fabulous book! Far from the names and dates and heroic men which bog down many western histories, this history chronicles the stomachs of the priests, soldiers, and homesteaders who were dreaming of fresh butter, unwormy flour, and other delectables while expanding the American frontier. Memorable photos include soldier's wives cooking in a tent to escape the desert heat, a Franciscan priest frying eggs under an umbrella, and a nice Mormon couple having tea on the prairie."},{"Title":"Home on the Range: A Culinary History of the American West","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I keep it on the coffee table and several of my guests agree and are also looking for a new edition to be printed."},{"Title":"Home on the Range: A Culinary History of the American West","review":"Fascinating history along with many recipes of the old West. Bought this book for my &#34;chef&#34; daughter as she enjoys reading antique cookbooks. I was thumbing through it and found it so interesting I had to find another copy for myself. Worth it!"},{"Title":"Home on the Range: A Culinary History of the American West","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously. Since my grandmother ran a boarding house for school teachers and was known for her cooking, the recipes and stories in this book had special meaning for me. So many of her recipes call for some of the same ingredients seen in Home on the Range. Reading this book gave me special insight into how we don't appreciate the ease with which we can whip up \\"homemade\\" dishes today with all our appliances and modern facilities. We truly don't appreciate how fortunate we are!! This is one I will read over again."},{"Title":"Successful Christian Parenting: Raising Your Child With Care, Compassion, and Common Sense","review":"Mr. MacArthur seems to be talking directly to parents with a deep understanding of what the Bible guides us in childrearing! With multiple references to Biblical scripture, he does not pamper the importance of parenting by God's standards. It's amazing how he presents worldly influences on today's children, which results in defiant, pampered children. This goes completely against God's breathed-words of how children should behave and the importance of God's position of parents as head of the household. \\"Children are not mature or responsible enough to raise themselves. They are to bring joy...\\" Unfortunately, the only dislike I have is the intense repetition. Three times repetition of a subject is a strong indication that it is very important and must be remembered, however, more than that is somewhat tedious."},{"Title":"Successful Christian Parenting: Raising Your Child With Care, Compassion, and Common Sense","review":"So far the book is great. I am only reading a little at a time, but it is very helpful."},{"Title":"Successful Christian Parenting: Raising Your Child With Care, Compassion, and Common Sense","review":"It greatly disturbs me that there are modern Christians who still believe that Serious and Severe Brain disorders such as bipolar disorder are the result of sin. John MacArther attempts to drag christians back into the dark ages where demons, spells, and witchcraft exists. Considering that there is more scientific support for Brain disorders than there is for A.I.D.S. I wonder where he gets off by saying that there is no biological support for Bipolar Disorder. P.E.T. scans now reconfirm to the average person what Doctors have believed for years; Bipolar Disorder is the result of a Chemical imbalance involving at least three Nurotransmitters. Considering that John MacArthur has ZERO experience in the medicine field, I find it odd that he claims to know more than doctors who have trained all of their life. I think that it is a shame that Christians like John have found sadistic pleasure in tormenting the seriously ill. &quot;What you do unto the least of my servants you do even unto me&quot;----Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Successful Christian Parenting: Raising Your Child With Care, Compassion, and Common Sense","review":"In our culture, there are many concepts and theories, assumptions and views on how to raise children. Often, studies in the areas of Psychology and Human Development, Sociology, Medicine, and so forth, come to different conclusions, sometimes even contradictory. Studies in other cultures again have different views. Then there is the Christian sub-culture, with all its very helpful seminars, books, audio tapes, magazines, etc. But these usually draw their ideas from one or more of those same studies, and end up contradicting each other.I don't want to discredit Christian educators, child psychologists, and so forth. They are playing an incredibly important part in helping parents understand their role; for instance, I believe that Focus on the Family, and James Dobson, THE contemporary parenting \\"guru\\", had and still has a huge influence on how families raise their children, and I am thankful for that.If you are parents, or getting there :-), I encourage you to get your hands on some good books from Focus. However, when the theories of the books we read, Christian or not, contradict each other, then we're stuck. How can we really KNOW the best way to raise our children? The answer is quite obvious: Read the Bible!You might argue that many things in the Bible are either old-fashioned, from another culture, and simply not applicable in our time. You're right, not everything applies to us. But everything can serve to teach us something, to educate us.When the Apostle Paul wrote his letters, no one had a degree in Child Psychology; no one had heard about ADHD or other such \\"problems\\". But when Paul wrote, his thoughts were guided by the Holy Spirit, and He transcends time and culture. We still have to use our brains :-) when we read Scripture, to find out what things meant to the original writers and readers, and what it means for us today. But, if you want to know how to raise your children, then DO read the Bible, MORE than any other book.John MacArthur has done a study on parenting, from the Bible. This book is the result of this study.If you want to get the BASICS of parenting right, I strongly encourage you to get a copy. It is filled with quotes from Scripture and excellent advice. If, after reading it, you think it was not worth your time or money, then read it again, you must have missed something! This book is not written to give you the latest tips and ideas on parenting, but to give you a foundation on which to build your family and home.Put it this way: if I were teaching Parenting 101 at a Bible College, this would be the required textbook (for Parenting 201, I'd require many different ones, most of them probably from Focus on the Family).Please remember: I believe MacArthur does a good job explaining the Scriptures, focusing on what God wants us to know and do in our families. However, don't read the book like you read the Bible. John MacArthur is not God :-) You might find that some of his interpretations and views clash with yours. That's ok. You might be right. You might not be. For instance, he supports spanking (based on Scripture; Proverbs 13:24). I agree with that, but I'm not saying that spanking is a must. Regardless of your view on different things and issues, read this book with an open mind and see how God might use this tool to challenge and equip you to be(come) better parents."},{"Title":"Successful Christian Parenting: Raising Your Child With Care, Compassion, and Common Sense","review":"This book is perfect for anyone who takes Scripture seriously, and is either thinking of having or currently has children. John MacArthur is very true to God's Word, is very open and honest, and provides wonderful direction for raising children in the love and admonition of the Lord. Some of the truths he presents are not popular, especially today, but they are very biblical.Not a pseudo-Christian \\"self-help\\" book, this book provides a wonderful blueprint for raising children, teaching them about salvation, and encouraging them to serve the Lord all from a firmly biblical standpoint."},{"Title":"Successful Christian Parenting: Raising Your Child With Care, Compassion, and Common Sense","review":"After only a few chapters the Lord has shown me that my frustration up to this point in childrearing could have been avoided. His way is so simple and basic. We make things diffcult by coming up with our own methods. By teaching the basic principles of God's word we cannot fail in raising our children because the Lord will back us up with His power when we apply His principles. However, it starts with us as the parent and the way we live our lives as the example. How can we teach our child to be right with God if we are not following God's laws as parents. This book shows the extreme importance of putting our focus on bringing up our children God's way especially as we see our society's decline becoming more evident. Only the Lord can save the family!"},{"Title":"Successful Christian Parenting: Raising Your Child With Care, Compassion, and Common Sense","review":"An excellent presentation of the unchanging truths and principles that God gave us for not only raising children but for living all of life. MacArthur doesn't rest on the human wisdom found in theories and methods that change with time, place and people. This is a wonderful teaching tool to use alongside Scripture as an individual or in a class."},{"Title":"Successful Christian Parenting: Raising Your Child With Care, Compassion, and Common Sense","review":"As a single person I rejoice in the goodness of God who has granted me the opportunity to read this book before I have a family. I can now look ahead with great confidence knowing that I have the tools to be a good parent, to raise children well, and that I have a God who is faithfull and has given me everything needed to be a &quot;succesful Christian parent&quot;."},{"Title":"Successful Christian Parenting: Raising Your Child With Care, Compassion, and Common Sense","review":"Obviously when a parent reads a book on parenting there will be aspects and opinions that are not always agreed with. I am not finished with the book so I will only review what I have read so far. I am in chapter 4 and still reading, that's good! If I don't like the beginning of a book, I won't read it!First, what I do not agree with; In chapter 2 he mentions that some parents are extreme in their efforts to protect their children from sexual material, that if we, as parents, do not allow our kids some sort of knowledge of sex, that in their sinful nature will conjure up their own ideas of it. He uses the idea of historical art; that we shouldn't keep them from it, but allow them to see it, as art but using it as an opportunity to teach our children. I am an artist, I am a Christian, I do not agree that nudity in any art, modern or historical, can be considered art. I feel that nudity in historical art is just older forms of pornography. I do agree that children need to be informed about sex, body parts and their functions, but allowing them to gaze at naked people in a painting so that I can seize the opportunity to enlighten my children is not the way I am going to approach that subject. I would not allow a movie with any nudity in my home, nor will I allow art with nudity. (By the way, he only makes mention of this subject, it is not a big portion of the book that he lingers on, I am merely passionate about it because I am reading this book with a couple girlfriends, they do not agree with me, I am alone in my [personal] conviction)Also, when he begins the book he uses extreme examples to bring across his point of how far off our society is from being just (Example: a man went to jail for 5 years for killing a dog, and a woman went to jail for 5 months for throwing her baby out a window)Not that that is wrong to use the extremes, but there is middle ground that I think more people could relate to and understand that maybe could have been better examples for making his point.Second, what I love; MacAthur is not slack in backing up his teaching with Scripture! I love it, so far, the best part! Chapter 3 is almost entirely all Scripture. You cannot argue Scripture, you can argue man's opinion, but not the Lords'!! MacArthur is doing a wonderful job at presenting a Godly view of parenting. My hope is that the things I disagree with, are disagreements because I cannot understand his tone in the way he presents his opinions or examples. I cannot hear the love in his voice through the pages, perhaps hearing this subject taught would be more affective than just reading it, so much is lost in black and white. God Bless him and his ministry, and God bless you as you read this book!"},{"Title":"Successful Christian Parenting: Raising Your Child With Care, Compassion, and Common Sense","review":"This is a really well written book that emphasizes biblical standards for raising children.

She explains all procedures, what to expect prior, during, and after surgery. Each chapter has exercise sheets to plan step by step planning during the process. I give this book 10 gold stars."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"I am reading this book now. I must say I was a little bit disappointed in that Paula put down any other surgeries than the one she had which was the gastric bypass. I am planning on having a lap band surgery and I think it is to each person's own decision. She said in her book chapter 5 that the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass is considered the \\"gold standard\\" against which other surgical options are measured. This is her opinion. Both the gastric bypass and lap band surgeries are tools for weight loss. I understand that she is partial to gastric bypass, because that is what she had, but at the same time, there is no reason to say that the gastric bypass is the \\"gold standard\\". I have been to seminars and also seen my doctor and he said that this year lap band surgeries will probably be out numbering the gastric bypass. I can say that I would recommend this book to gastric bypass patients, because it has very good information for you."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"I enjoyed my purchase, it was easy great product and arrived early. The seller discribed it well in the write up so I knew exactly what I was geting and was happy on the transaction."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"If you have done any kind of brief reasearch already, either before or just after your own surgery, then this book will be a waste of your time because you probably won't learn anything new. In fact, the most engaging paragraphs in the entire book are quotes from other books! Also, there are a lot of lists included for this and that, some of which are quite redundant and seem to be included just to take up space. I expected a little more insight, but was dissapointed."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"First, the title is misleading because the book deals with pre-surgery nearly as much as post-surgery issues. If you had surgery through a decent program, your surgeon or program staff should have already told you most of what Peck covers. If you are looking for that information in book form, this is for you. If you are looking for additional information, there are other, more relevant books out there."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"has potential to be a good resource but too much trite info. - good if you haven't read other books on the subject but if you have - not too much new info."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"Excellent recipes, not expensive, and something for everyone's taste.

Paula has spoken to the Group four times, and, after the first time, each presentation has been standing room only. She has an open invitation to speak to the Group at anytime.I personally vouch that Paula is a compassionate and wonderful person, which shows in her writing. Having been a Registered Nurse for thirty years, she now has dedicated her career to helping the morbidly obese. In this book and in her presentations, she frequently recounts her own experiences and those of others who have had the surgery. Paula's own story is remarkable. Having been morbidly obese all her life, she loss 175 pounds from conventional \\"white knuckle\\" dieting only to gain it back. Having exhausted all her options, she courageously chose to have gastric bypass surgery. Why courageous? Because this was the same surgery that killed her sister when it was a pioneering procedure. After her surgery, she lost 185 lbs, has kept it off for over 5 years, looks wonderful and is having a happy life.I love the practical and sensible advice her book provides for long-term success -- both in weight loss and in achieving life's goals. Paula wrote me that this book's original title was, \\"When the Hunger Returns.\\" Much is being written about the procedure itself, but little has been written about what to expect and do AFTER the surgery. And, what has been written by others is often outright wrong or conflicting.Weight loss surgery is not an answer in itself. It is a tool. Patients can regain much, if not all, their weight after undergoing this major surgical procedure. And, rarely addressed by others are the lifestyle changes needed to achieve long-term success. Many individuals in my Support Group have never developed their social skills after a lifetime of obesity. Food events, such as, holidays, celebrations and parties are perilous. Many are uncomfortable and feel awkward in social situations. Many think of themselves as still being fat even with their new body. Newfound sexual intimacy is often awkward. Some old relationships with others can be detrimental and undermine the progress because of their jealousy, resentment and/or insecurity over your new body. Paula sensibly addresses all these issues and many others.I feel this book is an absolute must for weight loss surgery patients, potential patients, and support people, such as, loved ones, parents and friends. Paula has done us a great service by writing this book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"Paula has done an excellent job capturing what really goes on longterm not just in the honeymoon phase!

The writer truly conveys hope. Embrace it!"},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"I just received this book today and I am already half-way through reading it. My doctor has recommended thatI have the surgery, but everything is taking so long and I didn't know what to do next.

I did learn from the book."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"I could not put Exodus from Obesity down. I highlighted it and even felt compelled to email Paula Peck, the author.This book totally \\"walks you\\" through the entire process from selecting a surgeon to managing food and situations years after surgery.Ms. Peck convinced me to buy a book to log my success after surgery. She includes a weight chart to chart your weight losses, which I have bought and begun.As she suggests, I will spend the day before surgery (two days from now) taking measurements, recording feelings and taking pictures. She suggests taking pictures each month, but I will probably do it each two weeks.She has given me \\"permission\\" to weigh myself daily, as opposed to what anyone else suggests.Buy the book, I am taking it to the hospital with me!"},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"I find myself rereading pages in this book over and over as needed. This is instrumental in helping me on my weight loss journey and I've recommended it to the WLS group I'm active in. Many of the group members are familiar with this book, and agreed that it's quite helpful. Ms. Peck took major surgery and a total lifestyle overhaul and put this reader at ease with her personal story. It helped that a medical professional wrote the book and lived this journey herself. I recommend this book to everyone considering weight loss surgery."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"Being aware that my surgery would be life altering, I was nervous about how to proceed with the rest of my life post-operation. Paula Peck's book was written with such care, concern and intelligence that upon turning the final page I realized my anxiety had completely left me and that I literally held a blue-print for success in my hands. Thank goodness for Paula's sensitivity, charm and wit. This is a honest guide to living and coping after weight-loss surgery - and who knew? A funny one too! Kudos for this book."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"As this was written by someone who had a positive experience with her WLS, it offers several good ideas (training for surgery, writing a letter to yourself before surgery, etc.). I wish it would have gone into more detail about I've read in other books (bad breath, gas, hair loss, etc.). Overall, I was pleased with some of the suggestions in preparing for the surgery, both physical and emotional. It's a very fast read, as well as clear and concise writing. One thing I really enjoyed were the quotes at the beginning of the chapters. Although they didn't have anything to do with WLS per se, I thought they were inspirational."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"I just loved this book.

This book is a must read for those people who are considering gastric bypass surgery, have had the surgery, or for those who know someone who has.Once you read this book you will have gained pracital, useable tools which will ultimatley make you feel so much better.

I would not buy again.In fact, will probably put up for sale here!"},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"I guess the book is what the title says. But it would have been so much better if she had written in some detail about the surgery itself and the recovery. I understand that everyone is different as far as recovery goes...but she breezed over the surgery part in less then a paragraph. So I thought the surgery itself wasn't a big deal. I didn't give it much thought either. I just had my surgery and I have been in living hell for two weeks post surgery. It is not such a small deal that everyone makes it. Do your research about the actual surgery and recovery. This book does not cover everything you need to know about the surgery."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"There are a few books about gastic bypass sugery on the market. \\"The Exodus from Obesity\\" is on top of the list. The author, Paula Peck, has incedible insight into the medical and emotional aspects of the \\"pre\\" and \\"post\\" surgery. She has a keen ability to relate to the patient. Why? Because she writes from personal experience. Being a retired nurse provides her to the knowledge of the medical techniques. However, it's her sincerity, compassion and kindess that truly delivers each chapter for mentally healing.

What I discovered was a wealth of solid nutritional science leavened by psychological insight and Ms. Peck's abundant wit and affection. All addiction is nourished by loneliness, Exodus From Obesity offers escape from this prison, doing so with compassion and loving-kindness.

I was not very impressed with the book, to be honest. The author's writing style is rather boring, and much of the advice in it is very basic and seems to primarily relate to the pre-op and immediate post-op stages--so the title seems a bit misleading. I also felt that some of it was not very good advice, based on what I've learned from years of my own research and my own experience. The author makes a lot of assumptions that everyone who is morbidly obese and/or has the surgery does so for similar reasons and has the same problems. I guess I just could not relate to much of her own personal story and felt that it was too simplistic to be very beneficial. Perhaps if I had read it pre-op instead of eight months after my own surgery I might have felt differently, but for someone who's already gone through most of the process, much of the advice and observations weren't that helpful.

Found the book to be standard in some areas (any research on surgery would cover those areas) but also full of fresh good ideas. Offers key points at the end of each chapter to get you involved. I have already incorporated some of the suggestions. I know I will refer to it again and again. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is the writer mentions her trips too frequently for those whose income and job excludes them from going on a journey to Peru as a reward for weight loss or flying to a plastic surgeon in L.A."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"This book was more than I had expected it to be.

Everything I read reinforced what I been told by my surgeon, other patients, the nutritionist and social worker. I recommend it for anyone who is considering or planning a Roux en Y gastric bypass. Note: this book does not discuss any other procedures, so you wouldn't benefit as much from it if you're planning on a different procedure, however, she does talk about much more than the surgery itself."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"At almost a year out from my Gastric Bypass Surgery, I can attest to how helpful and true this book is. Paula Peck not only talks about the physical experience and process of the surgery, but also addresses the emotional changes which many people experience. The book is mostly geared towards women, as that is her experience and women constitute a greater portion of Gastric Bypass patients.Peck talks about how scary it can be when you realize that you are hungry again. She talks about Body Dismorphia: how even though the scale says a dramatically lower number, in your head, you still think you weigh what you did when you started. She talks about ways in which she battled this and learned to see her body as it actually is.Paula Peck explores so many of the issues that I myself experienced that if I could only recommend one book to a friend about to have Gastric Bypass Surgery, this would be that book."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"I have been researching this topic for several weeks and found this book to be very informative. I have found the technical stuff (how to eat, what to eat, vitamins to take, etc). on line and at various seminars but this book gives some insight on the way the brain isn't \\"fixed\\" and you will still have to address your relationship with food. It's very important for pre op knowledge seekers to understand this...it isnt' a magic fix to all your problems, in fact it gives you more problems that are life long adjustments. The only thing I didn't like about the book is, it's biased, at best. I want to know both sides...for and against the surgery to make my decision. I needed a guide to give me facts."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"Applause to Paula Peck for a valuable guide that completes the journey toward whole person wellness. Her Guide completes the intangible spectrum of our relationship to food and feelings that many of the profit-making, medical systems leave out. Paula addresses the big-hit surprises and potentially destructive manifestations of body image change, sexuality, and resentments toward fat prejudice, just to name a few. She emphasizes what's possible and how to handle the range of \\"surprises\\" on going with humour, wisdom, and empathic understanding. I'm a person, who has recovered from obesity, but not the attraction to food-as-love and comfort. Thank you, Paula, for emphasizing the lifetime hold this challenge has; and the lifetime dedication it takes to succeed post-op. I've been facilitating groups and doing individual consultation for almost 15 years with clients/patients, who have found the promise of life renewed with gastic bypass and other weight-loss surgical procedures. Then, the fantasy fog (I'm a San Franciscan) lifts. The pounds creep back, along with severe self-blame, self-humiliation, and shame. Powerlessness to control the \\"slide\\", isolation, and ultimately depression. Why? The \\"rennovation\\" takes place on the outside; but the heart, soul, and emotions are never addressed...until now. I've recommend this book to my clients; and even keep one in the waiting room of our professional group. It's ongoing support strategic, compassionate support in print."},{"Title":"Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition","review":"Halfway through this book I realized there were many points I wanted to highlight for future reference, so I started at the beginning again and ended up highlighting almost everything.

Not a whole lot post op.

In my case the issue of \\"meta-humans\\" and how they get to be the way they are has been exercising my mind and soul.A book with that title, did not go anywhere near answering my question, but I think that this book came close for me. Of course Jack Bentley is not a meta-human, but he has discovered some very interesting stuff. The title of this book is presumably the question he is searching for, and does not really answer in this book. Not that I was bothered about that, because I have already found out some of the ingredients that lead us to bypass death, as seems to have occurred to Enoch and Elias. The exact process by which we can be reborn of spirit, and thus bypass death is well set out in the Urantia Book, and also explained using different concepts in the Padgett Messages.Spirit was determined to reach Jack, buried as he was initially in stifling theology, and the things that he has experienced rank as some of the most amazing I have ever heard about. Fortunately he was open to the notion that the voice he could hear had his best interests at heart.Along the way Jack sets out his experiences with touch healing, and these explanations are wonderful too. His drawing of the design of the chakras stuck a chord deep inside me, and led to a major revelation - that just as Father downloads his Divine Love into us, to nourish our souls, so too can Gaia upload energy to nourish the physical body.This is a truly wonderful book, and a very easy read. I thoroughly recommend it."},{"Title":"Twin Planets","review":"Reread in 2010...Typical mid-60s SF - themes of freedom vs mind control & brainwashing, personal responsibility vs governmental control, man and woman finding THE ONE that completes them, the hero larger than life with vulnerable moments...

To date, over 5,200 manuscripts of the New Testament have been found and none of them are the same. Therefore, it becomes of utmost importance to inquire as to the correct translation. Joseph Smith was a prophet and made an inspired translation of the Bible. Those who love the Bible will love the Joseph Smith Translation. The translation just feels right, the Hebrew parallelism matches, and the spirit of the work is tremendous. The personality of Jesus comes through as in no other version. These presentations are excellent, insightful and inspiring."},{"Title":"Healing Hepatitis C with Modern Chinese Medicine","review":"I have suffered with chronic active Hepaptitis C for quite a few years, first noticing symptoms of fatigue in 1991. My physician told me that my fatigue was due to stress and depression. He prescribed Prozac for me which brought on a whole bunch of new symptoms. I soon stopped eating,and developed an &quot;I don't care&quot; attitude. Another physician, after hearing of my symptoms had me take a blood test. I then found out that I had Hepatitis C and the early stages of cirrhosis.I researched conventional medicines such as interferon and ribavirin and decided not to take them but to go the natural route. I went to a nutritionist chiropractor who had me take lots of different herbs and supplements. I did seem to get better but then after a few weeks I got worse. My liver enzymes shot up to over 400 and every part of my body hurt me. I couldn't concentrate on my job and always felt nauseous and sick. I became desparate.In July 2000, one of my friends had told me that he had heard about a Dr. Zhang in a newsletter that was written by Dr. Andrew Weil. Apparently, Dr. Zhang was having success using a unique herbal therapy to treat hepatitis C. I called his office and found out that his clinical practice was in New York City. Since I was in Florida, I asked if the Doctor could still help me. I purchased a copy of his recently published book, Healing Hepatitis C with Modern Chinese Medicine. I followed the advise that he gave in his book and within one month of following his herbal protocol my liver enzymes were almost normal.Now, five months later, I feel like a new person. My life is back to normal. I have returned to full time work as a real estate agent, go to many sporting events and still have the energy to play football with my two boys.Reading this book turned my life around. I am so happy that it is now available to so many people through Amamzon."},{"Title":"Healing Hepatitis C with Modern Chinese Medicine","review":"A reviewer on this page takes issue with the fact that Hepa-Pro SELLS these herbs. Get real. Do you expect them to give them away? I, for one, am greatful to have a place to purchase these formulations; formulations that have worked for liver ailments in the Far East for THOUSANDS OF YEARS. The only proof I need is that, like the other reviewers here (and countless others) I am in much better health since I began the protocols about 17 months ago. Normalized enzymes, viral-load 1/3 of what it was and symptoms disappeared (I didn't even know why I felt the way I did). As for FDA approval, it will never happen. Why? There is no money in herbs. The pharmaceutical companies will lobby to block their approval. They would much rather SELL THEIR drugs - which HAVE NOT been shown to work. Anyone with HCV should at least check out this info with an open mind."},{"Title":"Healing Hepatitis C with Modern Chinese Medicine","review":"Dr. Zhang has an incredibly sensible approach to staying healthy and treating this disease, a disease that is vastly over treated by conventional medicine.

His blood work indicated he was actually worse than before he did it.So he asks me to buy another book from Amazon about herbs and hep C, and i do, but see this and i bought it for him. Actually fealt moved to buy it for him. He ended up calling Dr. Zhang and going to him. He's well now. This costs a fraction of the Pegasus treatment ahd wasn't hard on him physically. But i repeat the actual bottom line. His blood work say's he's got it well under control. True story. He asked me to be sure to put it out on the web. He's still something of a luddite.

The doctor at that time said there was nothing I needed to do about it except just not drink alcohol. I ignored this advice and basically forgot about it until about a year ago when a new doctor had blood work done again to check my liver function numbers. They were very high and a biopsy was done. It showed that I was still OK...a 1 out of 5 with 5 being cirrhosis.Anyway, I was now faced with the prospect of treatment with conventional western medicine which is long and has many side affects. I then found Dr. Zhang's book and decided to try his approach. I ordered the herbs and started treatment. Not only are their no side affects for me, I already have lost 10 lbs.(I was about 60 lbs. over weight) and am sure my numbers are coming down. I feel so much better already. My circulation has improved so much that I have full feeling in my toes which I didn't before starting the herbs. I will see my regular doctor in another 2 months and have my numbers checked.Hundreds of people have used this therapy with great success and I will do a follow-up review after I have completed the therapy. Check back to see...in the mean time check out this book to understand why Traditional Chinese Medicene may be the best treatment for these viruses."},{"Title":"Healing Hepatitis C with Modern Chinese Medicine","review":"I GOT A LOT OF HELPFUL INFORMATION OUT OF READING THIS BOOK THINGS I COULD NOT FIND OUT ABOUT ANY WHERE ELSE,SO THANK YOU DR.

My overall health and immune system are also noticeably improved. I had visited a Hepatology unit at a local hospital, had many tests and spoke to the Western doctors who all but had me dead in 6 months before I discovered Dr. Zhang and his Chinese Medicine techniques. Dr Zhang has told me I will die WITH Hepatitis C...not of it. I think this will be true for me and my PCP confirms my excellent health despite living with this virus.I reside in Virginia, so it is not necessary to be near NYC to take advantage of his skill with this chronic condition.

Java 1.2 was available in 1999, you do the math! This is unacceptable. I find it ironic that another book, &quot;Professional Apache Tomcat,&quot; (WROX), which was published before new Apache book covers 4.0, even 4.1! It also appears, from the tone of the book, that the authors do not care much for Java and would rather the reader use Perl.Do not buy this book if you want Tomcat information. Honestly for straight Apache information I would stick with the 2nd edition of the Apache book and use on-line resources.Sadly O'Reilly books are lacking in quality lately."},{"Title":"Apache: The Definitive Guide (3rd Edition)","review":"This book is not a tutorial on Apache.

It will help you configure Apache down to great detail. If you are a programmer, get the online information. It is more up to date.This book did increase my knowledge of security for Apache, as security is covered well in this book. It covers troubleshooting for both Unix and Windows (As if a Windows system is secure enough to run a web server) Systems.As I am a programmer in the Java Language, I was disappointed to see that the authors pushed toward using scripting languages with Apache rather than full programming languages. This will limit what you can do with the Apache Server. This is a very sad commentary.Also, being a programmer, I am more interested in the API's rather than the configuration of a Web Server. Now that the book is already outdated, the API's in the book are no good to me. So I use the API's provided with the Apache documentation. Not to mention, the authors recommend using Java 1.1. It has been several years since Java 1.2 has even been released. Did the authors do their research on Java before they printed the book?This book covers the installation and configuration of mod_perl and Tomcat/j_serv, this was just fine for mod_perl (a scripting language), but did not help my cause, as I use Tomcat, and the authors are not very knowledgeable for Java based applications."},{"Title":"Apache: The Definitive Guide (3rd Edition)","review":"Hi,I read a few weeks ago some reviews complaining that this textbook doesn't deal with recent Java SDK like 4.1 or 5.

The book begins with an overview of what a web server and browser clients do, how they work, and planning/installing Apache. The book covers versions 1.3.x and 2.0.x, and the differences between them. After installation, the next few chapters explain the initial configuration required to get a working webserver, including the various directives blocks, access control, and setting up virtual hosts.Chapter 5 discusses how to implement authentication, passwords, and more on access control, such as using .htaccess files. Following chapters describe how to change settings for various web filetypes, indexing, imagemaps, and redirection of web page requests. Chapters 9 and 10 explain using a proxy, and the multitude of logging and status options which can be configured.One of the longer (and important) chapters, Chapter 11, goes into excellent detail about the security aspects of running a webserver. It includes discussion and examples on signatures, certificates, using SSL, and firewalls. General security precautions, real life scenarios, and even potential legal issues are addressed.The next section goes over building and administering a large website, and the issues associated with that. Also there is a chapter on adding web applications to your site to allow flexible user interaction, such as forms submission. There are then several chapters regarding add-ons and extensions to get even more from the webserver. These include PHP, CGI, Perl, mod_perl, XML, and Cocoon. There are numerous examples of coding provided, although most of them are somewhat basic in nature. One subject that I thought should have been addressed more was integrating the webserver with a database (such as MySQL), as this is a very common requirement.The last two chapters go over the Apache Application Programming Interface (API), and how to write Modules for Apache. This may be useful to more serious developers, but is probably too technical and difficult for the average casual user. The book closes with a good Index and there is also a very handy foldout inside the back cover which contains quick-reference data for the most commonly used configurations and commands.Overall this book seems to &quot;cover all the bases&quot;. It was useful to me as a beginner to set up a testing webserver, and yet has extra details and information for those more advanced webmasters. The quick reference section especially, should be very useful to experienced Apache users. I would highly recommend the book for anyone wanting to start or improve their knowledge in running the Apache webserver."},{"Title":"Apache: The Definitive Guide (3rd Edition)","review":"Most of the time you can trust O'Reilly technical books.

While the author is trying to create a noob friendly book here, it comes off like it was written by noobs (which probably isn't actually the case).There are also some questionable things, for example, they create a shell script that must run in a particular directory. They actually say \\"you must cd to the directory first\\" and then use the shell built-in 'pwd' instead of the dot operator for the current directory -- twice on one line! This comes off as pretty noobish to me. In the old days, this would cause 300,000 lines of kernel code to execute an external program and return, but at least the shell implements pwd as a builtin these days. Still, it was one of those small things that makes you wonder about a book...Despite this, the book IS useful for a noob to learn some Apache basics and make the conf files more readable. I had a 10 year old Apache Bible with Y2K material in it that in some ways was more helpful.

Not only does it explore (and I use the word &quot;explore&quot; because these listings go way beyond mere addresses and phone numbers) about 500 vintage and contemporary designer resale stores all over the U.S., Canada and Online, but with the information offered on each store (what kind of merchandise is carried, price range, return policy, store owner's personal collections, description of the store itself, etc.), I feel much more confident about shopping for my newest passion, vintage clothing (almost like the authors are holding my hand and walking me thru). I also found the section that describes designers from the '20s to the '80s, along with an explanation of what was going on the world during those times, fascinating. The glossary of fashion terms is also helpful, and I loved the listings of vintage expos all over the U.S. The quotes from costume designers, and learning about vintage pieces worn by Hollywood celebrities, is definately a fun bonus.

Retro Chic is a *great* guidebookbook. I purchased my copy at home in Seattle, and was pleased to see that my favorite retro sources were included -- as well as several new favorites I hadn't heard about before. The information on online resources is also quite helpful, and introduced me to a whole new way of shopping for unique resale fashions. I took Retro Chic with me on a business trip to Los Angeles last week, and was able to do some wonderfully affordable consignment shopping in a city that's completely foreign to me. What a fantastic resource!This DOES NOT appear to be a book in which the authors were paid for reviewing particular stores. The information is well organized, up-to-date, and gives plenty of clues about the stores it reviews. Listings are honest and cover a wide variety of topics, ranging from price scales and credit cards accepted to the kind of merchandise available.This book is a great resource for anyone with a retro fetish, and a no-hassle way for people new to the \\"scene\\" to find great resale outlets in their home town, on vacation, or online.

Its viewpoint is somewhat new and unique. Little of the substance of the book seemed new, but there were a number of places where the book provides better ways of communicating ideas than I had previously seen.The title led me to hope that the book would present a very ambitious vision of how we might completely free ourselves from genes and Darwinian evolution, but his advice focuses on modest nearer term benefits we can get from knowledge produced by studying heuristics and biases. The advice consists mainly of elaborations on the ideas of being rational and using scientific methods instead of using gut reactions when those approaches give conflicting results.He does a good job of describing the conflicts between first order desires (e.g. eating sugar) and higher order desires (e.g. the desire not to desire unhealthy amounts of sugar), and why there's no easy rule to decide which of those desires deserves priority.He isn't entirely fair to groups of people that he disagrees with. I was particularly annoyed by his claim that \\"economics vehemently resists the notion that first-order desires are subject to critique\\". What economics resists is the idea that person X is a better authority than person Y about what Y's desires are or ought to be. Economics mostly avoids saying anything about whether a person should want to alter his desires, and I expect those issues to be dealt with better by other disciplines.One of the better ideas in the book was to compare the effort put into testing peoples' intelligence to the effort devoted to testing their rationality. He mentions many tests that would provide information about how well a person has overcome biases, and points out that such information might be valuable to schools deciding which students to admit and employers deciding whom to hire. I wish he had provided a good analysis of how well those tests would work if people trained to do well on them. I'd expect some wide variations - tests for overconfidence can be made to work fairly well, but I'm concerned that people would learn to pass tests such as the Wason test without changing their behavior under conditions when they're not alert to these problems."},{"Title":"The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin","review":"This book is largely about what psychologist Keith Stanovich sees as the disconnect in the postmodern world between &quot;maximizing genetic fitness and maximizing the satisfaction of human desires.&quot; (p. xiii) On the one hand we have the &quot;replicators,&quot; the genes that blindly seek only their replication. On the other hand we have the vehicle (the phenotype), i.e., &quot;us,&quot; which carries the genes, which Stanovich believes should seek its own happiness. He sees our brain as composed of two overlapping, but sometimes divergent, systems. One, the more primitive, he calls &quot;The Autonomous Set of Systems&quot; (TASS) and the other he calls an &quot;analytic system.&quot; He calls this having &quot;two minds in one brain.&quot;The autonomous system is held on a &quot;short leash&quot; by the genes while the analytic system is on a longer leash; that is, TASS reacts to events in the environment almost automatically in close concert with the dictates of the replicators while the analytic system is more removed from innate drives and can analyze situations rationally and can act in terms of what is good for the vehicle rather than what promotes the replication of the genes. Note that these systems usually are in agreement and react to the environment in the same way. Threats to the well-being of the vehicle from predators and other dangers, signal the same avoidance behavior. However, sometimes there is a conflict. The example that Stanovich uses is TASS's need to flirt with the boss's wife, which might increase the replication of the genes, while the analytic system realizes that such behavior probably goes against the best interests of the vehicle (possible loss of job, etc.). Following the counsel of the rational analytic system instead of the urgings of TASS is what Stanovich calls &quot;maximizing goal satisfaction at the level of the whole organism.&quot; (p. 64)The title of the book comes from Richard Dawkins (and indeed this book is written in partial reaction to and in concert with Dawkins's ideas) who called organisms &quot;survival machines&quot; and &quot;gigantic lumbering robots&quot; in his famous opus, The Selfish Gene (1976). Stanovich wants to free us from the dictates of those selfish genes and so has constructed a &quot;robot's rebellion.&quot; He believes we can use our rationality (our analytic system) to override the sometimes self-destructive inclinations of the more primitive set of brain systems. Stanovich is preeminently a rationalist and believes that right thought leading to right behavior will lead to a more fulfilling and happier life for the &quot;robots.&quot; We need to be on the long leash from the genes, not the short leash, is his idea.A strong point that Stanovich makes very well is that in the information societies of the modern world many of the talents that served us well in the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptiveness in the Pleistocene are &quot;worthless&quot; when (e.g.) trying to use &quot;an international ATM machine with which you are unfamiliar&quot; or when &quot;arguing with your HMO about a disallowed medical procedure.&quot; (p. 124) He argues strongly that corporations and governments, through their advertizing and propaganda, have become very good at exploiting blind spots in our more primitive brain systems and getting us to do what is good for them and not necessarily good for us. I think this is correct, and that those of us who can see how the players in the modern economy are trying to use us for their benefit will avoid most of the more obvious traps and thereby increase our standard of living and presumably our chances for happiness.Stanovich devotes a chapter to criticizing evolutionary psychologists for failing &quot;to develop the most important implication of potential mismatches between the cognitive requirements of the EEA and those of the modern world,&quot; as he carefully phrases it on page 131. Nonetheless the psychology presented here is mainly a synthesis of cognitive psychology, brain science and evolutionary psychology and as such represents the latest in our attempt to understand ourselves.He also devotes a chapter to the effects that another kind of replicator, the meme, has on our lives. I don't have the space to go into his ideas about memes and their implications, but I want to say that from my point of view the word &quot;meme&quot; is an approximate neologism for the word &quot;idea.&quot; However, I think that it is a useful coinage and, like Stanovich's mind dualism, facilitates a new way of looking at and talking about how our brains work.While I think this is an extremely interesting book that goes a long way toward showing us the sort of thinking that characterizes postmodern psychology, I must point out that Stanovich's mind dualism is a construct that, while based on his interpretation of recent findings, is nonetheless just that: a construct that will be refined as time goes by and eventually overturned for a new construct. As always in science we are increasing our understanding and expanding our knowledge as we move toward a final understanding that will most likely always lie tantalizingly in the distance."},{"Title":"The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin","review":"Keith Stanovich is an accomplished behavioral scientist (psychologist) who applies all his scientific knowledge to answer a single question. We humans are the genetic product of hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, during most of which we lived as menial hunter-gatherers with a 35 year life expectancy. Given this genetic heritage, Stanovich asks, is there any way we can free ourselves from being the captives of our genetic pre-history?The setting for this analysis is Richard Dawkins' argument in The Selfish Gene that we humans are &quot;giant lumbering robots&quot; who serve only as transient containers for our genes, who are the truly eternal replicators.Stanovich makes the following arguments. First, there are two decision processes in the human brain. The first is the Autonomous Set of Systems (TASS) which we share with nonhuman animals, is a complete product of our evolutionary history, and only very imperfectly serves our contemporary interests. For instance, the TASS may tell us to overeat, have unsafe sex, or enjoy other forms of immediate gratification. However, there is a second decision center, which Stanovich calls 'analytical' that can override the TASS. This sounds like Freud's Id and Ego, which is one of Freud's unsullied contributions to human understanding. There is much evidence in favor of the TASS/analytical distinction.Stanovich is to be praised for NEVER descending into the philosopher's morass, in which the question would be posed as one of 'free will.' I do not know if there is free will, but I do know the scientific evidence on which Stanovich's case is built.The author's second thesis is that the same sociobiology that gave us selfish genes also seriously downgrades the importance of CULTURE in understanding human evolution and dynamics. Boy, is this ever true! His case is built up meticulously from a good knowledge of the contemporary research literature in the area, and is quite persuasive.Stanovich's point is that the analytic brain can alter culture so as to overcome the biases of the TASS system, allowing humans to realize truly human and emancipatory goals. For instance, even though we all make elementary error in statistical decision-making (the brilliant work of Kahneman, Tversky, et al. shows this), experts can avoid the errors and can instruct others to do so as well.But now comes Stanovich's third point: we cannot necessarily control culture so that it becomes an instrument of emancipation. According to memetic theory, we are as controlled by our memes (little nodules of culture) as we are by are genes. Stanovich does not manage to solve this problem, and suggests that we all be critically aware of the possibility that we adopt cultural practices that serve only to harm and constrain us. His list of rules for evaluation memes is quite useful and plausible.I think the answer to Stanovich's problem is that the whole notion of memetics is rubbish. His defense of the notion in the book is uncharacteristically weak, to the point of being pathetic. For instance, he asserts that memetics itself is a meme complex, so if many people accept memetics and memetics is wrong, the memetics must be right! In fact, memetics posits behavior with no evolutionary justification. This is: we accept memes because they force themselves upon us. But, a creature who behaved in this way would be evolutionarily eclipsed by another who did not succumb.The correct treatment of culture is that it is an epigenetic form of information transfer, and humans evolved to use it to enhance their fitness. The fact that sometimes we adopt harmful memes no more contradicts this than the fact that there are deleterious genetic mutation refutes Darwinism. This analysis is well developed in the research area of gene-culture coevolution, which I urge Stanovich to become (more) familiar with. It will open up vistas for him in pursuing his emancipatory project."},{"Title":"The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin","review":"I will start from the bad, because in the case of this book, they are insignificant and easy to formulate. To be brief -- this book is in need of some heavy editing for redundant repetition. Some sections are just unacceptable in this regard, making it incredibly boring to keep reading. But for those whom patiently read on, there awaits a chest of pure gold!If I could go back in time to when I was a kid and give myself advice on reading, I would unquestionably hand myself this book, and make sure that I understand that it would change my life drastically towards a much more rational and lucid being. In fact, if I had enough money along with a time machine, I would hand it to every individual in history capable of reading. Why? Because this book singlehandedly, although indirectly, would be and is capable of changing the history of humanity for an alternative, that would not be as shameful and incredibly irrational in introspect. Just think of Hitler or Stalin and enough is said.This book targets a very fundamental problem of individuals and humanity in general, namely -- our dreadful and enormously powerful potential for irrationality. A reaction to reading history is often of shock and disbelief -- and rightly so -- of the degree of human pitfalls of judgment and thinking. If only there was a way for people to step aside from their meme-plexes and genetic predispositions, and analyze their behavior -- surely much, if not most of human problems would be solved indirectly, by undermining them at their root. This book undertakes just such an endeavor! It is a manual for recognizing, understanding and recovering from the parasites and modules in our brain that make irrationality possible. In short -- it is a missing manual that should have come with our brain that would start something like \\"A useful thing we gave you here (the brain), but beware of...\\"What this books will do for you:1. It will erase any oversimplified models of rationality and intelligence that you may have, and replace it with a much more comprehensive and instrumental version.2. It will make you think about parts of your mind you want to identify with, and parts you would want to ignore like a noisy roommate.3. It will explain why high achieving and acclaimed doctors can be so terrible at making rational decisions about treatments. And a closely related problem of how someone like Francis Crick could be a scientist and a religion zealot at the same time.4. It will awaken you to the degree of irrationality that prevails in our society.5. It will explain why judging people for their intelligence (computing power) is far from adequate criteria for putting them in power.6. It will teach you to analyze and detect processes in the brain that could be potentially detrimental to your goals, namely -- the irrational and automatic modules, most of which are echoes from the past of our evolution that are potentially harmful in the current environment.7. It will make it clear that the environment that we merrily inhabit right now, is much different from what we evolved to cognitively understand, thus creating a number of niches for irrationality that must be recognized.8. It will awaken you to the rude reality of the existence of the two replicators and their selfish motives, namely -- genes and memes.9. It will help you distinguish goals that are truly yours and those that only appear to be yours, and why this illusion exists and persists.10. And finally it will encourage you to rebel from the selfish replicators, while also give you tools to make the rebellion possible.My Rating: 5/5"},{"Title":"The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin","review":"Robot's Rebellion is an excellent book. I'll spare the details, as the other reviewers have written very complete summaries of the text. But Stanovich's thesis, that humans are uniquely adapted to take greater control over their lives if they will learn how to use their higher cognitive abilities, resonated very strongly with me. We can do much to have happy, fulfilling lives if will start to assess our actions and our biological limitaitions critically. Stanovich weaves a very convincing argument that we make our lives better by overriding our genetically and \\"memetically\\" programmed intellectual reflexes. But we need to start using logic and accept the hard realities behind much of our mental processes.I hope Stanovich continues to write on this subject. I would like to see more discussion of how we fall into traps and how we can develop a program to build more meaningful lives.I found much of Stanovich's thesis to be very consistent with Erich Fromm's works: Escape From Freedom, The Sane Soceity, and Man for Himself. Although written long before the biophysical studies underlying Stanovich's work, Fromm very intuitively undestood the challenges that we face in modern, market-oriented society. I think Fromm's works are a great booken to Stanovich."},{"Title":"The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin","review":"Stanovich introduces the reader to the idea that humans are merely the hosts for two replicators -- genes and memes -- and that these replicators don't care for the interests of their vehicles (us). However, Stanovich also thinks we have reached a point in evolution where we can \\"rebel\\" against the interests of these replicators and pursue our own interests.Much of Stanovich's discussion rides on his concept of \\"thin\\" versus \\"broad\\" rationality, i.e. simple \\"wanton\\" utility maximization vs. utility maximization according to a reflectively acquired value system.Stanovich can be dramatic at times, constantly repeating his concern that the truths he is revealing will shatter our world-view and depress us. I was not depressed by any of the truths Stanovich revealed to me, and I could have done without the drama, but that may be because I started reading the book already believing in Darwinism, and not clinging to a smug sense of superiourity at being part of the only species on the planet which possesses consciousness.The book probably could have been about half as long. I appreciate that Stanovich includes many counter-arguments, illustrations, and study-data, but he unnecessarily repeats many of his points several times. By cutting out these redundancies and the drama previously mentioned, the book could have been shortened.While not ground-breaking to people who are well-read in the relevant fields, this book is a good overview of some of the fundamental ethical concerns that confront humanity in the age of Darwin."},{"Title":"The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin","review":"This is a rare book that created a paradigm shift in the way I think about human evolution. After reading it, I was impacted for months by its simple yet compelling idea. I would have loved to give this book 5 stars. I didn't because it was a heavy read. I was compelled to keep reading by the revolutionary ideas not by the writing style. If easy writing style is important to you, you may not like this book. If earth shattering ideas are important, then get it and see if it doesn't create a new paradigm in your mind about the course and future of human evolution.Dr. Darrel Ray, author of The God Virus: How Religion Infects Our Lives and CultureThe God Virus: How religion infects our lives and culture"},{"Title":"The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin","review":"This was a hard book to rate. Stanovich covers some fascinating ground, and has much to say that is worthwhile. Unfortunately he takes way too many pages to make his points, which all could have been clearly conveyed in a third the number of pages. It's not that he goes into more depth than necessary, but rather that so much of the same material is repeated over and over again, in a somewhat rambling and confusing manner.Much good previous work is built upon, but in some cases the work is not adequately represented. For example, the book is largely about dual process theory and about rationality, and Stanovich frequently cites Evans and Over's work (e.g., Rationality and Reasoning, 1996), yet nowhere does he mention their dual process theory of rationality, which is central to their work and differs from and is more fundamentally \\"dual process\\" than Stanovich's own less developed theory of thin and broad rationality.Nevertheless, there are some very good ideas and integrations of evolutionary and cognitive science ideas to be found, as long as one is willing to dig for them."},{"Title":"The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin","review":"The Robot's Rebellion is about the effects of replicators and evolution, specifically genes and memes. As a result of the genes there is the \\"vehicle\\" (the individual) built by the replicators with a two sided inter-influential mind, the automatic unconscious side and the conscious analytic side. The automatic side has goals that aren't always in line with the vehicles, like a bee giving up its life by stinging. The conscious side can use tools to override or alter the automatic side. The memes' (an idea held by more than one person) effect is culture. Ideas can spread just for the fact that they are good at spreading. Therefore a spreading idea doesn't have to be helpful to us but just needs to have properties that make it good at spreading.Therefore the goal is working on becoming properly rational, understanding the tendencies and effects of genes and memes and critiquing them as well as our values and desires with the tools we have, though those tools (e.g. logic) are also memes and are subject to critique as well. There are also cultural products that make it difficult to act out accordingly, an example Stanovich gives is our market system. Also cultural products become so infused with our way of thinking that they create thinking boxes (paradigms) and thus we rarely think outside of them.some strengths&#9675; a subject index&#9675; a hearty appendix of notes&#9675; nice thought experiments&#9675; immensely referenced&#9675; interesting parallels with Buddhist thought.some weaknesses&#9675; a little cluttered&#9675; Stanovich's thinking might also be boxed by his approach of helping us to satisfy desires better vs. not even playing the game of desire satisfaction and dropping them.Would be nicer if it was more practically organized or contain a practical summary chapter, listing the genetic and memetic traps and tools for deliverance from the restrictive clutches of the mighty replicators."},{"Title":"The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin","review":"This is a painful book to read. It is poorly edited. It has ridiculous footnoting. It pounds on certain points until you scream, &#34;Stop!&#34; Other points the author glosses over, assumes you have them memorized, and then expects you to recognize his off hand reference a few chapters later. Maddening.AND YET. If you are willing to stick with it... If you are willing to pull content from the writing... what you have here is a spectacular piece of research. This book summarizes in one place I-don't-know-how-many research studies, pulling the threads together and highlighting some startling patterns of human behavior. The author presents a compelling argument for how to truly be ourselves, how to recognize the preprogramming of nature and when we are working against our own best interests. The modern world is a terrible place for many of our instinctive actions, and this book highlights the places where our thinking gets overwhelmed by our patterns of action. Then it goes further and offers -- based on actual research -- ways that we can become aware of our own minds and keep our rational brain in the drivers seat.I really wish someone would take this most excellent piece of research and transform it into a book that is more readily consumed by readers. It contains some solid ideas that should be shared widely."},{"Title":"The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin","review":"The book is a manifesto expanding on Richard Dawkins' idea at the end of The Selfish Gene. Dawkins wrote:\\"We have the power to defy the selfish genes of our birth and, if necessary, the selfish memes of our indoctrination. We can even discuss ways of deliberately cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism - something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world. We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.\\"Stanovich turns this into the central thesis of his book. His book is about a type of morality and ethics which is informed by evolutionary theory.Stanovich comes from a long line of thinkers that views nature as immoral, or at best amoral. Thomas Henry Huxley, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and many other thinkers have painted nature as curel and indifferent - and evolution as bad and not to be imitated.Stanovich - like Dawkins - proposes that humans rebel against selfish replicators - namely genes and memes - and instead promote their own interests: \\"the interests of the vehicle\\", as Stanovich calls them.Most of the book is about why and how humans should rebel against their genes. He pictures humans as part-conscious and part-unconscious systems. He sides with the conscious component, or the ego, and characterises our unconscious minds as sub-human saboteurs, getting us to do things that make us miserable against our own best interests.The whole topic is an interesting one, though the book is a bit on the dry and repetitive.The book has a section on memes, which is quite good. Stanovich recognises memes as forming a second evolutionary system, and has a pretty good understanding of memetics. However, memes are just another type of selfish replicator to Stanovich. They no more have our interests at heart than our genes do. Indeed, he characterises many memes as being especially nasty - \\"nastier than genes even\\", as he puts it.In the rest of this review, I will directly address Stanovich's main thesis. I should say at this point that I am not sympathetic towards it. The idea that evolution is bad has been opposed by thinkers such as Julian Huxley and Peter Kropotkin. Like them, I see in evolution's positive, cooperative side a guide about how to behave. The views of Huxley and Kropotkin have been mostly trampled on by subsequent thinkers, but their ideas about evolution and cooperation are essentially correct - even though they are not currently in vogue.The idea of enlightened humans rebelling against the interests of sub-human replicating agents is an intriguing one, but I don't think it is founded in good science. The problem is that Stanovich's picture doesn't include all the copying processes that are taking place.While Stanovich deserves credit for recognising both DNA genes and memes, he doesn't treat within-brain change as an evolutionary process. However the fact that individual learning also forms its own evolutionary process was recognised long ago by Skinner, Campbell, Calvin, Cziko, Dennett and others. Indeed, any non-trivial goal-directed system is going to have a fitness function and an evolutionary tree-pruning algorithm at its heart.In rejecting genes and memes, Stanovich is just throwing has hat in with other evolving structures within the brain. Stanovich claims to be siding with \\"the vehicle\\", but, in practice this turns out to be something close to the ego, which itself is composed of a bunch of happiness-promoting replicating structures that Stanovich didn't consider. In short, all positions to this topic involve siding with some bunch of copying entities or other. Copying with variation and selection underlies every optimisation process. The issue is not whether to side with a bunch of copied entities, but rather which ones you side with. With this framing of the problem, much of Stanovich's rhetoric about the inhumanity of stupid mindless replicators falls flat.There are indeed some reasons follow the dictates of your conscious mind - that part of you is often smart and forward thinking. However, the brain's analytic side is heavily dominated by the ego - which is rather like the brain's public relations department. A big part of its job is to convince everyone else how wonderful you are. Stanovich's proposal is rather like giving control over a company to its public relations department. Egoism is fairly common, but there's more to a human than their ego. Thinking of yourself as being your ego is an impoverished picture of yourself which ignores much of what makes you human. Egoism is partly a western disorder - those from non-western cultures are less likely to identify completely with their egos. So: I think Stanovich's idea takes things too far.Since the ego is largely constructed by genes, we can expect most humans to not have rebellious egos - since those with a tendency to rebel against their genes would have left behind fewer children. So, one wonders what fraction of humanity Stanovich is preaching to.Stanovich proposes redefining the word \\"rationality\\" to refer to actions that promote the interest of \\"the vehicle\\". This plan strikes me as being a hopeless one - that just isn't what the word \\"rationality\\" means. I think that idea that rationality consists of optimising the function that Stanovich recommends is a non-starter.Stanovich's book can be regarded as an interesting example of an attempt at founding a secular religion based on science. Stanovich's memes do get cited from time to time and have found themselves an audience. There's a type of human that hopes that their ego will live forever - and isn't interested in reproducing - and some of them seem to approve of Stanovich's ideas.However, my council is to consider Stanovich's book as another memeplex that wants you to divert your resources into propagating it - at the expense of your own genetic heritage. There are a lot of memes out there hoping that you will divert some of your reproductive resources towards their propagation. Stanovich promises you happiness - if you are prepared to get off the genetic train and - consign your genes to eternal oblivion. If you are normally OK with memes hijacking the goals that nature gave you, then, by all means, go for it. However, if you don't usually approve of that, then I recommend being as cautious of embracing Stanovich's memes as you are of any other ones."},{"Title":"Unfinished Conquest: The Guatemalan Tragedy","review":"Victor Perera is a native guatemalan who took the better part of 6 years to write this book. This book is chock full of great information gathered from hundreds of interviews. Perera doesn't waste time trying to interpret the events he writes about, instead he let's the participants and witnesses speak for themselves. He interviews everybody for this book from wealthy landowners, government officials, military personel, catholic and evangelical clergy and mostly the mayan people who have suffered from 30 years of civil war. He then fills in the cracks with historical background. His writing is very precise and specific, his descriptions paint a very vivid picture of the oppression and genocide that continues to take place.The book begins with his visits to the garbage dump slums of guatemala city and proceeds to other hot spots of violence.

The author begins her story with her first days of school, singing hymns. Gradually school changes. The hymns become martial Nazi songs, the teachers become agents or resistors of the Nazis. Life includes complications such as avoiding Nazi service and ideas. She spends an obligatory year at farmwork. As the author grows older, the skies contain not clouds but bombers.

The topics covered are comprehensive of the broad field of networking. I have found the entries to be up-to-date and error free. This is a significant feat for a 1430 page book! I intend to use this encyclopedia to help me prepare lectures for undergraduate courses. The entry on Cable and Wiring at 17 pages (plus additional pages for TIA/EIA Structured Cabling) is everything an undergraduate student needs to know about this important area.

For him it wasn't a matter simply of updating the previous edition; he pretty much tossed that out and started from scratch in evaluating the current state and near future of the many technologies included in the book. The material in this book isn't warmed over; it was thoroughly reconsidered.And despite the current edition's 1400-odd pages, Tom had plenty more to say but there wasn't room, so he puts additions and updates to the encyclopedia on his Linktionary site. Single-handedly pulling off this excellent book in the face of constant change in the industry was quite a feat, as far as I'm concerned.

Up until recently I worked as a Network Administrator in Sydney and believe me, your books saved my bacon on more than a few occasions! I first received the electronic edition of the Encyclopedia of Networking whilst studying Computer Technology and e-business in Sydney. The encyclopedia was included as part of the overall course and many references were made in the college's learning guides to certain chapters when more detailed information was necessary on a particular topic. I'm currently involved in the area of Multimedia and Telecommunications and recently obtained a copy of the latest edition, The Encyclopedia of Networking and Telecommunications and am amazed at how much extra and updated information has been included. I keep the book close by at all times and find myself referring to it quite regularly. I could now honestly say that it's become my IT bible! It covers all aspects of networking, the Internet, Electronic Communication, topologies, protocols, security and various configurations in absolute and thorough detail. The encyclopedia also comes with a CD that can be loaded onto your computer as a PDF file and the search facility works brilliantly.

(There are Spanish-English and English-Spanish glossaries in the back of this book, though). I learned some new words and had fun, too. This book is a good value.There is an answer key in the back. The only reason I didn't rate it as 5, is that the answers are not translated to English.

I, in turn loaned my copies of these books to several family members who,in turn, read these books and passed them around to family members and friends. Their reactions echo mine. My parents and an aunt and uncle travelled to Lucan, Ontario several years ago, and visited the Donnelly grave. While there, they took pictures of the Donnelly tombstone and did ask some people about the Donnellys. Even though the Donnellys were murdered 118 years ago, there are decendants of the members of the vigilante committee around and it is still a rather sore topic to try to discuss. The Vengeance of the Black Donnellys is strictly a fictional story, which the author, Thomas P. Kelley states at the beginning of the book. But - if you read the &quot;Black Donnellys and think about some of the events that are mentioned in the Vengeance of the Black Donnellys, maybe truth is stranger than fiction. If t! his book is made up, maybe the author is hitting on some truths that followed the murder of the Donnellys and none of the survivors of the vigilante committee is willing to acknowledge just how close the author has come to relating how those responsible for the murders came to meet their death."},{"Title":"Vengeance of the Black Donnellys","review":"This is the sequel to Kelley,s \\"The Black Donnellys\\";the story of Canada's most barbaric feud.This was a true story of 35 years of fighting,feuding,barn burning,animal mutilation,revenge and mayhem that ended in the massacre of 5 Donnelly family members on February 4,1880.This massacre was carried out by a VigilanteGroup.See my review of that book on January 29,2006;and visit the super web site \\"The Black Donnellys\\"for the whole story, many excellent pictures and lots of information.Kelly was the first author to write a book on this all but forgotten tragedy in 1954.He ignited a great interest in the whole story.He was not,nor did he ever profess to be a historian.He was a very successful pulp fiction writer.In fact he was probably the greatest Canada ever had,and his books sold in the millions.He was somewhat like Ned Buntline ,a New Yorker,who went out west and was one of the most popular pulp fiction writers of the Wild West.Kelly would find a story that he felt would interest a lot of people,spend some time to learn the essence,then set about to tell it,filling in the details where necessary,from his own imagination;right down to and including conversations.He was an excellent storyteller and left the nitpickers worry themselves about details and accuracy,if that was their avocation,but it wasn't his.\\"The Black Donnellys\\" was such a great success,he decided to follow it up with a book that told story of the awful fates that were visited on the members of the Vigilante Committee.Though there were probably some things that really did happen to some of them;Kelley let his imagination run freely,and created all kinds of legends and stories.The result is a thrilling tale of evil,revenge,romance and adventure that is difficult to put down once started.However;for the greatest effect ,his other book,which is essentially the true story,should be read first.Just as in his first Donnelly book;each chapter starts off with a verse from an old ballad about the things that happened on the Roman Line and around Lucan following the awful murders.There has even been a bit of a cult following that has grown up and visit the areas in hopes of encountering some of these 'old ghosts'on the anniversity date of the night of February 4,1880.Let me just qoute a couple of verses of the ballad to set the atmosphere of the book and tale;\\"It happened,God alone knows why,In Lucan,long ago.Dark clouds were on the moon that night,The fields piled high with snow.As the mob killed old Johannah,She cried out with her last breath:'Your murderin'souls will roast in hellYou'll all know a violent death.\\"\\"For the midnight hour brings alarm,And horses won't pass the Donnelly farm.Stay off that road or you'll come to harm,Out on the Roman Line.\\"\\"They found him in an upstairs room,He lay half beneath the bed.Blood flowed around his lifeless form-In one corner was his head.\\"And finally;\\"The ghost of the violin still plays-For the dead sometimes return.I know what these old eyes have seen,I know what I did learn.And even though a thousand yearsMay pass along in time:\\"The ghosts of the Black Donnellys willStill ride the Roman Line!\\"If you'd like a great story of murder and mayhem,this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Vengeance of the Black Donnellys","review":"A good example of sensational literature but not much help if you want the facts.

Cherryh is great at putting believable characters in crisis, surrounding them with a hard-science SF environment, and showing us what it is to be human. These two books are excellent examples of her work.Paul Dekker is an amazingly talented pilot. His partner is killed to hide illegal activity by a large corporation. His mind is fractured by his near fatal attempt to save her. He ends up being rescued by a young 'belt born' navigator, and his aging earth born pilot - a pair of miners in the asteroid belt.This raises the interesting emotional/pshychological differences in humans raised on earth, those raised in a hypothetical 'space station' environment, and amazing ethical questions. What happens when human culture starts dealing with time dilation between vast distances? Does the culture fracture?Should these two miners 'take' Dekker's ship as salvage, which would finally get them financially ahead of the mining company that is slowly driving them to indentured servitude, or should they stand by him and support him when the company is trying to bury him?These books are full of intigue, action, science, psychology, and an amazing description of skill. Two for one! Highly recommended! If you like this, try Tripoint, Merchanter's Luck, Finity's End, Downbelow Station, Cyteen, etc... She's extremely prolific, so if you give a try and enjoy it, you'll have dozens of novels to read down the road."},{"Title":"Devil to the Belt","review":"Normally I don't like Omnibus paperbacks... they tend to be too thick to read without destroying the binding in the process. But these two novels are from the 80,000 word novel era (newer ones tend to be 120,000+ words) and two older novels (instead of three... i.e. The Chanur Saga) still fit comfortably in this paperback.This omnibus collection contains the books Heavy Time and Hellburner. This is where the Alliance/Union universe all starts.C.J. Cherryh is a master at telling the story of her characters while still sneaking in a description of a universe that is so realisitic you'll forget its fiction.Although this omnibus is just the first two novels in the Alliance/Union universe, they are also a complete set. You can stop after reading this omnibus collection, but you would be a fool not to read any Cherryh you can get your hands on, and if you are new to Cherryh, this is the best place to start... at the beginning.For detailed reviews, check out the reviews for individual books in this omnibus collection."},{"Title":"Devil to the Belt","review":"Bundling Heavy-Time and Hellburners like this is a great idea because, unlike the majority of C.J. Cherry's Spacer/Alliance-Union stories, these two books are best read in the correct order so as to get the best out of them. When I read them first I unknowingly started with Hellburners, which wasn't too much of a problem as it was fairly self contained. Even so, I always thought it would have been better to have them combined - like she is doing with her Chanur books. The new title is rather intriguing, too."},{"Title":"Devil to the Belt","review":"Heavy Time isn't very fast paced, just a guy who can't really think straight trapped by corporate circumstance; Hell Burner is about military trials and has the same guy not thinking straight trapped in a military circumstance. Given the other book I read from C.J. Cherryh was Downbelow Station, which had a similar guy coming out of rehab (from brainwash called Adjustment), it's rather disappointing to read basically the same thing over again, twice, with some variation in between. The characters are well portrayed, there aren't many likeable characters, but they're definetly well done despite the fact that little happens in any single novel. Don't expect sublots or sidequests/type adventures, they feel like expanded short stories. However, HB describes how a Rider (an interceptor w/ a crew of 30 that goes at .5 c!!!) works, which makes all of it worthwhile. If you're into technical jargons than this is it. It feels like reading a novel written from the future: it assumes you know a lot of the futuristic everyday things, and slowly explains them through context and situation. If you're looking for some scifi inspiration, this is a must buy!Oh and the way they talk and the way she narrates is kind of choppy, hard for me to read without rereading stuff because of irregular sentence structure or she skips words like \\"that\\" and \\"which\\" and \\"as\\" sometimes. But that's just me."},{"Title":"Devil to the Belt","review":"Writing Quality: 6/10.Cherryh is a perfectly competent writer. Every once in a while I come across a construction that seems a bit of a puzzle, but never anything that strikes me as amateurish. She's got her own distinctive voice that carries over through her various novels, but while many characters share a similar syntax, she still finds ways of making character voices reasonably distinct. I think that every novel of hers I've ever read has included various repetitions of the following: \\"Damn, damn and damn.\\" I don't think that any specific phrasing ever stands out to me, though, as something worth remembering. Her writing seems mostly utilitarian, to service the plot and other themes. And here and there, there is excessive exposition that comes in the form of one-sided conversations, a result of Cherryh's \\"very tight limited third person,\\" as she calls it, which prevents her from offering the more omniscient observations that other authors can sprinkle throughout the narration.Depth of Concept: 6/10.I considered scoring this a point higher, which would have matched it up with my reviews of Pratchett's Night Watch, Ender's Game, and The Once and Future King. But while Cherryh is always intelligent and appreciably ambiguous in many aspects of her writing, I don't think that these two novels exhibit her greatest skill at offering multiple meaningful interpretations. I'm thinking that her novel Cyteen, at the least, deserves a 7 and maybe even an 8 in this category. To me, Heavy Time and Hellburner offer only a hint of the interesting psychological explorations that occur in Cyteen. In Ender's Game, we got an interesting allegory in which children fill in for the adult analogs in our world, and where phobia of aliens can help us think about our real-world phobias of the foreign. In The Once and Future King, there was a lot to explore about national identity and the trials and tribulations of leadership and loyalty. I do think that Cherryh raises some intriguing ideas about the ways that people who live on Earth may differ psychologically from their space counterparts (oh, maybe now I'm second-guessing my lower score), but I think that Kim Stanley Robinson did that at least as well in Red Mars, and had a lot more conceptually to offer besides.Rounded Characters: 7/10.A score of 7 here matches it up with Robinson's Red Mars, although I think there are some notable differences in the way the two go about explaining their characters. Cherryh tends to keep her character's thoughts very immediate, in an intimate stream-of-consciousness that ends up emphasizing very local and pressing concerns. Robinson, by contrast, takes a more omniscient look at his characters, and allows their personality development to be placed within the context of larger movements and social paradigms. Ultimately, I find Cherryh's long long internal monologues (in all of her novels, including the award-winners) to be a little over the top, and frequently repetitive, but there's no doubt that the accumulation end up offering substantial insights and intriguing thoughts about each of her characters. I particularly appreciated the understated way that characters develop and grow in their relationships with each other over the course of the novels, and you feel that you're present as they change. By contrast, you often feels in Red Mars that you're uncovering things about the characters, layer after layer.Well-Developed World: 7/10.You don't get info dumps with Cherryh when it comes to world-building, and it's something I appreciate about her style. A lot of writers feel like they need to explain the world to you in big blocks of explication, and maybe that is sometimes necessary. But mostly when that happens, it feels to me that the author couldn't figure out a way to include that information in a more nuanced, organic way. It's particularly noticeable and irritating in fantasy novels (The Eye of the World, Wizards First Rule, The Sword of Shannara, etc.). Cherryh, however, doesn't coddle you, and writes from the very beginning only through the eyes of her characters; if they already know something, she doesn't break the rules of the perspective she's created and search for cumbersome ways of explaining it (with the exception of some of her character's long-winded monologues about political intrigue). And if they don't know something, she doesn't tell you about it until they learn about it. Having said that, her environments feel real and distinct, with little about them that could be dismissed as merely \\"conventional\\" or \\"stereotypical.\\" I especially like the thoughtful (if not always scientifically rigorous) way she discusses the limitations imposed by space travel, whether in terms of health and diet, or in how ships maneuver.Page Turner: 7/10.There are moments that rise far above a 7. But there are also moments that drag, as during the long internal monologues I've already described. Still, I found both novels to be basically engaging, and frequently gripping. After many of the Cherryh novels I've read, I find myself surprised at just how little actually happened, and yet how engaged I was, sometimes literally on the edge of my seat. Cherryh has a great ability to build suspense and to use action to heighten tension without having the narrative devolve into a run-and-gun caper. Nevertheless, I kind of wish some of the longer monologues could have been edited out, in which case I'd score these novels, and Cherryh generally, a point or two higher.Kept Me Thinking: 6/10.There is plenty to think about here, but everything is so tight and personal and intimate in scope that I didn't find myself musing about life and real-world analogs in the same way that I did while reading Red Mars, or even Terry Pratchett's Night Watch. And, while Cherryh's characters are usually interesting, she always seems to be constructing personalities that would only exist in the worlds she creates, and so I have a harder time using her novels as an analogy to my own real-world experience. Maybe it's also because I don't feel particularly oppressed or \\"watched,\\" though others may feel more paranoia about their lives than myself.___________________________________________________Overall Recommendation: 7/10.I think Cherryh can be a bit polarizing. I'll argue to the death that she writes really intelligent, really interesting literature. But whether you like her style, that's a little more dependent on taste. These two novels are probably a little more action-oriented than Cyteen, which is her most renowned, but less action-oriented than her Chanur novels. If your goal is ACTION!, then I might suggest starting with The Chanur Saga or Downbelow Station. If you're willing to go a little slower, and spend time with her (intelligent but lengthy) psychological explorations, then Cyteen is a truly fascinating novel, along with its sequel, Regenesis. Still, I enjoyed these, and I don't think I'll ever regret reading one of her novels.For an expanded review and other thoughts, see my profile web page."},{"Title":"Devil to the Belt","review":"Heavy Time (1991) and Hell Burner (1992) are contained in the omnibus Devil in the Belt.

Personally, I have found this book to be highly useful, entertaining, and educational. For example, I can thank David Pringle for leading me to Olaf Stapledon's \\"Last and First Men\\", one of the most original and amazing books - of any genre - that I have ever read. Before getting the \\"Ultimate Guide,\\" I am embarrassed to admit that I had never even HEARD of Olaf Stapledon! Similarly for other authors like M.J.

Before getting the \\"Ultimate Guide,\\" I basically only new about Dick through \\"Blade Runner.\\" What's really cool about this guide book is that its author is so knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his subject, but is not afraid to give bad reviews, even to famous authors, and good reviews to relative unknowns. Basically, this guidebook is a meritocracy, in that it doesn't matter how well-known you are; what matters is how good the book is. That not only speaks highly of David Pringle's integrity, but at the same time makes the book more valuable by increasing the reader's level of trust in Pringle's judgment.

A modern vampire in a major city! Sound familiar? Whitten beat them to the punch as his book was first published in the 1960's.It is a good quick read with memorable scenes. But what is more is that it is set in Washington, D.C. in the late 1960's. It is a time in D.C. when hookers ruled 14th street and an interesting look backward at a Washington of yesterday. And amid the usual crime of D.C. there is a vampire killing people. Our hero is a DC cop who gradually learns that he is up against something unusual.I'd like to see a hardback reprint of this story. I do not know if Whitten is still around but who ever owns the copyright on this book is missing out on something good. Get yourself a copy and don't miss out on a good vampire tale."},{"Title":"Progeny of the Adder","review":"If you've ever wondered which writers have influenced Stephen King, just flip to the back of his study on horror, \\"Danse Macabre.\\" There you will find various lists - movies, books, that King feels are essential to a horror fan. In the book section you will notice that King places an asterisk by those works of fiction he considers especially important. One such mark appears by Les Whitten's vampire novel \\"Progeny of the Adder.\\" By today's standards, \\"Adder\\" is pretty tame. But one can see how it impacted King - especially \\"Salem's Lot.\\" Whitten's writing style is straight ahead stuff, pretty much what you would expect from a journalist who is moonlighting as a horror novelist. What makes it unique, for the time, is how Whitten turned what seemed to be a standard police procedural into a horror novel. Perhaps more importantly is how Whitten took everyday people (a King trademark), and exposed them, whether they want to believe it or not, to supernatural evil. Whitten is skillful in his characterizations, supplying depth, and, for that now distant time at least, believable dialogue. These are regular folks, with their modest hopes and dreams. For example, the main character, Detective Harry Picard, is your average Joe, a young detective fretting over his lack of college, but ambitious, while at the same time wanting to settle down with a nice girl - who he thinks he may have found in Suzy Finnerton, another cop. Basically, the American dream with all of its attendant real life frustrations. And then there's the vampire, who is a quite nasty. For horror buffs there are some exciting confrontations that hold up well by any day's horror standard. Also good are the various descriptions of a what now seems a distant, though hardly quaint, D.C. (this will appeal to those familiar with D.C. in the sixties and early seventies). One gripe is the ridiculous title, which doesn't match the blue-collar tone of the story. A more appropriate title would of simply been \\"D.C. Vampire.\\""},{"Title":"Cake in the hat box","review":"Cake in a Hat Box is the 19th in Arthur Upfield's Bony series. The story starts with the discovery by a long-distance truck driver of the body of Constable Stenhouse in his jeep on the road to Agar's Lagoon. Stenhouse, a competent policeman but not a well-liked man, has been shot, and his native tracker is missing. At first, it looks like, the tracker, Jackie Musgrove, has shot his Constable and cleared out with his swag and rifle. But the local blacks are making smoke signals and gathering purposefully. Bony happens to be in the town of Agar's Lagoon due to engine trouble in his flight home from Broome, and as the case gets more interesting, he relishes being asked to help with the investigation. This Bony book is filled with a collection of outback characters, some stoic, some downright bizarre. Despite Bony's occasional laconic attitude, Upfield gives us fast-paced novel with an original plot, a few twists, especially the motive and the murderer. Upfield's extensive knowledge of the outback and the aboriginal shines through all his Bony novels. Is there really a cake in a hat box? Does Bony actually get his murderer his time? No spoilers here! Another enjoyable Bony instalment."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Anyone who cannot benefit from this book does not love god with all his/her might, mind, and soul.Only those who approach religion without their hearts involved will not benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"The book offers a few tidbits, but not enough for me to read the entire thing.The format is not arranged well for a logical, detail oriented mind.

These can be helpful in achieving self-mastery, in breaking the bonds and feelings that keep us from being free, and in approaching with serenity the various vicissitudes of life. Especially in his early writings, Father de Mello, while revealing the influence of Buddhist and Taoist spiritual currents, remained within the lines of Christian spirituality.But already in certain passages in these early works and to a greater degree in his later publications such as this one, one notices a progressive distancing from the essential contents of the Christian faith. In place of the revelation which has come in the person of Jesus Christ, he substitutes an intuition of God without form or image, to the point of speaking of God as a pure void. To see God it is enough to look directly at the world. Nothing can be said about God; the only knowing is unknowing. To pose the question of his existence is already nonsense. This radical apophaticism leads even to a denial that the Bible contains valid statements about God. The words of Scripture are indications which serve only to lead a person to silence. In other passages, the judgment on sacred religious texts, not excluding the Bible, becomes even more severe: they are said to prevent people from following their own common sense and cause them to become obtuse and cruel. Religions, including Christianity, are one of the major obstacles to the discovery of truth. This truth, however, is never defined by the author in its precise contents. For him, to think that the God of one's own religion is the only one is simply fanaticism. &quot;God&quot; is considered as a cosmic reality, vague and omnipresent; the personal nature of God is ignored and in practice denied.Father de Mello sees Jesus differing from other men only in the sense that Jesus is &quot;awake&quot; and fully free, while others are not. Jesus is not recognized as the Son of God, but simply as the one who teaches us that all people are children of God. In addition, the author's statements on the final destiny of man give rise to perplexity. At one point, he speaks of a &quot;dissolving&quot; into the impersonal God, as salt dissolves in water. On various occasions, the question of destiny after death is declared to be irrelevant; only the present life should be of interest. With respect to this life, since evil is simply ignorance, there are no objective rules of morality. Good and evil are simply mental evaluations imposed upon reality."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"First of all, Anthony De Mello was a Catholic priest who used his position to preach things incompatible with the Christian faith. That is religious hypocrisy. And that would be something like a pork-eating Imam, for example.De Mello's writing resembles obnoxious sermon with lots of \\"never before known knowledge\\", some almost-relevant jokes and a good dose of psychobabble to boot.Here are few examples:GOOD, BAD, OR LUCKY:\\"The lovely thing about Jesus was that he was so at home with sinners, because he understood that he wasn't one bit better than they were... The only difference between Jesus and those others was that he was awake and they weren't.\\"THE ILLUSION OF REWARDS\\"One sign that you're awakened is that you don't give a damn about what's going to happen in the next life. You're not bothered about it; you don't care. You are not interested, period. [...]People are so ashamed of their past. They're crazy! Just drop it! When you hear \\"Repent for your past,\\" realize it's a great religious distraction from waking up. Wake up! That's what repent means. Not \\"weep for your sins.\\" Wake up! Understand, stop all the crying. Understand! Wake up!\\"And an almost-relevant joke:Little girl says to a little boy, \\"Are you a Presbyterian?\\" And he says, \\"No, we belong to another abomination!\\"And a good dose of original, 1970's psychobabble:\\"Maybe you are not listening to me at all; maybe your daddy is listening to me. Do you think that's possible? Of course it is. Again and again in my therapy groups I come across people who aren't there at all. Their daddy is there, their mommy is there, but they're not there. They never were there. \\"I live now, not I, but my daddy lives in me.\\" Well, that's absolutely, literally true. I could take you apart piece by piece and ask, \\"Now, this sentence, does it come from Daddy, Mommy, Grandma, Grandpa, whom?\\" Who's living in you? It's pretty horrifying when you come to know that. You think you are free, but there probably isn't a gesture, a thought, an emotion, an attitude, a belief in you that isn't coming from someone else. Isn't that horrible? And you don't know it. Talk about a mechanical life that was stamped into you. You feel pretty strongly about certain things, and you think it is you who are feeling strongly about them, but are you really?

Among other things, this book can be a real eye opener to the reasons why the 1970's church music, interiors, architecture, knowledge of basics of faith were so terribly flawed and why, 30 years later, the Catholic Church was forced to pay billions in lawsuits.That is what happens when one replaces God-given common sense with Gnostic-like \\"awareness\\".This book can be informative as well as entertaining, but it can cause grave spiritual harm to an uncritical reader.

I still wonder what possessed him to pick this work or this author.First, I must confess that this is the only De Mello work I am familiar with. As it is the only work of his I am likely to read, this puts me at something of a disadvantage as a judge of this particular volume.In general, however, Awareness comes across as something of a naked emperor. Throughout, De Mello paints a picture that you &quot;can't get&quot; until you are &quot;awake.&quot; Thus far, it sounds a lot like any form of faith or mysticism. Where De Mello diverges is that he defines this vision as a unique entity. It is impossible to call his vision Christian, let alone Catholic; throughout Awareness De Mello has much more use for the Buddhist transcendentalism than for Christian approaches to God.As a form of spirituality, &quot;Awareness&quot; is watered-down yogiism, with a dose of EST &amp; a little bit of Simon &amp; Garfunkel thrown in. This book will probably continue to be a hit with those spiritual seekers who are intent on new-age Godless spiritualism. However, such a search will always be fruitless. There is only one Way, and He is apparently of little use to De Mello.I must, however, cite one benefit of his book. After completing its nonsensical ravings, it occurred to me that it was right up the alley of a leftist/buddhist friend of mine. I mailed him a copy, for which he thanked me... then I didn't hear from him for a couple of years. Coincidence? Perhaps.

In order to fulfill my penance, I came here and purchased it. Then I began reading these reviews.One reviewer mentions that the Vatican Information Services website contains information concerning the Church's stance on Fr. Anthony De Mello. I searched the website and found the information in question: an edict by none other than the current Pope, formerly Jospeh Cardinal Ratzinger, endorsed and issued for release in 1998 by Holy Father Pope John Paul II.An excerpt from the edict:\\"Consistent with what has been presented, one can understand how, according to the author, any belief or profession of faith whether in God or in Christ cannot but impede one's personal access to truth.

It was impossible for the text to respond logically to arguments that cropped up everywhere in my mind. After two pages I felt like I knew what he was going to say for the rest of the book, but I was certain I would get no reasons why it makes sense, only vague tales and stories with \\"morals.\\" De Mello might say to me that I simply haven't \\"woken up\\" yet, or that I am just resisting the truth, but that means nothing to me and doesn't bother me in the least because it is vaguely-defined, and I have no capacity to argue otherwise.

No matter what the cost"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I am a senior Philosophy student and a Jesuit University and was recently introduced to Fr. De Mello by my spiritual director on a silent retreat. I was raised Catholic, spent a period of my life as an atheist, and within the past year have become a much more spiritual person after an experience of profound awakening. My experience led me to be particularly drawn to Eastern spirituality and philosophy - Zen Buddhism and Taoism in particular. I have since immersed myself in the works of Alan Watts, Ken Wilber, and Deepak Chopra, to name a few, and have been making an effort to live a more mindful life.To make a long story short, I went on this retreat with the intention of letting go of my ingrained prejudices toward the Christian tradition in general and the Catholic tradition in particular. The practice of silence, after all, is generally universally promoted by all traditions worldwide, and this had been so long before any of them had any contact or dialogue with one another. I can speak from my first personal experience with a silent retreat in the Ignatian tradition that it really does transcend religion as such, opens one up to God (or the Tao, Brahman, one's Buddha nature, whatever you want to call it) and can be very transformative. Further, it is a very important practice to be in touch with the spiritual traditions of one's own culture, as they condition our thinking and habits in many ways that we may not be aware of and may have a lot to teach us because they have developed through the collective consciousness of our own society.I can certainly say that Fr. De Mello puts the Christian perspective into a whole new light, and that although I felt that I understood many of the things he talks about in this book before reading it through my study of Zen, Vedanta, etc., there's something about his simple style of delivery and his personal orientation as a Jesuit priest and psychotherapist that speaks to me in a way that others have not been successful. Its true, Fr. De Mello is not really interested in Christianity as such. He sees Jesus as an enlightened teacher, and incorporates Buddhist wisdom, Zen koans, and Hindu scriptures just as much as he quotes the Bible and draws upon the lives of the saints. I believe this, however, to be a great strength in his perspective. He allows those of us who unjustly shut out the Christian perspective to integrate it into a more inclusive, universal view in perhaps the most paradoxical way - shattering our \\"views\\" altogether. To use Ken Wilber's terminology, Awareness transcends and includes Christianity, and I highly recommend it to spiritual seekers, those interested in Eastern religions, faithful Catholics, and even non-religious folks who are interested in considering the perspective of a wonderful psychotherapist."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I have owned this book for 8 years and re-read sections from it constantly. Each time I read it I understand more about the world we live in and the human condition. Awareness has gotten me through some terrible times. It will comfort you. It will make you reevaluate how you see the world as well as how you think about what you experience. It is a hand book on how to live in this crazy world. It is very easy to read and is divided into very short chapters. De Mello has a knack for explaining the concepts and wisdom of near eastern philosophy, near eastern religion, and basic concepts of Christianity so it can be understood and applied to everyday living. It is however, never preachy. I love this book so much I have given it away twice and now have a designated copy to loan out and one copy just for me so I will never be with out it. I highly recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Not surprisingly, the central theme of Anthony de Mello's book AWARENESS is awareness and understanding (and by implication, insight). Indeed, Tony sees awareness and understanding as the panacea that all human beings need to be human. For him, the basic task for all human beings is being human. He says, \\"I've got different themes, but they are all about the same thing. Call it awareness, call it love, call it spirituality or freedom or awakening or whatever\\" (page 63). As he uses these terms, they are really the same thing. They are equivalent with one another, and so they are interchangeable terms.In a similar way, he refers to the basic problem in different ways, but they are all about the same thing. We are asleep and sleepwalking (the basic problem), and so we need to wake up (the solution). We are unaware (the basic problem), and we need to become aware (the solution). We are socially conditioned, brainwashed, programmed, hypnotized, sleepwalking, addicted, chasing illusions; these alternative terms can be used interchangeably as descriptors of the basic problem. However, even though being addicted figures prominently in his analysis, he does not discuss compulsivity and being compulsive, which strikes me as the other side of the coin, so to speak, of being addicted.Thus we have the basic problem and a number of descriptors of it, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, we have the basic way to overcome that basic problem and a number of ways to describe overcoming the basic problem.Now, Socrates famously said that the unexamined life is not worth living. Tony understands Socrates to mean that the unaware life is not worth living. By contrast, the life of awareness is ultimately the source of happiness. But there is not exactly a formula for how to become aware. Socrates' famous statement urges examination of or reflection on one's life, as distinct from the unexamined life. So awareness involves an examination of one's consciousness.Digression: Anthony de Mello, S.J. (1931-1987), was a Jesuit priest and retreat director. In Jesuit spirituality, Jesuits are urged to examine their consciences daily, usually toward the end of each day. In this way, Jesuits reflect of each day and thereby cultivate awareness. But in addition to awareness, Tony emphasizes understanding and insight based on psychological analysis of oneself. End of digression.So awareness is the key to the panacea that all of us need, but there is no Procrustean bed in the sense that there is no one way to cultivate awareness in one's life. Good luck finding ways that work for you. If Eric Berne's transactional analysis works for you, go for it. If Albert Ellis's rational-emotive approach to therapy works for you, go for it. If working with the conceptual construct of the Child Within (also known as the Inner Child) that John Bradshaw and others have popularized works for you, go for it. If family systems analysis works for you, go for it. If dream analysis works for you, go for it. If Freudian analysis works for you, go for it. If Jungian analysis works for you, go for it. If Adlerian analysis works for you, go for it. It appears that no one approach to psychological analysis works well for everybody, so there's no Procrustean bed, even though Tony clearly favors his own way of analyzing our emotions. But even Tony does not offer a Procrustean bed for everybody, except to say that awareness and understanding (presumably including insight) are key factors to be cultivated, and in this respect, they are the panacea for everybody to cultivate, but in ways that work for them. I will return to this point momentarily and show the catch-22 contained in Tony's so-called four-step program, which sounds like a Procrustean bed of one size for everybody.Now, awareness or examination of one's consciousness must be penetrating enough to makes us aware of our illusions about ourselves. Our illusions are numerous and manifold. For this reason, Tony devotes much time and effort to alerting us to the basic problem in our life that awareness should enable us to penetrate and understand. On the one hand, inasmuch as we continue to have the basic problem in life, we will be able to say that we have not yet worked out a way to cultivate awareness that works for us. On the other hand, inasmuch as we have worked out a way to cultivate awareness that works for us, we should be able to see that we are making headway in overcoming the basic problem in life.Now, the other component of the panacea that Tony advances is understanding, but understanding specifically based on and informed by psychological analysis of our emotions and of our ability to be in touch with our emotions. For example, he centers much of his attention on fear. As the proper antidote to fear, he recommends being fearless.Much of the time, Tony works with the verbal distinction between \\"I\\" and \\"me.\\" For all practical purposes, the \\"me\\" as he conceives of it can probably be understood as the Child Within (also known as the Inner Child) that John Bradshaw and others work with.But when Tony works with the \\"I,\\" he centers his attention on how we make misleading predications about the \\"I\\" involving forms of the verb \\"to be.\\" For example, we say such things as \\"I am depressed.\\" Clearly this predication involves making a statement about the \\"I.\\" But Tony cautions us against making such statements about the \\"I.\\" Instead, he would have us say something like, \\"There is depression there [in my psyche] right now\\" or simply \\"Depression is there [in my psyche] now.\\" So his basic point is that we should stop making predications about emotional states at any given time and the \\"I.\\" He styles this kind of misleading way of speaking as identification - that is, we identify a given emotion with the \\"I\\" as though \\"I\\" were the emotion involved (e.g., \\"I am depressed\\").In a word, we should detach the \\"I\\" from our account of our emotional experiences. At first blush, Tony's injunction to detach the \\"I\\" from our description of emotional states may not sound significant. But it is significant because we are supposed to be trying to understand our emotional experiences. Tony's basic claim is that we will misunderstand our emotional experiences if we insist on predicating them in connection with the \\"I\\" (e.g., \\"I am depressed\\").Next, Tony wants us to understand that nobody else needs to change. People who are asleep oftentimes think that other people in their lives would need to change in order for them to feel better themselves. Wrong. Nobody else needs to change in order for us to feel better ourselves.Now, having advocated the key components of awareness and understanding (including presumably insight), Tony turns to advocating a four-step program for everybody to cultivate. At first blush, his four-step program may sound like a Procrustean bed of one size for everybody. But hold on! His four-step program appears to me to be kind of elastic or protean. It's more like the outline of the basic idea of a bed. But not exactly a Procrustean bed. Let me explain why not.Here are the four steps Tony outlines:\\"The first thing [that] you need to do is get in touch with negative feelings that you're not even aware of\\" (page 78).\\"The second step . . . is to understand that the [negative] feeling is in you, not in reality. . . . So stop trying to change reality [or other people]\\" (page 79).\\"The third step: Never identify with that [negative] feeling\\" (page 80; identify means for example, saying \\"I am depressed\\").\\"The fourth step: How do you change things? How do you change yourselves?\\" (page 83).As I say, at first blush, the four steps Tony has outlined may sound like a Procrustean bed of one size that fits all people. In a certain sense, this is true enough. But even though Tony claims to be setting forth a seemingly four-step program, there is a proverbial catch-22 contained in his outline of step one.In his outline of step one, Tony refers to \\"negative feelings that you're not even aware of.\\" That we are not even aware of those negative feelings in our psyche is the proverbial catch-22. How in the world are we supposed to get in touch with negative feelings in our psyches that we're not even aware of?First, we must become aware of our negative feelings in our psyches. Good luck with that!Tony himself is unequivocal in stressing that fear oftentimes is a negative emotion in our psyches that we are unaware of. So we need to become aware of the fear locked away in our psyches so that we are not aware of it. Next, according to Tony, we need to get in touch with that fear, which will not be a pleasant experience to undergo.Tony himself is also unequivocal in stressing that being fearless is the antidote to the negative emotion of fear that is locked away in our psyches so that we are not even aware of it.No doubt the fear locked away in our psyche is connected with our childhood traumatization. That's why the fear is locked away in our psyches. But the fear locked away in our psyches influences us every day of our lives. However, if we were somehow to experience the fear locked away in our psyches, it would not be a pleasant experience. That's why it was locked away in our psyches to begin with.So let's reconstruct what happened in our childhood traumatization. The young child forms attachments.No attachment = No loss = No traumatizationTraumatization = Fear of lossIn short, traumatization locks our fear of loss away in our psyches, so that fear influences us every waking moment of our lives as long as it persists in our psyches. Our fear of loss is locked away in our psyches as a result of traumatization because we do not have sufficient ego strengths to undergo the rigors of healthy mourning. Healthy mourning is a demanding, rigorous process that requires a certain modicum of ego strength to undergo and withstand.Loss = Healthy mourning of lossBut traumatization = No mourning of loss = Unresolved mourningIn short, the fear of loss that is locked away in our psyches carries with it the unresolved mourning of loss from the traumatization. But unresolved mourning of loss requires healthy mourning in order to be resolved.However, mourning is an involuntary process that we are summoned to undergo by our psyche. In other words, you probably cannot just decide one day that you want to experience mourning, but you may be able to undertake to evoke the experience of mourning in yourself as a way to engage in psychotherapy. But when a loss in the present triggers the involuntary process of mourning, the mourning process may dredge up unresolved mourning issues from the past. As long as the mourning process remains healthy, healthy mourning will ultimately enable us to resolve the unresolved mourning issues in our psyches. John Bradshaw likes to say that grief is the healing feeling. Healthy mourning will heal us of our present loss and may also heal our unresolved mourning issues from the past. The unresolved mourning issues from the past include the fear that is locked away in our psyches, which came from our traumatization and fear of loss in the past.Now, adults are supposed to be no longer children, except that many of us carry around within us the Child Within (also known as the Inner Child) from our childhood traumatization. Inasmuch as we as adults tend to form attachments as though we were still needy young children, the attachments that we form will probably involve clinging to the attachment.As an alternative to the clinging-type attachment, Tony draws on terminology from Jesuit spirituality to recommend detachment, by which he means a non-clinging approach to attachments. In theory, a non-clinging approach to attachments is what he recommends. Perhaps we should say that a non-clinging attachment is an ideal or an idealization."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This is one of the best spiritual texts I have read along with Eckhart Tolle's writing. De Mello and Tolle both point us in the same direction of awakening. Anthony De Mello uses short little humorous stories to point to the reasons why we suffer. Awareness is a great little book to refer to from time to time. It is worth owning. The lessons and realizations it provide are priceless. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is sick of suffering."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This book is extremely informative about the reality of our existence and our hearts.

In particular, I like his thought about \\"I'm an ass, You're an ass.\\" I definitely recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This book was a true blessing in my life. Right when I thought I knew it all and had the world by the balls, I still felt that I was miserable and unhappy. I only read this book at the recommendation of a girl I was trying to impress. Turned out that she impressed me more than I could have imagined. The book taught me that my pain and suffering was due largely to my own ability to not see the truth of its cause; that I brought on my own hellish agony.This book came at a crucial time in my life, and I cannot imagine having survived without it. The pressures of society to \\"fit in\\" and at the same time \\"stand out\\" is so mind-#&@$ing, it's amazing more people aren't insane (locked up looney). DeMello uses common stories and, though it was written over 20 years ago, can easily be talking about our world today. He speaks in a language we all can understand. I'll admit that it took me a second reading to finally grasp the concept of what should happen (awakening), but it was well worth it.Because of this book I am much happier in life, can experience the love and joy of others, and am no longer afraid. I am no longer a mindless zombie like the majority of society who rely on the words and actions of others in order to find happiness; or happiness is in buying expensive garbage just to impress \\"friends\\" and fit in to society.Many sages have said that true happiness comes from within, and that's no bull."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This book will either enlighten you or enrage you, there is no middle ground with this author.

If you do or you don't...I really don't care. Superb message this book has to transmit, but whether you understand it or not--and whether you are willing to give up all your programming--it's up to you. Like he says, if you profit from it...that's good, but dont thank him, if you dont, its your bad not his!(it wouldnt make a difference 'cause he's dead anyway.) In all the self-help books ever written, true wisdom isn't always present. But De Mello, once again if you understand him, teaches you how to dig within your soul and obtain the wisdom from there. I have read the Bible many times, yet after reading this book it's as if a new light was shed upon God's message to humanity. The parallels found between the lives of Jesus and all the prophets, and the lifestyle which he describes as being 'awake' definitely make a lot of sense.

I felt like I'm just imitating the things mentioned in the Bible without actually having the heart to do so, or sometimes doing the \\"good deeds\\" to avoid guilty feelings, or just thinking that I will go to heaven when I die.Father De Mello talks about a story in the Bible about the people who gave to eat when (Jesus) was hungry and gave me to drink when (Jesus) was thirsty. But these people knew what they were doing. They knew they were doing \\"good deeds\\".I KNEW I was dong good deeds. Not with much passion or compassion. Thinking that this is the life I'm supposed to live. But always in the back of my mind, I wasn't LIVING it. I was just putting up a show like a hypocrite, to do the \\"right\\" thing. I was missing the \\"fire\\" as Father De Mello puts it.Reading this book made me open my eyes. Perhaps, not fully at the moment, but I have begun to see things I have never questioned before.The rose does not choose to give its fragrance to people she likes or dislikes. The light does not choose whom or where it will brighten. The rain falls on the righteous and unrighteous alike. Do you want to live the life that Jesus taught us? Do you want to love your enemies and treat them as you would treat yourself?

This book filled the void between these two powerful lifecycles. Building on a Jesuit education, eastern upbringing, penetrating intellect, and engaging wit, DeMello writes of the mystical experience we all are on. It is so simple, yet far from easy, to become aware of each moment. DeMello's book has been not only a life guide, but the most powerful career guide I have ever read."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"If everyone took the advice of this author, we'd have a great world.

I actually respect that because it's sometimes hard to speak the raw truth when you know it may hurt someone's feelings. but I can say this, i've been in the same rigid religious place. (probably even more devout and ascetic, fasting and abstaining from the desires rigorously.) I actually was studying to be a pastor for a certain christian church, but these teachings were like a finger pointing toward the moon for me; not the truth itself, just a guide.. so all i can say is: what can be so bad about this book, since after really absorbing its intense life altering message, i am free from worry, ego, stress, suffering, anger.. or at least when these things do appear, i can truly observe them from 3rd person and the nightmare just dissappears..i think the fact that these words changed my own life so drastically is enough to prove their credibility. not to mention all of my freinds who have had the same experience..oh, and by the way, i still have a real love for god, its just not an attachment. for example, i experience divine peace even on the days where it feels like god has abandoned me, like when jesus on the cross said &quot;my lord, why have you forsaken me&quot;..i no longer feel forsaken. i mean really, you are so much bigger than your beliefs!!!"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This is one book that you live, you just don't read it and forget it.

The range of reaction was pretty much reflected in these Amazon reviews. The bottom line is that it profoundly effects some and annoys others. But it would be hard not to have a reaction. After I read it I feel renewed. After the passage of time I feel bogged down. Then the cycle continues.

And this has blown me away too! I have read many similar books, but this one really left a huge impression on me, because many of the things that Anthony De Mello writes in this book is what I try to practice. And many things in this book also challenged me in many ways that I am still trying to decipher.I enjoyed the section \`Negative Feeling Toward Others\\" and \\"Our Illusion About Others.\\" I was also glad to read about some criticisms he has had of his faith over the years. It was less than 200 pages. I think I read it in four days. After reading this book, I conducted more research on this highly enlightened man who tragically is no longer with was. But he left his mark on this side of Heaven. And I thank God for that!The editing of the book could have been improved as this was taken from speeches he made. That was the only criticism I had."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Very good book, but not for the beginner.

I cannot say enough good about it. I gave my other copy away to someone who is now also equally amazed at this book. I cannot think of another book which has led me to be more enlightened than this one and has helped me work on my defects of character and weaknesses.

If you can clearly see that the world is operating from the space of the status quo and people hold onto the dogmatic ways of their ancestors then you will find this book beyond valuable.

It's certainly a refreshing point of view that de Mello offers here and anybody who has found themselves questioning their religion, depressed and despondent about the state of their life or just not content within their current spiritual life practices can potentially gain from reading AWARENESS. It is so unlike the many self-help books that attempt to convince people they must change themselves or others to be more whatever it is is they think is right or good or happy or enlightened (i.e. \\"don't sweat the small stuff\\", etc.). This book makes it clear that the author holds no such illusions. You won't change anybody by reading this book. You won't even change yourself. You might, however, just start curiously observing or reflecting on yourself and your actions or feelings in a different way, a way more authentic to the person you really and truly are and what that person you call \\"I\\" wants or needs from life. And that little tweak in the way you perceive and experience your life can ripple widely and resonate deeply in you. You might just find that you no longer have such strong desires to change yourself or others and instead find in its place a developing sense of humorous detachment and delight as you begin to see through the folly that was ensnaring you and continues to ensnare others and simply enjoy a life free of your earlier immature mental and spiritual constraints. That is how I assess the effect of this book on my own life as it has become part of it through reading and re-reading this book from time to time."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"If you had told me, an depressive athiest with a history of alcoholism and self-loathing, five years ago that I'd find the greatest book on the most revolutionary wisdom in the Christian section of the bookstore, I would have told you a) get away from me, and b) gimme whatever you're smoking.Since that time I've come into a bit of a \\"spiritual path\\", and read countless books on awareness/mindfulness/presence, or whatever you'd like to call this path.Many are wonderful. This was the finest of all, though. This is not a Christian book at all. It is simply another expression of the \\"one true wisdom\\" which cuts across all spiritual teachings, religious or otherwise.It is what the Buddha was talking about. It is what Jesus was talking about. It is what Lao Tzu was talking about. It is what Eckhart Tolle, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Tara Brach, Thich Nhat Hahn, Byron Katie are talking about today.There's really only one teaching over the past six thousand years or so. You pick your favorite teacher. De Mello is, after reading this book, mine. Perfectly hilarious and light, but forceful and to the point, without getting bogged down in words. Like someone who so confidently knows the subject matter, so confidently lives it, that there is no need for pretense.If you don't like it because it goes against your doctrine, your dogma, your beliefs, that's fine. When you have suffered enough, you will be ready to wake up from your dream."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Although Father De Mello died in 1987, I will speak of him as living because through his writings he is certainly alive and well. He is so alive, in fact, that The Vatican Information Services has a web page (\\"Notification concerning the writings of Fr. Anthony De Mello, SJ\\") devoted to discrediting De Mello's work. Here is my summary of that page: \\"Father DeMello does not think like we want him to think, so Catholics should disregard what he has to say.\\"...Awareness is the simplest and most profound book I have ever read. It is less than 200 pages, and I imagine I can (and might) spend the rest of my life reading it.

Each page threw up another challange to my way of thinking. It shattered forever my view of the world and my role within it. But in the end it showed me how to become awake and alive and happy. I am no longer a slave to my programming. I no longer concern myself with how others see me. The fear I lived with for years is gone. I read this book two years ago and have enjoyed peace of mind and freedom from fear ever since, even though I have been through some very tough times.

I always thought the world was problematic. It never occurred to me that I am the problem, not the world. Dale Carnegie once said &quot;success is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get&quot;. I never understood that until I read this book. You are in for the shock of your life, assuming that you are ready to understand it. As he says, your ability to understand this is relational to how much truth you can take before you run away. People will always tell you &quot;I just want the truth&quot;, but don't believe them, even for a second. What they REALLY want is to be right, first and foremost. The right God, the right philosophy, the right facts..... Then, if there's some room left over for the truth, so be it. THAT'S how people operate. They never consider that life is not the problem, THEY are the problem. He will prove this to you, and although that sounds painful, it's actually joyful and liberating. No need to judge the world anymore. He will shatter the belief system that makes you unhappy, and whether you know it or not, you are unhappy. One can be the happiest person in the entire depression ward of a hospital and can truely believe that they are happy based on relative comparison, but they are not happy. They don't know what true, unconditional happiness is. He will show you TRUE happiness, TRUE love, TRUE peace. Are you ready for that?

So succint, clear, to the point, hardhitting, Truth by the ton. Eloquent, enlightening and easy to understand. Numerous quotes and stories that I have not read anywhere else. What a treasure!"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I approached this book as someone who is slowly opening his eyes to reality. It is scary for someone like me, with a strong Christian upbringing and involvement in my church, to venture into this realm of 'Awareness'. I was always a nice and loving Christian my whole life, not a whacko fundamentalist by any means, but never challenged to think \\"outside the box\\". I, like so many others, was taught the doctrines of the church, said and did all the right things, was a member of the Republican Party as most \\"good\\" Christians are, and never really questioned why? After all, why would I need to ask \\"why?\\" when I had all the answers? Well, needless to say, Anthony de Mello gave me several good reasons why I need to ask \\"why?\\" I have been sleepwalking, conditioned, and trained just like a robot.Because de Mello has obviously been influenced by Eastern/ Buddhist thought, not all Christians are going to agree with this book; however, before you refuse to read this book based on some theological disagreement, please allow yourself to at least open you mind enough to gain the truth and insight that this book offers. I did not agree with everything that the author had to say either, but so many of his words really struck a chord with me. Becoming aware and objective has really opened my eyes to so many things that are difficult to explain in words, I just know it to be true. I am realizing how much conditioning we ALL experience in this life from the media, churches, schools, politicians, etc., and are becoming nothing more than mouthpieces for these organization. There is no real thought in that, there is no real growth in that, and inevitably there is no real peace in that... We will only be disappointed and frustrated in the end if we continue to be unaware.The author says societal answers to the internal frustrations of life only offer temporary relief, not a cure for what is ailing us. They offer treatment only, and that is exactly what they want; so we become addicted, and we believe we NEED their \\"drug\\". We have to unlearn this, de-condition ourselves and \\"choose\\" to be happy, and quit settling for untrue and superficial alternatives. We must realize there is more to life than being addicted to what \\"they\\" want.A great quote was: \\"A sage will point to the moon, and the idiots will only see his finger.\\" How true is that of us? We only focus on the externals and what is easily accessible to us: what is she wearing?, what is he saying?, what do they think of me?, will they accept me if I start to question?, etc. We have to just be. We can only control ourselves, not others, and we need to stop worrying what others will think of us.Again, this is a great read, and I encourage anyone who wants to start thinking to read it. You may or may not agree with all he says, that is irrelevant, but there is much truth to be gained... you just have to open your mind a bit to find out what reality really is.... And chances are, it isn't what you have been taught."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This is a sweet and funny and profound book which warmed up my heart and consistently made me laugh. De Mello was a universally respected Jesuit priest who managed to go far beyond the orthodox catholic dogma and into the very heart of spiritual alivennes and connectedness. Several centuries earlier a similar attempt was made by Loyola, another Jesuit troublemaker; however, in A., DeMello dispenses with the extraneous mumbo jumbo and goes straight to the heart of the matter. God is presence itself and through awareness we are simultaneously connected to who we truly are and to the sacredness of all life. De Mello reminds us time and again of this simple yet profound truth; i especially admire his skilfull use of anecdote and parable, which reminds me of another great spiritual teacher... Perhaps it is not coincidental that De Mello lived and worked in Goa, that syncretic ex-Portuguese colony known for its eccentric inhabitants and practices. What impresses me the most about this book is that DeMello manages to weave into his teachings the best elements of Buddhist and Hindu traditions (their emphasis on awareness, mindfulness) and combines them with what is best in Christianity (the emphasis on love, openness of the heart). In addition to that, he is consistently funny (no mean feat for a work on spiritual matters)... and even manages to be cranky in a way that makes me laugh. Perhaps as importantly, the book shows that Christianity may not be all about biblethumping -in the right hands it is a vibrant, contemporary, compassionate, and profound spiritual practice. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about mindfulness from a master teacher."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Awareness is a compilation of De Mello's dialogues on spirituality awakening. De Mello dialogues have an in-your-face conversational style that is not what you'd expect from a Jesuit priest. He uses anecdotes to make his point and demystify enlightenment. The book is an easy read, perhaps too simplistic. On the other hand, it is also practical, with topics pertinent to our ordinary life experiences.\\"Spirituality means waking up,\\" explains De Mello. \\"Many of us, even though we don't know it, are asleep. We're born asleep, we live asleep, we marry in our sleep, we breed children in our sleep, we die in our sleep without ever waking up.\\"One of the underlying principles is the difference between interdependence and dependence. According to De Mello, interdependence is healthy and occurs when we have different roles in society, allowing us to interact and live more efficiently. Dependence is unhealthy and occurs when we depend on another for our happiness..De Mello provides insight on religious dogma, insight that is pertinent to the religious battles that plague us to this day. \\"Scripture,\\" he says, is \\"a hint, a clue, not a description. The fanaticism of one sincere believer who thinks they know causes more evil than the united efforts of two hundred rogues. The final barrier to the vision of God is your God concept. You miss God because you think you know. There is far too much God talk; the world is sick of it. There is too little dropping of illusions, dropping of errors, dropping of attachments and cruelty, too little awareness. That's what the world is suffering from, not from a lack of religion. Religion is supposed to be about awareness, of waking up. Look what we've degenerated into. Come to my country and see them killing one another over religion. You'll find it everywhere.\\"True faith is more than reciting scriptures. It is not something that can be worn on your sleeve. \\"Meditating on and imitating externally the behavior of Jesus is no help,\\" says De Mello. \\"It's not a question of imitating Christ, it's a question of becoming what Jesus was. It's a question of becoming Christ, becoming aware, understanding what's going on within you. If you would die to the past, if you would die to every minute, you would be the person who is fully alive, because a fully alive person is one who is full of death. We're always dying to things. We're always shedding everything in order to be fully alive and to be resurrected at every moment.\\"In today's fear-based society, you may have forgotten what it feels like to be full of love and joy. \\"Happiness is our natural state,\\" explains De Mello. \\"Happiness is the natural state of little children, to whom the kingdom belongs until they have been polluted and contaminated by the stupidity of society and culture.\\" If you take the time to step away from your ego, you'll come to the realization that \\"Negative feelings are in you, not in reality. So stop trying to change reality. Stop trying to change the other person. We spend all our time and energy trying to change external circumstances, trying to change our spouses, our bosses, our friends, our enemies, and everybody else. We don't have to change anything. Negative feelings are in you. No person on earth has the power to make you unhappy. There is no event on earth that has the power to disturb you or hurt you.\\" Awareness comes when we can step far enough back from our selves to drop our illusions and fantasies and reclaim the grace and magnificence of our creation."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"A Father knocked on the door of his son's bedroom and announced, &quot;Wake up!

But, then, I found out that Anthony De Mello actually never wrote it! Instead, he gave a long seminar and spoke these words, tales, ages of wisdom. He was about 55 (I am about 40), and he died soon afterwards.If you don't believe, which is good :-), check out the audio recordings at:http://awareness.tk/It is a one-man show with a lot of laughter in the background.Tony asks that you do NOT believe what he says. Instead, be like the goldsmith and treat his words like the goldsmith would: rub, scrape, cut and melt. My challenge to you is to also do the same to your own responses (thoughts, feelings) to his thoughts/ideas. Rub your own responses, thoughts, beliefs; scrape, cut and melt them before you believe them.Don't be lost in them though. Tony would have liked you to taste life you have HERE and NOW, and not philosophize to endless depths over his message.Remember the tale he tells from Japan: There was a man running away from a tiger. He came to a precipice, and fell. Fortunately, there was a bush he could hold on to. Up, there is tiger, down, his fall to death. At that point, he notices the bush, a berry bush.

I don't agree with everything that is written here. But Demello is very challenging to our ways of thinking. I have enjoyed this book very much over the years and would recommend it to anyone who is open to change, new ideas, new ways of thinking and a new way of life."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Want to elevate your spiritual awareness? This a fabulous read for all deep thinking, spiritual persons. I could not put it down and read it several times! I ordered extra for my adult children!"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"AWARENESS was a very thought provoking piece of literature.It is beneficial toward promoting expansion beyond limitedconcepts of belief and behaviour. One is drawn into thedifference between Authority as experience and consciousnessand authoritative as those who tell us what to think rather thanhow to think. The book was in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"De Mello's awareness of reality and ability to communicate on a level that all can understand is very refreshing in this age of over-analysis. The art of living in the now, forgetting the past, stop worrying about might or might not come to pass is the key to true happiness that De Mello makes my heart soar."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This book will definately give you a fresh perspective on life and your relationships, with those around you and yourself. The short chapters make it easy to read just a few minutes at a time."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Have you ever driven several miles and passed your exit ramp? An example of not being aware or fully present is pretty easy in this mind-numbing world. We're either over-stimulated or have too many things on our minds to fully pay attention to ourselves, others, or our lives. This book jolted me into the present--no easy task! If you want to see how much you are coasting your life away by not being fully present, this book is for you. I highly recommend this if you see your life zooming by."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Highly recommended to anyone seeking larger understandings of themselves and world around them . Great food for thought... It'll shake you up, wake you up, open you up to new perspectives. My husband and i read it aloud chapter by chapter to each other and then discussed, related it to life... had to buy a couple extra to share with friends..."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I really like this book. Anthony de Mello was a priest and a psychiatrist living in India. His ideas come from religion, psychiatry and Buddhism and he proposes some insights to be happy.We are not happy because we believe we need the approbation of others, to be successful and to care for others. We have to wake up, that means to realize that these beliefs are false. You have a right to be selfish, to make mistakes and you can live even if people don't like you.These false beliefs also reduce our freedom because they make us vulnerable to manipulation through critics, rejection and accusation of selfishness.The book is a fun read because De Mello illustrates his ideas with stories and jokes."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Sometimes I'll read a book and, maybe a couple of times along the way, I'll be forced to stop and just let my mind calm down. Just because something the author has written is so thought-provoking.With this book I had to do that on almost every page. I don't think it's ever taken me so long to read 184 pages before.I'm actually glad Cardinal Ratzinger, Chief of the Vatican Thought Police, decided to condemn Fr. de Mello's work. If it wasn't for the ensuing controversy, I might never have become aware of the work of this truly enlightened priest.I don't approve of censorship, but sometimes these things happen when Catholic priests (or nuns) throw pearls before swine (which is unavoidable in the world of mass market publishing).No bother. This book would not be appropriate for the handful of people who actually care about anything Ratzinger has to say, anyway. Not because they don't need to wake up reality, mind you -- they're just so enjoying living in a dreamworld, any attempt to disturb their slumber will only irritate them. You don't want to disturb the simple faithful.Of course, maybe if they were disturbed a little bit, they wouldn't be so simple?"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This book was extremely useful in helping me catch myself, in the midst of my experience, becoming conscious of what I am doing, who I am being and considering why. Also, De Mello reminds us not to beat ourselves up about what we do or how we feel....no judgment, but just to be aware. Great book. I'm so thankful it was recommended by my lovely Professor, S. Rao!"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Anthony de Mello's book Awareness is the most direct book I have ever read about what the really important questions in life really are. De Mello wastes no time placating or hedging: he states succinctly and with amazing clarity exactly what the &quot;real&quot; questions are and tells us how to &quot;answer&quot; them: Awareness. Truthfully, he lays little claim to direct answers, his point is that awareness is not an answer because no answer is appropriate -- the point is to be aware, not to answer questions nor solve problems nor to &quot;fix&quot; things. Life is not broken.Regardless, if you feel your life is not what you want it to be, if it lacks a spark of some kind, but you can't quite figure out what is missing, I highly, highly recommend this book -- I think you are in the perfect place to find value in this book, if not immediately, definitely soon. I am continually amazed as I read every page how _true_ de Mello's words are. I would say it's &quot;unfortunate&quot; or &quot;sad&quot; but I think these things are meaningless to describe the fact that few people will even appreciate this book and fewer still will truly understand it. I can say that I think it would be nice if everyone was able to read this book and really consider de Mello's words with an open, honest mind.Anthony de Mello suggests an incredible opportunity for a life worth living in this book and I want you to take advantage of it. Read this book.Live well."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"the good from many religions, yet easy to read, creates a new understanding. I didn't know about this Fr. DeMello until a reading assignment, and now I have read most of his 9 books. Sermon on the Mount, this one deserves several readings. MAL"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"DeMello totally blew me away. This book is an incredible piece of work. This book changed my whole way of thinking and explained why I have lived my whole life in pain."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This book is on my top 5 list of all time. It was given to me at I time when I was ready to hear what it had to say, and I re-read it whenever I have the chance. Though I was unclear about a few parts, I found it helpful to keep reading, as he returns to themes later on, and this reinforces what he is saying. Of all the self-help material out there, I find this to be the clearest, most succinct, most honest, and most direct. If you want to move through painful parts of your life or begin appreciating things -- I wholeheartedly recommend this!"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"As of this date 50 of 55 have given this book a 5 star review. Tony De Mello will remain immortal through his writings and Awareness is a gift which I will appreciate each day of my life through a daily reading of one (or more)of Tony's 58 gems of spirituality. This book was a gift to me and it is a wonderful &quot;opportunity of reality&quot; to give the book to my friends and family members. One of my many enjoyments in life is to laugh outloud while I am reading a book ... which I did so many times throughout Awareness beginning with the empathic story of the headmaster who didn't want to get up in the morning and go to school. Tony's sudden death of heart failure at age of 56 was his last mortal reminder to live each day and each moment of our lives with love and Awareness."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Is he casting aspersions? That's OK. DeMello was obviously way beyond Catholic theology and either enlightened or on his way there. A beautiful, simple, and simply amazing book."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Read this book. It's important"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Though I did not agree with everything De Mello wrote it still was a near perfect book. I found myself waking up in the middle of the night and reading it with my solar flashlight. I found it a great help in generating positive thoughts in which to fall back asleep to, resetting me for the day to come."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Awareness is the best book I have read... It is written in easy to relate to language..It has changed my life..."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I read this years ago but re-read it recently and it is still a great book. This man was one of a kind, a bit of a rebel even though he was afilliated with the catholic church before his death. The book is about keeping your awareness clear in order to have a free mind and know ultimate reality. He keeps repeating the word \\"awareness, awareness, awareness\\" throughout the book to remind the reader that that is all spirituality is really about. It's a gem of a book!"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This DeMello classic which combines the practical with the mystical has never failed to reinspire me upon re-reading. Nor has it ever failed to please any of the many to whom I have given or loaned this book. It remains an \\"essential\\" on my spirituality shelf.The other book to be grabbed before being left off on a desert island? I havn't decided that one yet..."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This is not for those content with their status quo! Father de Mello leaves no stone unturned to ruffle feathers about our \\"reality existence.\\" But, if you are a true seeker, there is no better book than his to contemplate.Love and Immortality: Long Journey of My Heart"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"do whatever it takes to have a copy of this book. ask yourself why people hold on so tightly to \\"their\\" opinions, then just read it with an open mind and then contemplate if there is any truth in what you have just read.i bet you'll want to read it again and again"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This is a great book! If you want to get more out of life, read \\"Awareness\\""},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Here is a book that transcends religion and deals with what we all know in our heart of hearts to be true. De Mello strips away our illusions and forces us to acknowledge what lies behind the curtain of modern society. At times his revelations become uncomfortable; many may find his passion for the truth disquieting; others may be put off by his vehement exhortation to \\"wake up.\\" Maybe these ideas should make us uncomfortable at the same time we recognize them as truth.This book needs to be digested in small bites, allowing us time to process all he proposes. Memorable stories, anecdotes, parables, fables, and aphorisms abound. Best of all as a native of India and an ordained Roman Catholic priest, De Mello ably reconciles both Eastern and Western philosophies.As soon as I finished this book, I returned to the first entry and began again. There is so much here that makes all the difference in the world!"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I have written somewhere else that I am not good believer, that applies also with this book. Having said that I did not let the writer's background to stop me to read and learn from the book. I could feel that Anthony de Mello is not selling consulting service with the book but the real meaning of these writings is to bring help in everyone's life journey.For me this was very important book, which helped me when my life was really difficult. The book was a important element for me to get back to the light during the dark period of my life.I bought this book also to some of my friends.Great book for everyone who is interested in self development and wants to understand essence of life."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Your inner \\"eyes\\", that is. He is a blend of St. John of the Cross, a Zen master and Brother Lawrence and is not bound by the constraints of his Catholicism but has distilled its essence. This essence is communicated with a distinct flavor of the best of the Eastern mindfulness tradition. You will be happy to have the good father as your spiritual guide. Sadly, he is no longer with us on this earth, but he certainly continues to guide us in our search for the deepest union of our selves with the Divine."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I had the great fortune of discovering this wonderful book from the recommended reading list at www.superwisdom.com (Thank you again Tom). Awareness is one of those treasures that kinda take your breath away as you come upon something that connects with something higher, you go \\"wow\\" and grab the yellow highlighter so you don't miss what you have found. De Mello is one of those very very rare people like Vernon Howard who are able to write and express himself whereby you can grasp what he is saying. This is a book that I've shared with close friends."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"As a Fordham ( NY's Jesuit college ) grad,it may be permissible to say Anthony DeMellois the greatest Catholic writer on spiritualmatters. Awareness is the book! Too bad thethe Pope INC. doesn't get it."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This book has within it the power to free you from thinking of the word 'burden' and life in the same thought.Time and time again I come back to this book so that I may continue to challange myself to think beyond everything I have learnt spiritually and practically. Strange how this one book has changed so much about how I approach life.:-)"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I like this book and I've given a few away to my friends. I'msure you'll want to do this too so go ahead and order several copies..."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Read this book over and over again! Memorize it, live it, then pass it on or buy it for someone you love! They'll thank you."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I received this book as a gift. Although I did not plan to read it right away, just scan it (you know, busy, busy, busy!), I found myself unable to put it down. The book is filled with jokes and stories, and while light reading carries a profound message -- that sticks. The message may not be acceptable to those who are sticklers for religious dogma, since it points out some pitfalls of religious worship as opposed to achieving true spirituality which is an inherently human trait (God is in every one of us). I can't wait to order De Mello's other works."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"To the author I would say, &quot;Bravo, you're making people think.&quot; To other Christians I would ask, &quot;Are you ready to think for yourself? Or are you content to have people do your thinking for you?&quot;"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This is a simple read, and so packed with pragmatic wisdom. I wish I could set my iPhone to play chapters audibly whenever it detects I'm sleeping while awake. It's a firm but playful nudge to help us shift from opinion to truth. From \\"lost in thought\\" to appreciation for what's hiding in plain sight. From chasing what we often forget is the \\"fool's gold\\" of life (money, fame, popularity, affirmation)... to a place where we stop seeking happiness... and start noticing the quiet, content love that surrounds us silently every moment. The book is packed with stories and humor and written in a very informal and playfully abrupt (but humble) style. It may not offer anything we don't already know, but help us unlearn some things that are distracting us during our journey."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I thank God for this book. It changed my life. I was so lost in the world and confused. It brought everything together into an integrated whole, a \\"oneness\\". It told me things I already knew to be true but had forgotten. It challenged me, and yet at the same time encouraged and helped me. I feel very deeply thankful for Anthony de Mello and his writings. I feel very connected to him, like he is here helping me in life. His writing is so honest and true that every word and every sentence is full of purpose and meaning. It speaks about even silence has great purpose and meaning. I remember reading it for the first time and not being able to put the book down. I had an inner smile and a hunger for this kind of refreshing insight into life. It speaks directly to your heart, bypassing your mind. It speaks with living words, not just pointing a direction but taking you down that road, almost carrying you. I must have read it 3 times to begin with and then only pulling it out when I needed some encouragement and to remember how to live. I reached a point where as it said at the end of the book that you will come to a point where you don't need it anymore, and I felt I didn't. I have lost my way many times since, but I can keep coming back because it planted and nourished a seed of awareness within me. I started listening to Allan Watts and Eckhart Tolle after words. I appreciate all of their teachings, but there is something about this book that is like my first true love in life, that it will always be special to me, innocent. I have matured much since my first true love but I will always remember and be thankful for that experience. I am currently ordering this book for a friend who I think will find a treasure trove in \\"Awareness\\" here.Whatever you are doing in life, do it well. If you are sweeping the street, be the best street sweeper in the world. If you are walking down the hall of your house walk it as the best hall walker in the world, when you breath, breath as the best breather in the world. Stay connected to your source.(recent Julia Roberts movie) - \\"Smile with your mouth, smile with your whole body, even smile with your liver.\\"God bless you. May we all find our way in this life and whatever or whatever not comes after."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"SUPER - AMAZING - LIFE CHANGING book!! A must read for everyone who is just feeling life is disappointing and not worth living. Anthony de Mello gives you a new look at living and life and yourself that is revolutionary -&#34; it's not work, it is easy&#34; - become aware of what you are doing and what is going on in your life. Become aware! Awareness! Awareness! Awareness! This material is also online on YouTube with Tony in conferences before he died! It is a transcription from these conferences and meetings!"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This book is perfect for those who find themselves questioning everything they were raised to believe and who experience the feelings of confusion, loss, guilt, and hopelessness associated with breaking out of their programming. De Mello is able to use metaphors and philosophies from several faiths and religions to tie together the universal process of \\"waking up\\"."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I'm a big fan of Eckhart Tolle and became aware of \\"Awareness\\" by word of mouth from other Tolle fans. I couldn't put the book down; read it in one sitting. As I was reading, I tripped out that the author was actually a priest! His style of writing is straight to the point, \\"in your face.\\" Picture a highly energetic motivational speaker who genuinely wants you to change for the better; well that's what I pictured. He speaks the truth bluntly. It'll open your eyes, make you see things from a totally new angle.Although I love Tolle's \\"The Power of Now,\\" for someone who's new to this, I would recommend reading \\"Awareness\\" first because it's much easier to understand. I had to read Tolle's books a few times before I really had an understanding. And if you're already familiar and enjoyed Tolle's works, you will surely enjoy this. \\"Awareness\\" covers a lot of material that Tolle goes over: disidentifying with thoughts, labeling, presence (not covered in depth like Tolle though), and more. But Anthony covers the material in a different, more down-to-earth type style. If you had trouble understanding Tolle, \\"Awareness\\" could probably help you have a better understanding.You can easily find live recordings online of Anthony speaking to an audience. He's not highly energetic as I had in mind, but he doesn't need to be. There's surely some magical quality when Anthony speaks. If you check out the audience, you'll notice that they are all giving Anthony their full undivided attention. They're transfixed, hanging on his every word. \\"Awareness\\" is actually a transcription of his live talks. Just like how the audience is transfixed seeing Anthony live, you too will be transfixed reading the words just like how I was. Amazing read!"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Awareness was recommended by a friend who has bought more than 10 books to give away to friends. It is a great way to understand how your mind can torment you and keep you in addictions of all kinds. A good book to reread often to help move forward in emotional wellbeing."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I loved this book and it has a lot of helpful advice for anyone who is struggling to be happy. It has helped at least two of my friends and myself to focus on what DeMello calls being \\"aware\\" or understanding why things make you happy or unhappy and how to overcome the unhappy times.It has some excellent opinions about love as letting the object be free, rather than what many call love which is really manipulation, control, and covetness."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This is the essence Tony De Mello's writings. I have read his other book 'Love' many years ago and have embraced his insight and wisdom for living. 'Awareness' is a great book to have for quick reference or as as a daily meditation when you want to contemplate an issue that you are facing. It has helped me relax and enjoy life rather than trying to control it."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I was raised Catholic, which is fine, but I never was blessed to meet a single priest who was really aware. Of course, what do I mean by what I just said? Everybody is aware, right?Wrong...almost no one is aware, because \\"everybody is thinking that they are somebody\\" when if they were truly aware they would clearly know that an idea of self is just an idea and nothing more. Please excuse me when I say,\\"Oh my goodness, the mind has taken over the world and we are all prisoners who are being subjected to brainmaking techniques that are causing us to believe that the things we see and perceive define who we are and what everything is.\\" Nonsense. \\"I Am\\" is all that can truly be said about who or what I am or anyone is. Anthony De Mello realized this Truth and he passionately and concisely shares it. Apparently the Vatican wasn't pleased that one of its fellows was awake like Jesus. Can't afford another Jesus running around while the church is busy telling you to wait for his future return to save you.Does Awareness need to be saved from anything? Is awareness threatened by what it is aware of (the come and go offerings of life experience)? Since you are that essence of knowing power, do you need to be saved? No, unless you would prefer to give up your obvious freedom for something limited that can only be known as such because Awareness Is. Yes Tony, boy are we asleep. I love Anthony's direct uncompromising style of exposition. Why not blurt the truth out directly. The clergy and its followers have missed the boat to reality by living in the mind, the past, the future, the image-nation. Wake up wanna-be holy ones, holiness is right here, right now.Thank you Anthony for speaking gracefully about the One awareness that loves all beings and their things. After all, how does all of this drama appear in the first place?Yes, I agree, through the You that is I for all...Awareness. Nothing is more fun than being aware and being That Alone, thus Awareness in any form is the best form that I know, simply because...I know I know etc.etc.etc.eternallySundance Burke, Author,Free Spirit: A Guide to Enlightened Being"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This is a fun book to read and an altogether different approach to spiritual teachings that often can come across as a bit heavy or even pretentious. De Mello has such an authentic and lively voice and reminds us that spirituality does not have to be sober and serious-minded."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I read this book about two years ago and the material has been on my mind ever since! De Mello seems to introduce material and concepts that you never really knew existed. He stresses some key points in the book: waking up to \\"reality\\" and experiencing life free of internal constructions and false perceptions; being \\"AWARE\\" of your moods, self, and surroundings; along with a plethora of other life changing topics. De Mello also ties a great deal of his material with his faith (Catholicism... although he HATED such labels)-- this may discourage some readers but it is secondary to his real message. My only criticism is that I wish he would have gone deeper into some of the concepts. I find myself trying to apply some of the concepts, which make perfect sense, but find that some of them are limited in scope. For instance, how far can one take the practice of not assuming any labels?"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This is a book I have read and reread, in bits and pieces, when I want to feel refreshed. It reminds me of what is important in life. Put it on your nightstand, along with the other books that you never reshelve."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"A very good friend told me about de Mello's works and I have several of them. This one captured my imagination, my passion, my heart as I sensed Truth in it. There is a Universal ring to it!"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Awareness - to have impecable awareness is one of the highest traits of a spiritual life. If you want to start to \\"wake up\\" out of unconsciousness and live a conscious life this is a good book to start. This book does not sugar coat anything it is a straight up \\"wake up call\\" to start learning how great life can be, and living in awareness is a big part of the picture. This book is an easy read, no technical stuff but gets right to the point. I read this book to complement my favorite author Eckhart Tolle, as living in the Now and having impecable awareness are one in the same."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I must say that there are some good insights in this book and perhaps it will strike your fancy, it just didn't strike mine. Right off the bat there was a typo within the first few pages, the font is strange, and the presentation is in the style of a talk at a retreat. So the language is colloquial and idiosyncratic. If you're not a logical type you might enjoy the folksy, somewhat confrontational style of the dialogue. It's just not my cup of tea. I see that others have given very high reviews and let me qualify my criticisms with a nod to the fact that the insights presented herein are in line with some of the greatest teachers I have read and thus you should not discount this book.

But you have to watch out that you don't take what he says to mean nihilism, as at first this is what seems to come across when he is describing he thoughts. Because of this you have to be careful with how you use this book. But other then that it's well worth the read."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This book may work for you, but it did not hit me in any powerful way. The style is casual and confident, at times seemingly overconfident and hyperbolic. As with other books in this area, the ends are presented with words (like &quot;wake up&quot;) that almost make it appear easy to achieve, yet whether it is easy or hard depends on the person. It is tempting to get caught up in the mystique of eastern ideas. Probably readers with little exposure to minfullness and detachment will find it more useful than did I."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This book was decent. I won't say that I'd be hot to trot about buying it again, but I will say it makes you think about things.My friend recommended this book to me. He had mentioned that it was a good blend up meditation of spiritual ideas from multiple sources. He said it was enlightening. In fact he said the writer was enlightened.There are a good many things that this book says that make sense. It's main idea is that we should be more than just aware of our actions but also our motivations behind them as well as our motivations behind our motivations.What I wasn't a fan of is how he came across a bit abrasive and uncothly blunt. Unfortunately it came across as being negative and indicating that humans are all selfish at their core. Which is a bit different than I'd any other spirituality book I've read."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"i find this book most liberating and rewarding. It is my bible for living. i have given the book as a gift, many people say it is depressing, these happen to be the same people who seem to me to be caught up in drama and ego. The concepts are like home to me, and yes i do read to confirm what i already think, fair criticism to by the author about humans. However there is one difference, these thoughts have been out of the concensus reality since my childhood. I have wondered why i thought differently, and it re assuring to hear someone say the things i have already thought. I would enjoy recommendations of any people via E mail for books in the same vein. I am a philosophical ignoramus and hope for guidance. i recommend it highly thank you Anthony De Mello"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This will be a brief review, to cast my vote &quot;for&quot; this wonderful book and to offer some advice. I was greatly impressed with Father De Mello's advice to stop thinking about being aware and Just DO IT! That advice -- to be aware of the blessings of God in our world and in the brief section of the world we call our life -- is superb and valid no matter what your faith or outlook (assuming it is basically positive).Just one word of advice -- the Vatican has, indeed, cast some aspersions on this book (at least for now; who knows when that may change). I would recommend this book be read by someone who feels comfortable with their faith and with their trust in the Lord. The book can seem a bit new age-y but it can also bless one's prayer life and one's response to the wonderful creation, which includes one's awareness."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This book can change your life. Although De Mello's emphasis is spirituality, it deals with cognitive issues. His approach is practical &amp; straight forward.

While the audio is better because you actually get to hear Tony DeMello's voice and enjoy his humor more personally, the book is an excellent read, with one qualification. That is, if you happen to be a devout Catholic or any other type of devoted Christian for that matter, it might be better for you to avoid this book unless you are willing to truly open your mind to new information. If you do indeed fit into one of these categories, and are absolutely certain that your faith/beliefs represent the \\"undisputable truth,\\" then don't purchase this book as it may just annoy you. I know this based on my personal experience of recommending it to friends and associates.For me personally, \\"Awareness\\" was a life-changing work because it inspired me to adopt a significantly altered view of life and reality. For this reason I strongly recommend it, and in fact within my own book I identify it as a \\"must read\\" for anyone on a purely \\"spiritual\\" as opposed to religious path."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who needs enlightenment.

Like him De Mello turns our everyday concepts of love, life, our fears and our joys, inside out. Both construct their arguments impeccably and very carefully making you think thoughts you were never going to consider, weaving you in your own web of illusions. Krishnamurti's approach was suave and hypnotic, but De Mello's argument tend to end up with an unexpected slap in the face! You'll soon become quite defensive (if not defenseless) watching him passionately tearing all your thoughts apart, substituting them with something frighteningly real. Its meditative free-floating series of heavy punches is difficult to tackle and can easily leave the reader numb instead of illuminated. It leaves you on your own, which is a drawback, but realistic at the same time. You'll be smiling at the end of it all, but sarcastically you won't know what you're smiling at anymore."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"i love the book but buying used comes with highlighted parts underlined words and sections! but the book is awesome!

While it has inspired me to read more books about the Zen philosophy, I think that I will keep referring back to Awareness, as I will need frequent reminders to focus on the &#34;real&#34; world, as opposed to the illusory one that most of us create by adding our emotions and prejudices to everything. He recommends that we step outside of ourselves and be a dispassionate observer of all that we see, hear and say. He promises that if we do that, our lives witll change for the better. With this attitude of detachment we will learn a lot abut ourselves and we will also know how to love everyone. We will no longer be vulnerable because our &#34;self esteme&#34; will not depend upon compliments and we will not be hurt by criticism.. He suggests we start with admitting that; &#34;I'm an ass, you're an ass&#34;. He also asks that we face the fact that we often want to demand that other people change. Once we face this honestly it will affect all of our interactions. We don't have the right to demand that, but we do have the right to protect ourselves from anyone who would manipulate us. Anthony DeMello's words are much more convincing than mine. So if you are currently experiencing pain in your life, read this book. I have worked as a social worker for many yrs. and been to many seminars on all kinds of behavioral and psychological issues. I found this book to be more helpful than all of them combined."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"this one is for the gods-uproarious laughter, a sly cut at our slyness and still profoundly simply and profound. how can words express truly glory!"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"In his book Awareness, Anthony de Mello, reminds us over and over in many different ways to be awake to what is happening in our world and in our souls, in our bodies and in our minds.His language is straight forward, uncomplicated, and easily understod.

It's one of those books that I buy and give away to others and get another copy and so on. So, obviously, had to do the PC version so I can actually keep one just for myself.

While I have read books on mindfulness and also books by Jiddu Krishnamurti, none have had the impact that this book has had on me.One of the reasons that I believe that this book was had such an impact is that it addressed a point in my life where I had become disillusioned and doubful of the ideas of the afterlife and a personal God as taught in Christianity. If this is you, this book is definitely for you. However, if you are a person who is happy and content in your ideas in a personal God, and you're certain of a personal afterlife, I'd actually discourage you from reading this book. It will likely only upset you."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Tired of your self???????? Read this and get harshly jolted awake, you will never be the same(thank goodness)"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This book will throw a monkey wrench into the gears of your mechanical modern mind. Not just the mechanical mind of the secular consumer, but more so for the religious, who just may be &quot;worshipping a mental idol.&quot; This book is about waking up existentially. Quit adopting the externals of others, whether saints or not, quit absorbing things to your false self, quit personalizing everything, quit identifying with what makes you both seemingly happy and miserable; and what is so great is that you are not to actively &quot;quit&quot; these things. Instead, look. Exist. Listen. Awareness, awareness, awareness. As in the words of that unknown author of &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot;: instead of realizing &quot;what you are&quot;, realize &quot;that you are&quot;.The awareness spoken of in this book is not self-consciousness, not a straining of the will or mind; in fact, the awareness in this book implies a kind of good unawareness.Some other reviewer on this page says this book is &quot;watered-down yogiism&quot;. He goes on to say basically, in more or less words, that this book is Godless and is psuedo-eastern escapist pacisfist quietistic navel-gazing crap. Now, it MUST be noted, this book is for people who are capable of understanding that De Mello is not here teaching a doctrine of Salvation, so to speak. He is not saying, &quot;okay, here is how you save yourself...&quot; No. It is more like he is saying, &quot;okay, here is how to be yourself...&quot; He is not saying that awareness is salvation. No. Awareness is simply awareness. Christ was aware of all that was going on around Him. This came with being fully human. Christ wants us to be fully human and to love Him as humans, not as rigid &quot;religious&quot; mercenaries, mistaking our discursive thoughts and mental images for Christ Himself. Our discursive thoughts and mental images are good, but reality keeps on going, not mechanically, but in a kind of always beginning, calling us to a kind of daily death, which is actually creation groaning in its birth pangs.This book teaches what Christ taught when He spoke about the lilies of the field. I don't think we really take that teaching seriously. It is not about irresponsibility. It is not about feel-goodism, (which, I might add, is one of the things that De Mello nicely destroys in this book, leaving for the reader throughout the reading, many instances where you are neither ecstatically crushed under condemning news about yourself, nor led away on some discursive and clever &quot;insight&quot;, flattering you away to neverland, but left plainly and wordlessly in front of yourself with your bubble burst, yet still pointing to some ground of your being that is undeniable, so that you don't get to indulge in the pleasure of crawling under a rock to sleep in self-pity.)I recommend this book to those who have not only wept for their sins and errors, (by this I mean real error and sin, not social faults) but who have also realized a little bit that there is the danger of a certain pride and egoism that comes with weeping over them too much or in the wrong way. WAKE UP!"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"ING. EMILIO CRISTANCHO GUEVARA ; edfasa@hotmail.com This is another excellent book of psychologist A. de Mello , it teaches us how to understand ourselves better in order to be able to modify our behavior , because as he points it out, the things we do not understand , we can NOT modify them, but the things that we do understand , we can then MODIFY them, and that is mainly the majority of the topics explained in this book , A. de Mello teaches us how to understand ourselves better, in order to accomplish our main goal ,which is to Modify our inmature or inappropiate behavior, to be able to live a less stressful and a happier life. This is another of the excellent books that gives you an internal peace of mind, and relieves you of so much accumulated tension, and makes you see things from a different REAL perspective; thus releasing your blocked energy and giving you more free extra energy that you never thought you had, to try to give you control over your life in most of lifes situations; thus I recommended highly this book along with the other books written by A. de Mello, these books will give you a better understanding of yourself, and he mentions that by understanding yourself, then you get better , you can modify yourself and you won't repressed it , so you will solve many of your unsolvable problems by knowning and understanding yourself better, then the reader can accomplish the ideal goal of psychology : to overcome the unreal Illusions that we have about orselves , and also to overcome the distortorted ideas that we have made of the personality of others, and this book will help to achieve this goal. I hope everybody enjoys this book as much as I have enjoy most of his books. By the way, this is one of the books that will help you increase your EMOTIONAL Intelligence. Sincerely : ING. EMILIO CRISTANCHO GUEVARA ; e-mail: edfasa@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"DeMello should be expected to make people nervous. He's a contemplative, who seeks the true meaning of spirituality. He does this from a position of spiritual poverty, so when his words seem as though they should berate me, I can still listen peacefully.From his contemplation comes compassion, which was the key to reaching me. He tells me exactly where I'm stuck without ever failing to assure me how much he loves me. He understands how afraid I am of the dark and how much I suffer there. But more importantly, he understands how scary it is to step out into the light.This is one book I wish I had with me always but I can't keep a copy!

I will never forget this image: (not a direct quote) If you can remember that you are the sky, not the clouds, then you will be separate from the stress. All any of us need ever do is shift our focus. Which is why I am an optimist, idealist, dreamer, philosopher, psychologist, without picking apart and killing the subjects and objects. I hope the world is ready for this."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"It's true and important to understand that De Mello often communicates through contradiction. For instance, he tells us \\"The only way someone can be of help to you is in challenging your ideas.\\" (Awareness pg. 35) No doubt, all of us can think of countless other ways and specific situations in which someone could be of help to us in a way other than by \\"challenging our ideas\\". However, this is a style De Mello has intentionally chosen in order to battle the sea of misconceptions that he sees over flooding our society. Rather than go through the semantic hoops that are technically necessary in order to make the subtle distinctions that he is after, De Mello chooses to \\"shock the truth out of us\\". He says things that are not intended to be completely accurate, and are sometimes even logically inconsistent, but rather contradict our culture's common assumptions, forcing us to either totally dismiss what he says or, if we read with an open mind, to consciously think about the point that De Mello is trying to communicate.This is a stylistic choice that fits with his view that logic is unable to fully capture reality. He explains, \\"the guru cannot give you the truth. Truth cannot be put into words, into a formula. That isn't the truth. That isn't reality. Reality cannot be put into a formula. The guru can only point out your errors. When you drop your errors, you will know the truth. And even then you cannot say.\\"There's a lot of good advice in this book that has helped me to get past some of the messages society tells us about what it takes to be a \\"success.\\" I highly recommend for anyone who is feeling at all disillusioned with Western culture and is willing to read with an open mind."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Awesome.

This book is pure inspiration. I feel like I'm about to wake up. I know how to do it now. It's just a matter of time."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"Judging from the number of 5-star reviews, it seems evident that =Awareness= is most typically a revelation or a reinforcement for the majority of readers. I expect it was a revelation to those who walked in through the Christian cultural door... and a reinforcement for those who've been up and down the paths of Buddhism, Taoism, Suffism and the like. It was certainly clever positioning, which, along with the cleverly worded subtitle, worked well on the tables at Barnes & Noble and Borders.And there are a lot of worthwhile passages. The disquisitions on Finding Yourself, Obstacles to Heaven, Detachment, Losing Control, among =many= others, should be required reading to provide some mindful balance vs. all the Pavlovian and Skinnerian manipulations we are fed through the majority of commercial media streams. If there is a single boil-down here, it may be that actual reality is nowhere near what we have been led to believe to support the purposes of those who need our labor and consumption to make them wealthy, as well as to fight the wars they need fought to either retain that wealth or get more.But for the reader whose eyes are already open; for the reader who knows who the mindless pieces and half-conscious players are around the game board; for the reader who actually knows from experience what \\"love\\" is (and isn't); for the reader who knows pluralism, either-or stipulations and unwarranted assertions... de Mello can be trying.If you are coming to this book from long associations with John Locke, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Michel Foucalt, Immanuel Kant, George Hegel, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, Milton Rokeach, Martin Buber, Bertrand Russell, Jules Henry, Stanley Milgram, Neil Postman and Margaret Singer (none of whom were \\"holy men\\" or psychologists), you will probably see the \\"glaring discrepancies.\\" Moreover, if you are coming from familiarity with Rumi, Paramahansa Yogananda, Georg Gurdjieff, Jiddu Krishnamurti, Fritz Perls, S. N. Goenka, Marsha Linehan, Steven Hayes, Thich Nhat Hahn, Eckhart Tolle, Jon Kabat-Zinn, John Forsyth or Pavel Somov (who were or are \\"spiritual giants\\" and head pshrinquers).Again, I want to emphasize that I am in favor of reading this book cover to cover. But I will humbly (regardless of how you feel about my using that word) suggest that one not do so until they at least understand the nature of logical fallacies, let alone =actual= spiritual experience. Because, to one who does, much of this book reads like it was lifted from others because the lifts sounded good though the lifter had not actually had sufficient experience with them to understand when he was under-stating, over-stating or mis-stating them.Perhaps because of the conditioning of the culture from which he came, as well as from St. Ignatius's own tendency towards =highly= assertive, all-or-nothing, this-way-or-no-way absolutism, de Mello stumbles again and again into hyperbole, projections, promises and declarations that are unwarranted. The collegiate debater will run into a good dozen of these in the first 25 pages and may chuck the thing out the window. He (or she) will cheat himself out of a =very= worthwhile journey if he does.It is simply unfortunate, I suppose, that books like this are so often the product of those doing a =pretty= good job of channeling their rage, but who are not fully aware of it when they need to be.Further, and despite the author's simplistic assertion toward the conclusion that he has provided an instruction manual for cultural transcendence, =Awareness= is just a terrific travel brochure. One =will= obtain plenty of value from this book, but the actual journey involves far more than what is reported here, not the least of which is the collective experience of countless expeditions into a non-verbal realm of wordless, non-symbolic, thought-free, direct apprehension of what is. And for that, one will need to consult =many= teachers who have climbed the mountain up many different paths.All that said, de Mello has made a substantial contribution to the bridgework from the popular and mundane to the \\"other side of the river.\\" He simply sounds more like some human potential movement shaman than the more discriminating may be able to tolerate."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"This book isn't just a wake up call, it's a knock upside the head!

In doing so, he opens the possibility for each of us to live a very powerful life, which, of course, is something none of us really want if we can't keep our hard-won victumhood, scapegoats, and hostage lovers. Yet, to Tony, it seems worth the effort to at least show what might be, what could be, what, in some transforming spots on this enchanting blue and white marble, actually, exits in the life of--perhaps-- the person standing right next to you.

Going way past identifying with any religious or spiritual &quot;techniques&quot;, de Mello tells us that in order to be happy we need to be fully human and in order to be human we need to be aware of ourselves. Yes, we hear this kind of a thing all the time, yet he Mello does this in such a highly personal, direct and warmingly engaging style that you take him in. He somehow synthesizes the best of Jesuit, Buddhist and Sufi teachings as well as modern psychological theory without any name-dropping or theorizing. Like a true master he is he goes straight for the personal experience. His jokes did more for me than the abhidamma texts i've been reading lately.

Since then I have read a few other works by this Jesuit priest, and I must say Awareness is the best. Perhaps that is due to it being a replica of talks he gave-that it brings out his &quot;natural voice&quot;, rather then his &quot;author voice.&quot; But yes, this book certainly has life changing potential. But perhaps it was just a book that was there for me at a specific time that, looking back, has a few errors within as well. Not a big deal-so maybe the conditions for you in this life are right.

It goes beyond demonination and beyond concepts and beliefs - right to the essence of reality itself, where is nothing but pure consciousness and well-being. Anthony DeMello was a spiritual teacher who just happened to express himself in a Christian framework. But really there's little difference between him and teachers like Eckhart Tolle or Krishnamurti. In fact I came across this book on the recommended reading list on Eckhart Tolle's website, where I have found other fantastic books such as The Fall by Steve TaylorThe Fall: The Evidence for a Golden Age, 6,000 years of Insanity and the Dawning of a New Eraand the work of Gangaji."},{"Title":"Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality","review":"I'm a student of the Bates Method of vision education.

In fact, I repeated the whole book now twice.You will probably find yourself underlining many passages that you will re-read often and share with others. One that particularly felt good to me was: &quot;Happiness is our natural state. Happiness is the natural state of little children, to whom the kingdom belongs until they have been polluted and contaminated by the stupidity of society and culture&quot;As you probably know, Anthony De Mello died in 1987.

In my opinion - everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"Anthills of the Savannah","review":"This splendid short novel demonstrates Achebe's continuing ability to depict the challenges posed to African societies by modernism and Western influence. It details the plight of three educated, upper-class Africans attempting to survive in an atmosphere of political oppression and cultural confusion. Set in the fictional African country of Kangan, it is clearly patterned after Achebe's native Nigeria, though one can also see elements of Liberia and Ghana.This was the first Achebe novel I had read since his classic Things Fall Apart. At first, I thought that Anthills suffered in comparison with that masterpiece, arguably the best known and most influential African novel. After finishing the book, though, I realized that Achebe had very deftly returned to and updated the themes raised in that book.His protagonists are Ikem, a courageous and opinionated newspaper editor; Chris, his friend and predecessor as editor, now the somewhat-reluctant Commissioner of Information in a military-led government; and Beatrice, a brilliant, beautiful mid-level civil servant, also Chris's lover. Each studied abroad and is comfortable tossing off literary references and cultural cues from the West. At the same time, each is proud of and clearly shaped by his/her African heritage.Kangan is ruled by a smart but narrow-minded military officer who rose to power following a coup. &quot;His Excellency&quot; is also coincidentally and not at all implausibly an acquaintance of all three main characters, bringing a very personal dynamic to the struggles they face as Ikem sharpens his already bitter criticism of the government, to the professional discomfort of Chris and the personal alarm of Beatrice.I found the first half of the book a little hard to get through at times. The prose is often overwrought and the narrator changes from chapter to chapter, making it difficult to follow. Further complicating things is the frequent use of West African dialect, especially in dialogue between the lead characers and their less-westernized compatriots. While this brings a ring of authenticity to the work, it also requires close attention by non-African readers to divine the literal meaning of the deceptively familiar words. As the novel progresses, though, the confusing switch-off of narrators ends, the prose becomes sharper, and the storyline clearer.Achebe sprinkles humor liberally throughout the book. The characters serve up a steady stream of clever, expressive African aphorisms. The most memorable of these are delivered by a tribal elder from Abazon in an impromptu tribute to Ikem. Achebe also paints vivid and funny accounts of a monstrous traffic jam, a confrontation with soldiers at a checkpoint, and an up-country bustrip. those who have spent any significant time on the continent will nod their heads and chuckle at these uniquely African scenes.As in Things Fall Apart, the insidious influence of the West is depicted mostly indirectly. While there are no major European characters, the cynicism of Western expatriates and the cluelessness of Western journalists are reflected quite well in two minor characters, a British doctor who administers the local hospital and a visiting American reporter. More often, though, the specter of Western influence hovers in the background. One sees it in the alienation of the lead characters from their roots, most vividly in Beatrice's reminisces of her village childhood and university days in Britain.In the end, Achebe seems not so much to be blaming the West for Africa's problems as pointing out the ways in which, years after independence -- and even longer since things first &quot;fell apart&quot; -- African societies continue to struggle with the legacy of colonialism. The villains are not Europeans but the opportunistic soldiers, politicians, and businesspersons who came to power afer the departure of the colonists.Achebe's perceptiveness and skillful sketches of characters make this an important work, a period piece as representative of contemporary, post-independence Africa as Things Fall Apart was of colonial Africa."},{"Title":"Anthills of the Savannah","review":"Achebe wrote three classic books in the 1950's and then after a long hiatus returned to the novel with the publication of Anthills in 89. The earlier books dealt with the effect of modern civilization on traditional African life. This book uses one nation as an example of what is happening with many nations as they struggle to find their own version of modern life without altogether letting go of tradition. The characters are all educated, many in the west, but strictly western modes of rule do not work in third world conditions quite as smoothly as they do in industrial conditons. Big changes are needed and a big leader is needed to effect those changes quickly and successfully but that age old maxim applies here as elsewhere: power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. A great book showing how good intentions can quickly go wrong. Achebe tells the story through the personalities playing a part in it and so you never feel he is making abstract points. He shows the human side of these dramas we so often see played out on the 6'o clock news. A touching and tragic book. Achebe is a fascinating person to see interviewed as well, perhaps the most articulate and insightful spokesman on modern Africa as it searches to find its shape."},{"Title":"Anthills of the Savannah","review":"Chinua Achebe has produced a masterpiece in &quot;Anthills of the Savannah&quot;. Set in fictional Kangan, Achebe spins a highly intriguing tale of three men who grew up in school together but find themselves increasingly alienated from one another professionally when one of them (not the smartest but the smoothest) declares himself President in the aftermath of the overthrow of the civilian Kangan government. Conflict of conscience issues generated by moves by the would-be dictator to consolidate his power over his people threaten to destroy their friendship and loyalty. It is no longer the white man who is responsible for the grinding poverty of the masses but the revolutionary fighters whose corruption and lust for power undermines their cause. Achebe is also brilliant in his characterisation. Ikem and Chris are vividly drawn and full bodied personalities, as are Beatrice and Elewe. Even minor characters like Professor Okong who appears only in the novel remain sharply etched in one's mind long after they have disappeared from the scene. &quot;Anthills of the Savannah&quot; remind me a little of V S Naipaul's &quot;Guerillas&quot; but it is by far a superior work. A thrilling and highly engaging piece of work by a literary giant."},{"Title":"Anthills of the Savannah","review":"This is indeed a masterpiece by the grandmaster of the African novel.As usual Achebe brings his characters to life in an amazing way.The setting is a fictional African country and the main characters are three men who met in high school the seemingly seperate lives they lived until a point when fate joined them together again is indeed the tragedy of modern African states.You have the military men,the sychophants,Pseudo radical intellectuals and of course the endlessly suffering masses whom all groups profess to know their problem.It is indeed recommended reading for anybody remotely interested in not only African but Latin American politics."},{"Title":"Anthills of the Savannah","review":"The story in this book is set in the fictional modern-day African country of Kanga. The action revolves around three central characters. Chris holds the position of \\"Commissar of Information\\" in the president's cabinet; he basically has the final say in what gets printed in the country's newspapers and broadcast on the airways. Ikem is the editor of the country's leading newspaper. He and Chris are friends have been friends since school. Finally, Beatrice is a mutual relation of both of these men. She and Chris are romantically involved, while she and Ikem have a close but strictly platonic relationship.The story revolves around how these three and their relationships are affected by the creeping authoritarianism that has been taking place in Kanga. We learn that both Chris and Ikem are boyhood friends of the president, whom his obsequious ministers address as \\"His Excellency.\\" His Excellency took power in a military coup that was intended to quash instability and then restore democracy, but as in most real-life African military governments, it stayed on after this original mandate had expired and turned into a full-fledged dictatorship. His Excellency is the archetypical African ruler. Trained in a European military school, he quickly rose up through the ranks because of his loyalty to his superiors, and when he seemingly accidentally gets installed as the new ruler, expects similar obedience from his aides. Like all authoritarian rulers His Excellency feeds off playing his subjects against each other. Eager to curry his favor, His Excellency's ministers spread rumors about each other and attempt to sow discord.In such a cynical, amoral, power-driven world, Chris and Ikem are clearly sympathetic characters. Achebe does a good job of describing what it is like to be a reform-minded, idealistic politician in contemporary Africa. Both Chris and Ikem received their college education in the U.K. and returned to Kanga hoping to build a vibrant democratic nation, only to get sucked into the web of corruption and authoritarianism that has been so typical of post-colonial Africa. Both try to deal with the situation in their own ways. Chris is more pragmatic; rather than open insubordination to His Excellency, he thinks that he can try to reform the situation from the inside. Ikem, on the other hand, openly criticizes the government's policies in his editorials.For me, Ikem was the most convincing and sympathetic character. While he openly criticizes the regime, he is no nave revolutionary. There is a great scene in which he gives a lecture to a group of university students. While he urges them to vigilantly pursue their convictions, he also takes a few jabs at Marxist theories of imperialism. I think Ikem's character is probably closest to Achebe's own views; while he faults the West for its general neglect of Africa and frequent embrace of its authoritarian leaders, he also places much of the blame for its predicament at the feet of its own corrupt, self-interested leaders. The character of Beatrice, while sympathetic, did not seem as instrumental to the story as that of the two men. Achebe clearly intended for this character to represent an educated African woman, and there is even a chapter written in the first-person from her point of view. While the chapter is interesting in itself, it seems somewhat disconnected from the larger story.Overall, I think that Achebe portrays an intriguing and realistic portrait of contemporary Africa. Although the book was written nearly 20 years ago, it did not seem dated at all. While Achebe accurately portrays the venality and corruption of African political leaders, he also depicts the genuine humanity and indomitable will of both ordinary people and leaders who are trying to bring about change."},{"Title":"Anthills of the Savannah","review":"Our library book club read this book last month,and I'm grateful, for it's not a book I'd likely have picked up on my own. It's a story about a group of friends from a fictional African country who attended an elite school in England and then later found themselves all with roles in the country's postcolonial government, with one friend becoming a reporter. The tale seems to have many layers: exploring the effects of their education abroad on the way they view their country; the corrupting properties of power; losing and regaining connections to their homeland; shifting dynamics of friendships in the face of power; and much more.I was able to appreciate the poetic writing style, the shifting point of view, the nonlinear narrative (without telling us we're flashing back or forward), the references to folk stories, the proverbs that were unfamiliar to me, and the use of pidgin English in some of the dialog. I enjoyed being exposed to a writing style different from what I'm accustomed to. However, this made the book very difficult for this book devourer to get through. Still, if you'd like to expand your horizons, read this book. Just be prepared to maybe feel a little disoriented, but keep reading; you'll be rewarded in the end!"},{"Title":"Anthills of the Savannah","review":"After reading excellent non-fiction about the situation in Africa by Ryszard Kapuscinski, I felt ready for Chinua Achebe. \\"Anthills of the Savannah\\" is his first novel I've read. At first, I thought I would be disappointed. In the first half of the novel, the political topic combined with very dense prose, constant changes in the narrators and frequent use of pidgin English from the region made the mix for me hard to swallow and requiring very much undisturbed attention. Luckily, the second half of the book is the prize for patience, the action starts to develop very fast, the plot is engrossing and the book is difficult to put down until the end.The novel, set in the imaginary African country of Kangan, ruled by the military regime established after the coup, is built around three main characters: Ikem, the editor of the national newspaper, an idealist from the remote province, who identifies with the problems of the nation and seeks solutions (to his peril); Chris, the Commissioner for Information in the current government, suffering from critical attitude, but also somehow soft-hearted; and Beatrice, a thoroughly modern, intelligent and beautiful woman, a girlfriend of Chris and friend of Chris and Ikem. All three had the luck to get the best quality education in Europe, speak excellent English, but in reality only Ikem is not removed too far from his native people to feel what needs to be done in the country.The central complication and the fact which is the starting point of all the subsequent events is that Chris, Ikem, and the dictator, His Excellency (or Sam) are former colleagues from the same school.The country is in chaos, the permanent drought and poverty in the Northern province of Abazon causes destabilization, His Excellency is not popular in that region, his insecurity grows and with it his destructive tendencies. He wants to stay in power by al means... Even if it includes persecuting his friends and loyal collaborators.Achebe managed to include in his novel powerful insights into the reality of many African republics, struggling with corruption, natural disasters, poverty, illiteracy, lack of national consciousness and influence of former European colonizers, at the same time making the novel an interesting story, evoking the images of vast African savannahs and rainforests, the humor of the people and the deep love."},{"Title":"Anthills of the Savannah","review":"\\"Anthills\\" remains Achebe's only novel published in the last four decades; he has otherwise confined his literary output to stories, children's books, poems, political journalism, and criticism. Although he is still primarily known for the ubiquitous \\"Things Fall Apart,\\" I think this later and distinctive work is nearly as good, abandoning allegory and myth for a bitter realism and a torn-out-of-the-headlines plot.The story concerns three friends who studied together in England before gaining prominence in the fictional West African nation of Kangan. Sam assumes power following a coup, Chris Oriko takes a position as Commissioner for Information in Sam's Cabinet, and Ikem Osodi becomes editor of a newspaper critical of the new government. For each man politics and postcolonial Africa have a different meaning: for Sam, they are means to stability through a strong-armed rule that quickly deteriorates to authoritarian self-aggrandizement; for Ikem, the idealist, the new government owes its existence to the people. Caught in between is Chris, the practical member of the trio, who sees the need for firmness yet understand the dangers of Sam's egotism.What truly unites--and divides--all three men is the time they spent abroad. Even Ikem's connection to \\"the people\\" is hesitant and insincere. For all Ikem's idealism, Chris's pragmatism, and Sam's self-absorption, the three men have in common the wall that separates each of them from the people they govern. \\"But why are all you fellows so bent on turning this sunshine paradise into bleak Little England? Sam is no bloody queen,\\" asks a British expatriate, a longtime friend of the group. \\"The most awful thing about power is not that it corrupts absolutely but that it makes people so utterly boring, so predictable.\\"But perhaps the strongest character in the novel is another British-educated government official, Beatrice Okoh, who is also Chris's erstwhile girlfriend. In a pivotal scene fraught with menace, Sam invites her (sans Chris) to a dinner intended to convince the American press that all is well in the sate of Kangan. Beatrice becomes little more than Exhibit A for the prominent role of women in Sam's government, and she bridles against the artifice. Her lack of diplomatic tact is just another dangerous spark among the group of friends; as Sam's insecurities multiply, every confrontation, every sarcastic rejoinder, every challenge becomes a threat to the state, and soon every act performed by even his closest friends is seen as insubordination.In the end, the problem with Kangan's elite is not simply the lingering prevalence of Western influence or that the leaders look to the West for answers and approval. Rather, the new purveyors of African self-rule are not very different than the old colonizers: they have forgotten that the heart of the nation--its very reason for existence--is its people and their traditions. Given the intractable division between rulers and ruled, the despair of the final chapters is hardly surprising--but Achebe suggests that hope might yet be found in the next generation."},{"Title":"Anthills of the Savannah","review":"Not that I have anything against Chinua Achebe as an author, mind you. I liked those early novels like \\"Things Fall Apart\\", \\"Arrow of God\\" and \\"No Longer at Ease\\" when I read them back in the 1960s. Achebe was kind of a herald for me---announcing the arrival of African literature in English on the world scene. I used them as I taught Anthropology, not because I was engaged in African Studies, I was not, but because they portrayed a whole world, an interesting one, of different values, different life plans, and opened up such a world to students who could not have got anything remotely similar from dry textbooks. Achebe wrote of African history and politics from an African point of view. Well, I left my job and Achebe kind of receeded into the background. Recently, I thought I would renew my acquaintance with his work and picked up a copy of ANTHILLS OF THE SAVANNAH. I must say I was extremely disappointed. Wooden characters and a very preachy plot that jerks around, never running smoothly or deep. In a state reminiscent of Nigeria, a military dictator rules but feels the crown rest uneasy upon his brow---so to speak. Stereotypical characters abound. Corruption and the sycophantism of people around a strong man are hardly new topics in the world. Achebe has picked a highly relevant topic for sure. Many conflicting interests surround the government in every country, some in opposition, some in support. Do the common people ever get a day in the sun ? Not likely ! However, the vicissitudes of tyranny have been written about in far better ways. For example, read Garcia Marquez' \\"The Autumn of the Patriarch\\". If you have never read any Achebe, please try one of his other books. I could hardly wade through this one. It's true that the theme is very relevant to modern Africa, but we are judging literature here, not politics or economics. I don't think this novel measures up."},{"Title":"Anthills of the Savannah","review":"I thought the author did a good job depicting some believable but typical characters.

It was well worth reading. Achebe sets the story in a mythical country in West Africa (Nigeria?) and the plot centers on a two bit dictator and his cabinet. I did find the beginning a bit slow and the book hard to get into initially, but the interaction of the cabinet, in retrospect, sets the stage for the happenings that occur later on. Achebe's critique of non-democratic rulers and their lackeys is piercing and thoughtful.The ending of the book is dramatic and hopeful but all along Achebe demonstrates how the British, the former colonial masters, left little for the people to hang on to after they left. The cabinet and the leader are satirical objects almost making the return of the English almost desirable. The one recurrent criticism of the book I would offer is Achebe's use of Pidgin English in the speech of the less educated characters. I had trouble understanding what they were saying, although I do understand his use of the language as a tool. Even when he is not totally on top of his game, Achebe is still worth reading carefully. He is a fine writer.Stanley C. Diamond, author of \\"What's an American Doing Here?

The two female characters contrast one another and invite the reader to consider a less stereotypical vision of African women.Mr. Achebe's use of language is dense and is sprinkled with words and phrases unknown to most American readers making slow going through this short novel.

This story is truly brilliant."},{"Title":"Anthills of the Savannah","review":"VERY GOOD BOO"},{"Title":"New Testament: Todays Bible Translation That Says What It Means","review":"God's Word follows a dynamic equivalence (thought for thought) method of translating. But there are potential problems with this method. I will use a well-known passage (Ephesians 2:8,9) to demonstrate such problems. The verses will be quoted first from the more literal New King James Version, then from God's Word:\\"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.\\"\\"God saved you through faith as an act of kindness. You had nothing to do with it. Being saved is a gift from God. It is not the result of anything you have done, so no one can boast.\\"It should be obvious that these two versions differ greatly. If nothing else, God's word is considerably longer, having 39 words versus the NKJV's 27. But the important question is: are these added words justified by the Greek text? A look at some of the more important changes will answer this question.First, the conjunction \\"For\\" has been omitted in God's Word. But this word is important as it indicates that this verse is related to the preceding one. The problem here is, by omitting this and other conjunctions, God's Word makes it much easier for people to take verses out of context. Conjunctions let readers know that one verse must be interpreted in light of a preceding or following verse.Second, the first sentence has been restructured. Rather than \\"you\\" being the subject of the verb \\"saved,\\" God's Word has made it the predicate noun. In order to have a subject for the verb, \\"God\\" is added to the text. And it should be noted that neither this word nor any other added word is italicized to indicate they are added.Third, \\"by grace\\" is rendered \\"as an act of kindness.\\" And \\"kindness\\" is a possible rendering of the Greek word. So this is not inaccurate. However, there is a separate word for \\"kindness\\" in Greek which appears in the previous verse. God's Word also renders this word as \\"kindness.\\" By rendering both the same way, God's Word hides the fact that two different words are being used. Moreover, it must be asked why \\"grace\\" needed to be changed? Is it really a word that people today would not understand?Fourth, \\"and that not of yourselves\\" has been changed to \\"You had nothing to do with it.\\" Now it is true that the latter is a more natural way of expressing the concept, but none of the words are accurate translations of anything in the Greek text. Moreover, a phrase has been changed to a full sentence.But most importantly, the word \\"that\\" has been changed to \\"it.\\" So a demonstrative pronoun has been replaced with a personal pronoun. But at least God's Word is still using a pronoun. This pronoun is important as it refers back to \\"something\\" in the verse, but there is much debate as to what that something is. However, the two versions differ as to whether they make a decision for their readers as to what the antecedent to the pronoun is. This can been seen in the next words.The NKJV begins the next phrase with \\"it is\\" in italics. The italics indicate these words are added. But God's Word adds, \\"Being saved is\\" without indicating the words are added. The Greek text actually has simply \\"this.\\" So neither version is really literal here. But the NKJV is closer in using a pronoun to render a pronoun rather than God's Word's use of a participle functioning as a noun.The difference here is this: the NKJV leaves it vague as to exactly what \\"that\\" refers to, and hence what the \\"gift from God\\" is. Many believe \\"that\\" and \\"the gift\\" refer back to the verb \\"saved.\\" But others believe they refer to the noun \\"faith\\" or the entire preceding sentence, which includes faith, along with grace and salvation.This difference is important as this verse could help to answer a very important yet very debated question: Do people generate faith from their own \\"free wills\\", or is the very ability to have faith a gift from God? If the antecedent to \\"that\\" is \\"faith\\" then the latter would be true. Faith itself would be a gift from God. But if the word \\"that\\" refers back to being \\"saved,\\" then this verse does not settle the question one way or another.So what God's Word has done is settle this issue for its readers without letting them know that it has done so. In other words, the theological opinions of the translators have been inserted into the text.Continuing with comments on this verse, the phrase \\"not of works\\" has been changed to the sentence \\"It is not the result of anything you have done.\\" God's Word does express the idea, but the only word actually in the Greek text is \\"not.\\"And finally, in the last phrase, the negative \\"lest\\" and the pronoun \\"anyone\\" has been changed in God's Word into the conjunction \\"so\\" and a different pronoun. But at least the final verb is rendered in a possible manner.In conclusion, God's Word has left many words untranslated and has replaced words by completely different words. But worst of all, the theological opinions of the translators are inserted into the translation. As such, God's Word is not a reliable translation of the actual words of God.The above was adapted from my book \\"Differences Between Bible Versions.\\" My book contains more on the God's Word, along with reviews of over 30 other versions of the Bible."},{"Title":"Swordfish: The Story of the Taranto Raid","review":"On a dark and cold night in November of 1940, twenty one obsolete British torpedo bombers (\\"Swordfish\\") took off from the aircraft carrier Illustrious in the Mediterranean Sea. Their target was the Italian naval base at Taranto. Lying at anchor were six battleships, along with several cruisers and destroyers. This group made up the majority of the Italian Navy.Relying on the navigational skills of the pilots, the British aircraft swarmed over the harbor, dropping flares to illuminate the ships and dropping torpedoes and bombs while facing murderous anti-aircraft fire from the Italians. For the loss of only two aircraft, the British managed to sink three battleships, three cruisers, and a destroyer. This successful raid greatly altered the balance of power in the Mediterranean and forced the Italians to move the rest of their fleet to safer harbors in northern Italy.I was a little disappointed with this book. The title is somewhat misleading, for the actual attack on Taranto is only covered in two chapters. Much of the remainder of the book deals with the development of the British carriers in the pre-war years. Much time is also spent on the entire battle of the Mediterranean; something that maybe should have been left to a larger book. The chapters that actually deal with the attack itself are very good, and the attack is described in great detail. Being a Pearl Harbor buff, I also enjoyed the chapter that compares the Taranto raid to the attack on Pearl Harbor.I feel that this could have been a much better book if the author would have devoted more space to the actual Taranto raid. One to two chapters just doesn't due the attack justice. I did enjoy learning about the battles in the Mediterranean. However, I read this book hoping to learn about the Taranto raid, and after finishing it, I didn't learn much more than I already knew before reading the book. If you're interested in learning about the whole battle for the Mediterranean Sea, then this book does a fairly good job of describing it, but it lacks quite a bit in the description of the attack on Taranto."},{"Title":"Swordfish: The Story of the Taranto Raid","review":"Often touted as the attack that proved to the Japanese that aerial torpedoes would work in a shallow harbor, the attack on Taranto is usually relagated to a few paragraphs in books about the more infamous Dec. 7, 1941 attack. Wragg tells us the rest of the story with a clear and interesting, if somewhat pedestrian, recount of this remarkable surprise attack on the Italian battleship fleet in 1940. There are a lot of characters in this story, so many that it can become a bit confusing for the reader. But perhaps the most interesting character and the one developed best by the author is the Fairey Swordfish, the slow biplane that these stunningly brave British airmen flew into the maelstrom of Taranto harbor to all but put an end to the Italian fleet. A little known story, well told. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Swordfish: The Story of the Taranto Raid","review":"Very interesting account of the Taranto raid, a forgotten yet important event in WW II. Despite the fact that the books reads easily, it shoudl have been half as long. The buildup to the raid is indispensible, but a bit overdone in detail. It could have been slightly less rich in detail. But what is really overdone is the aftermath. This takes half of the book, in which the general course of events in the Mediterranean is described, as well as later engagements in which Swordfishes were involved, and a comparision with Pearl Harbour is made. To top it of, a general analysis of carrier development. I was a bit suprised to see the F4 Panthom appear in the last chapter of a book dealing with the Raid on Taranto. The writer should have made some basic choices here. Nevertheless, even though the story runs wild, it still makes easy and entertaining reading. And the charm of a story about biplanes taking on a much more modern fleet is too strong not to recommended this book."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"This novel has got to be one of the most sweetest, and romantic story that I have ever read. One could almost feel Lucy's joy for being in Italy, and her torment of trying to keep her feelings hidden.If anyone loves a period romance, this is it."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A Room With a View is a little hard to get into at first. The many references to Italian culture and British politics in the beginning confused me and made it hard to get into. However, after a little research, I understood the story better and really liked it. Get past the beginning, and you'll be fine. Forster presents very relatable characters in this story: characters trying to discover the meaning of life and feeling. He presents great ideas in this book about happiness and love. The text can be somewhat hard to understand at times; I would keep a dictionary handy. However, this book is truly a classic and an excellent read."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A Room with a View is a spare and striking novel about a man and a woman and about class and societal expectations and pressures. Lucy and her cousin Charlotte are offered rooms with a view of Florence by a Mr. Emerson and his son, who are willing to exchange. The strict and pinched Miss Bartlett does not wish to have an obligation to the Emersons, who are deemed less than polite society will condone. Their rector, Mr. Beebe, tells them he believes the exchange is proper and the ladies get their view of Florence. It becomes clear that Lucy herself wants a view of LIFE and later confesses to her fiance, a priggy intellectual, that she imagines him always in a room with no windows, with no view. The novel's love story is compelling, but the secondary themes of class and society structures are equally strong, with the truly noble characters emerging in the end with great strength."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"One of my absolute favorite books. I discover something new every time I read it. Beautiful settings, lovely characters, an interesting style, and at least a few hearty laughs for everyone."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Contrary to one precis of EM Forster's classic, I found this story neither a '...brilliant social comedy...' nor '...a witty observation of the English middle classes...'In short I found it a disappointingly dreary love story and filled with characters none of whom, with the exception of George Emerson and his father, was particularly likeable. The author himself over-egged the pudding somewhat by inserting far too many personal observations,which bordered at times on pomposity, seemingly to try to point the reader in the direction he/she is meant to think. But amongst it there was a nugget of truth, which shone above all else - \\"Though you...never see him again, or forget his very name, (he) will work in your thoughts till you die. It isn't possible to love and to part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.\\" (p.223 Penguin Classics edition). For this alone, the trudge was worth it."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"In Forster's A Room with a View, sheltered young Lucy Honeychurch (what a name!), traveling abroad with her spinster aunt, happens to meet George Emerson and his doting father. Lucy is not quite sure what to make of the pair, as they seem kind enough but are unpolished in their manners and way of thinking. One morning, during a day trip to the mountains, George comes upon Lucy amidst a field of violets and impulsively kisses her.This indescretion is hurriedly hushed up, and Lucy returns to her home in England. There, she becomes engaged to a respectable young man, a good match by all social accounts, but with whom she has very little in common. Who should happen upon the scene but George Emerson? Lucy finds herself conflicted and confused, unsure of whether to make the socially advantageous match expected by her friends and family or to make a break with convention and think for herself a bit.While this novel starts out VERY slowly, it picks up speed as one goes along, providing a very satisfying ending. Lucy is so intolerable at the beginning of the book that it is difficult to keep reading, but, thankfully, as she becomes more in command of her own thoughts, she is much easier to relate to. (I find this often with female characters in \\"classic\\" literature. It is all one can do to keep from shaking them by the shoulders sometimes. I understand that women were more repressed - oppressed?- when these stories were written, but it can be awfully trying for a modern woman to read such characters. In that respect, reading contemporary novels is sometimes easier.)I also found the novel's debate about expatriates/natives versus tourists interesting, as the same arguments are traded around travel circles today - i.e. the \\"ugly American,\\" those who are inseparable from their guidebooks, etc. It's funny to see that people's views on such a subject have really changed very little in the past 100 years!Though some of this novel is set in Italy, do not expect much of the rich, atmospheric descriptive passages one would hope to find in a contemporary novel of this sort. During the primary character's time there, she is still very much mentally confined, and because we are seeing things through her vision, the novel is more concerned that she see the \\"right\\" paintings and statues so that she can say she's seen them. Eeesh.At any rate, this book is certainly worth reading. I found it to be a pointed social comment on the mores of of the time."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"\\"A Room with a View\\" is a novel that is thoroughly enjoyable from the first page to the last. It's a heart-warming love story, and this aspect of it completely charmed me. It's also very funny in some places. It's not overlong, either, so it doesn't drag, and it's a very easy read. I simply fell in love with \\"A Room with a View\\", and it has to be one of my favorite books I've ever read. I'd recommend it to anybody."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"If you guys love romantic stories, then this is the book for you. I thought that this book was great because the style of writing had it set up so that the scenery and the characters come to life. The author writes about England's pastime. The book kind of gives you a gut feeling to find out what happens at the very end. The story also has a bit of comedy in it, which is very enjoyable. Now in this story, there is a man named George Emerson. George Emerson is a really passionate guy, who fell in love with a girl named Lucy unprepared from the first site. Now the whole story basically revolves around Lucy and her family. The story portrays Lucy and her family's everyday life. The whole story has an easy to follow plot, and many symbolic views of the characters. The reason why Room With a View is comedic, is because the story gives suggestions towards society in a funny way. So I would recommend this book to all of you out there because this book is quite enjoyable to read, and you will have a great time with the book."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A Room with a View was written in the early 1900's by Edward Morgon Forster, also the author of A Passage to India. His story speaks of a young girl by the name of Lucy and her struggle to understand the people around her and her views of the world. She grew up in a family where looks, style, and behavior is what determined the person. People had to be sophisticated and seem almost perfect. When Lucy travels to Italy with her cousin, she meets a man by the name of Mr. Emerson. His ways seem strange to her. He is simple, indifferent of what people might say about him. Lucy tries to ignore his, but her feelings are even more confused when she encounters the young George Emerson, the son of Mr. Emerson, and falls in love with him, something she could not admit for very long. Lucy comes back home to Windy Corner in England and is engaged to Cecil Vyse, a sophisticated and well-bred young man. Everything seems calm, until the Emersons move into Windy Corner as well. Lucy is lost, scared, and embarrassed, but slowly she realizes what she must do. Finally understanding that Cecil, who is too bland and \\"perfect\\", is not right for her, she breaks off the engagement and finds true love and true life with the right person -- George, who is in love with her even since they meet in Italy.Besides the plot of the story, there is a deeper meaning to what Lucy went through. The book was written almost a century ago, so some concepts are lost to us, but the theme is still applied to us. Lucy wanted to know how to be and how others should be. She didn't know what was right and what was wrong. Isn't this something many people, especially teenagers, go through? It isn't exactly the same, but we all wonder how we should be and how others should act. Lucy felt that Cecil did not give her freedom and helped her do everything to make it the way he wants it--perfect. Many of us feel that too--in a relationship with someone, with friends, and with parents. Although it is written in a strange way, this book shows some struggles people of any time in history go through. Our appearance, our actions, our behavior... We question all of it and hopefully find right answers.The thing that really caught my attention about this book was the descriptions of various places the author used. Forster actually traveled to Italy before writing A Room with a View which is another addition to his vivid and somewhat poetic words. Lucy's first morning in Italy was in a room \\"with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons.\\" As she opened the window, she leaned \\"out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road.\\" The autumn in the Windy Corner, Lucy's home, \\"approached, breaking up the monotony of summer, touching parks with the grey bloom of mist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold. Up on the heights, bettaliens of black pines witnessed the change, themselves unchangeable.\\" The author describes so well \\"the pine-woods, the deep lakes of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road.\\" His words seem simple, but together they come to create a picture of a world that you can feel. If you carefully read the passages of the descriptions, you somewhat sink into them, thinking you're almost there. Forster also knew how to put someone's feelings onto the paper. When Lucy frowned, lost in her emotions, he described her as \\"a brave child\\" who \\"frowns when he is trying not to cry\\". The simplicity of these words is what paints the picture of Lucy, trying to be strong and fight her troubles. I believe that E. M. Forster is an extraordinary writer who's words are unique, simple, and yet mysterious poetic.As in almost any book, this one also has a down side. Since A Room with a View was written almost a century ago, its concepts might be somewhat strange to us. Also it is written in a way that is difficult to read, especially for younger people. Sometimes you can miss minor details as the text is unclear or too complicated. These might be the reasons why this book is hard to get into. When I started reading the first few chapters, I thought it would be a bore and a burden to finish this book. It went on better and easier to read though, especially as the plot of the story developed. The key is to have some patience with this book at the start.A Room with a View is a book that may seem different and boring at first, but overall it is an interesting piece of literature. The places described inside make the book very vivid and it nicely shows the way people looked at each other many years ago. Its concepts--the way people judge each other and treat each other is something we can all think about and relate to. Whether you're a teen or an adult, after finishing the book, you won't consider reading it a waste of time. A solid 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Forster's touching, funny and insightful novel toys with the conflict between passion and propriety in the British upper classes in the first years of the past century. Like a good Austin novel, we enjoy the journey despite the inevitable conclusion. In fact, it's not crazy to suggest that this is a book Austin may have written had she lived 100 years later.The movie, starring Helena Bonham Carter, is faithful to the book and worth watching. But read the book as well."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A young Englishwoman's \\"coming of age\\", E.M. Forster's acclaimed 'A Room With A View' is set in the Edwardian era of England's history. The heroine, Lucy Honeychurch, is a well-bred upper-middle class girl who possesses an extraordinary vivacity for life. However, her future happiness and fulfillment in life seems ultimately doomed by the decorum and pretensions of society's expectations.Little does Lucy know that her life will be changed forever under a loggia in Florence and amidst the beautiful Tuscan countryside. On a Baedecker-style grand tour of Florence, Lucy is accompanied by her chaperone and elder cousin, Charlotte Bartlett (an incompliant spinster \\"much discomfited by any unpleasant scenes\\"). They stay at an eclectic pensione filled with British expatriates. There, Lucy becomes acquainted with the handsome and unconventional George Emerson, a modern freethinking Englishman who is staying at the loggia with his like-minded father. The two men kindly exchange their rooms with a view, with Lucy and Miss Bartlett, who were given rooms with no view.The plot revolves around Lucy's inward struggle with what high society expects of young women, versus what she desires for her own future. Lucy frustratingly finds herself at a crossroads. Should she bow to society's \\"rules\\" of 'proper' women of her day, and marry the stuffy and priggish Cecil Vyse back in England, a wealthy and learned gentleman who embodies all things viewed with favour in England's high class society. Or should she follow her heart and marry the broad-minded and genuine, yet penniless, George Emerson?Forster's delicate and playful story-telling spirits us from an escapade through in the cobble-stoned alleyways of Florence and the lush fields of Tuscany, to the ceremonious rigidity of English lawn parties and drawing rooms. 'A Room With A View' is brought alive by the impetus of a perceptive and contemplative mind. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"At its core, \\"A Room with A View\\" is a simple, pleasant romantic comedy, no less predictable and sentimental than many books in the genre. But this is E. M. Forster, who suffuses his story with both droll dialogue and a satirical touch that somehow manages to be simultaneously lighthearted and acidic.Lucy Honeychurch is the young British heroine who visits Florence with her prim, proper, and priggish older cousin. (Even before I saw the Merchant-Ivory movie, I imagined Maggie Smith in the latter role.) Early in the book, two events shatter Lucy's oppressive Victorian facade: first, she witnesses a murder on the streets of Florence, and then George, a carefree, young man staying in the same pensione, spontaneously and forwardly kisses her in a meadow.Following her \\"embarrassment,\\" Lucy returns to England and becomes engaged to Cecil, an appropriately named cad whose stiffness and artificiality exceed even those of her cousin and who \\"should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.\\" Soon after the engagement, Lucy's newly respectable life is thrown into disarray once again when George and his father become neighbors. \\"It is Fate that I am here,\\" exclaims George to a minister friend with a rationalistic bent, \\"but you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy.\\"Into this formula, Forster blends both social satire and political themes. The novel's political views are far less developed and serve more to define the characters than to present the struggle between aristocratic affectations and democratic (even socialist) principles. Most comically, Cecil's overt professions in favor of egalitarianism are little more than a patronizing, haughty, and occasionally cruel pose.The social satire, however, is integral to the book: skewering the \\"mediaeval\\" pretensions of Victorian England, he portrays Cecil as \\"the type who's kept Europe back for a thousand years\\" and George as the progressive visionary who decries the brutish \\"desire to govern a woman\\" and argues for a world in which \\"men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden.\\" Lucy finds herself caught between their nineteenth- and twentieth-century views; it's an unfair struggle between those who long to remain mired in the past and those who march bravely into the future."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A witty comedy with literature beauty which is expressed through the clever exchanges, personal thoughts and philosophic lines (but not causing your temple to creased). Lucy Honeychurch, a young girl from a bourgeois middle-up class, decided to look at the world by visiting Florence in spring time, chaperoned by her elder cousin, Miss Charlotte Bartlett. What was started by an argument about a room with a view developed into an impulsive kiss from George Emerson amid the violets thus ended the Florence period in a flight to Rome, away from the 'bold' suitor.Now, George Emerson was not a brackish bold person. He was just a passionate one, who had deep feelings about anything and was in a distress mood over 'everything doesn't fit' and there was no reason for him to enjoy life, though he didn't intend to commit suicide. While his father is an outright-spoken person which didn't fit nicely with English stiff etiquette style. Together, they were misfits among English tourists in Florence's Bertolini Pension. But a murder scene just took place right before Lucy's eyes and George, coincidentally, was able to help her away from the mass. From then on, his dour view of the world was changed and he discovered the wanting to live his life and Lucy found some extend of the deep emotion of a George Emerson.His impulse to kiss Lucy is understandable for a passionate guy, who was unprepared, caught the most beautiful sight of a lovely Lucy, who had revived him, among the violet blooming on the hill where you can have the best view of Florence. But unfortunately, the kiss was also seen by Miss Bartlett and that certainly put a chaos feeling to Lucy. Being forbidden to tell the accident to her mother or anyone else and fled to Rome the very next day, she did not have time to think her feeling over and quickly countered and proposed by Cecil Vyse, the son of her mother high society acquaintance in Rome.The uncertainty, self-denial and buried feeling masked all her actions. The frivolity and passionate spirit that loved the Beethoven music just went under beneath the hypocrisy of 'clever' society standard. Would she discover her true self and feeling at the right time? Or should George go back to his previous gloomy state? What would the so called clever society think?Find the funny but thoughtful lines in between and be invigorated by Beethoven!"},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"One of Forster's earliest novels, Room with a View generally lacks the depth and literary importance that his later works justifiably claim. Nonetheless, it is astute, enjoyable, concise, and incredibly funny. A first reading isn't enough, really; I've read through the novel several times, and each time I find a new level of meaning, a new, ever more subtle layer of humor or sadness or pathos. What seems on the surface to be merely a cute story of a delayed romance turns out to be, on further inspection, a witty and relevant critique of English society and latent Victorian values."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"We are spoiled by modern fiction. As great as the writing is, it is more straightforward and literal. Do you ever find yourself starting a classic and not finishing it??? You weren't getting into it immediately and lost interest. It can be the same with old movies. We watch through different eyes than the time when it was written or produced. My book club did this book this month. We all struggled. I chose this one because I wanted us to try a classic, but I wanted it to be short and pleasant. The \\"flow\\" started later, and it was more laboured to get there.It is so worth it to keep with it. It is not that we are not capable of understanding the language. We are so used to graphic, and explicit, and straightforward language. We need to train our brains, and it can take up to half the book to get to the point where you are really drawn in, forgetting to concentrate and just enjoying the ride.This is truly a lovely story. I love Florence. It is a timeless city that infects you body and soul. So will this book if you let it."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"It's hard to know which to praise more, E. M. Forester's witty comedy of manners, or Joanna David's nuanced and entertaining reading of the book. Clearly, the combination of the two is that rare marriage of great writing brought to life by a talented actress. If you only listen to one audio CD this year, you would do well to make it this one.Forester writes about an England that is long gone . . . but not forgotten. The middle class has its wits and its respectability to defend itself from the vagaries of a challenging world. Naturally, the middle class prefers its own company and so-called manners are merely an excuse to keep everyone else at bay. The absurdity of this way of living is highlighted when Forester takes a young Englishwoman, Lucy Honeychurch (don't you love that name?), off for a trip to Florence in the company of her maiden cousin, Charlotte, who also serves as chaperone.A variety of English tourists are gathered in a small Italian pensione in Florence when Lucy and Charlotte arrive. Both women had asked for and been promised rooms with a view. Upon arrival, they got just the opposite. Complaining over dinner about this, two men, a father and his son, immediately offer to exchange rooms. This offer breaks most rules of good manners at the time, and the women turn down the kind, well-intentioned offer. Thus far can manners cause one to go against one's best interests. During their time in Florence, the women find themselves confounded and redirected by the honest helpfulness of the Emerson men. But the familiarity raises dangerous challenges for Lucy, and she flees their company.The rest of the story looks at the consequences of the flight and focuses on Lucy's attempts to find a way of life that makes sense for her . . . rather than being a slave to social convention.Describing the story's plot doesn't do justice to the witty satires and ironic comments about the pompously respectable. It's a delicious romp, and Ms. David makes it all the more so.If you are like me, you'll find yourself racing to the end to find out what Lucy does with herself."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Forster's turn-of-the-century novel about British snobbery opens in the Renaissance mecca of Florence, Italy, where middle-class tourists clash with both passionate natives and judgmental expatriots. Chaperoned by her prim cousin Charlotte, young Lucy Honeychurch finds herself closely guarded and overprotected in what should be an Italian paradise. Struggling to be reborn--as a living and compassionate being--she is shocked at the rituals of propriety daily served before her naive eyes. Whom to cultivate, whom to snub, what is and is not appropriate behavior vie for dominance in her gentle soul, as she is obliged to surrender her neophyte will to please demanding elders.Much worse still Lucy is not permitted--nor does she permit herself--to explore the forbidden territories of her own heart. The examples of unrestrained natives and a bold kiss among the violet-covered hills of Fiesole result in their precipitous departure for Rome, but continue to haunt her memory for a year. The Emersons (father and son) prove new inpsiration in Lucy's circumscribed social milieu. Against her better judgment she is charmed by their disingenuous manners and the expression of frank feelings. Inspite of her inflexible upbringing, her mind is fascinated, even if her heart does not feel attached, by the father's unselfish kindness and the son's eager grasp of life. Their unusual philosophies and behavior throw fresh air into the drafty corridors of contstraint in which she has been reared.It all starts with the Emersons' courteous offer to exchange their own rooms in the pensione, so that the ladies might enjoy a room with a View of glorious Florence. It takes Lucy one year to realize that her own life has needed a clear view, which she can only obtain through George Emerson. Evenback in England the Emersons inadvertantly displace two elderly ladies as tenants when they rent a villa near Lucy's home. How did poor Lucy ever come to be engaged to a boor like Cecil, with his limited world view of masculine control and maternal domination? Lucy can not imagine him unless he is inside a room, without a view, while he rightly considers her a living view of the world. Lucy is dishonest in denying her growing attraction to George; both of them individually plan to flee the anguish of frustred, forbidden proximity. Then there is the ubiquitous poor relation, Charlotte, meddling, bungling, misunderstanding and misdirecting Lucy's little life--Despite the best intentions. Will Lucy realize her error before it is too late? A quiet, insightful read which will charm students of Edwardian England and the human heart."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A short, pleasant read, which is also very satisfying - I read it as a palette cleanser, so to speak, between Great Expectations and Crime & Punishment, which is not to say it's by any means a frivolous piece of fiction.

This one did the trick!

Boy meets girl, they fall in love, she's in denial, she gets engaged to the wrong guy, conflict ensues, they finally happily ever after. But there's actually a surprising amount of substance underneath all that. From the quietness of his little love story, Forster brings forth some profound thoughts about life and love. Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I found this book as a young pre-teen. My mother handed me a dog-eared copy she had owned since her teens so I would leave her alone during a very long sea-side summer holiday. As a summer novel, it is still one of my favourites.Despite what many of my fellow reviewers have said, I found the character development redeemed many of the characters you may not have liked too much in the beginning. Lucy's growth especially is quite real. Very much something we all end up having to go through in one respect or another as we try to survive our teens. Only her struggle is made all the more aggrivating by all the unwritten rules of Edwardian Society and the meddling relations and aquaintances Forster seems to find an evil glee in throwing in her path.Lucy is a girl caught midway between the tantrums of childhood and expected decorum of adulthood. Through the novel she stumbles her way through all the pit-falls her station and ever-so-proper upbringing keep throwing in her way as she tries to deal with falling in love with a middle-class Bohemian [good heavens]. She starts very much as a young girl still learning the \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" way to do things and through the novel somehow find her way past all the expectations of her mother, her fiance, and society in general to become a woman who takes her fate into her own hands and dares to say \\"But I want THIS!\\"It's the pitfalls and meddlings of the other characters that makes this story a treat. Everyone has an opinion and everyone gets in the way. Forster many times seems to be making fun of his characters, pointing our their absuridites with the turn of a phrase, but in the end it leaves you only with a feeling of affection for the whole lot of them.The writing is many times very tongue in cheek and you can't help but smile at the way Forster turns a phase. The chapter names especially keep the tone of the novel light, even when things begin to look as though George and Lucy will never get together.The copy that I read as a child also happened to contain a short article that Forster wrote many year after the fact as an Epilogue called \\"A View Without A Room\\" that let you know what he saw his characters doing with their lives over the next twenty years after the book ends. Its apparently rather rare, but I would recommend it as I would recommend this book as a whole. Still one of my favourite light summer reading novels despite having read it almost every summer for the last fifteen years."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"This is the best love story I have ever read. You fall in love with the characters the moment you meet them. I have recommended this book to everyone I know, and everyone who has read it adores it. Just read it to find out what I mean. =)"},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Often while traveling, I'll get a sudden hankering to traipse through this delightful novel again. As a result, there are by now maybe four or five different editions scattered throughout the landfill that is my domicile.The Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics edition is by far the best one I know of. You're certainly on the right page. (The \\"Dover Thrift Edition\\" stinks.)It has an introduction by Malcolm Bradbury that is nothing short of marvelous (what would you expect?). He also did the footnotes, which are chocked with insight.This is one of those slightly oversized paperbacks, as I suspect all the offerings in Penguin's \\"Twentieth-Century Classics\\" line are. It's a thin volume, though."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I was greatly impressed by the grasp that this male author had on the sometimes vague nature of emotion - his understanding, especially of women and their emotions, may stem from the fact that his father died soon after he was born and he was raised by his mother and two other women. This book is amazing, not only for the statement that it makes about women and their changing role in society at the time, but for it's great insight into the important aspects of life. For example, (and this is a running theme throughout the book)in the words of a little old lady at the pension: &quot; ...have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate, and yet at the same time - beautiful?&quot; This philosophy of life highlights Forster's obvious favor of Lucy's brother Freddy and George Emerson - the silly ones who go for a romping swim in a pond - and makes plain his disfavor for Cecil Vyce, Lucy's stiff and condescending intended. This philosophy of life comes to full fruition when George kisses Lucy and even dares to kiss her again. By the rules of society, he is an indecent cad, but Forster would encourage us to find the beauty in it instead. Furthermore, this is not merely a story of a brainless girl who is tossed from an unfeeling fiance to an affectionate suitor. Rather, it is a story of a girl's realization of herself and her will. She triumphs as a thinking and feeling girl at the end and that's what makes the finale a sure victory for the author - he has not fallen into the usual trap of creating a two dimensional heroine."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said by the other reviewers?

However, &quot;A Room with a View&quot; was one of the most wonderful non-Austen books I have ever read. I laughed out loud many times at the way Forster worded things, especially the chapter titles (eg. &quot;How Ms. Bartlett's Boiler was so Tiresome&quot;). At the beginning, he seemed to be making fun of his characters - at their simple-mindedness and lack of depth - but then he commenced to transform them (mainly Lucy) and make them into wonderfully admirable people. It seemed that justice was served to Cecil when he served as the means through which Lucy and George were finally united. I enjoyed every minute of this book but would recommend it only to those who would appreciate it and who would be reading it by choice."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Without a doubt A ROOM WITH A VIEW is one of the most charming classics out in print.

Forster, but I decided to give him a try and i am soooo glad that i did! A Room with a View is sweet, believable, and romantic.

(i hope)"},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I first read A ROOM WITH A VIEW when I was young and I enjoyed tremendously. After reading it again recently, all the subtle humor and irony behind what seems to be just a simple love story was still there.This is one of English literature's lost work. The subtle love that George first expresses towards Lucy after holding her head in his lap after she faints was powerful. All he did was hold her, but the strong and foreign love he has for her can be felt.When they go out to the country with a few other friends, you can feel how nervous George was, not even talking to anyone and just fidgiting, avoiding Lucy's brillant eyes.The story then climaxes when he just strolls up to Lucy in a field of tall weeds and kisses her. It then goes on to become steamy when he kisses her the moment after her fiance goes off to find his hat.Forster recognizes that true love takes time to develop and that lovers dont always say or do the right thing."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"The first two thirds of the book are well written and entertaining and the last third is magical.

I couldn't understand some of the characters actions and motives.I almost felt like parts were left out - and this could be possible from what I have heard about some of the Kindle book versions.

It deals much with society and one's place in society, of a woman torn between two men, one from her class and another from a different class. It was a bit difficult to separate what part of the book was intentionally placing characters in their societal place and what part of the society issues were a result of the time the book was written. It does draw the reader in and has him/her rooting for certain characters. Also, if you're looking for a book that takes place in Italy, this is not the best one.

Part of Charlotte's traveling expenses are being paid by Lucy's mother. George Emerson and Mr. Emerson are willing to change their rooms at the Pension Bertolini so that Lucy and Charlotte will have a better view.On the following day when Lucy's sightseeing companion departs and takes the Baedeker with her Lucy joins forces with Mr. Emerson and George. They lead her to the Giotto at Santa Croce. On a rainy day Lucy plays the piano at the pension. George and his father don't fit in with others at the pension. In true English fashion this is a matter of class. Lucy finds her cousin and chaperone, Charlotte, tiresome.The scene shfits to England. The travelers have returned. Lucy's mother likes Lucy's suitor Cecil because she knows his mother. Cecil is self-conscious, ascetic. He became interested in Lucy when he encountered her in Rome. Lucy is not given to criticizing people, but Cecil is. Lucy and her family have been surrounded by the best people at their home, Windy Corner. Mr. Honeychurch, a barrister or solicitor, had settled in the neighborhood before it had many houses in it.A local clergyman knows that Cecil Vyse likes thwarting people. Mr. Emerson and his son are to take a house near Windy Corner pursuant to Cecil's machinations to play a joke on someone. Charlotee has made a promise to Lucy she breaks, freeing Lucy to seek her true interests in her relationship with others. Speaking to George causes Lucy to dismiss Cecil as her suitor, and speaking to Mr. Emerson causes Lucy to follow her true bent to achieve happiness.E.M.

He follows the genius of the master novelist of the previous century, Jane Austen."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A Room With A View takes place in England and Italy. The scenery is beautiful and the characters are very well developed. The book shows a lot about people and how they interact with each other and their surroundings. The main plot is about a girl falling in love and not always understanding or knowing how to follow her heart, but the real importance lies within the characters and their surroundings. Mr. Emerson and his son George are amazing people with wonderful ideas of the world, but they are frond down upon because they are different from the norm. I found the book very enjoyable although the first part was quite slow. The middle and the end of the book went quickly and had me hooked."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"The romance of this book was beautiful...you can't really describe it. Young Emerson being unexperienced falling in love with Lucy was hinted a bit with every chapter, it was never really bluntly spoke of that he loved her...Forster didn't take the easy road, but beated around the bush which made Lucy and George's relationship much more interesting and fascinating to look at.From the scene where Lucy wakes up and finds herself in the arms of George is probably the biggest hint of his love for her...even though all he really did was hold her. In the end their struggles to get ignore their parents and society itself gives them the reins to control their own lives.I'm not sure but there was just something about this book that makes me just aghasted...I can't describe it...I feel so overcomed with emotions, just like when I read Tess of the Durbervilles. But in this case, there's a happy ending"},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"'Everyone' has seen the movie (possibly several times) and enjoyed the beauty of the Tuscan landscape. This is an extremely witty book that examines the social mores of the English villagers of their class and time. It's not actually a long way between this and Joanna Trollope. It's a type of literature the English have been doing superbly for, well, centuries. This is not a hard book to read. It has nicely observed things to say about class attitudes, but is not particularly profound or deep. Just enjoyable.Younger readers might find it hard, especially if they have not had experience of the type of social structures and attitudes depicted. It will help you to understand about other places and times. All that is important for helping to understand where we are now."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"This book reminded me a lot of \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" with a number of key differences:1. This one was written 20 years earlier.2. There is no sex - just two kisses on the cheek.3. It's just so much better - the psychology of the characters is much more realistic, the conventions of society are satirized much more aptly. Furthermore, this book is very funny at the right places while still being morally serious. It is also kind to the characters (including the \\"bad\\" ones) showing them as people with failings and not as straw demons to be skewered in service of the author's philosophy.So, if you like serious but enjoyable literature, go and read it."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Forster's novel takes aim at the British ideas of respectability and social class. Lucy wants to rebel against the many rules that govern her conduct, but she is torn. She loves her mother and brother, and wants the admiration of her social set, but she finds so many of these people tiresome and hypocritical. I was struck by how frequently the title phrase is mentioned. There are the obvious references to her room at the pension in Florence and to the view from the salon at her home in England. But Forster also explores the \\"view\\" of one's acquaintances vs the reality of their inner core. It's when this second way of looking at things (pun intended) comes into play that the novel really got interesting for me.I did find the middle section - from the time Lucy and Charlotte left for Rome to Lucy's epiphany regarding George and Cecil - somewhat slow going. In fact, I just about gave up on the book. But I'm glad I persevered; the last five chapters redeemed the work for me."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I just re-read this classic as part of a E.M. Forster compilation that I was recently given. It is one of my favorites. It is probably a 4 1/2, maybe 5. In my mind, it will always be intertwined with images from the Merchant-Ivory film, probably because the movie version is so well done and true to the book. I think I am going to have to dust off the movie and watch it sometime in the near future.I did enjoy this quote from the book: \\"A rebel she was, but not of the kind he understood - a rebel who desired not a wider dwelling room, but equality beside the man she loved.

Some fiction achieves a status like Holy Writ. This novel might.The central characters in >A Room With a View&lt; are as follows.1) Lucy Honeychurch:a. \\"I can't think,\\" Lucy said gravely.b. Lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do.c.

If you're not used to reading pieces from this period, you may need to warm up to the style, but once you do, you'll enjoy this."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"When A ROOM WITH A VIEW was first published in 1908, the sun had not yet set on the British Empire. The Victorian Age was coming to a creaking end, but for most English, life went on pretty much as it had been for the last half century. But under the priggishness that was the remnant of old-style prudery, cracks were appearing in the hidebound and stuffy proper British upper-class morality. Women were starting to clamor for rights. The lower classes wanted more of the economic pie that once belonged unquestionably to that of the upper. Amidst all these nascent changes, E. M. Forster wrote A ROOM WITH A VIEW to satirize gently the entire spectrum of proper British morality that was becoming increasingly clear was not so proper after all.Lucy Honeychurch is your typical Victorian young lady visiting Italy in the vain hopes that she can \\"broaden\\" her vistas, a process that Forster thinks clearly is so much rubbish. Accompanying her is Charlotte Bartlett, an equally stereotypical chaperone whose business it is to keep Lucy from having too good a time. In Italy, they rent a room that they do not like. In the room adjacent is the father and son Emerson family who graciously offer to swap rooms. The stern Miss Bartlett promptly exhibits her social snobbishness by thinking the Emersons are low class clods. The younger Emerson, George, likes Lucy but her higher standing on the social pecking order, discourages him from forming a liaison. Lucy and Ms. Bartlett return to England where Lucy becomes engaged to Cecil Vyse, a thoroughly dislikable sort but whose high social standing makes him a perfect choice for Lucy. George winds up in England and learns of Lucy's engagement, which he encourages her to break. After much soul searching, she sees that Cecil is a pompous buffoon and marries George.A ROOM WITH A VIEW is a lesser book in scope than A PASSAGE TO INDIA and a much lighter in tone work than HOWARD'S END, but in its gentle satire and in Forster's ability not to take anything too seriously, he has recreated a world of stuffiness that stands revealed in a comic manner that still manages to address such sobering issues as woman's rights and class snobbery. This is a fine book that sheds some much need perspective on an era that not many see as humorous."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I have read \\"A Room with a View\\" about six times. It is a mystery to me why I enjoy it so much. I love the descriptions of Italy and the sense of humor that Forster imbues all his characters with. I feel that Lucy and Cecil represent the tendencies within each of us to escape intimacy and 'real feelings' under the guise of social suave.I also think I know about five Miss Barretts. Forster also captures the essense of the supremely annoying old spinster who 'doesn't want to trouble anyone' and her tragic beauty."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"E. M. Forster's novels just don't wear-out. Reading a classic such as A ROOM WITH A VIEW is the perfect book to prove the point. The form and story has been rewritten by many modern authors, but this original is still the best and on top of must reads before I/you die. The setting makes you want to escape to quickly book a wonderful view. Return to this classic, soon."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A Room with a View is a wonderful, gossipy book that teaches more than one life essential moral. Lucy, a young woman who finds herself battling with society's expectations, teaches the reader many of these morals as she discovers them herself. Throughout the course of the book, Lucy strives to take a more independent path in which she can follow her heart with passion. The role of social classes is quite significant as it teaches one to not be judgmental or conformed to the rules of society. Forster does an excellent job developing his characters page by page. Miss Bartlett, Lucy's society-driven cousin, becomes Forster's most interesting and mysterious character by the end of the book. Both George and Mr. Emerson, a father and son first introduced in Italy who are of lower class, also become more deeply engaging characters as the book becomes more and more addicting. Part I of A Room with a View takes place in Italy where art, music, love, and society's expectations all emerge. After reaching Part II there was no putting down the book. I became enthralled in the gossip of love, truth, society, and morals. Lucy battles with the ideals she was brought up with and society's pressure as she strives for independence, passion, and true love. A Room with a View is the type of book that makes one feel good after reading it. This romantic book is full with gossip and morals that is sure to bring a smile to anyone's face and warm anyone's heart."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A Room With A View is one of those light-hearted yet serious books that starts out slowly, begins to warm up, and becomes wonderful toward the end -- leaving one with a warm, happy glow. On the surface, it is a very simple book with a very simple plot and theme -- forbidden love. Indeed, it is not the plot that makes the book so enjoyable; it is the style and the characters. Outside of fiction, E. M. Forster is also well-known for essays on various aspects of literature; he also taught in the English university system. This becomes clear throughout the course of the book; he writes like a literature professor. This accounts for both the slow start and the eventual charm. Always a clever writer (though occasionally too self-consciously so), with tongue never too far from cheek, Forster can definitely turn a phrase -- the penultimate paragraph to one of the later chapters, on Lucy's \\"surrender,\\" is bone-chillingly good --, and the book is written in a generally light-hearted, jovial way. As another reviewer pointed out, he almost seems to be making fun of his characters at times. Clearly a social critic at heart, Forster shows how what seem like earth-shattering tragedies to Lucy -- the prim, upper-crust heroine -- are, at best, but ripples in the pool. Despite the recurring \\"tragedies,\\" the mood never gets too dark and heavy; light-hearted chapter titles help perpetuate this feeling. This raises the book above countless similarly-plotted novels. Forster after all created the concept of \\"flat\\" and \\"round\\" characters, and as anyone familiar with the terms knows, the former is not a pejorative. Forster stressed that a novel needs both to be balanced and true-to-life. This indeed has them: Lucy, the well-rounded, life-accurate heroine who lives, breathes, and grows; Cecil, the walking caricature. Forster's social criticism must also be remarked on once more. In this social comedy, he deflates Edwardian England's puffed-up, self-important upper-class values and leaves us both charmed and amused. The book's deeper element lies here, as he enlightens us about the hypocrisy and xenophobia. His point should not be missed. These elements come together to bring about a delightful, pleasant, and short read that is likely to please most anyone. This is a well-deserved classic."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"This was one of the few books I was able to import to my Kindle Fire when I first got it and was just a title I had heard of."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"With news that the British Government is closing its High Commission in Florence, this work is even more topical. This is light and funny, but it is not Forster's best book. Despite some of its shortcomings, the setting is thrilling and many of the characters are highly entertaining."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Contrary to the back cover precis of EM Forster's classic, I found this story neither a '...brilliant social comedy...' nor '...a witty observation of the English middle classes...'In short I found it a disappointingly dreary love story and filled with characters none of whom, with the exception of George Emerson and his father, was particularly likeable. The author himself over-egged the pudding somewhat by inserting far too many personal observations,which bordered at times on pomposity, seemingly to try to point the reader in the direction he/she is meant to think. But amongst it there was a nugget of truth, which shone above all else, and really is the essence of the story - \\"Though you...never see him again, or forget his very name, (he) will work in your thoughts till you die. It isn't possible to love and to part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.\\" (p.223 Penguin Classics, London:2000). For this alone, the trudge was worth it."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"E.M. Forster does a remarkable job of illustrating the constricting social values of Edwardian England with humor and acute insight. Our heroine must decide: go along and get along or shirk her \\"dutites\\" and chose a life of remarkable rebellion (for the time).You'll want your own trip to Italy when you're through reading! One of my absolute favorites."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"In A Room with a View, E.M. Forster infuses a formulaic plot with rich characters and social commentary to create an eloquent insight into the human condition. Forster's gift for detailed character description and subtle sarcasm are prominently displayed as he describes protagonist Lucy Honeychurch's transformation from virtuous, obedient girl to vivacious, independent woman.A Room with a View was first published in 1908, at a time when the British Empire was at its apex. The stereotypical images of high British society - proper tea parties, cultured conversation, and mild-mannered ladies- were still commonplace. However, a cultural revolution was taking shape. Women were beginning to challenge their role as symbols of modesty and decorum, while socialists and other freethinkers criticized the insular, intolerant views of the upper class.In the midst of this rising movement of innovation, young Lucy Honeychurch takes a sightseeing tour of Italy. Raised in sheltered comfort at her estate in Surrey, England, Lucy is dutiful, submissive, and subconsciously able to suppress her own feelings in order to please others. In Florence, Lucy meets George Emerson, a passionate, spontaneous man with radical ideas on life. After a brief romantic encounter, Lucy returns to England, feeling confused and strangely dejected. Her sense of propriety outweighs her emotions, however, and soon she is engaged to a well connected, self-important man named Cecil. Cecil exemplifies the haughtiness and superficiality of the upper class. Forster describes him as, \\"Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as self-consciousness\\" (100).As Lucy and her snooty fianc&eacute;e prepare for their wedding, George moves into a nearby villa. His reappearance sparks both feelings of love and contempt in Lucy, who vows to ignore him and devote herself to Cecil. But confrontation is unavoidable, and in their few moments alone, George inspires Lucy to break off the engagement with Cecil. He tells her, \\"Every moment of his [Cecil's] life he's forming you, telling you what's charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly; and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of your own\\" (191). Lucy realizes the truth in his statement, but is so distraught, that she rejects both Cecil and George. It takes a heartfelt speech by George's father and a great deal of soul searching before Lucy realizes that she needs George. After all, he is the catalyst that starts Lucy down her path of self-discovery.While the plot of A Room with a View is similar to other period romance novels, such as those by Jane Austen and the Bronte's, Forster's didactic style and witty sarcasm lift the book above the standard. Forster includes comments like, \\"But, as I say, this took a little thinking, and - so illogical are girls - the event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done\\" (137). This quote highlights Forster's love of humor and cynicism, but it also brings up another issue that sets him apart from his peers. Forster is a man writing about a topic that is typically covered by women. While his views may be biased at times, his perspective adds a unique element to the genre.Even more amazing, is Forster's ability to portray a young woman's personal and emotional rebirth with such understanding and clarity. Lucy is a complex character who continually struggles with outside influences and her own beliefs. All of her emotional battles are internal, but Forster records them so beautifully that they are just as exciting to read as any external action. For example, he writes, \\"Some emotion - pity, terror, love, but the emotion was strong - seized her, and she was aware of autumn. Summer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring...The scales fell from Lucy's eyes\\" (193-94). Although Forster is a man, he captures the sprit of a woman in his words.E.M. Forster's story expressively highlights human nature, personal growth, and free will through the development of Lucy Honeychurch. Forster has the remarkable ability to be sarcastic one moment and poetic the next. Ultimately, it is his unique style and character development that make A Room with a View an incomparable novel."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Forster's indicment of Victorian England is not as enjoyable as Howard's End or A Passage to India. However his direct style and story telling ability is still preferrrable to some of his British contemporaries.The story centers around that of the ruling gentry and their contempt for anyone a little different from themslves. Interestingly enough Forster's most booring characters seem to be the Anglican clerics who are more interested in gossip and self importance that serving their constituents.The novel begins in Florence admidst the many treasures that adorn that City and concludes in the beautiful English countryside. The hero, Lucy, is embarrassed by her own attraction to the Emersons's, Father and Son, who are clearly not of her class. She is encouraged by her stuufy cousin and a couple of old maids who are staying at the same hotel to avoid the Emersons. Mr. Emerson is a true romantic and his style is much to direct for their comfort and his quiet son George is much too gloomy.Lucy is so taken off balance by young George Emerson that she cuts short her stay in Florence and flees to Rome and then home. At home she becomes engaged to a dull and pretentious man who her Mother and brother dislike.By coincidence the Emerson's let a house from Lucy's fiance and Lucy is confronted with George. Through a series of events,Lucy finally comes to grips with the feelings she has fought so hard to repress."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"E.M.

I chose to read Forester's A Room With a View. I must say that I was amazed at how quickly I was caught up in the story. I felt as though I myself was a character within the book. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is a wonderful read. Very simple, yet so complex at the same time.

In that case, actual narrative seemed to be missing."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A ROOM WITH A VIEW depicts a young Englishwoman's adventure trying to come to grips with the conflict between her desires and society's expectations. Lucy Honeychurch is a well-bred young middle class girl on holiday in radiant Florence. She comes from a family overconcerned with respectability and is therefore overprotected by a dessicated spinster named Charlotte Bartlett. One wonders if Forster had in mind a more famous Charlotte B. when he drew Lucy's protector, a woman \\"much discomfited by [any] unpleasant scene[s].\\" Forster playfully tosses barbs at this don't-let-the-servants-hear-you world the English try to maintain on foreign soil. Less playful with sanctimonious Puritans or hypocritical clergymen, Forster lets them foil themselves.Under no circumstances will Miss Bartlett allow Lucy to pursue (or even examine) her affection for the handsome young George Emerson--his father is far too unconventional with his modern notions about honesty and freethinking. Duty must reign . . . mustn't it? Ah, that wild transitional phase between the late-Victorians and the early-Moderns!Forster writes gently and calmly, but with a passion for life and love welling up beneath the surface. A ROOM WITH A VIEW is a lovely book, vital with the force of a sensitive and empathetic mind. There's even more to this book than it seems--highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Concerning Lucy's passionate playing of Beethoven upon the piano, the Rev. Mr. Beebe once said, &quot;If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very exciting--both for us and for her.&quot; At the time of the remark, Lucy is a very conventional young woman, with perhaps occasional rebellious thoughts. The Emersons, father and son, are somehow not quite acceptable in her social circle, and though George is so bold as to kiss her impulsively, she is determined to forget him. Instead she finally gives in to the repeated proposals of Cecil Vyse, a thoroughly fashionable young gentleman, if not very exciting. So the stage is set for this splendid satire on the English social strata of the early part of the 20th century, a time when the formal structure of the Victorian era was beginning to fray at the edges. Vyse is a delightfully drawn male chauvinist prig; nobody likes him, but everyone is willing to accept him, and Lucy convinces herself that she is in love with him. However, Vyse's own penchant for getting his way by playing rather cruel practical jokes brings the Emersons back into the picture. Confronted by the contrast between the not quite classy but intelligent, thoughtful (and bold) George Emerson and the arrogant, boorish, but elite Cecil Vyse, Lucy finally decides to live as she plays Beethoven, with exciting results. This early work of Forster's is a pure delight, with a light and well-controlled tone throughout. Although there would be a danger of stereotyping to illustrate the different social classes, Forster skillfully makes the characters well rounded and unpredictable, as in the scene when Lucy breaks her engagement to Vyse, expecting his feelings of masculine superiority to precipitate an argument, but instead being somewhat dismayed when he behaves as a perfect gentleman. Although HOWARDS END is usually rated above A ROOM WITH A VIEW, I prefer this slighter, but consummately well-done, novel."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"This charming little novel which has recently celebrated its centennary can be easily put down as a period piece. E M Forster foresaw it already in his note which he added to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first edition. Yet a prospective reader would be most wrong to disregard it. There is a lesson here which still needs to be learned by many.The title gives away some of the content - the main heroine, Lucy Honeychurch, needs to get away from the stuffy atmosphere of late Victorian England in which she was brought up - the symbol of which is for EMF the room. Her escape takes place in stages - the first of them is her trip to Italy where she finds landscapes and people most different from those she was accustomed to. It is also there that she meets the man she falls in love with, George Emerson. Yet these changes come too quickly for her. Lucy yields to the demands of her chaperone and escapes back to England, finding on the way a more appropriate suitor, Cecil Vyse.When the three young people meet again in England, a fight for Lucy's soul begins anew. Lucy has to decide whether she prefers Cecil who will keep her under his protection in his house as a work of art for others to admire, or George with whom she will have to face the challenges of the world but be free.What is the lesson for us today in a world where there are neither chaperones nor stage-coaches? We also must make similar decisions - choose freedom which always comes at a cost or safety for which we must pay with our soul. We choose between being true to ourselves or satisfying the demands of others. Lucy's adventures may serve as a perfect food for thought for those facing seemingly dissimilar but actually very similar decisions. It is the more valuable as Forster does not show easy decisions or easy solutions. The happy ending never comes free and yet still it is worth striving for."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Best of all, this is one of the very very few books to be made into a movie and come out unscathed, perhaps even improved in certain aspects. If you can't stand to take a chance and read it, see the film at least.Yes, the premise is somewhat similar to Madame Bovary. However, I found the difference between them to be that I hated Mme. Bovary and adored A Room With a View. To clarify, there is a part in the latter where Forster, discussing some sonatas of Bethoveen writes, &quot;they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and Lucy had decided that they should triumph.&quot; Flaubert plays on the side of despair, while Forster, like his character, &quot;loved to play on the side of Victory.&quot;All of the characters are vividly drawn. They speak as real people speak and act as real people act, or once did. The language and mores have changed since the Victorian era, but they are motivated by similar things to those that motivate people today and they are fully-developed.Forster has the knack of describing his characters in a few well-turned sentences that tell you all you need to know to picture them. They get themselves into situations you can believe, and they do not always act in their own best interests, just like real life.I have re-read this book several times over the past 10 years, and what strikes me is how much detail Forster managed to sneak in with out making the book feel weighted or heavy. It is a light read, and yet every time I pick it up to reread it I find some new passage I had overlooked previously, each lovlier than the one before. He also makes some very interesting philosophical statements, without bogging down plot or pacing. Forster was obviously influenced by the Transcendentalists (Emerson, Thoreau), one of the main characters is even named Emerson, so if they are of interest to you, this may be as well."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"While not approaching the magnitude of A Passage to India, or even Howard's End, A Room with a View offers an entertaining enough, if not rare, look at the middle class British (traveler's) life. Consumed with the self-discipline and propriety dictated by the national character and emulation of the upper classes, Lucy Honeychurch finds herself between her stodgy cousin's checks and George Emerson's unconventional, bold, and straightforward sincerity. In the backdrop, just as in Howard's End, is the burgeoning realization of female identity and the possibility of greater freedoms.Forster creates rather familiar characters in the oppressed but promising Lucy, stuffy and financially dependent Charlotte, and traditional, sarcastic snob Cecil, whom Lucy opts to marry after several rejections, in order to avoid confusion about her own future and the doubts the Emersons have introduced. George Emerson, of course, is the modern knight--uncouth and unsmooth--but dangerous and attractive on a visceral level.What makes Room with a View special is not the content--covered territory, or the dialogue--witticisms and comedy of manners, but Forster's special insight into the characters that lets us know eveything they are and everything they can be, without deeply probing the people. It is a respect and dignity he grants his creations that makes them real."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I'm embarrassed to say that I had avoided Forster's work because I had wrongly assumed that, given the time in which he was writing (early 20th century), his fiction would surely be stuffy, dry and dull. I was completely wrong. In fact, this short novel's charm stems from it's casual, leisurely pace and the surprisingly winning chances it takes in terms of style (the chapter titles, Forster's penchant to pause the action and speak directly to the reader).Others have noted disatisfaction with the ending. I partially agree. I think the conclusion does wrap up things a little too neatly. But since this is an early Forster effort, it's understandable that he hadn't quite discovered how to end a novel with a bit more complexity. On the other hand, I cannot help but read A Room With a View through the lens of the classical definition of Comedy (which is the antithesis of Tragedy) where we are given a situation that begins with harmony/order and slowly slips in to crisis/chaos, only to surface in again, in the end, in a state of general cheer. And if one compares A Room With a View to, say, the Comedies of Shakespeare (Much Ado About Nothing, for instance), I think that Forster was very much trying his hand at novelistic Comedy: the foreign setting, a quirky cast of loveable (yet somewhat typecast) characters, chapters that function as Acts, and a somewhat formulaic (yet Classical) plot structure. I heartily recommend this slim wonderful novel."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"What a relief! This was a short, simple, easy read that I truly enjoyed. The young and beautiful Miss Lucy Honeychurch, accompanied by her dear older friend Miss Bartlett, is first introduced to the reader in Florence, just arrived at the pension they will be staying at during the course of their holiday in Italy. The ladies are vexed to find that they have not received rooms with the views they wished for; overhearing them, an elderly man and his son offer to trade rooms with them, for they have rooms with perfect views; and hence the title of the book.This is when Lucy first meets George Emerson, an attractive, if not unconventional, young Englishman. Lucy encounters him again when she witnesses a public murder in the streets, and George attends to her after she faints. This is when his passion for her is first ignited. This inward flame is only stoked more when he and his father are accidentally invited on a daily outing with Lucy and her friends, and George sees Lucy alone in a field full of flowers, beautiful and surrounded by beauty. He cannot help but kiss her, which is entirely un-gentleman-like. Miss Bartlett witnesses George's display of affection, and decides that to keep her young companion's innocence safe from George's intentions, the two of them must leave immediately for Rome, without so much as a goodbye to George or his father, and stay with some family friends, the Vyses.The story opens up again in a quiet, small neighborhood in the country, with Miss Lucy Honeychurch engaged to Cecil Vyse, whom she became better acquainted with in Rome. Then, by mere coincidence--or is it fate?--George Emerson and his father, whom Lucy never expected to see again, reenter into her life, and complicate things. Should Lucy flout convention and follow her heart, which is leading her to George, or will she remain with Cecil, the safe and respectable choice, who she knows can never make her truly happy?Find out for yourself! Forster does a great job of painting with certain clarity and humor the scenes and characters of this story. This classic is a breath of fresh air, and I'm sure that even if you aren't a huge fan of British Literature, you will love it."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"This is one of those rare books made into a film, where the film actually does justice to the story. It is almost as good as the book.. almost. Which means it is a very very fine movie, in my opinion the finest thing that Merchant Ivory ever did.I first read A Room with a View ten years ago when I was hitch hiking across England for the first time. I spent a week there, on 100$, walking and hitching throughout the night, sleeping in parks and fields during the day, waking up periodically to read snatches of the book. It was the perfect traveling companion for that adventure.I fell in love with Lucy (the heroine of the story) - she is hard to describe, a sort of expressive cipher - on the surface she is a somewhat callow, bored teen aged girl.. But as Mr. Beebe the perceptive Parson immediately notices, there is something extraordinary about Miss Honeychurch... There's hidden passion there. And EM Forster is the master at presenting her to us, along with the rest of his subtly drawn cast of characters.Forster thought her intriguing, himself. Forster was a lifelong bachelor, and a closeted homosexual. He usually treats his female characters with a certain dispassionate distance. But Lucy was his favorite of them all, and she stayed with him. In fact, he wrote a short story detailing her later life after the end of the novel.**So, this story, like everything Forster wrote is a comedy of manners focusing on the mores of the early twentieth century English middle class, highlighted against a foreign background. It is witty, philosophically interesting, and rife with good companionship. These characters will inhabit your imagination.If you like Jane Austen, George Eliot, or even stuff like Evylyn Waugh or Oscar Wilde, you will probably enjoy this book.[**The four page sequel is titled \\"A View without a Room,\\" and it was published in 1958 in a private edition, which is now very hard to find. It was reprinted though, in the Penguin Modern Classics edition of a \\"Room with a View,\\" which is where I read it.The text can also apparently be found in the New York Times Book Review of 27th July 1958.]"},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"This elegant little novel totally swept me away. It is so perfect from any angle I look at it. I know that this will be one of those novels I will always keep in a prominent place on my bookshelf and return to my whole life.This exquisite novel primarily concerns Lucy Honeychurch. The novel begins with Lucy on a trip in Italy. She is accompanied there mainly by members of her own society, the upper class of England among which she has been raised. While in Italy, though, Lucy is confronted by the Italian society where she notices the classes seem to mix easily. She is also confronted with George Emerson. George is simple, direct, and of a lower class, and he is having existential worries. Despite themselves (or their pasts), the two begin to fall in love with one another, and their experiences eventually lead to their realizations of what their hearts really desire.As it is with all of my favorite novels, I really cannot do A Room With a View justice with this review. This is a truly lovely book. The prose and the pace is perfect. There are so many sentences which are just perfect little gems by themselves. The characterizations are complex. The plot is romantic and funny. The thought behind the novel is meaningful and life affirming. There's not much more that any novel can do. A Room With a View is perfection."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I listened to \\"A Room with a View\\" by E.M. Forster on audiobook. Written in 1908, it tells the age old story of a girl who has to choose between the socially acceptable and her heart/mind.\\"It is a great opportunity, the possession of leisure.\\"The story starts in Florence, where the naive young Lucy Honeychurch meets the brutally honest George Emerson, and has a brief moment (and I do mean moment, as lovely as it is) of passion with him.\\"The garden of Eden which we say is in the past is yet to come. We shall be equal when we stop despising our bodies.\\"It then continues to the English countryside, where Lucy decides to marry the stodgy Cecil Vyse (him of good snobby stock) but has all her plans upended by George's arrival and ardent engagements.\\"Choose a place where you don't do very much harm and stand there for all you're worth facing the sunshine.\\"The landscape is beautifully laid out, and the language is precise and hilarious, in that way only the English can describe.\\"She gave up trying to understand herself and joined the vast armies of the benighted who followed neither the heart nor the brain and march to their destinies by catchwords.\\"E.M. Forster skewers society and its stuffy hierarchies and mincing debates, and not a bit of is dated, despite the Edwardian era. If you like this sort of thing - clever funny period pieces that resonate in the modern world, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I decided to read this book for the wrong reasons (our upcoming trip to Italy and my incessant need to immerse myself in all things Italian) but by the time I'd finished reading the first page, marveling at the beauty of Forster's writing, I knew I'd found a new addition to my list of Books You Must Read.Our main character, Lucy Honeychurch (what a great name!) is off to Italy with a relative. She meets a man, George Emerson, who startles her, frightens her, with his intensity, and she bolts back to her secure home in England and quickly becomes engaged to a comfortable man. But it is too late for comfort, and when she finds herself unexpectedly meeting up with George again, Lucy must choose between a life and a semblance of a life.Beautiful writing. You will love this book."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal. The plot may be relatively basic, but it's a medium for Forster to convey his message about how important it is to seek real love and connection.Instead of a cast of heroes and villains, Forster gives us a bunch of realistically drawn people. It would have been easy to make Miss Bartlett the butt of every joke or Cecil completely without redeeming qualities - but he doesn't do that. The point of the book isn't to transport you to Italy (in fact, I think he makes the point very well that the social and mental strictures of the characters put them in a sort of bubble that prevented them from authentically experiencing much of anything, no matter where they traveled)."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I'm not sure how a voracious reader like me missed this classic novel, but luckily, my book club picked it and I promptly downloaded the audio (narrator: Wanda McCaddon). I found myself immediately transported to Florence, italy, and completely captivated by the travails of young Lucy Honeychurch. Everything about this book is perfect: the descriptions of Florence and the muddy Arno (where I visited long ago and toured with my then-future husband); the stinging digs at tourists who go abroad only to stay clumped together with others of their same nationality (in my experience, tourists have not improved at all since Forster's time); the characters with their personal foibles, dreams and fears. Even the titles of the chapters are wonderful: \\"In Santa Croce with no Baedeker,\\" \\"Lucy as a Work of Art,\\" \\"Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants.\\" Many times I laughed out loud, often caught my breath at the beauty of particularly beautifully written passages, and constantly ached with longing to be young and in love again. The narrator was wonderful and I found myself wishing the book would never end."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I have re-read this book every couple of years for well over a decade now. Indeed, it does take some work to understand the cultural politics of early 20th century Britain, but it's so worth the effort. Forster's writing crackles with wit all of these years later. Honestly, I've always loved this book because it's a quick read and it's such a delightful little costume drama. Locations and characters are carefully developed and doted upon because the story keeps such a tight focus on Lucy, and the narrative never goes to melodrama. Yes, Merchant and Ivory made an excellent and faithful adaptation of a movie, but what it misses is Forster's omniscient point of view. Only in the book do you get the full insight into the inner mechanics of the characters."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Short and beautiful, a classic Forster. vivid, colorful prose and intriguing characters and the struggles between free mind and societal proprieties, passion and duties... A lovely read."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I don't know which I love more, the movie or the book, but both explore the human spirit in such a way that uplifts the reader--or viewer--and makes you want to live life with gusto. One of my favorite books. Period."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A simple love story about turn of the last century English society and individuals set in Florence, Italy.This classic is well-written, engaging, rich and moving. The conflict between social norms and individual behavior is well illustrated. The characters develop through the chapters, becoming familiar and human, even if they are not all lovable or psychologically deep. The limitations of being too conformist, aspiring or rational are shown. The heroine, Lucy, seeks personal growth through travel, experiences and music. She is unsure of herself as she grows, unsure of where she wants to go or how to get there. Yet, through the simple act of showing up and having a small amount of self-confidence and self-awareness, she does grow and achieve some of her ends. Forster's writing style is appealing and approachable. Both the particular details and the eternal themes resonate a century later. As noted by the critics, the plot is a bit erratic at times and relies upon improbable coincidences to weave the ending. Nonetheless, this is an easy read with several layers of depth and meaning."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I teach literature at the university level. I read E.M. Forster decades ago, and saw many of the films based on his books. (A Room with a View and Howard's End were excellent adaptations.) For some reason, after listening to a panel discussion on the radio about a new Forster biography, I decided to pick up a copy of A Room with A View. I found Forster's writing, in certain places, stiff and archaic (even when taking into account the time period), more so than (a much earlier) Austen's writing, perhaps because he is not quite as witty as she. However, the beauty and passion of the Lucy-George love story, and Forster's powerful philosophy of undying, truthful love that undergirds the story (primarily delivered in short speeches by the elder Mr. Emerson)overrides any twisted or cement-like sentences. Unlike some other readers, I felt terribly sad for and empathized with Cecil Vyse. I do not think he is a bad man; he is simply a different kind of man than George, and Forster makes a point of contrasting the two. However, another type of woman, not Lucy, might have found him quite fine. If you are a hopeless romantic, no matter your age, you will love this novel."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I listened to this on the Communter Library audio version, read by Wanda McCaddon. I didn't find that listed here at Amazon so I'm posting my review here. I did, however, want to give special praise to Ms. McCaddon's reading. I've listened to quite a few audio books and I've found that performance of the reader can add or detract from the words. Ms. McCaddon's readings of the old, the young, male or female are wonderful. I completely forgot that an actress was reading the lines.I had just finished another audio book of Edith Wharton's Age of Innocence. The theme is the same: the choice the protagonist must make between his feelings and his obligation to the social standing of his family. However in my opinion Forster's work is far superior in the sense of its quiet, subtle, gentle tone and its wisdom. He doesn't hit you over the head with the details of the social inequalities that poor Ms. Wharton did. She was certainly justified, given her personal experience but she loads you with so much verbiage that I found it much less interesting than this book.These characters are well rounded, not just stock types, as Wharton's were. Lucy appears to be a rather ordinary young girl but we see, through the perceptive comments of Mr. Beebe, that there are depths in her of which she is unaware. I appreciated Forster's portrayal of the rector, Mr. Beebe, avoiding all of the stereotypes of the English clergy of the time that one would easily fall into. Her mother, her cousin, Charlotte, and the amazing Emersons are all real people, with their faults as well as their virtues.There is so much wisdom, inserted in quiet ways in this little story that at times I wanted to pull my car over and write down a sentence. One of the gems that I did remember was Forster's remark that although Lucy's dilemma seemed to be a choice between personal feelings and the dictates of society, that it was really between reality and illusion! I had just this thought when I was listening to Wharton's book and was so happy to hear Forster articulate it.There is a lot of light hearted humor in the book, too. I loved the scene of the three fellows bathing in the pond. And the scene where George Emerson finds Lucy in the field of violets is amazing! No wonder he was gripped with passion...who could resist all those violets on a hillside in Florence?I'm sure I'm missing some of the othere virtues of this unpretentious but wise little book.

The story itself involves several generations and portrays the contrast between two main cultures and lifestyles; one in the West, that is Britain, the other one in the south laid-back Mediterranean Europe, namely, Italy. The protagonist, a young lady, searches new experiences and heads for an adventure, whereas her older companions strive to make her think before she leaps, speak wisely and counsel her. So far, it looks as if their life is as it should be. However, things are not always as they seem at firts. The narrative takes some twists and turns and eventually the so-called generation gap starts to diminish, while the moral values are more or less reevaluated. Whether there is a happy end, you should look forward to finding out for yourselves!

The subtle love that George first expresses towards Lucy after holding her head in his lap after she faints was powerful. All he did was hold her, but the strong and foreign love he has for her can be felt.When they go out to the country with a few other friends, you can feel how nervous George was, not even talking to anyone and just fidgiting, avoiding Lucy's brillant eyes.The story then climaxes when he just strolls up to Lucy in a field of tall weeds and kisses her.

Forster's &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is a romantic comedy, and as such, it follows the typical formula of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl. This basic plot is, of course, embellished with a lot of comical characters, exotic settings, and convenient misunderstandings, but none of this mollifies my opinion that the novel, although well-written, is not very interesting.Two fussy English women, the nubile Lucy Honeychurch and her older cousin Charlotte Bartlett, are staying in a small hotel (a pension) in Florence, Italy. There they meet the Emersons, a father and son, who do not seem to have much money and are hinted to be &quot;Socialists,&quot; which reflects a prejudice on the part of the allegers and doesn't even really mean anything within the novel's scope. Lucy has a brief romance with the son, George, even though she knows he is not quite suitable for her social status. A few other characters also are introduced in Florence, including two clergymen, Mr. Beebe and Mr. Eager, and a romance novelist named Miss Lavish.The action shifts back to England, where we meet Lucy's doting mother and frivolous, immature brother Freddy, who could be a progenitor for P.G. Wodehouse's aristocratic loafers. Lucy is courted by a snobbish young man named Cecil Vyse whom she has known for a few years and accepts his proposal for marriage. Trouble arises when George Emerson and his father show up as tenants in a nearby cottage, and Lucy must decide whether she is going to submit to social convention and marry Cecil or follow her heart and go with George. Care to take a wild guess about the outcome?Forster obviously intended this novel to be a comedy, but his humor is stilted and contrived. There are subtle jokes about English class distinction, blatantly symbolic surnames that sound like they came from the board game &quot;Clue,&quot; juxtaposed sentences that purposely contradict each other for the sake of painfully overt irony, and satirical snippets that affect Oscar Wilde-style wittiness. The novel's humoristic tour de force is a scene in which Cecil remains oblivious to the fact that Lucy and George had a fling in Italy, even though he reads a direct account of it in a novel penned by Miss Lavish, who fortunately has disguised the names of her hero and heroine. Simply put, the book is as funny as burnt toast.Colorful but predictable and simplistic, &quot;A Room with a View&quot; may have been an important Edwardian novel, but it seems innocuous compared to the hard realism and bold sexuality of D.H. Lawrence's imminent works. Even the author himself acknowledges the novel's fabrications when he allows Mr. Beebe to state, &quot;It is odd how we of that Pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one another's lives.&quot; Funny, I was thinking the same thing."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A rich and scandalous story of a young woman who falls in love with a solemn, clumsy sort of man in his arms, literally.Oddly enough I don't see any hype in this book, which is the best thing, no hype."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Though a romantic story with good character development and scene painting, it can be difficult to enjoy if the main character is inconsistent throughout. Lucy admires George, but commits to marry Cecil. She rejects Cecil because she adopts George's assessment of Cecil's character. She will not marry George the Truthful because he does not fit Cecil's standard of propriety (though the author does not quite tell us that). She is indecisive and is making everyone miserable, when finally some odd man with absurd philosophies pushes her to make a decision which, our author tries to convince us, was the correct one. Here is the message: It is perfectly fine to lie to everyone. After you have dodged them, hurt them, and confused them, \\"it will all come right in the end\\" and you will live happily ever after. The message appeals well to an age of utter selfishness. Our heroine shows some sign of repentance: He will never forgive us. But she immediately takes it back: I mean, he will never be interested in us again. But the selfish character wins and the reader is to applaud her \\"courage.\\""},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A Room with A View is a romantic book, which teaches more than one important lesson of life. Lucy teaches the reader many great morals through her battling of society's expectations. We also see these morals being taught with her struggle to find what she really wants. Throughout the book, we see Lucy start to develop a sense of independence and passion by following her heart. I think E.M. Forster does a great job of reflecting the 18th century in this book. Through Lucy he portrayed a woman's strength and a woman's changing role in society. This was also happening at the time in the 18th century to many other women. In this novel, social class is a huge factor in teaching us not to be judgmental or obey the unfair rules of society.This novel teaches us to think for ourselves just as Lucy did. Lucy meets a man of lower rank than she was. His name is George Emerson. He teaches her the things in life that are important such as her musical talents. He shows her the truth, and passion that she soon with discover. Nature is also conveyed widely in this book. Forster does a great job of connecting man and nature showing how they affect each other. Forster teaches us the lesson that man cannot be taken from his natural state. When the novel ends, we see how man and nature are all tied together. With the help of many people and by traveling to Italy, Lucy finally grows into a strong woman. She is now passionate, independent, and aware of what she wants. This book takes the reader through the adventure of a young woman's struggle with her heart, and with the society."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A very chatty book with little description and almost all dialog. I found it difficult to maintain momentum through the rivers of Victorian mores on exhibit in this book. In sum, I found it dull and not enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Do not buy this version. It is not formatted correctly for the Kindle. It has fixed line lengths which wrap awkwardly on the Kindle, making it very difficult to read."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"E.M.Forster is a semi-classical English writer, who produced numerous novels set in the early 20th century. Later, film director James Ivory (an American, strange as it may seem) made a career for himself by turning these books into movies. &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is what you could have called &quot;Proletarian literature&quot; in Soviet literary canon; only working-class setting is replaced by the British &quot;proper&quot; society, still unscathed by the Great War. I have a thing for this epoch, but Forster's book does not reflect its charm in the least. All because of its social message. No gripping plot, no character development, no psychological motivations. The only really enthralling thing is to observe to what degree did the English train their language to conceal feelings. It is what makes the books like Forster's or Ishiguro's &quot;Remains of the Day&quot; almost untranslatable. In Forster's case, though, no harm done."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I hate to be the one to write a bad review about this book, however I feel there is a lot of hype surrounding this classic that is not deserved. The plot is fairly simple, and very similar to that of Romeo and Juliet. The girl loves a rogue, but her parents want her to marry the spectacular man they like. Etc. Some scenes in this Edwardian book I agree or slightly amusing, but it is not worth the read."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"It is difficult to imagine a girl in the 21st century over-reacting to a rather innocent kiss, as is the case with the inciting event here. But this is exactly the situation a century ago with a girl from a respectable English family. And this is what makes the novel difficult to grasp for readers of our present day.Not all that much happens. There's the kiss and then a whole lot of agonizing over it, trying to hide news of it, pretending that it wasn't meaningful, to the point that the poor girl's life is in turmoil, her engagement to another is broken.The characters are wispy--we never quite see clear pictures of them. The dialogue is stilted by current standards. (Did people ever really talk that way?) The atmosphere of Florence, Italy, and semi-rural England is also a trifle wispy; the reader never quite feels as if he has benn taken along for the trip.There are great many annoying editorial intrusions in order to puff up this lame plot, and most of the actions are internal. I'm not saying that an explosion or a car chase would have been necessary, but something more might have happened. There is a murder, but it is of no consequence. All in all, I'd say the novel is just a tad over-rated. I believe it was Mark Twain who said that a classic was a book that people praised and no one read. Few people voluntarily, rather, in this case."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A Room With a View is hardly what you could consider fine, classic literature. The plot runs off of a much more dramatic and insightful classic, Flaubert's Madame Bovary. The stories are the same: a woman, dissatisfied with her station in life, seeks happiness in an unorthodox way (namely a man) that entirely displeases her relatives and friends. The only difference is that Flaubert gives his heroine a realistically tragic end, while Forster opts for the happy, fairytale finale.It is this unoriginality, lack of plot depth, and dialogue reminiscent of a Hans Christian Anderson story that makes A Room With a View dissatisfying. Forster obviously felt the need to contribute a story that, with its tiresome protagonists and only somewhat interesting antagonists, would teach future writers one thing: change a famous writer's denouement around and you can gain all the fame and merit you could want off one piece of literature.Holly Burke, PhD.Georgetown U."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"If you like Dirty Harry, Terminator or Rocky, don't read this book!!!

Its not often that the film is as good as the book, but in this it was, so faithfully adapted. When I got the book after seeing the film, I felt I was seeing the film again while reading, the film was sooo faithful to all the key plot and character points in the book and many of the minor ones too. Whether you've seen the film or not, definitely read the book as well. There are one or two typos but its very readable. This is one of my favorite romantic novels, and whats so great about it is that its not a stereotypical \\"romance novel\\", its for guys as well. Read it."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A Room With A View is a novel not only about the journey to find true love, but also about the difficult decisions one is faced with when one must decide to either listen to the expectations of others, or their own heart. In this novel the main character, Lucy takes a trip to Italy with her cousin, and upon her arrival meets the Emerson's. Lucy belonging to the upper class of society thinks she could never have an attraction to someone of the lower class, like the Emerson's. Love was something Lucy was hoping to find in Italy, but as soon as she arrived back to her home in England she promptly became engaged to Cecil, a man of the same social class as her. Lucy soon realizes that she is not truly in love with Cecil, and discovers that she is in love with George Emerson. Everyone Lucy knows expects her to marry someone wealthy and proper, like Cecil, but instead of listening to what others expect of her, Lucy listens to her heart, and allows herself to be in love with George. Throughout Lucy's journey to find true love Forster conveys the message that others expectations cannot guide one to the path of love, only one's heart can. I recommend this book to anyone who struggles when faced with making the decision of following others expectations, or following their heart. This novel will teach its readers that what one truly desires is the only escape to genuine happiness."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Forster's social satire is both poignant and whimsical - a pleasure to read.

You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"This is the first E.M. Forester book I've read and it affected me greatly. When I write 'reviews', I don't mean to give a traditional book review, but to note how the book affected my real life.This is how: One of the characters, Cecil, is a bit of a snob and looks down on the common homey interests of his betrothed's family. He is good with books,art, ideas and 'things', but when he interacts with real people, his personality 'kills' any chance of having an intimate relationship and thus, his life is one of ideas rather than people.How fiction unwraps itself and reveals itself to be true! This was looking into a mirror for me. What my friends won't tell me, a good novel will! Doing well with \\"books, ideas and things\\" is not the epicenter of living, says Forester, but the nitty gritty give and take of affectionate living is where life's eruption takes place. Art and ideas and books, although glorious, arise from this center, not vice versa. First comes the flesh, then the idea.Thus this 'old' book, written over 100 years ago, performs the magic of all good literature: it makes me act and think differently. I now, attempt to(!), treat the person who stands before me, not as an idea, but as another real, carbon-based life form!\\"A Room With A View\\" tells the often told story of a young person learning to stand in her own place rather than where society demands she stand, yet Forester's characters are so complete that this old story is like a skeleton that is dressed up in finery and begins to walk! I fell in love with the characters and recognized myself in all of them; yes, even in the old biddy Charlotte, who, as it turns out, wasn't so old fashioned and possibly was the master puppeteer."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I've often heard complaints about classic novel's transition into digital format, but in the case of A Room with a View, there should be no complaints. I've read this novel both in print and digital forms and can say that the reading experience was not lessened on my Kindle than my old print copy. For anyone interested in reading a truely classic piece of literature, I recommend trying this book. I find it to be a funny piece of fiction with realistic characters to the time period. As a free digital copy you have nothing to lose."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"At 36, I finally discovered the Edwardian, Bildungsroman romance that every woman I know apparently read several times when they were 17 & 18 years old. It is sweet and transcendental. Forster's generally upbeat take on propriety and class differences makes this probably his most loved and most approachable novel. His characters are symbols, but also very real and very transformative. heroine Lucy is often muddled, and her antithesis (and for for much of the novel her fiance) Cecil isn't just a static foil, but ends up being fairly dynamic.One of my favorite quotes from the novel is, spoken by George (I believe):\\"There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain amount of light,\\" he continued in measured tones. \\"We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to place to save things; because the shadow always follows. Choose a place where you won't do harm--yes, choose a place where you won't do very much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.\\"Reading the novel makes me appreciate the fine job done by theMerchant & Ivory adaption(from 15 years ago) even more."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"This has always been one of my favourite novels, simply a joy to read. I've read all of Forster's books and in my opinion this is his best. Quite funny: who can't help but laugh at lines like: \\"Then never- never- never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.\\" And the characters are priceless- Lucy, George, poor Cecil- and the entire theme is just so fresh... Wonderful novel."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"This book, written in 1908, is enwrapped with the then-stereotypical clash of the British castes. In this book, a young British Brahman woman, Lucy Honeychurch, must decide whether to marry wealthy Cecil Vyse or follow her heart after the young and buff, but socially crass (to them but not to us 21st century Americans), George Emerson.Cecil dislikes most everyone, because they are not as gifted or talented as he. And, George - as well as his father Mr. Emerson - ignore the innuendo and scofflaw-like attitudes thrown in their direction by Cecil and people with whom he associates. In fact, when discovering Lucy's engagement to Cecil, George flatly (and out of character) responds, \\"You cannot live with Vyse. . . He should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.\\" This sentence is so out of context with his character's dialogue throughout the remainder of the book. But, perhaps more true to the character, it describes his emotions about Lucy and his main competitor for her heart.Lucy is torn between two lovers. She is in what Mr. Emerson describes to be in a \\"muddle.\\" Much of the muddle has been exaggerated by her meddling spinster cousin, Charlotte, and Charlotte's poor choice of a friend, Eleanor Lavish. But, to her credit, she thinks the situation through, and makes a decision which she enjoys, but which most around her do not understand.Forster's dialogue reminds me greatly of Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf, or either Austen. The prim respectability often reads constrained when emotions of anger or hatred are expressed. But, the richness of the dialogue and depth of insight for the main characters are masterfully done. That is why this novel still is read today and will be for years."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I found this book as a young pre-teen. My mother handed me a dog-eared copy she had owned since her teens so I would leave her alone during a very long sea-side summer holiday. As a summer novel, it is still one of my favourites.Despite what many of my fellow reviewers have said, I found the character development redeemed many of the characters you may not have liked too much in the beginning. Lucy's growth especially is quite real. Very much something we all end up having to go through in one respect or another as we try to survive our teens. Only her struggle is made all the more aggrivating by all the unwritten rules of Edwardian Society and the meddling relations and aquaintances Forster seems to find an evil glee in throwing in her path.Lucy is a girl caught midway between the tantrums of childhood and expected decorum of adulthood. Through the novel she stumbles her way through all the pit-falls her station and ever-so-proper upbringing keep throwing in her way as she tries to deal with falling in love with a middle-class Bohemian [good heavens]. She starts very much as a young girl still learning the \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" way to do things and through the novel somehow find her way past all the expectations of her mother, her fiance, and society in general to become a woman who takes her fate into her own hands and dares to say \\"But I want THIS!\\"It's the pitfalls and meddlings of the other characters that makes this story a treat. Everyone has an opinion and everyone gets in the way. Forster many times seems to be making fun of his characters, pointing our their absuridites with the turn of a phrase, but in the end it leaves you only with a feeling of affection for the whole lot of them.The writing is many times very tongue in cheek and you can't help but smile at the way Forster turns a phase. The chapter names especially keep the tone of the novel light, even when things begin to look as though George and Lucy will never get together.The copy that I read as a child also happened to contain a short article that Forster wrote many year after the fact as an Epilogue called \\"A View Without a Room\\" that let you know what he saw his characters doing with their lives over the next twenty years after the book ends.

In their merging, at the end, only then did they feel a sense of completeness and wholeness. Their obstacles in getting there were amusing and cathartic all at the same time. From the moment that Lucy witnessed the death of the Italian, life wasn't the same; the death signified a death within herself, and only through a love as deep as she had for George would she be able to understand the concept that love and death are very close together in feeling - the type of love that comes but once in a lifetime.

Forster's &quot;A Room with a View&quot; can certainly be taken as little else than a charming and amusing Eduardian love story. But to do so is to belittle the true grace and beauty of this stunning piece of literature. Like so many of Forster's works (indeed, like so many of his contemporaries), &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is about grappling with the infinite in a world so seemingly, &quot;flat, stale and unprofitable.&quot; Through the medium of a story, Forster brings to light the heroine's own internal struggle from childishness, to mindless conformity (&quot;the ranks of the benighted&quot;), to a sort of &quot;awakening.&quot; In short, Lucy Honeychurch's own journey is parallel to the historical changes in mindset that have formed our modern restless society. The book is rife with meaning and symbol, found in action as well as chapter titles. The language is beautiful, the characters charmingly (and sometimes sardonically) drawn, and the sense of place outstanding. &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is an excellent starting place for those interested in reading the works of Forster, both because of its brevity and also because of its historical youthfulness (his first novel). Although I felt the ending lacked in explanatory action, and I was not wholly satisfied with its philosophical conclusion, &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is doubtless an excellent piece of literature that works on several levels. Lovers and scholars of the various liberal arts would do very well to read this, as well as lovers of Eduardian and modern British novels."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Forster has a knack for making the ordinary extraordinary.

Lucy and her cousin Charlotte are offered rooms with a view of Florence, Italy by Mr. Emerson and his son, who are willing to exchange for them. The strict and drained Miss Bartlett does not wish to have an obligation to the Emersons, who are deemed less than polite society will condone. Their rector, Mr. Beebe, tells them he believes the exchange is proper and the ladies get their view of Florence. It becomes clear that Lucy herself wants a view of life and later confesses to her fianc&eacute;, a priggish intellectual, that she imagines him always in a room with no windows, with no view. The novel's love story is compelling, but the secondary themes of class and society structures are equally strong, with the truly noble characters emerging in the end with great strength.A Room with a View has everything a reader could ask for. Not only does it contain a beautiful and romantic love story that will capture your heart, but it contains the most simplistic comic relief, that it forms the perfect balance. Just as the story starts to get involved in deep romance, Foster will roll in a statement that will lighten the whole picture, and leave the mind simply happy.Foster writes in a way so calm and gentle that you want to fall in love with the book itself. He makes every word seem like it has such a great importance, that without it, the story will fall apart. One can tell this novel was written with a passion for life and love and with the force of a sensitive and empathetic mind.However, this gentleness leads to an extremely slow moving plot that sometimes winds up dragging along the reader. At some points, I found myself getting swallowed by the words and not really fully digesting them the first time. The key to aptly appreciate this novel is to have patience, knowing that the conclusion is well worth pacing the plot.Foster also created such a basic and easy plot that some chapters seemed to drag on until the idea was pulled through. Nevertheless, since there was not a complicated plot scheme to follow, the reader was able to concentrate on the language and characters illustrated in the novel. This way, it was also so easy to make yourself a character in the book and put your feet right in the room or scene to get the full effect of the atmosphere.Another aspect that was interesting to follow along with is how the novel conveyed very differently each level of society was looked at and thought of. Even though these thoughts on society may not have been the primary theme, they were definitely prominent throughout the novel. The lesson that can be learned from this aspect of the novel is that the entrenched morals of society should be thrown away in favor of passion and the natural instinct.The greatest fallback would have to be the British language used by Foster. I am not a big reader of British literature and I found the wording at little times to be a slight bit clumsy and awkward to follow. Although this stood in the way of the greater aspects of Foster's novel, it was definitely not a reason I would give for not recommending this astounding novel.This would have to be one of the greatest novels I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Anyone who believes they have the patience to appreciate this accomplished writer's work, will be utterly satisfied. The book is at every facet entertaining, no matter what genre of novels you're partial to."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I guess I am not a fan of Forster. I didn't too much care for \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\\" and this second try was no better. He shoots for social commentary and hits it, obliquely, but his characters are flat and so not elicit sympathy. Worse, his Italy, so much a part of the book, is generic and without character.It is not the sympathetic and even sappy story, or the stilted behavior of the English gentry I dislike. I am a fan of Austen and the Bronte's. I think that it is Forster's treatment of the material and characters."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"This book can be read on different levels; eg. simply as a love story, on a deeper level as a study of the &quot;muddle&quot; of life or the struggle in to maturity etc. I found it amusing (during the talks given by author to reader), well written with many descriptive images of Florence etc., and romantic. Forster manages to give the reader the feeling that they are looking in to these character's lives without their knowledge (perhaps even as if you are looking upon them from a &quot;room with a view&quot;) and you feel very involved in the story despite the third person perspective (lapsing in to occansions with the author speaking directly to readers). Forster originally wished to make this a tragedy; I feel we need some hope now and then, that life is not always tragic and this book might give you some. I recommend it to any romantics."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"British writer Forster writes a romantic love story which takes place in England at the turn of the century. Young Lucy, is engaged to Cecil, a man of her class and social level. However, her views of the world changes drastically when she takes a trip to Florence, Italy and meets George.George and his father are rumored to be socialists and free thinkers. They quickly prove they have a tongue. George and Lucy have many interactions. First, they exchange rooms on account that Lucy's view is not what she wanted. He also helps her home after Lucy sees a bloody fight in the town's square. They also take an excursion to see a beautiful valley, where George makes his intentions known that he appreciates Lucy.When Lucy returns to England, George once again is put in her midst. With George's influence, Lucy begins to see that Cecil is stifling her. Challenging her Victorian principles, she must decide between the free willed George or the controlling Cecil.I enjoyed the book a great deal. It reminded me of a British version of a Sinclair Lewis novel where Lucy must challenge her societal roles. There is also a hint of women's liberation in the book as well. The idea is similar to Lewis's &quot;Main Street&quot;. However, I did find the book challenging to read; I am not a big reader of British literature and I found the wording a little clumsy and hard to follow. None the less, it was a good read and the ideas that Forster conveyed make this one a classic piece of British literature."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Interesting, very interesting. But not on first read. Yep, like everyone else here, I read this book as part of an English literature course. And, the first time I read it, I felt like setting fire to the damn thing. But, like the Velvet Underground, if you force yourself to take this in repeatedly, you eventually fall in love with it. The story itself is so basic, so obvious, a standardised Romeo and Juliet fantasy, but the language, social commentary, and at times plain flippantry of Forster's writing just infiltrate your mind like a brain tumour. Call Forster Coupland in a chastity belt. Touching, life-affirming, and, in a twist for books you study at school, some characters you care about. The sexually frustrated Mr Beebe, the hateworthy Cecil, and the greatly underrated Miss Bartlett. If you've ever been in love, and something's gone wrong, then this book was written for you."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Old-as-time plot line (young woman growing up and going against convention) is livened somewhat by Forster's interesting heroine, Lucy.

I found this book a fine mix of period portrayal and timeless observation (a characteristic, I suppose, of all good art), and after finishing it, one of my biggest reactions was to be grateful that I wasn't living in the choking society of Victorian England. The acuteness of the author's evaluation of human relationships reminded me his literary forebear, Jane Austen, yet with a keener, more biting edge. Our contemporary culture surely has its problems, but A Room with a View will give you perspective--with many artfully-turned phrases along the way."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"This charming little novel which has recently celebrated its centennary can be easily put down as a period piece.

It is also there that she meets the man she falls in love with, George Emerson. Yet these changes come too quickly for her.

In other words, it's about Lucy learning how to make decisions for herself, and learning what she truly wants out of life.The book is full of delightful characters and beautiful passages. Yet, Forster isn't above seeing the humor in life, and many characters are quite amusing, and the chapter with the pond is probably one of my favorites!I was surprised, a little, by the ending, but in looking back I can see where it fits.

However, most of this author's fiction was completed in the first 20 years of the 20th century. \\"A Room With a View\\" is a gently satirical view of the English abroad and at home in the late Edwardian Age. Perhaps we can view England as the cozy room of normality and routine while the sunny Italian landscape provides us a view of a wider world outside our usual gaze.The short novel is divided into two parts. In part one we are introduced to a group of English travelers in Italy. We meet Charlottean old maid aunt who is chaperoning the upper middle class young lady the fetching Lucy Honeychurch. (Charlotte reminds one of the governess types described with right on accuracy by Charlotte Bronte). The women want a good view of Florence so reluctantly switch rooms with Mr. Emerson (a dreamy transcendentalist like older man who reminds us of the philisophical musings of Concord sage Ralph Waldo Emerson) and his stra handsome son George. (George is to become a knight saving Lucy from the clutches of the effete snob aesthete Cyril Vise). On a sightseeing picnic Lucy and George kiss and then depart. Lucy goes to Rome meeting her future fiance the artistic and bookish Cyril.Part II is set in England. After several complications the course of true love is finally set on its right course. Lucy jilts Cyril and finds true bliss with George. The novel is cyclicalbeginning in spring and ending with Lucy Honeychurch's honeymoon with George. This occurs in the same Florentine hotel in which they met. A year has passed and it is spring again for these young lovers.Forster provides a gallery of colorful characters: Mr Beebe the clergyman who hopes Lucy dumps Cyril for George; Eleanor Lavish a comically drawn mystery writer; Lucy's brother Fred and a Cockney hotel owner in Florence.Forster wishes to open the stuffy door of Victorian fiction with a new frankness on sexuality and freedom of expression. His scene in which the major male characters bathe in a pond is an example of this theme. Forster favors physical and intimate love to the aesthetic passionless p love which Vise has for Lucy. George is athletic and earthy while Vise is a nerdy bookworm. Forster's book is good in the use of witty dialogue. His understanding of the British class system leads him to satirical comments on its rigidity.A quibble. The characters don't have much depth seeming to be actors in a stage presentation. Forster is worth reading for his advocacy of true love and emotion in a society of elaborate and often hypocritcal rules. He is a good author worthy of your time."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A Room with a View is a delightful novel by E.M. Forster. Is is a bit of a romance and was probably realistic fiction in the time period in which it was written. The main character is a young lady named Lucy. Lucy and her cousin Charlotte have traveled to Italy, and they meet a lot of interesting characters in their hotel. The Emersons are a middle-class father and son who offer to give up their rooms to the ladies because the rooms have wonderful views. Lucy learns a lot in Italy about herself and upon returning home becomes engaged to Cecil Vyse. The Emersons and Cecil have dramatic effects upon Lucy's life after she returns home. She discovers conflicting love within her life, and she learns that home is a lot less perfect than she had always pictured it to be. Lucy observes that \\". . . even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never talked about-religion-was fading like all other things.\\" Lucy struggles to find out who she is, what she wants, and if the rules of society are to be followed in all aspects of her own life. Lucy finally discovers her beliefs and decides whether or not to follow the trends and manners of society.I would rate this book relatively highly. It is only two hundred and thirty pages long, but the language is difficult. It is a good book because the reader can relate to the characters and because it is a romance, which most girls like to read. However, there is quite a bit of philosophy, which makes it hard to understand and it is written in the language style of the nineteenth century. I had to read some of the paragraphs multiple times to grasp their meaning. Wrestling with the language is a good vocabulary and thinking exercise, however. A Room with a View is a good novel to read, but the language makes it a lengthy and difficult book to understand."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A timeless classic, written in 1908. All through this book, I saw the movie. How perfectly they matched! Dialogue was almost word for word. Much better match than \\"Howard's End\\", because that was a better book, with far more depth that couldn't translate to the screen. But this one did, and perfectly. Most of it lies on the casting. Whoever did that deserves most of the credit. How this book would read if I hadn't already known the outcome, I am curious to know, but I never shall, of course. Still an enjoyable read, especially being able to visualize all the characters. You can see the beginnings of all the wisdom that comes forth in \\"Howard's End\\" and culminates in \\"A Passage to India\\". This one is very romantic and Forster here first puts in his feelings about music, so vividly evoked in the first chapter of \\"Howard\\"s End\\"."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I LOVE this novel and the Merchant Ivory film of the same name, which I would give 10 stars! The film, by the way, is very faithful to the book. Anyway, I was extremely delighted by this story when I first read it long ago after seeing the film, and my impression of it has not changed with time. This is a parody of prim and proper English society, something the author E. M. Forster specialized in. For a novel written in 1907, this is an extremely easy read, nothing like a Henry James novel.The plot concerns a young woman named Lucy who goes to Italy on holiday chaperoned by her older spinster cousin, Charlotte. Lucy meets a handsome young guy named George, but he seems a bit odd and eccentric, and she doesn't quite know what to think of him. He takes her by surprise by walking up to her and kissing her in a secluded open field. Charlotte happens to see this and is determined not to let it go any further. You see, Lucy is already engaged to a snobby twit named Sistel back in England! But in the end, Lucy follows her heart.Ah man, I just love this story. See the movie and then read the book.David Rehakauthor of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;"},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"If you are the one who loves reading love story, this book is an interesting one. It gives a clear picture of middle-class life in England one hundred years ago. You will see the importance that was given to social position and appropriated behaviour. Moreover,its grammas are good. It appropriate for children who want to practise their gramma. This book is about the girl who struggle to make sense of her feelings towards the two very different men in her life.Let's find out what she is going to do with her life."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A Room with a View revolves around a young woman, Lucy Honeychurch, who lives in England. The story is about the daily life of Lucy and her family and the few adventures Lucy partakes in, some with acquaintances which she meets on a few month excursion. She takes a trip to Florence, Italy to discover a cultural world outside of England, but instead, discovers a new side of her self that, when she returns home, she misses and finds herself wanting to revisit. Lucy encounters many new things and unorthodox people in Italy whom she tries to understand and finds she cannot. A startling romantic incident during her trip causes Lucy to become puzzled and contemplative. When she returns home, she is immediately engaged to a family friend, Cecil Vyse, who is a young man who disapproves of her family yet seems to think she is quite appealing. Soon, though, some individuals, out of complete chance, come to live on Summer Street, near her home, and soon the enigmatic emotions she experienced on her summer vacation are back to haunt her. Lucy has a choice to make which consumes her and makes her seem very troubled to her family. A Room with a View is considering a comedy because it's numerous satirical suggestions towards society and it's quirky, but well developed, characters. It is a short, refreshing read which has an easy-to-follow plot, and yet incorporates philosophical and symbolic views of the lives of the characters. Many people can enjoy this novella, and even might find the author's expansive and comedic vocabulary entertaining."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Wonderful book, wonderful movie, wonderful book-on-tape.This classic by E. M. Forster is full of wicked humor that punctures the 19th century English class system. Superb cameo pieces. The character development is subtle and sure, beginning with our heroine traveling to Italy with her maiden aunt as chaperone. There, in a pensione, she meets an iconoclastic father and son, honest, rough-hewn, plain-spoken, who insist upon trading rooms when they overhear the prim aunt complaining that she booked a room with a view. It, of course, becomes a metaphor for room to view life as a whole, without prejudice, in all its wonderful complexity.Don't miss this excellent book by this excellent author. Then read all his others, if you haven't already done so."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"This short novel by Forster exposes the confusion (or what some might term 'hypocrisy') of Victorian society in turn-of-the century England.The story displays countless instances of the oppressive strictures of Victorian society. Lucia's companion becomes flustered when offered the kindness of a better room (with a view)- as the offer comes from persons of a lower caste. This offer is met not with gratitude, but with befuddlement (what is one to do in this situation?), and Miss Bartlett (?) affects indignation, recognizing this to be the proper 'feeling' when put upon by the presumptuous lower bourgeoisie. Further offense is given by Mr. Vyse's practical joke: the letting of a property to a lower class of people amidst the elite. Adn the most tragic bewilderment is Lucia's refusal to recognize her love for George: this sentiment being improper, she laboriously attempts to come up with another name for this sentiment, or to identify and name a passion that a lower caste could properly induce in her. The roles that the charcters force themselves into are humorous at times; and the temper of the times induces more pity than outrage."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"A Room with a View is what a romantic novel should be: light and fun, entertaining and sweet- I thoroughly enjoyed reading it!

As for those of you who gave this wonderful book a poor review you must be young and/or you are an avid reader of literary geniuses such as Danielle Steele. Watch some more TV you people and stay aware from criticising great books you did not understand!"},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I think the book is totally great. It's about love that can't be ignored or stopped and it has a happy ending. I think that one of the things the author tries to say with this book is that you sometimes should do what your feelings tell you to do. Just because a thing has been considered right or wrong for a long time, doesn't always mean that it actually is.The main character, a young English girl, has a hard time trying to figure out what she really feels inside. She loves but she is not sure if it is right of her to do so. The old English thoughts and beliefs influence her very much, but when she manages to get rid of a few of them, she shows her feelings more openly and is not ashamed of them.I think this book is just as good as the old English classics, a well-written, overwhelming love-story"},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"I didn't like this book. Short, written as gorgeously as anything else Forster wrote, there just isn't anything worthwhile going on.A comedy only because you laugh at how annoying everyone is, the story verges on outrage because nobody seems to matter. Oh, sure, they care desperately about everyone and everything they're supposed to be involved with, but the characters are pompous, the resolutions are forced or indifferent, and I can't say I recall much of anything that actually happened shortly after completing the text.Another thing to draw it down is the fact that I tended to think of other things while still reading this book. Not while it was set aside, waiting to be vaguely experienced, but while it was in front of my eyes going on.In spite of all this, three stars is accurate because sometimes Forster comes up with an accute anatomization of why these people act this way. A stirring, psychological portrait of people I couldn't care less about."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Never has such a book been written that combines with such artistry the romance and charm of Florence with the passionate love of two idealised and idealistic yet incredibly indeering charcters.

But you unless you are interest in social studies or the antrophological development of romance, you will find most of the situations downright silly. Maybe what particularly bothered me was that the writter did not make any significant effort to provide clues of why the characters fall in love. Actually, their attraction seems to be a mere infatution of inmature personalities, presented to the reader as a great romance."},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"Britain's answer to Henry James here provides us with the tale of Lucy Honeychurch and her forbidden love for George Emerson, the unsuitable young man she meets in Italy. While social mores dictate that she make a match with the more proper gentleman, Cecil Vyse, who is courting her, Lucy is torn between passion and propriety. Ultimately, she chooses Emerson who reminds her of &quot;a room with a view&quot; offering her a new vista on life.This is a comedy of manners, as we can see from the subtlety of characters names: Vyse represents the constricted vice-like society, Emerson is &quot;nature&quot; a la Ralph Waldo &amp; Thoureau. And, of course, the lesson we learn is that the entrenched morals of society should be thrown away in favor of passion &amp; the natural. This common theme of the top 100--we've seen it in Edith Wharton, &amp; others--seems even more moronic as we close the century, the elevation of passion over morality has never looked worse than in the wake of the Clinton scandals. Further, as we now know, this admonition must be read in light of Forster's own homosexuality, adding an altogether different cast to the call for discarding social convention.If you feel compelled to read Forster, I advise sticking to A Passage to India.GRADE: D"},{"Title":"A Room With a View","review":"It is okay.

Max's smuggling operation got the kid's brother into the UK but the brother's disappeared and the kid's frantic to find him.And anyway, Fran thinks there's something very fishy about the trendy pizzeria where she works. Could it be somehow part of a larger organization that's up to nothing good? Enter the spunky blonde widow of a seedy PI who was murdered in one of Fran's previous adventures, dead set on getting Fran involved in the PI biz. Add driving lessions for Fran, the production of a play in a local pub with a large dog onstage (never act with dogs or children), Fran's friend Ganesh and his family . . . and a sudden horrific death. Which pushes Fran inevitably into sleuthing, much to the irritation of the police - and a few ruthless criminals.This gets four stars instead of five for some disappointments in Granger's plot.However, the professional rendering of this novel into audiobook is unarguably excellent.Once again in this unabridged audiobook, Kim Hicks gives perfect voice to Fran Varady, and to the characters in her world.

Her female amateur sleuth Fran Varady is well drawn and self-sufficient as a former resident of the streets, and a good job has been done in authentically painting the London cityscape in which the mayhem transpires. It's a cozy read for a dark and stormy night with a pot of tea by one's side but, alas, I wasn't as surprised by the outcome as I was hoping to be.

Spanish is a \\"vulgar\\" offshoot from Latin, and \\"tragedies\\" were not works for the vulgar (common) language. If you are looking for comedy in a Golden Age Spanish play it will be difficult. Most involve moral and religious issues. But you should still read this play because it is pretty [darn] good :)"},{"Title":"El caballero de Olmedo / The Gentleman of Olmedo (Biblioteca Didactica Anaya) (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is one of those books that any contemporary reader shall not face alone. Even if your first language is Spanish, the archaic nature of some words and phrases, force you to read the relevant line more that three times to get a notion of the idea behind them. Afterwards, you must figure out why the work was considered as a comedy in the XVI Century. The infatuation between Don Alonso and Ines is not a joyful event on the contrary, both character are consumed by anguish and the rejected lover is only thinking about revenge. Only Fabia presents an element which lights up the gloomy nature of the play and that somehow is not predictable. Consider to read this book if you are interested in the evolution of Spanish Literature but do not expect much pleasure of laughter out of it."},{"Title":"Between Mother and Daughter: A Teenager and Her Mom Share the Secrets of a Strong Relationship","review":"This book is a true one-of-a-kind. Open, honest, and real, this book is full of practical ways that mothers and daughters can learn from each other to create a strong and loving relationship during the teen years. Each chapter begins with a true senerio that all mothers and daughters can relate to, (like the desire for body-piercings, learning/teaching to drive, dating/boys, etc.) then Judy and Amanda take time sharing each of their perspectives on the situation. The wonderful thing about this book is that it has both the mother's and the daughter's voice. The book is also beautifully designed on the inside with quotes, interesting facts, quizes and activites for mothers and daughters to enjoy together. I gaurentee that all teenage girls and their mothers will love this book!"},{"Title":"Between Mother and Daughter: A Teenager and Her Mom Share the Secrets of a Strong Relationship","review":"All Moms....if you're even remotely interested in this book, I would recommend it very highly. My daughter & I began to have many conflicts before she became a teenager. I kept hoping things would get better eventually, but they weren't. I really felt like I was at my wit's-end. In my online searching, I purchased this & read it as soon as I got it. I am not saying it has solved all problems between my daughter & me, but it has really helped me to understand things from her point of view. It is so well-written & so insightful! I am definitely going to order some as gifts for my friends who have daughters.

I could never understand why my mother didn't understand some of my decisions. I hated it when she would not let me do something because she \\"said so.\\" Yet, I never took the time to see the situations from her perspective. That is where this book came in handy. It's a great book to learn about your mother/daughter. I read it alone, since I go to college 5 hours away, but it's a really great book to read with your mother/daughter. It gives little work shops to do together to strengthen your relationship. I read the book with a highlighter in hand so I could go back to my favorite parts and because I wanted my mother to focus of those parts too. I recommend this book to every mother and daughter. Even if you believe you have a pretty good relationship with your mother/daughter this book will make you appreciate them on a new level."},{"Title":"Between Mother and Daughter: A Teenager and Her Mom Share the Secrets of a Strong Relationship","review":"This book is awesome for all mothers.

I got this book as my way of exiting my state of denial about girls' problems being totally different than those of boys, I'm still in denial but the book is very sweet and charming.

Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald once said that there were no second acts to American lives. Yet, a fellow Irishman (one much less gloomy) proved him very, very wrong.This book is the homage that James J. Braddock has always deserved. Braddock's amazing story has been slowly fading from public memory, as well as the memory of modern boxing fans, steadily over the years. This book puts things right.Author, Jeremy Schaap, has written a Godsend of a book for Braddock fans, and his clean, direct style is perfectly suited to telling this story. If Schaap were a boxer, he would be referred to as a cagey, \\"cute\\" fighter; meaning that it might appear that he isn't doing much, but what he does counts and he will be there at the end of the fight with his glove raised.To put it another way, there is nothing prosy in Schaap's writing; but he really knows the way to hit the right spots. Like any very good writer, he recognizes true moments of drama and plays these moments with a pure economy of words that come at you from the blue. Bang! Suddenly I found myself very moved and didn't even see it coming.James J. Braddock was in so many ways the perfect product of the Great Depression. He was a washed-up fighter, his best years behind him. He had been cleaned out by the depression, desperately trying to feed his family by taking odd jobs at the docks in New Jersey, even going on relief (which so humiliated him he wouldn't tell anyone, not even his mother). Yet dock work had made him lean and tough, so when his second chance came, the hard knocks of life had prepared him.People loved him not because he was white, or Irish. Americans loved him because he was like them - all of them - and he represented a hope. He had been crushed and humiliated by life, yet he did not quit. He literally fought his way back. One of the most telling moments in the book, described beautifully by the author, was when Braddock walked into the pubic relief office. He had the amount that he had been given in cash in his pocket, and he wished to pay it back.While this book is a pleasure for the mainstream reader, hard-core fight fans will have nothing to complain about either. His descriptions of the fights of Braddock's career make it plain the author knows his boxing as well. As an unexpected bonus, Schaap has portraits of many other fighters that entered Braddock's sphere; among them Primo Carnera, Max Bear and the great light-heavy, Tommy Laughran.This book is a long-needed and wonderful portrait of a champion, as well as an important addition to boxing literature."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"It is the best sports book I have ever read! The author pulled no punches in detailing the amazing story of Braddock. The boxer's highs and lows were vividly portrayed. You could smell the gym, feel the training, and taste the victory. Moreover, the political, economic and social state of the world in those times was marvelously woven into the fabric of the story. This book was truly a joy to experience. By the end of the story, two champions emerged, Braddock and Schaap."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"James J. Braddock wasn't a great Heavyweight Champ; he lost the title in his first defense bout after he'd won it. But his is, perhaps, the greatest comeback story of 20th century pugilism. The CINDERELLA MAN had heart.Author Jeremy Schaap's book begins with the commencement of Braddock's comeback in June 1934 with his victory over \\"Corn\\" Griffin. Jim's last previous fight had been nine months earlier, at the end of which, with a right hand that had been repeatedly broken and numerous defeats under his belt, he was thought to be washed up. To the point of the Griffin match-up, he was barely able to feed his family with odd jobs on the New York and New Jersey docks and welfare help; it was the Depression, and Braddock's fortunes were at their rock bottom. Then, Schaap regresses in time to the period 1926-33 when Jim fought as a light heavyweight, almost winning that title in 1929. The author alternates the early Braddock saga with the same for the 1929-1934 career of Max Baer, who won the heavyweight title from Primo Canera, also in June 1934, thus setting up the confrontation that established Jim's fame and won him the heavyweight crown, the Braddock-Baer bout in June 1935.Schaap's summaries of Braddock's eighty-three fights and Baer's forty-seven prior to their epic battle are, almost by necessity in a volume of only 276 pages, spotty in detail, yet are sufficient to establish the two fighters' characters. There is an adequate section of photographs, as well as the complete ring records of both Braddock and Baer and a complete listing of all the heavyweight division champs since John L. Sullivan. (Who is Hasim Rahman, champ in 2001, for Pete's sake?!)For a boxing aficionado, CINDERELLA MAN is perhaps, despite its relative brevity, a must read. For those who otherwise couldn't care less about the sport, then viewing the excellent 2005 film CINDERELLA MAN, starring Russell Crowe in the title role, is the preferred, shorter option that provides all the basics. The visual version skips the preliminaries, starts with Braddock's last fight in 1933, his and his family's descent into near destitution, his enduring relationships with his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), his comeback contests versus Griffin, Lewis, and Lasky, and his win by decision over Baer in 15 gritty rounds.Though it wasn't the author's intent, I gather, it was Baer's personality that came across as the more intriguing, at least for me. Max was a hard-punching, underachieving champ who fell more in love with the perks of his achievements - the fame, women, fine clothes, good food, showmanship - than with the commitment to his profession and hard work necessary to stay at the top. It's one of his quotes that stays with me:\\"Listen, I don't want to be one of those champions who fights once a year. I need to fight. Dames are expensive.\\" Truer words were never spoken."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J.

Perfect for summer reading."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"I am in the process of reading this book. It is a great story told by Jeremy Schaap. (Yes the son of the late Dick Schaap)Jeremy Schaap has done a masterful job of weaving this story together and giving us the cultural perspective that was present in early 20th Century of the United States. As with all great stories there will be a movie made about Braddock. It should have the same type of commercial success as Seabiscuit. Read this book before going to the movie theater because it really does a nice job of telling us about the background of Braddock.P.S. This book reminds me of how the sport of boxing has changed over the years. Boxing is now perceived by Americans more for its actions in the court room and greed by its promoters. Community identity with a boxer like Braddock is non existant in this American culture. Maybe it is not fair to compare this generation of boxers with those of Ali. Yet Ali stood for something that a society rallied around other than money. You can disagree with Ali but the respect I have for this man is incredible. Braddock might not have talked that much but he represented something that all of us could identify with. Hard work. A work ethic that people could identify with no matter where a person lived, their religion or their race."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"If you liked the movie you will love the book. The book goes into much greater detail about the man and the time period. Also, if you want to know more about Max B. you will not be disappointed. He was unfairly shown in the movie as a one dimensional bad guy.If you want to step into a time machine and see what boxing was like in the late 20's and early 30's, this one is for you. I could not put it down till I was done."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"A story of an almost unbelievable time. One photograph in the book shows 80,000 people who paid more than a million dollars to watch a fight in an open field. And this was in 1921 when a million dollars had a lot more value than it does today.This is the background against which a perceived has been of boxing James Braddock managed to get a fight with the heavyweight champion Max Baer. Going in as a ten to one underdog, the conventional wisdom was that Braddock didn't stand a chance. As history shows, he won.This was a time when the individual sportsman reigned supreme. And of these boxing was the top of the heap. Boxers were at the top of society, perhaps just as a novelty, but invited to all the best parties, the best restaurants.Mr. Schaap has given us a view of the time, the people, the society of the time. Even if sports are not your thing, the story is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"Terrific biography on the greatest underdog in boxing history . But this documentary gives the reader two biographies in on. The book is as much about Max Baer as it is about Jimmy Braddock which was a pleasant reading surprise. If you enjoyed the highly acclaimed movie \\"Cinderella Man\\" this book is a must read. Unfortunately Hollywood twist reality and the truth in order to sell tickets at the box office, and the movies depiction of Max Baer was a complete falsehood. The \\"real\\" story is complete in this book that is well written and researched. A absolute must read for fans of boxing and sports."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"Its a great book, and better then the movie. The movie was mainly about Braddick,but the book is about both Max Baer and Braddick, and tells both their journeys tofinal concluding fight. Based on having read the book, Max Baer is misportrayed unfairlyin the movie as a selfish bully, when according to the book he was a perfect gentleman, andwhat would be called today a \\"people person\\". In fact, based on this book I felt thatMax Baer was the more interesting story as opposed to Braddick."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"This is a joint review of \\"Cinderella Man\\" and \\"Beyond Glory\\". Together, they provide a very interesting review of the workings of the upper levels of the heavyweight division in the 1930s, when boxing was the king of professional sports. I give \\"Cinderella Man\\" four stars and \\"Beyond Glory\\" five stars.I read \\"Cinderella Man\\" first. It is a light read and entertaining - I read it in one Shabbat. James Braddock's story is inspiring, and by all accounts he was a good man. His tale is a healthy reminder that life does not move in a straight line, no matter what we might want or work hard enough to deserve.While it could not have been easy for author Schaap to research and write the book, I doubt that it breaks any new ground. Further, the writing style and thoughts are straight forward; nothing complex here. Of course, that is OK if the story is strong enough. Braddock's is.\\"Beyond Glory\\" sets its sights higher - and achieves its goal. The story of Louis and Schmeling is great, aided by contrasting main characters (Louis is simple and Schmeling complex - or is it vice versa?), colorful supporting characters (managers, promoters, announcers and more), the run up to war and life in America just before the dawn of the civil rights movement. There is great history throughout, and moral questions enough to occupy a philosophy course.Beyond Glory is not to be read in a single sitting. Rather, the reader will want to pause every few pages to consider the meaning of what just transpired. The meaning is often quite deep, involving questions of amorality, race baiting and much more that has little to do with boxing gloves. This is a very good book."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"I must say this is the single greatest book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I simply could not put it down. I have never had a story leave me hanging on every word like this did. And the story, well, I laughed and I cried, sometimes on the same page. To read a book about such a good man gives me inspiration to be a better husband, father, and man than I am. Mr. Schaap has taken a simple man's extraordinary story and turned it into what I now refer to as \\"my favorite book of all time.\\""},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"I will start by saying that half of the book's success comes from the story, which was written by no other author than life itself. James J. Braddock's predicament seemed so hopeless that the outcome was a true evidence of the man's force of will and tenacity. However, the other half comes from Jeremy Schaap who managed to brilliantly capture the story in a form of the written word. The best aspect of the biography is definitely the emotions conveyed. Whether it's Joe Gould, Max Baer, or Braddock himself, the reader can truly feel what any of the characters involved felt in a given situation. Schaap also provides the readers with solid background information. We get to know a little about the Great Crash, the boxing in the first half of the 20th century and the reality of sports writing back then. The author put a tremendous amount of effort into researching the facts to make sure the book is as close to reality as possible.Jeremy Schaap's \\"Cinderella Man\\" is definitely one of the best books I have ever read if not THE best. I wholeheartedly recommend it to all people who would like to know how far one can go if they refuse to give up despite a tough life situation."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"Cinderella Man is less a biography of James J. Braddock, than a skillfully crafted portrait of boxing's golden era. The colorful characters(Boxers, managers, promoters, trainers, referees, etc.) who populated the era are so vividly described by Schaap that they fairly leap off the page, and when he writes about the action in the ring, you can really feel the punches. Against this lively backdrop, he tells the improbable story of Jim Braddock, from his glory days as a top light-heavyweight contender in the late 20's, to his nadir in the mid 30's, when thanks to a broken right hand, the losses start to pile up, and he plummets to the bottom of the division, all but forgotten by a few dedicated fans and boxing writers. Eventually, he is forced to find sporadic work as a day laborer just to survive the depression. As soon as his hand heals he begins his comeback, slowly climbing the ladder of the heavyweight division until he is granted a title shot by reigning champ Max Baer in 1935(Baer fans will be pleased that Schaap goes to great lengths to rehabilitate Baer's character from the hit it took in the film.) Against all odds, Braddock wins and begins a two year reign as champ. Even though his time at the top was short, his inspirational tale of triumph over extreme adversity has endured, and should serve as a lesson to all of us, never give up despite the odds. Jim Braddock was a genuine hero at a time when people really needed one."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"Jeremy Schaap does a nice job of telling the story of James J. Braddock who pulled off one of the biggest upsets in boxing history on June 13, 1935 when he defeated Max Baer for the world heavyweight boxing championship. While I don't think Schaap does a wonderful job of capturing the era or the times that Braddock lived in, he does an excellent job of conveying Braddock's up and down career, his relationship with his manager Joe Gould, and the desperate straights both found themselves in during The Great Depression. It's really a heartwarming story in many ways.Schaap also provides us a very good look at the character and career of Max Baer. In many ways Baer's career could be seen as a bit of a tragedy in that he squandered his great talent by not applying himself to the craft of boxing. Then again, he was emotionally affected by the death of Frankie Campbell after Baer knocked him out in the ring and appeared to see boxing as a means to wealth and fame but didn't really like it - at least the training aspect of it. Schaap's treatment of the controversial Baer seems evenhanded and well woven into the book.Overall, for sports and boxing enthusiasts, a definite thumbs up."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"After hearing all the hype behind the movie Cinderella Man, I decided to get a non-Hollywood version of the story. The book that fulfills that need is Jeremy Schaap's Cinderella Man - James J. Braddock, Max Baer, and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History. This is an incredible story of perseverance and determination...If you're unfamiliar with the story, it basically takes place during the years of the Great Depression. Braddock grew up in an environment where fighting and sparring was second nature. Once he figured out that boxing was something he could excel in, he started to fight for money. Keep in mind that boxing back in the 20's and 30's was *the* sport of the people. Crowds of 60 and 70 thousand to watch matches was not uncommon. A champion in the sport was treated as the king of the world. Braddock was well on his way to climbing that peak until he broke his powerful right hand. It never got a chance to heal properly, and his sole weapon started to become ineffective. After losing a number of fights against boxers he should have dominated, he decided he had had enough and quit. Unfortunately, the depression robbed him of any savings he had earned during his career and he had no other skills to fall back on. He finally ended up on the relief program and was working at whatever job he could find on a daily basis down on the docks.Contrast that with Max Baer. Baer was a highly skilled boxer with looks and personality. His career was somewhat rocky at first, but then he started a four year winning streak that made him one of the most well-known personalities in the world. But for him, boxing was simply the means by which he could have fine food, wine, and all the women he wanted. Even though his training was half-hearted at best, he was still able to dominate the heavyweight ranks.The stories start to converge in 1934. Baer is the world champion, and Braddock is working on the docks. But all that hard work has led to a leaner, more fit Braddock. His right hand has healed, and his left, always a non-factor, is now as strong as his right. He is signed to fight on two days notice against someone who needs a \\"name\\" fighter to go against but who won't beat him. Braddock surprises everyone by dominating him. After two more fights where he wins in impressive fashion, circumstances align to place him against Baer for the heavyweight championship of the world. Baer sees this as nothing more than other victim of his boxing prowess, while Braddock sees this as the culmination of everything he's worked for his entire life. As the bout gets closer, Baer starts to sense that perhaps he's underestimated Braddock. In the ring, Braddock takes everything Baer can throw at him but is still able to box and dominate the champion. At the end, he's declared the winner by unanimous decision and caps the most unlikely upset in boxing history.Schaap does a great job painting the story in relation to how society functioned back in the 20's and 30's. It's hard to imagine today how much prestige boxing champions had, as the sport has lost a lot of its popularity. But back then, Braddock's \\"Rocky\\"-like story captivated the nation and gave the common man, struggling to make ends meet, a symbol of hope. If this were nothing more than a Hollywood story, it'd be a good one. The fact that it is a factual recreation of real events makes it even more inspiring. A great read..."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J.

The book was released just before the movie of the same title, but the two are independent projects. That's too bad, the movie producers could have used the help of this book.Schapp was very effective in giving the reader the mood of the times and making Braddock easily accessible to understand his emotions. His wife's character is less well developed, but that most likely is due to less available historical information on her. Schaap did not neglect discussion on the various other fighters who make their way into the story including Jack Dempsey, and especially Max Baer. I don't know if a book has been written on Baer, but he was a particularly interesting and tragic personality. Schaap also does not make the error as did the movie into making Baer the antagonist. The depression was the villain, and the writer did not sway from this story line.I'm particularly glad that the writer used boxing for his first book, since boxing makes for the most interesting of sports stories. He also gave us a chance to learn about an athlete who used his abilities and self-determination to rise above his lot in life and become a true champion."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J.

Baer was not onlyheavily favored, but he had already killed two men in the ring. Braddock, with the help of his manager, Joe Gould makes a remarkable comeback and defeats Baer. Braddock becomes a hero and is able to get off welfare once and for all. The story is a hit, even for those who don't like boxing."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"Sports fans have been blessed with a number of quite readable books in the past decade, and this ranks right up there with the best of them. The author recreates an entire era when boxing was the king of sports and then tells one of the most amazing stories in the annals of the ring. And while the book is comprehensive, it is not a difficult read -- so I'd even recommend it as a gift for the sports fan who usually doesn't do more than ESPN: The Magazine.My grandfather grew up in New York City's immigrant neighborhoods and boxed as a young man. He lived the life described in the book, and he attended major prize fights in NYC for decades. This book filled out some historical figures and events my grandfather used to tell me about, with both the hardship/drudgery of boxing anonymity and the glamour of boxing fame."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"Before appreciating the value of kickboxing lessons, when someone mentioned boxing, I would cringe and wonder why someone would box.During the Great Depression, James J.Braddock, like many other boxers of his time, boxed because they believed that they had to box. Boxing, in Braddock's younger years was the country's most popular sport. The country depended on the boxer's determination, as a way to avoid the uncertainty of the economy.Boxing was also what Braddock knew best.And it defined him from the core of his being.Yet, after 3 straight years of losing matches, losing a great deal of his earnings, and breaking his right hand in 3 places, Braddock thought, on one level, that no one wanted to see him in the ring again.His life mirrored the despair of the times around him, yet on another level, he never truly gave up.And it was in fighting Max Baer, who had killed 2 men in the ring, that gave James J. Braddock his come back.James J. Braddock's story, and this book are about the value of determination, focus and living your self-definition."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"Having seen Ron Howard's film, I have now read this book, which reveals how very closely Howard kept the film authentic. This book is well-researched and well-written. I would have liked to have learned more about the relationship between Braddock and Baer after their fight, their friendship which Max Jr says they had, but Schaap gives us nothing on that. He does give us a glimpse of the relationship between Braddock and Louis, and the respect Louis had for the Cinderella Man. His commentary on the other great figures of the saga -- Schmeling, Loughran, etc. -- is excellent. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"The media blitz for the Russell Crowe/Ron Howard film Cinderella Man is in full swing. But the detail and drama that are oftentimes difficult to capture in a movie are located in the pages of this book subtitled, \\"James J. Braddock, Max Baer, and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History.\\" In the tradition of the bestseller SEABISCUIT, the drama builds until the climatic final chapter, which says, \\"Of the 30,000 people in the [Madison Square Garden] Bowl, virtually everyone except the Jews was cheering for Braddock. In 364 days, Baer had squandered all the good will and respect by winning the title.\\"Damon Ruynon called Braddock \\"Cinderella Man.\\" Once a promising light heavyweight boxer, the quiet, burly Irishman faced a string of losses in the ring combined with a broken right hand that occurred with the Great Crash of 1929. With only one good hand and no trained skills other than boxing, Braddock was forced to work as a laborer on the docks of Hoboken to provide for his wife and children. Joe Gould, his diminutive yet loquacious Jewish manager, also fell down on his luck but still believed Braddock should have one more chance. In less than twelve months, one of boxing's oddest combinations staged one of the greatest comebacks in fighting history.The book follows a dual storyline that merges in the final chapter with the fight between Braddock and Baer. One theme follows the life of Jim Braddock -- how he started in boxing and his hardworking beginnings. As Schaap writes about Braddock, \\"When people saw him at the gym, they were always impressed by the quality of the effort he put into his workouts and by the seriousness with which he approached his procession. Braddock could easily have grown cynical about boxing, which at times had treated him cruelly. Even when he believed that he wanted out of the fight game three years earlier, he could not have stayed away for long. Fighting was as essential to him as breathing. When the sport seemed unfair, he maintained an abiding respect for it, and he was determined to acquit himself honorably regardless of the bad decisions and chronic injuries he suffered.\\"The second theme carefully woven into the fiber is the story of Max Baer, nicknamed the Livermore Butcher Boy. Allegedly Baer killed two men in the ring and was a brash outspoken boxer who made headlines in the ring but also outside of the ring through his Hollywood film The Prizefighter and the Lady, along with his dating Hollywood stars. The newspapers wrote a great deal of material about Baer, and he wore his trademark boxer trunks that bore the Star of David symbol.The contrasting lives of these two men are built on a backdrop of the Great Depression, which leads to a classic David and Goliath type of story with an almost fairy tale ending. I confess to knowing little about the history of boxing yet I was fascinated with the intersecting lives of these two men. Jeremy Schaap, the host of ESPN's \\"Outside the Lines\\" and an Emmy Award-winning reporter, does a masterful job of constructing a richly told story that is difficult to put down.[...]"},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J.

Forewarned is forearmed. Anyway, I thought this was a very well thought out, cogent presentation of a rather slippery topic. Storr, in my opinion, does a good job of sifting Jungian wheat from chaff; although he is an admirer of Jung, he can be pretty critical. Overall, I thought Storr did a very good job of presenting Jung's thoughts and contributions to theories of divided self, the positive role of myth, etc. The book does raise many questions which it leaves unanswered, but I suspect that is a function of Jung's eclectic philosophy, not Storr's writing style, which I thought was very clear. Overall, a good presentation, in the opinion of this highly unknowledgeable reader (although there are some pre-feminist comments that had me cringing)."},{"Title":"Fourier series,","review":"This is a concise and rigorous introduction to Fourier series.

I am a firm believer in the four minute theory since reading it. I loaned it to a friend of mine at the time who was very shy with women. He attributed the book with helping him meet his wife. They have been married thirty years now. My wife is amazed at how I can read people so quickly. A few years ago I met a new coworker of hers and in the first few minutes I could tell she could not be trusted. On our way home I told my wife to watch out for her. After a few months she told me I was right. I am now looking to buy this book for my son. Since it is so cheap I may buy a few extras to give as gifts to other people I feel it may help. I would especially recommend this book for people to buy for their children who are leaving home for the first time. As I recall it is a small book and easily carried and read. It was in paperback at the time and probably around 200 pages or even less.

The book also goes well beyond the first four minutes and includes a section on examining your views and behaviors on a wide range of topics.

Although it contained almost nothing that I had not read before, it did what was necessary to my head. It somehow made the position of woman as the Other imaginable by me. Reading it, I imagined what it would be like for me to live in a society that had been dominated by women for more than three thousand years, a society where almost all the most renowned people, heroes, and religious icons were women. A society where the United States of America had had nothing but women presidents and every state was predominantly represented by women, though males account for half the population. Where the predominant forms of music for the last fifty years have all treated men as an interesting and occasionally useful, but often annoying or even maddening objects, and us men run around in skimpy calvin klein-style underwear on MTV while hip-hop women constantly call us \\"dogs\\" in their raps and the classic rock section of the local used music store overflows with female lyrics that question what is more important in life, men, cars, or booze? and blame us men for breaking their poor girl hearts and for being warlocks, (...), or idiots (while the woman rock stars collect millions of dollars and boy groupies run around ready to have sex with any security guard to get a shot to have sex with the famous women).A society where families are dominated by mothers and their husbands live in fear of having their allowance terminated, and have to do menial chores around the house to try to feel, or at least look, useful. Where a boy child realizes before he is 10 that he is a failure and, at best, a second-rate human being (if not an object)(...) A society that is obsessed by the symbol of the womb--in which musical instruments, spaceships, means of transportation, weapons, religious ornaments, political regalia, and thousands of other things are designed to resemble the shape of a womb. A society in which men are scared, brutally scared, of walking around alone at night because almost any woman can physically overpower them and rape them with a sex toy. In which the most famous and influential philosophers of all time, the ones that get taught in university classes and whose books are actually bought and read and that influence the intelligensia, are all women, mostly women who loathe and/or misunderstand men and write things such as \\"What is the cure for all of a man's problems? Impregnating a woman\\" but despite such stupidities are adored by female thinkers.And so on...So that's why I rated this 5 stars. It did something to me, which is the most important quality in a book for someone who's read thousands."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"The Second Sex is an excellent philosophical work on woman; the English translation is not. Terms are translated poorly, such as \\"l'experience vecue\\" (the lived experience similar to Husserl's life-world) being translated as \\"Woman's Life Today\\" (a slam), \\"en-soi\\" and \\"pour-soi\\" being translated interchangeably as in-itself and for-itself (they cannot be used interchangeably-they are not synonyms), etc. In fact, while the original work was published in two volumes, the English translation fits into one...because the translator cut some three-hundred pages that he felt were \\"boring.\\" The original French is lucid, direct, and quite beautiful. The reason that the book sounds so \\"dated\\" in English is because the man who translated it was. (He was a zoology emeritus with no background in philosophy). Thus, a lot is lost in the translation, and, since the publisher will not commence with a new translation for the sake of accuracy while the poor one sells so well (think dollar-signs), one could probably learn French and read the original writings first. \\"The Second Sex\\" (or rather \\"Le Deuxieme Sexe\\") is a good opening forum into what it is to be the Other, and the philosophical ramifications are just as relevant today as when the book was written."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"I recently finished THE SECOND SEX by Simone de Beauvoir, which I had been \\"reading on\\" for more than a year. I adopted a system of reading chapters of it between other books after starting out great guns the summer of 2004, reading 200 pages and realizing that if I didn't do something to break it up, I would never finish it.That is not to say that THE SECOND SEX is not a great book. It is. It's valuable. It's interesting. It's educational, not just about views of women in the first part of this century in Western culture, but also about the logical and writerly process that de Beauvoir uses to address such a massive topic: The topic of Woman; the topic, really of Woman as Other.But there are issues with the translation that can't be ignored. If memory serves me, Parshley had trouble getting de Beauvoir to help him with his translation. Questions he directed to her went unanswered for months, so he not only translated the book, but cut large sections (yes, this 732-page version is abridged!) that he thought were not important, or were redundant. Parshley also was not a philosopher, but was a zoologist, and as such did not understand the depth of such existential and philosophical terms as \\"immanence.\\" Once the translation was finished and published, de Beauvoir was furious with the results. Though Parshley can hardly be blamed given the situation in which he was working, it does make one wonder how much what one is reading resembles de Beauvoir's original ideas and objectives.Considering her objectives, this leads me to one of my favorite quotes about THE SECOND SEX. Nelson Algren, the Chicago writer who was the longtime lover of de Beauvoir (with whom she traveled when she wrote America Day by Day; he was also the writer of The Man with the Golden Arm), said that when the book came out, there was much brou-haha, especially when 22,000 copies were sold in France the first week after it was published. Algren noted that de Beauvoir was the most reviled and the most beloved woman in Paris, and it was clear: \\"She meant it.\\"The book is quite logically organized, which makes it easy to pick up and put down (and to read bits of between other works). Part I: Destiny includes chapters on biology, psychoanalysis and historical materialism. The other parts of the book are: history, myths, the formative years, sitautions, justifications and toward liberation. De Beauvoir uses examples from myth, literature and doctor's case files to illustrate her positions. And her positions are more and less relevant today than they were in the 1940s when she wrote the book. The chapter on lesbians seesm less relevant, since she bases her understandings of the homosexual orientation on situational and envrionmental factors. However, I found her chapter on motherhood to be extremely cogent, as she deals with the issues of expectations of self-realization through children, the disappointments and the isolation of mothers, and the societal expectations of mothers of both girls and boys. And de Beauvoir notices the logical conflict between a society that lauds motherhood for women, but denies them a public voice and equal public standing. This is a typical style of argument for de Beauvoir, and I find her insight, her wisdom, her logic and her organization in this book to be impressive.De Beauvoir writes, \\"One is not born a woman; one becomes one.\\" I think it can be argued that she is not saying that female humans are born the same as male humans, because we all know, or are ourselves, people who were born with strong tradtional male or female traits inherently. Rather, after reading this large and complete work, I think she is saying that women are not born second-class citizens, they become them, through societal shaping, political pressure and self-monitoring. They become the Other because they start to believe they are. While I think we have made strides since THE SECOND SEX was written, reading this book nearly 70 years after it was written is a little upsetting: some of the saddest aspects of the life of the Other for women still ring true."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"A previous review has noted some weaknesses in this translation, which I think are a bit one sided. Cetainly, Toril Moi raises some valid points in her critique of this translation - however, I think these are stylistic issues and translator's preferences. Indeed, there is rarely a \\"true\\" translation of a book, and opinions will always differ as to their quality. What I will say is that this book is infinitely better than the first translation, especially with its use of philosophical/existentialist terminology.I gave this book five stars because I think it is so much better than the original translation. Even though the translators may have made poor choices in parts, they have also restored a great deal of the book that was previously inaccessible in English editions. As to the criticism about the style of the book, I must disagree. I think the book is extremely readable, and had no trouble reading through in its entirety.Moving briefly away from the translation on to the content, this is a must have book for anyone interested not only in feminism, but also existentialism more generally. This book is for both men and women seeking to live an authentic (gendered) life. As a piece of history it is also important. Though the ideas presented her may no longer seem revolutionary, they were when this book was written. Of course, parts of the book have not aged well as science has advanced, but it does not detract from the greatness of the book."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"Simone De Beauvoir's book is the starting-point for any study of feminist theory. As part of the existentialist school of thought, the book explores why woman is the Other in society. While a few sections of this book are horribly dated (e.g. Part II - History), De Beauvoir's mamoth work initiates almost every debate waged within feminist thought up to the present day. She tackles burning debates concerning woman's biology, motherhood, prostitution and more. She also is the first to discuss the many myths surrounding women which doom them to immanence - the object through whom the subject (man) fulfills himself."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"As you read reviews of this book, be aware that there are two translations into English, and Amazon (as I write this) displays reviews of the old (H.M. Parshley) translation on the page for the new (Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier) translation. Some of these reviews echo a common opinion that the Parshley translation is bad.The new translation won't be released until April 2010, and you can see the date of each review just after the review title.I've suggested in feedback to Amazon that it treat translations as more different than editions, for instance saying something like, \\"This review is about a different translation,\\" and putting \\"[new translation]\\" in the title of the \\"edition.\\"That said, I give the book, even in the old translation, five stars. Some people project this book onto the mere-equality end of the modern spectrum of equality feminism vs. specialness feminism, but it doesn't fit there. The problem of being a woman goes beyond solving by political equality, and it comes from a problematic specialness._The Second Sex_ is one of those rare basic books. Here is an important point that doesn't fit previous (or later) categories, but it's too coherent to be rejected; the mind has to expand to try to fit it. This is also one of those books that relit for me that sense that being a human is worthwhile and grand, since, here is one of us, look at Simone de Beauvoir."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"I am staggered that the two \\"Spotlight Reviews\\" of this book revolve around the book being \\"dated.\\" Maybe it's just where I'm from. Maybe things are radically different elsewhere in the country and the world, but most of Beauvoir's words still ring true, perhaps not to the same degree as it was in the 1950s and 1960s, but true nonetheless. We, as a society, have progressed, but perhaps not so far as some would have us believe. With all due respect to those who think differently, I must disagree. Beauvoir's book may be dated, but it is far from \\"impenetrable\\" (interesting choice of term, isn't it?) and is still applicable to the state of women as a gender today."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"This book started an era in feminism called The Second Wave and represents the turn towards psychology and sociology from the political principles of liberty, justice and equality around which First Wave feminists argued.The book painstakinlgy traces the causes of much of women's psychological and behavioural evolution over millenia. de Beauvoir, is more concerned about appraising the situation correctly rather than apologizing for it, and this makes the analysis very objective and in some respects also inconoclastic because she demolishes both good and bad stereotypes of women -- from Montherlant's misogyny, to Caudwell's celebration of feminity.At the same time, she does not pretentiously portray women as something they are not -- quite the same as men, far superior in everything, always in the right etc. This makes the book wonderful reading for its rich well researched, well argued insights and objectivity, although it is a tad apologetic at times and somewhat unilateral in its presentation of men as just the nameless, faceless,'other' of women.Again many Second Wave feminists have largely concentrated on either the cosmetic-beauty imperialism, or some other aspect and not the entire yoke than bogs women. This is by far the most comprehnsive and well-rounded statement of both the feminine situation and the feminist position."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"This is a VERY long book; but it is worth every page!There was so much to learn I had to read it a second time; I'm still not sure I got it all.This is a MUST read for every young woman(it's best if you're young, but this is must reading for EVERY woman)...... and you men out there; read it, you might learn something!!

It moves beyond the surface of \\"radical feminism\\" and digs deep and helps you understand.The only problem I found is that she didnt come up with an answer, but that was not her purpose, she was only explaining the problem and what she saw, she also repeats herself a lot, but I think she does that on purpose.

Over the course of those years, many theories proposed in the book have either become verified fact or have been completely disproven.To a reader discovering this book for the first time today, it is nothing more than a mix of common sense and misleading data. The words, though, get into your psyche. While reading I could feel myself getting worked up, wanting to stand up, be counted, rebel against, well, men.Simone de Beauvoir seemed to be fighting for absolute sameness between men and women and that's where she lost me. While she admits that men and women differ biologically, she rather convincingly tried to reason that someone was to blame for that difference. That men were stealing womens power because women were forced to carry and raise the children they had. It doesn't even make sense as I write it here, so maybe I lost the true meaning in the never-ending cry of it's-not-our-fault-that-we've-been-held-down.She pointed out that women are forced to bow down to men because they have been raised that way. Inversely, shouldn't she also accept that men take control of women because that is the way they were raised to behave? The message to rise against biology and psychology and to change the system is a very important one, but blaming the entire male gender for womens fear of standing up for herself is prejudice. If I was a man, I would be horrendously offended.As a women, I see the value of the kind of passion about our gender. The Second Sex is powerful and compelling and often times inaccurate. It's to be expected based on the multitude of changes garnered by the feminist movement over the last 50 years. The book makes you think and that is always a good thing."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"It's slow going, overflowing with ideas and arguments, and very rewarding.

I could have gone for the Kindle version but thought to save some bucks and opted for the $4.00 used one instead. I received it in reasonable time and the condition of the book was good too. I hope I'll enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"This book is almost fifty years old and is still completely relevant. I think everyone, men and women, should read this to bring awareness to the truths of why women stay in the home rather than pursue dreams and careers, and especially so that that trend might continue to be changed. This was an inspiring book."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"Although I haven't read the flawed English translation by a hostile male, I have read Madame de Beauvoir and the complete uncensoured version of this brilliant piece of work in the original French language. (It's striking that some intellectually challenged reviewers refer to Simone de Beauvoir - one of the most prominent philosophers of the 20 century - as \\"Simone\\". In comparison, I can't imagine her lifepartner being addressed as \\"Jean-Paul\\", but, of course, referring to prominent women by their first name is a common means of belittling them and their achievements. Read more about it in \\"The Second Sex\\".)Anyone who dismisses the endlessly acute relevance of this masterpiece on human rights as \\"outdated\\" - particularly Americans who in 2004 still suffer rampantly archaic sexist issues with women owning the right to their own bodies or the idea of switching the governmental gender balance from a cluster of regressive males to progressive women - only airs their own fundamental ignorance regarding existential conditions for women in a world run by the women-hating male gender.\\"The Second Sex\\" makes for a painful read the intellectual content of which will not be outdated until the day we live in a post-patriarchal society - and that day wont arrive until we have reformed and modernised the male gender. The current destructive relic has long passed its expiry date."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"After reading several other reviews, I felt compelled to add one of my own. I loved this book. While several other reviewers described much of the content as dated, I'm surprised at how relevant much of it still is today. As one fascinated with understanding the underlying causes of sexism, particularly in male-dominated professions, as well as dominance in interpersonal relationships, I found this book enlightening and helpful. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"I wish I was aware of this insightful study on women when I was in high school or even junior high--it might have saved me some adolescent grief!Anyone who wishes to better understand women would benefit from reading this. Simone de Beauvoir's thinking and writing is lucid--she explains things exceptionally well. There are a few literary and philosophical references that are over my head because I'm not familiar with a certain author, nor do I have a philosophy background, but that is a minor distraction.Some have complained that this work is dated. To my mind, it is only dated from the time she wrote it. Sure, some things have improved for women in the last 60 years in varying degrees, but it's not enough. If it were, why are there still such grave problems related to gender inequality around the world today, in the 21st century: domestic violence, violence against women with impunity, spread of AIDS, poverty, pay inequality, sexual harrassment on the job, etc.? The issues she raised are as relevant today as when she wrote them.She clearly describes and explains contradictions that women feel in love, marriage, and work. She writes of the ways in which women's frustrations with men--and vice versa, manifests in destructive ways in relationships, and how women's anxiety about work due to parental and societal expectation hinder progress, etc. Much of what she wrote I could certainly relate to!Her historical, biological, mythical, and literary chapters in the beginning of the book provid much food for thought and helps me to understand how many ideas about women came about. Every chapter in the book seems to flow seamlessly into the next. Whatever thoughts or doubts I had growing up and have now--she has helped to clarify, from the standpoint of societal views and expectations.I am deeply passionate about women's issues and I LOVE this work. I intend to read it again more than a few times...there is so much to learn and digest!"},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"This book is a real masterpiece by a great writer who manages to create a lucid,systematic, clear portrait of women's history and situation. It touches both the practicalside of women's condition and the more subtle sociological and psychological issues thatexplain the whys and hows of their condition. It is not an \\"agry\\" book againts males, but avery balanced analysis that puts the blame for discrimination both on the arrogance and hypocrisyof the dominating male gender and on the passive acceptance that women often offer in exchangefor indulgence and \\"adoration\\". I wish I could say that this book is now old and outdated, but having livedboth isn the US and Italy, I must say that its content is very much actual and relevant today inboth countries. Don't think this book is hard to read. It will be hard only if you are one of thosepersons wwo have lost the ability and habit of thinking (too much TV maybe?) This book WILL makeyou think. Remember that this is no boring essay but some arid sociologist but the workof a great artist and as such will touch on philosophy, and on a deep view of human character,desires and aspirations. Another very strong point of this book is the beautiful writing styleof Simone, so if you have even a basic grasp of French try by all means to read in its original language."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"Simone's treatise is the most brave and brilliant piece of literature ever written about gender and its effects on the lives of everyone we know. She continues to speak the truths about men, women and privilege in society and the corrosive effects of the constructed and artificial roles that we still struggle with. The Second Sex is as essential and appropriate reading today as it was 40 years ago. To anyone interested in the roots of gender oppression, definition and equal access to opportunity, this is the go to reference book. Simone de Beauvoir has found another generation of readers who understand its appeal to rationality, historical accuracy and truth."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"The Second Sex was quite a risque undertaking for De Beauvoir at that time. Few feminist writers before then had challenged the status quo through such a massive attempt in depicting the female experience. It's certainly a fascinating read but, one has to cringe at De Beauvoir's naive attempt at generalizations. Her book is clearly only a depiction of females in the upper-crust of society, and negates social circumstance. Those familiar with the works of Sartre and other existentialists, will certainly recognize many of the ideas espoused in this book. It often reads like a 'who's who' of the french intelligentsia."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"(The rating is for the Kindle edition of the book ONLY.

Although there are excellent chapters that cover specific situations, specifically periods within a woman's life, the book as a whole is a bit thick and dense to digest in one sitting, even if that sitting were to last an entire semester. Instead, most people I have spoken to recommend reading just De Beauvoir's introduction and one or two chapters that are relevant to an individual project. I would have to pass along the same recommendation."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"French feminist writer Simone de Beauvoir argues in her book Le deuxi&egrave;me sexe (1949:13) that gender is a social construct: \\"On ne nat pas femme: on le devient. Aucun destin biologique, psychique, &eacute;conomique ne d&eacute;finit la figure que revt au sein de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; la femelle humaine; c'est l'ensemble de la civilisation qui &eacute;labore ce produit interm&eacute;diaire entre le mle et le castrat qu'on qualifie de f&eacute;minin. [One is not born, but rather becomes a woman. No biological, pschological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine] [v].De Beauvoir underscores the role played by prejudice in the oppression of women in contemporary societies. She points out that the key to understanding how girls develop as opposed to boys is to be found not in any \\"myth of the second sex\\" but in the manner of their upbringing in a society geared toward male supremacy. In other words, women consider themselves inferior because men regard them as such. Beauvoir offers her views on the subtle ways in which matrimony has often been made to work to the detriment of women. She perceives marriage as a male contraption to perpetuate gender inequality when she notes: Le mariage s'est toujours pr&eacute;sent&eacute; de mani&egrave;re radicalement diff&eacute;rente pour l'homme et pour la femme. Les deux sexes sont n&eacute;cessaires l'un &agrave; l'autre, mais cette n&eacute;cessit&eacute; n'a jamais engendr&eacute; entre eux de r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; ; jamais les femmes n'ont constitu&eacute; une caste &eacute;tablissant avec la caste mle sur un pied d'&eacute;galit&eacute; des &eacute;changes et des contrats. Socialement l'homme est un individu autonome et complet ....On a vu pour quelles raisons le rle reproducteur et domestique dans lequel est cantonn&eacute;e la femme ne lui a pas garanti une &eacute;gale dignit&eacute;. (196) [Mariage has always been a very different thing for man and for woman. The two sexes are necessary to each other, but this necessity has never brought about a condition of reciprocity between them; women, as we have seen, have never constituted a caste making exchanges and contracts with the male caste upon a footing of equality. A man is socially an independent and complete individual .... We have seen why it is that the reproductive and domestic role to which woman is confined has not guaranteed her an equal dignity] [vi].I argue along with De Beauvoir and other feminists that the second-class status to which women the world over have been confined is a social construct. I further contend that gender discourse needs to be revisited and debated around address issues that center on gender equality. Finally, I posit that the African woman, in particular, is in dire need of proper education in order to fight male oppression. It is my conviction that a woman's consciousness of her own femininity is to be defined under circumstances dependent on the society of which she is a member. Indeed, a major thesis of De Beauvoir's book is that all her life the woman is to find the magic of her mirror a tremendous help in her effort to assert herself in order to attain self-liberation. It is in the context of their natural differences that men and women must validate their commonality.Dr. Peter Vakunta is a specialist in French and Francophone literatures."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"A book that every thinking man should read, especially those of us who live with feminists.

Maternity caused society to label women and rob their individuality during youth. Labeling women and forcing them into certain roles inevitably results in women living lives of incompleteness and immanence. Age and the subsequent loss of reproductive ability ends woman's purpose and in turn her identity and usefulness.Great work, great research but the only reason I'm giving this work three stars is because of the mixed feelings I have about it: I agree with some of de Beauvoir's conclusions: the importance of financial independence for every woman, female character is a result of her situation not the opposite, the difficulty of breaking free from the myth of \\"femininity\\", and most importantly, women's own role in reinforcing their dependency and otherness. I strongly disagree though with the claim that being a mother or a wife are unfulfilling roles that exacerbate a woman's inferiority. For me, asking for absolute \\"equality\\" and taking away woman's motherhood is as cruel and dehumanizing as depriving females of subjectivity and turning them into objects.Not to criticize de Beauvoir's personal life, but her fixation with resisting the myth of feminine inferiority drove her to the extreme position, rejecting marriage and having kids. Even though de Beauvoir was committed to her relationship with Sartre, she didn't want to marry him and allowed him and herself marginal romantic encounters with males and females.The paradox of de Beauvoir loving some body and allowing herself to be with somebody else, to me, is as damaging as what she criticized in her work. It is exactly acting like the men she criticized for treating \\"the other sex\\" as objects."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"Simone de Beauvoir was the founder of neo-feminism, but her deepest affinity was with Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution. This is made utterly apparent in this book. Beauvoir was still passing out Maoist leaflets in the 1970s, years after Mao's crimes against humanity were well-known. To understand the legacy of American feminism, you have to explore the founder's orientation.While Simone de Beauvoir grew up in one of the most privileged families in France and went to all the best institutions, and never worked a day in her life, she nevertheless, along with a great number of the French left, fell under the sway of Chairman Mao in the 1950s and never recovered. A companion volume to this read would be Julia Kristeva's Chinese Women.The two of these feminists, still considered stellar intellectuals in the world of women's studies, were both simply Maoists for a great part of their life, and a great deal of their thinking went into supporting and amplifying the Chinese Cultural Revolution. The Cultural REvolution is now being relived in every women's studies program in America.Read this book. It is central to understanding the French mentality in the 1970s and the American mentality today in women's studies."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"I belive this book is not only for women, if you happen to be a man and want to get some wisdom read this book."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"This book has proved to be ground breaking in the feminist movement.

Beauvoir can be quite a slog even in English, which therefore needs to be as smooth as possible (compatible with accuracy, ca va sans dire!) Apparently the translators strove for a literal translation. What?!! A literal translation (ie word for word, where feasible) is NO TRANSLATION - something this ungainly beast bears out; it passes the bad translation test (in that it not only reads poorly but the original shows through) in spades. As someone who reads widely in translation (I figure if a book is so honoured, someone thinks it's worth reading) I can assure the good folk at Gallimard that there's all the difference in the world between a sensitive version which highlights both the original's AND the interpreter's skill (as a fine wine reflects both cultivator and blender) and the frankly impotable. Ugh!Le 2e Sexe? A great book to be sure - though you may have to learn French to read it (and don't neglect Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter, this one accessible in English, as the well-chosen title suggests; the literal French would be well-behaved/subdued (literally 'in order', 'put away', 'tidied up') girl/young woman - yes, even 'girl' would have been wrong, so to get round the age ambiguity the translator sensibly plumped for 'daughter'; the euphony is an uncalled-for bonus). As for the bunch of incompetents responsible for commissioning, vetting, greenlighting and finally defending this sorry exercise (you know who you are) they should be held to account; in fact I'm surprised the French government isn't up in arms, as the projection of French culture in the anglophone world must be a priority of theirs - unless they've already given up on us.

Unfortunately, I feel that it has become severely dated, which detracts from the advantages of reading this work.I felt that the first third of the book, dealing with philosophy (particularly existentialism), and Freudian psychoanalysis, was not as interesting or informative as the latter parts of the book. While some people may disagree, I tend to dislike using a lot of big words to describe simple things, as often happens with philosophers and psychoanalists.The remainder of the book, dealing with women at different times of their lives, or in different situations, was stronger. Its major deficiency was its being dated, but a large number of her arguments are very relevant today. Many of her then novel reasonings are now standard modern political fare, for example, her arguments about abortion. It was interesting to see them in the original.Overall, despite its importance, I cannot give this book five stars. It has simply lost too much relevance over the years. The best arguments from this book have become part of the standard fare, while the weaker ones have been lost in time. A modern reader of this book will not gain much insight into women as they are now, but merely a historical view of women and the feminist movement. While this is still a worthwhile goal, &quot;The Second Sex&quot; is simply not as important as it once was."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"I loved this book.

In 1953, H. M. Parshley translated from the French for an American audience. He did a perfectly wretched job as his mastery of French was pedantic at best. Much of the essence of de Beauvoir's original thought was either mistranslated or simply excised. The publishing company Alfred Knopf insisted that there was nothing wrong with Parshley's version and that, despite De Beauvoir's pleading for a competent translation, there was no need for a revision. It was not until 2009 that a fresh re-translation by Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany Chevalier made available to a long awaiting reading audience the howl of gender pain that Simone de Beauvoir had unleashed after a lifetime of suffering under an oppressive patriarchal hegemony.Once one reads The Second Sex (hopefully the latter revision), then one can trace the historical causes of a male bashing of women that is rooted in a myriad of discrete sectors of gender interaction: patrimony, menstruation, pregnancy, abortion, reproductive rights, and economic disequilibrium just to name a few. The methodology that de Beauvoir uses is the broad historical and sociological sweep, one that begins with what she terms \\"Facts and Myths.\\" Here she examines a triangular vortex of biology, history and myth, all of which intersect and coalesce over three millennia to produce the current sad state of depressed feminism against which she railed following the Second World War. In the book's second volume \\"Lived Experiences,\\" de Beauvoir outlines the genesis of a patriarchal imprinting on young and impressionable feminine minds that leads them down a path that encourages them to accept the status quo of women forcefully designated as The Other. This \\"Other\\" de Beauvoir deems a male construct, specifically created to perpetuate the view that males and females are inherently unlike. Males are Subjects and therefore transcendent. They exist by and for themselves and are complete in themselves. Women are Objects and therefore imminent. They exist as psychological, social, and sexual appendages to men without whom their collective existences would have no meaning. Transcendent males can look outward at an infinity of male-designated possibilities. Imminent females must not dare to look with eyes raised upwards at a male pantheon of destiny. De Beauvoir suggests that males can maintain this eternal stranglehold on the female mind via reciprocity. This term sounds harmless enough. It even sounds eminently fair. After all, it implies that when a male scratches a female back, she need do no more than scratch back in return. The problem, of course, is that reciprocity is one-sided. Men deliver a message of male superiority and women absorb it, thinking all the while that this is no more than The Way Things Are Meant To Be. And when women sublimate this invidious message, right then and there is also created the mystique of the Feminine Essence, immortal, inscrutable, and indefinable. There is no concomitant Masculine Essence. Men can therefore feel free to poke about in any woman's mind totally heedless of caution. One of the great ironies of patriarchal hegemony is that this Feminine Essence is a words-only essence. It hides nothing; it contains nothing. It is a psychological club used to bash women to keep them in line. What is de Beauvoir's solution to ending this uneven stalemate? She notes there is no single answer except perhaps for women to refashion and reorder their own internal self-image as autonomous beings who demand that men see them as such.Even with the publication of the revised edition of The Second Sex, not all feminists have rallied under de Beauvoir's tent. More than a few have noted what on the surface seems a thinly disguised self-loathing and disgust toward the biological necessities of womanhood like menstruation and pregnancy. Such critics have further noted her deeply rooted distrust toward men and marriage. Now all this may have some truth embedded but even so, if readers take de Beauvoir's word for it that men have been too successful for far too long at creating a false and self-serving image of woman as the imminent Other, then readers may well empathize with one woman who can find it within herself to lash out at injustice even as she chafes under it."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"Simone DeBeauvoir's The Second Sex was the first comprehensive book about women's lives - as told by a woman. There is so much in this it's impossible to describe: biology, history, politics, - you name it. She covers a remarkable breadth of information and a lot of it is in-depth as well.You can't really have a conversation about feminism without some point of DeBeauvoir's coming into it - whether the speaker realizes it or not. It's a seminal book.DeBeauvoir is a gem and a scholar. They're discovering now that a lot of Sartre's work (Sartre was her companion for most of their lives) was probably influenced by her far more than he credited her. Not that I care: The Second Sex outweighs most of his work on its own. But of course, it doesn't surprise."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"So commences Simone de Beauvoir in her monumental work concerning one of the most essential issues of human existence. She uses the singular form (but in a collective sense) and follows it with a question mark. How do women become \\"women\\", with defined places in society, and particularly vis-&agrave;-vis the opposite sex. She says that women become the \\"other,\\" different from the \\"normal standard.\\" De Beauvoir's erudition is astonishing; her book is grand \\"tour de force,\\" examining virtually all aspects of human knowledge. The book is the classic feminist manifesto, written more than 60 years ago, and it still eclipses all subsequent works. It is dense; rich in insights, and lengthy, and clearly not for the \\"fun read\\" crowd. No review can do it justice, certainly not mine. One can only hope to throw out enough tidbits that the reader says that the effort in tackling this book will be well-compensated. De Beauvoir accomplished this remarkable feat of analysis and hypotheses just as she was turning 40. As only one example of her erudition in literature, in a couple of pages she moves from Alain Fournier's depiction of Yvonne de Galais in \\"Le Grand Meaulnes\\" to Henry Miller's concept of god in a [...] to Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov sacrifices at Sonia's feet.\\"The Second Sex\\" is divided into two books, one entitled \\"Facts and Myths,\\" the other \\"Woman's Life Today.\\" Of course parts of the book are dated; consider that one chapter is entitled \\"The Point of View of Historical Materialism.\\" Yes, Communism has wound up in the proverbial dust-bin of history, as is another chapter title, the male-dominated point of view of psychoanalysis. She examined the concept of woman in the works of five authors: Montherlant, D. H. Lawrence, Claudel, Breton and Stendhal. It was personally reassuring that she liked Stendhal the best, saying: \\"...from this carnival atmosphere where Woman is disguised variously as fury, nymph, morning star, siren, I find it a relief to come upon a man who lives among women of flesh and blood.\\" Elsewhere, making a comparison with the so-called \\"Negro Problem\\" and \\"Jewish Problem,\\" which she says is neither, she says that: \\"the woman problem has always been a man's problem.\\" Other uncomfortable insights: \\"that is why superiority has been accorded in humanity not to the sex that brings forth but that which kills.\\"In the second book De Beauvoir speaks of the acculturation process whereby girls are taught to be \\"coquettish and seductive,\\" and are ambivalent in arousing male interest. She says that \\"the feminine body is peculiarly psychosomatic,\\" and that \\"woman's sexuality is conditioned by the total situation.\\" The entire chapter on a Married Woman makes for more uncomfortable reading, including the insight that: \\"Many married women find amusement in confiding to one another the \`tricks' they use in simulating a pleasure that they deny feeling in reality;\\" \\"This is indeed a melancholy science- to dissimulate, to use trickery, to hate and fear in silence, to play on the vanity and the weaknesses of a man... to \`manage' him.\\"In the chapter on the Mother, her discussion on abortion could tumble out of today's newspapers. She says that a mother who is harsh with her child is seeking vengeance on the man. In terms of her Social Life, she repeats the familiar aphorism that \\"woman dresses to inspire jealousy in other women,...\\" and that it is only in Old Age that a woman gains her independence, and can determine who she actually is. Another acute sentiment: \\"Man enjoys the great advantage of having a God endorse the codes he writes...\\" Her conclusion certainly starts depressingly enough: \\"No, woman is not our brother; through indolence and depravity we have made of her a being apart, unknown, having no weapon other than her sex... but moreover, an unfair weapon of the eternal little slave's mistrust.\\"I found some significant information in some of the other posted reviews: There is the issue of a faulty translation, which even excludes portions of the original text, and this matter has never been resolved. There is also the very real matter of her personal life, failing to \\"walk the talk,\\" and assuming a subordinate position to Jean-Paul Sartre, including the rumored procurement of younger women. Alas! Subordinate no longer, though, they lay side by side in Montparnasse cemetery, for those with pilgrimage inclinations.Overall, a superlative book that can be read and enjoyed numerous times for the central insights De Beauvoir renders."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"I used this book to write my senior research paper in high school during academic 1964-65, along with Betty Friedan's magnum opus, then did not look at it again for 36 years. In the intervening years, I came to know Helen Wentz, the &quot;American Quaker&quot; who was one of Simone's pen-pals, and Nelson Algren but remained blissfully ignorant of the fact that Simone and Nelson were once lovers until recently. I happened upon a volume of Simone's memoirs, Force of Circumstance, decided to read them to research a project of mine and came away awed by her writing ability.Driven by the need to understand this complex woman, I decided to reread her favorite book. Yes, it is repetitive, but the story is that she wrote and researched it very quickly. Yes, it is dated. However, sometimes there is genius in stating the obvious. Freud's genius was in reminding the world that humans are composed of the conscious and the unconscious. We knew that: we simply had to be reminded of it. A more recent example of that kind of genius is Jared Diamond's book &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel.&quot; Sometimes, genius consists in opening the debate. An example of that sort of genius was Henri Pirenne's work, which I believe is called &quot;Charlemagne and Mohammed.&quot; Although it is generally held that Pirenne's speculations are wrong, in order to challenge them, generations of scholars discovered and rediscovered much about the Middle Ages. In The Second Sex the genius of Simone de Beauvoir was to state the obvious and to open the debate that led generations of scholars to learn and relearn much about women. As the 20th Century drew to a close and pundits began drawing lists of most influential people and books, Simone and The Second Sex appeared on all of the lists. It was well placed. The book needs to be read today not as history but as philosophy, argument and document. Where would we all be without it?"},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"The Second Sex is a tour de force.

Admittedly, it is dense and took me four months of on-and-off reading to finish, but for those up to the challenge, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"Simone de Beauvoir basically explains the sexual initiation of the female, her relations with the opposite gender, and her place in society, in the style of her classic manifesto of the liberated woman.As a book published in 1949, Beauvoir's achievement for a woman at her time is really exceptional..."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"I'm only in the Author's Introduction, but I'm rating this as 5 stars because I think the intro is fantastic, and in scanning ahead I don't see any diminishment in quality. Some of reviewers here mention that they can only read a chapter at a time. I've been going about 3 sheets (6 pages) before I have to stop. There's just too much new information for me to grapple with by that point. This business with woman as The Other is a major mind blower. My initial reaction was that Beauvoir is out of her mind. To think that women in general believe that the meaning of their existence is a construction forced upon them by men, if they really believe this, simply astounds me. Yet I realize that Beauvoir isn't just some hack that fell off the turnip truck. She actually spoke for many women of her day, I gather. Well, that was the early 20th century. What about now? I've got the Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan, but won't be reading it until I'm done with The Second Sex, which will take me a while. Are women today still largely The Other? Defining themselves according to male expectations, and aiding and abetting the process by remaining complicit? Or are huge numbers of women redefining themselves on their own terms? There is the pro-life woman, there is the pro-choice woman, there is the stay at home woman, there is the career woman, etc. I'm guessing that women are making these choices, perhaps within a male framework. Hasn't this lead to a fracturing of solidarity? Was there ever a real solidarity of women, or just more vocal or publicized groups than others? Ultimately, is the woman of today happier than the woman of yesteryear? I sure don't know, but these are some of the questions that I have. Anyway, this is a very good book, and I'm enjoying it a lot."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"This book is a very important book, historically. If you're looking to study the history of feminism, it's essential. Further, for someone who simply wishes to get a feel for just how far we've come in the last fifty years, it can be very informative to read this book, and see just what constituted &quot;radical&quot; feminist thought around 1950.But if what you're interested in is cutting-edge, interesting, thought-provoking feminist theory, I'm afraid that this book no longer has what it takes. It was all of these things when it was written, and most of them as recently as the 1970s, but for a modern reader, most of de Beauvoir's concepts and arguments fall into one of three categories:The first is the &quot;Well, DUH!&quot; category, in which she makes a large production out of an argument that has long since become generally accepted; only the most neanderthal sexist would still argue against the basic right of women to be treated on an equal basis with men in employment, or to be treated as, legally, an equal partner with their spouse in a marriage, for two of the most obvious examples. People may argue still about what exactly constitutes equal treatment, but almost no one would dispute the basic concept.The second category, and even more unfortunate, is the category of arguments which have long since been discarded as themselves sexist; for all of her attempts to be radical, she was still a product of her time, and rather a lot of ideas got past her internal screen. The most obvious example of this category is her blind acceptance of the claim, then popular among most gynecologists (which of course, at the time, meant &quot;most male gynecologists&quot;, since there were very few of any other kind) that almost all menstrual or pre-menstrual difficulties experienced by their patients had no physical cause, but were in fact caused by a psychological problem with accepting their femininity. De Beauvoir, of course, puts a more tolerant spin on this outdated claim, suggesting that it is only REASONABLE that women would have difficulties accepting the demands put upon them by society's reaction to their gender, but that doesn't change the fact that she accepts the basic premise itself, a premise that has long since been recognised (at least by feminists) as patent hooey. There are a great many physical causes of menstrual difficulties, and if there are occasional instances of neurotic triggers, that doesn't make the statement &quot;I can't find a physical reason for your problem, therefore there isn't one,&quot; an acceptable diagnosis.The third category of argument in this book, at least for the reader unschooled in existentialist psychobabble and/or marxist dialectic, is the &quot;WHAT did she just say?&quot; argument. In spite of claims to the contrary in the introduction, this book is rather heavy going for the reader not familiar with the catch-phrases and pet terms of those disciplines. Terms like &quot;immanence&quot;, &quot;transcendance&quot;, and such are liberally sprinkled throughout the text, and it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the usage. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but it does make the book rather inaccessible to the average reader.I do NOT recommend this book to the general public; for committed historians, particularly historians of the feminist movement, there is much to be learned from it. But for the general reader, it has long since lost the relevance that made it worth the effort to parse the 814 pages of impenetrable language."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"This tome is no mere women's lib manual. It is a deep examination of the very real existential problems faced by half of the human race. It is required reading for anyone, male or female, who wishes to fully appreciate the total situation of a woman's life.De Beauvoir's exploration of womanhood is not a cheap and disingenuous feminism. There are no easy answers here. Whether you are man or woman, her radical honesty will impose upon you an uncomfortable awakening. You will be challenged to reconsider and transcend your personhood on your own terms... and in the face of so many insidious forces opposed to your self-actualization.The Second Sex is a call for the liberation of both sexes, an invitation that remains open and unfulfilled more than sixty years after its publication."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"This translation conveys the same message as the first translation, but is unnecessarily wordy, uses longer complicated sentence structure and is a struggle to get through. It seems to be a literal translation and also uses French terminology with no footnotes to explain their meaning to the English reader. All this book demonstrates is that the decades of criticism surrounding the first translation was unfounded & based in ignorance (no big surprise there).Does contain a great quote though: \\"Scandinavians are healthy, strong, and cold. \\"Fiery\\" women are those who combine their languor with \\"fire,\\" like Italian or Spanish women,\\"Oh how true it is."},{"Title":"The Second Sex","review":"I was amazed to read this book to see the origin of the women's movement. The jihad that Beauvoir calls for in the opening pages actually says that women should murder men. She says the proletariat has always dreamed of massacring the bourgeoisie, why can't women dream the same in regards to men.The result is a kind of declaration of holy war. This holy war has now spread to thousands of women's studies programs whose only aim is the spreading of hatred. This is funded by liberal states throughout the western world. It has utterly poisoned the air between the genders as men are viciously painted in the minds of gullible young women. Run by violent lesbians, the university training these women receive is devoid of anything except the study of myth, and literature. Science and math are male, and therefore left out of the women's studies curriculum.The training silos in Pakistan and Afghanistan create terrorists with a black and white vision of the world. Their fatwa is well-known against America.The fatwa that women should dream of massacring men is less well-known, and yet is funded without question.Reading this book was a huge breakthrough for me. I felt I had seen the source of my misery in college, and for many years after, as women of all ages exploded with rage at the men around me. They are being made into human missiles by Simone de Beauvoir's rage and the way which it is fashioned by women's studies programs who use this book as their koran."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald once said that there were no second acts to American lives. Yet, a fellow Irishman (one much less gloomy) proved him very, very wrong.This book is the homage that James J. Braddock has always deserved. Braddock's amazing story has been slowly fading from public memory, as well as the memory of modern boxing fans, steadily over the years. This book puts things right.Author, Jeremy Schaap, has written a Godsend of a book for Braddock fans, and his clean, direct style is perfectly suited to telling this story. If Schaap were a boxer, he would be referred to as a cagey, \\"cute\\" fighter; meaning that it might appear that he isn't doing much, but what he does counts and he will be there at the end of the fight with his glove raised.To put it another way, there is nothing prosy in Schaap's writing; but he really knows the way to hit the right spots. Like any very good writer, he recognizes true moments of drama and plays these moments with a pure economy of words that come at you from the blue. Bang! Suddenly I found myself very moved and didn't even see it coming.James J. Braddock was in so many ways the perfect product of the Great Depression. He was a washed-up fighter, his best years behind him. He had been cleaned out by the depression, desperately trying to feed his family by taking odd jobs at the docks in New Jersey, even going on relief (which so humiliated him he wouldn't tell anyone, not even his mother). Yet dock work had made him lean and tough, so when his second chance came, the hard knocks of life had prepared him.People loved him not because he was white, or Irish. Americans loved him because he was like them - all of them - and he represented a hope. He had been crushed and humiliated by life, yet he did not quit. He literally fought his way back. One of the most telling moments in the book, described beautifully by the author, was when Braddock walked into the pubic relief office. He had the amount that he had been given in cash in his pocket, and he wished to pay it back.While this book is a pleasure for the mainstream reader, hard-core fight fans will have nothing to complain about either. His descriptions of the fights of Braddock's career make it plain the author knows his boxing as well. As an unexpected bonus, Schaap has portraits of many other fighters that entered Braddock's sphere; among them Primo Carnera, Max Bear and the great light-heavy, Tommy Laughran.This book is a long-needed and wonderful portrait of a champion, as well as an important addition to boxing literature."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"It is the best sports book I have ever read! The author pulled no punches in detailing the amazing story of Braddock. The boxer's highs and lows were vividly portrayed. You could smell the gym, feel the training, and taste the victory. Moreover, the political, economic and social state of the world in those times was marvelously woven into the fabric of the story. This book was truly a joy to experience. By the end of the story, two champions emerged, Braddock and Schaap."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"James J. Braddock wasn't a great Heavyweight Champ; he lost the title in his first defense bout after he'd won it. But his is, perhaps, the greatest comeback story of 20th century pugilism. The CINDERELLA MAN had heart.Author Jeremy Schaap's book begins with the commencement of Braddock's comeback in June 1934 with his victory over \\"Corn\\" Griffin. Jim's last previous fight had been nine months earlier, at the end of which, with a right hand that had been repeatedly broken and numerous defeats under his belt, he was thought to be washed up. To the point of the Griffin match-up, he was barely able to feed his family with odd jobs on the New York and New Jersey docks and welfare help; it was the Depression, and Braddock's fortunes were at their rock bottom. Then, Schaap regresses in time to the period 1926-33 when Jim fought as a light heavyweight, almost winning that title in 1929. The author alternates the early Braddock saga with the same for the 1929-1934 career of Max Baer, who won the heavyweight title from Primo Canera, also in June 1934, thus setting up the confrontation that established Jim's fame and won him the heavyweight crown, the Braddock-Baer bout in June 1935.Schaap's summaries of Braddock's eighty-three fights and Baer's forty-seven prior to their epic battle are, almost by necessity in a volume of only 276 pages, spotty in detail, yet are sufficient to establish the two fighters' characters. There is an adequate section of photographs, as well as the complete ring records of both Braddock and Baer and a complete listing of all the heavyweight division champs since John L. Sullivan. (Who is Hasim Rahman, champ in 2001, for Pete's sake?!)For a boxing aficionado, CINDERELLA MAN is perhaps, despite its relative brevity, a must read. For those who otherwise couldn't care less about the sport, then viewing the excellent 2005 film CINDERELLA MAN, starring Russell Crowe in the title role, is the preferred, shorter option that provides all the basics. The visual version skips the preliminaries, starts with Braddock's last fight in 1933, his and his family's descent into near destitution, his enduring relationships with his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), his comeback contests versus Griffin, Lewis, and Lasky, and his win by decision over Baer in 15 gritty rounds.Though it wasn't the author's intent, I gather, it was Baer's personality that came across as the more intriguing, at least for me. Max was a hard-punching, underachieving champ who fell more in love with the perks of his achievements - the fame, women, fine clothes, good food, showmanship - than with the commitment to his profession and hard work necessary to stay at the top. It's one of his quotes that stays with me:\\"Listen, I don't want to be one of those champions who fights once a year. I need to fight. Dames are expensive.\\" Truer words were never spoken."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J.

It is a great story told by Jeremy Schaap. (Yes the son of the late Dick Schaap)Jeremy Schaap has done a masterful job of weaving this story together and giving us the cultural perspective that was present in early 20th Century of the United States. As with all great stories there will be a movie made about Braddock. It should have the same type of commercial success as Seabiscuit. Read this book before going to the movie theater because it really does a nice job of telling us about the background of Braddock.P.S. This book reminds me of how the sport of boxing has changed over the years. Boxing is now perceived by Americans more for its actions in the court room and greed by its promoters. Community identity with a boxer like Braddock is non existant in this American culture. Maybe it is not fair to compare this generation of boxers with those of Ali. Yet Ali stood for something that a society rallied around other than money. You can disagree with Ali but the respect I have for this man is incredible. Braddock might not have talked that much but he represented something that all of us could identify with. Hard work. A work ethic that people could identify with no matter where a person lived, their religion or their race."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J.

One photograph in the book shows 80,000 people who paid more than a million dollars to watch a fight in an open field. And this was in 1921 when a million dollars had a lot more value than it does today.This is the background against which a perceived has been of boxing James Braddock managed to get a fight with the heavyweight champion Max Baer. Going in as a ten to one underdog, the conventional wisdom was that Braddock didn't stand a chance. As history shows, he won.This was a time when the individual sportsman reigned supreme. And of these boxing was the top of the heap. Boxers were at the top of society, perhaps just as a novelty, but invited to all the best parties, the best restaurants.Mr. Schaap has given us a view of the time, the people, the society of the time.

The country depended on the boxer's determination, as a way to avoid the uncertainty of the economy.Boxing was also what Braddock knew best.And it defined him from the core of his being.Yet, after 3 straight years of losing matches, losing a great deal of his earnings, and breaking his right hand in 3 places, Braddock thought, on one level, that no one wanted to see him in the ring again.His life mirrored the despair of the times around him, yet on another level, he never truly gave up.And it was in fighting Max Baer, who had killed 2 men in the ring, that gave James J.

Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"The media blitz for the Russell Crowe/Ron Howard film Cinderella Man is in full swing. But the detail and drama that are oftentimes difficult to capture in a movie are located in the pages of this book subtitled, \\"James J. Braddock, Max Baer, and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History.\\" In the tradition of the bestseller SEABISCUIT, the drama builds until the climatic final chapter, which says, \\"Of the 30,000 people in the [Madison Square Garden] Bowl, virtually everyone except the Jews was cheering for Braddock. In 364 days, Baer had squandered all the good will and respect by winning the title.\\"Damon Ruynon called Braddock \\"Cinderella Man.\\" Once a promising light heavyweight boxer, the quiet, burly Irishman faced a string of losses in the ring combined with a broken right hand that occurred with the Great Crash of 1929. With only one good hand and no trained skills other than boxing, Braddock was forced to work as a laborer on the docks of Hoboken to provide for his wife and children. Joe Gould, his diminutive yet loquacious Jewish manager, also fell down on his luck but still believed Braddock should have one more chance. In less than twelve months, one of boxing's oddest combinations staged one of the greatest comebacks in fighting history.The book follows a dual storyline that merges in the final chapter with the fight between Braddock and Baer. One theme follows the life of Jim Braddock -- how he started in boxing and his hardworking beginnings. As Schaap writes about Braddock, \\"When people saw him at the gym, they were always impressed by the quality of the effort he put into his workouts and by the seriousness with which he approached his procession. Braddock could easily have grown cynical about boxing, which at times had treated him cruelly. Even when he believed that he wanted out of the fight game three years earlier, he could not have stayed away for long. Fighting was as essential to him as breathing. When the sport seemed unfair, he maintained an abiding respect for it, and he was determined to acquit himself honorably regardless of the bad decisions and chronic injuries he suffered.\\"The second theme carefully woven into the fiber is the story of Max Baer, nicknamed the Livermore Butcher Boy. Allegedly Baer killed two men in the ring and was a brash outspoken boxer who made headlines in the ring but also outside of the ring through his Hollywood film The Prizefighter and the Lady, along with his dating Hollywood stars. The newspapers wrote a great deal of material about Baer, and he wore his trademark boxer trunks that bore the Star of David symbol.The contrasting lives of these two men are built on a backdrop of the Great Depression, which leads to a classic David and Goliath type of story with an almost fairy tale ending. I confess to knowing little about the history of boxing yet I was fascinated with the intersecting lives of these two men.

Together, they provide a very interesting review of the workings of the upper levels of the heavyweight division in the 1930s, when boxing was the king of professional sports. I give \\"Cinderella Man\\" four stars and \\"Beyond Glory\\" five stars.I read \\"Cinderella Man\\" first. It is a light read and entertaining - I read it in one Shabbat. James Braddock's story is inspiring, and by all accounts he was a good man. His tale is a healthy reminder that life does not move in a straight line, no matter what we might want or work hard enough to deserve.While it could not have been easy for author Schaap to research and write the book, I doubt that it breaks any new ground. Further, the writing style and thoughts are straight forward; nothing complex here. Of course, that is OK if the story is strong enough. Braddock's is.\\"Beyond Glory\\" sets its sights higher - and achieves its goal. The story of Louis and Schmeling is great, aided by contrasting main characters (Louis is simple and Schmeling complex - or is it vice versa?), colorful supporting characters (managers, promoters, announcers and more), the run up to war and life in America just before the dawn of the civil rights movement. There is great history throughout, and moral questions enough to occupy a philosophy course.Beyond Glory is not to be read in a single sitting. Rather, the reader will want to pause every few pages to consider the meaning of what just transpired. The meaning is often quite deep, involving questions of amorality, race baiting and much more that has little to do with boxing gloves. This is a very good book."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J.

James J. Braddock's predicament seemed so hopeless that the outcome was a true evidence of the man's force of will and tenacity. However, the other half comes from Jeremy Schaap who managed to brilliantly capture the story in a form of the written word. The best aspect of the biography is definitely the emotions conveyed. Whether it's Joe Gould, Max Baer, or Braddock himself, the reader can truly feel what any of the characters involved felt in a given situation. Schaap also provides the readers with solid background information. We get to know a little about the Great Crash, the boxing in the first half of the 20th century and the reality of sports writing back then. The author put a tremendous amount of effort into researching the facts to make sure the book is as close to reality as possible.Jeremy Schaap's \\"Cinderella Man\\" is definitely one of the best books I have ever read if not THE best.

The colorful characters(Boxers, managers, promoters, trainers, referees, etc.) who populated the era are so vividly described by Schaap that they fairly leap off the page, and when he writes about the action in the ring, you can really feel the punches. Against this lively backdrop, he tells the improbable story of Jim Braddock, from his glory days as a top light-heavyweight contender in the late 20's, to his nadir in the mid 30's, when thanks to a broken right hand, the losses start to pile up, and he plummets to the bottom of the division, all but forgotten by a few dedicated fans and boxing writers. Eventually, he is forced to find sporadic work as a day laborer just to survive the depression. As soon as his hand heals he begins his comeback, slowly climbing the ladder of the heavyweight division until he is granted a title shot by reigning champ Max Baer in 1935(Baer fans will be pleased that Schaap goes to great lengths to rehabilitate Baer's character from the hit it took in the film.) Against all odds, Braddock wins and begins a two year reign as champ. Even though his time at the top was short, his inspirational tale of triumph over extreme adversity has endured, and should serve as a lesson to all of us, never give up despite the odds. Jim Braddock was a genuine hero at a time when people really needed one."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"Jeremy Schaap does a nice job of telling the story of James J. Braddock who pulled off one of the biggest upsets in boxing history on June 13, 1935 when he defeated Max Baer for the world heavyweight boxing championship. While I don't think Schaap does a wonderful job of capturing the era or the times that Braddock lived in, he does an excellent job of conveying Braddock's up and down career, his relationship with his manager Joe Gould, and the desperate straights both found themselves in during The Great Depression. It's really a heartwarming story in many ways.Schaap also provides us a very good look at the character and career of Max Baer. In many ways Baer's career could be seen as a bit of a tragedy in that he squandered his great talent by not applying himself to the craft of boxing. Then again, he was emotionally affected by the death of Frankie Campbell after Baer knocked him out in the ring and appeared to see boxing as a means to wealth and fame but didn't really like it - at least the training aspect of it. Schaap's treatment of the controversial Baer seems evenhanded and well woven into the book.Overall, for sports and boxing enthusiasts, a definite thumbs up."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"After hearing all the hype behind the movie Cinderella Man, I decided to get a non-Hollywood version of the story. The book that fulfills that need is Jeremy Schaap's Cinderella Man - James J. Braddock, Max Baer, and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History. This is an incredible story of perseverance and determination...If you're unfamiliar with the story, it basically takes place during the years of the Great Depression. Braddock grew up in an environment where fighting and sparring was second nature. Once he figured out that boxing was something he could excel in, he started to fight for money. Keep in mind that boxing back in the 20's and 30's was *the* sport of the people. Crowds of 60 and 70 thousand to watch matches was not uncommon. A champion in the sport was treated as the king of the world. Braddock was well on his way to climbing that peak until he broke his powerful right hand. It never got a chance to heal properly, and his sole weapon started to become ineffective. After losing a number of fights against boxers he should have dominated, he decided he had had enough and quit. Unfortunately, the depression robbed him of any savings he had earned during his career and he had no other skills to fall back on. He finally ended up on the relief program and was working at whatever job he could find on a daily basis down on the docks.Contrast that with Max Baer. Baer was a highly skilled boxer with looks and personality. His career was somewhat rocky at first, but then he started a four year winning streak that made him one of the most well-known personalities in the world. But for him, boxing was simply the means by which he could have fine food, wine, and all the women he wanted. Even though his training was half-hearted at best, he was still able to dominate the heavyweight ranks.The stories start to converge in 1934. Baer is the world champion, and Braddock is working on the docks. But all that hard work has led to a leaner, more fit Braddock. His right hand has healed, and his left, always a non-factor, is now as strong as his right. He is signed to fight on two days notice against someone who needs a \\"name\\" fighter to go against but who won't beat him. Braddock surprises everyone by dominating him. After two more fights where he wins in impressive fashion, circumstances align to place him against Baer for the heavyweight championship of the world. Baer sees this as nothing more than other victim of his boxing prowess, while Braddock sees this as the culmination of everything he's worked for his entire life. As the bout gets closer, Baer starts to sense that perhaps he's underestimated Braddock. In the ring, Braddock takes everything Baer can throw at him but is still able to box and dominate the champion. At the end, he's declared the winner by unanimous decision and caps the most unlikely upset in boxing history.Schaap does a great job painting the story in relation to how society functioned back in the 20's and 30's. It's hard to imagine today how much prestige boxing champions had, as the sport has lost a lot of its popularity. But back then, Braddock's \\"Rocky\\"-like story captivated the nation and gave the common man, struggling to make ends meet, a symbol of hope. If this were nothing more than a Hollywood story, it'd be a good one. The fact that it is a factual recreation of real events makes it even more inspiring. A great read..."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J.

Braddock, Max Baer and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","review":"In his first book and following in his father's footsteps (Dick Schaap), Jeremy Schaap gives us the almost unbelievable story of James Braddock, dubbed the Cinderella Man by the great Damon Runyon.Although not as elegant with his prose as his father, Schaap tells the story of the down and out fighter, who gets that lucky second chance and makes the most of it. The book was released just before the movie of the same title, but the two are independent projects. That's too bad, the movie producers could have used the help of this book.Schapp was very effective in giving the reader the mood of the times and making Braddock easily accessible to understand his emotions. His wife's character is less well developed, but that most likely is due to less available historical information on her. Schaap did not neglect discussion on the various other fighters who make their way into the story including Jack Dempsey, and especially Max Baer. I don't know if a book has been written on Baer, but he was a particularly interesting and tragic personality. Schaap also does not make the error as did the movie into making Baer the antagonist. The depression was the villain, and the writer did not sway from this story line.I'm particularly glad that the writer used boxing for his first book, since boxing makes for the most interesting of sports stories. He also gave us a chance to learn about an athlete who used his abilities and self-determination to rise above his lot in life and become a true champion."},{"Title":"Cinderella Man: James J.

He was one of the few artists who merited sincere praise from John Singer Sargent, and that praise alone says a great deal. With a powerful, gritty and explosive brush guided by an unerring sense of contrast, Duveneck was a painterly painter well before the Ashcan group was known. His formative years were spent in Germany before emerging on the scene in the United States. He made long excursions in Italy where he was also exposed to the atmospheric delicacy of the Venetians, and that added to his strong sense of contrast and made for some remarkable art. The book itself is valuable and wonderfully engaging; however it is a lesser quality reprint of a much older edition and the reproductions are of very poor qualit--better left out entirely.William J. Havlicek PhD"},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"This book contains essays in defence of capitalism from a variety of writers, not only from Ayn Rand herself.This book was one of the first books I read in the field of philosophy, and especially in the field of political philosophy. I do admit that the arguments in the book may sound extremely convincing at a first glance, and they made me a confessing objectivist for approximately one year.That is, however, the most dangerous aspect of a book like this one. After I gained an interest in philosophy, much thanks to Ayn Rand, I started reading books by other philosophers and the more I read the more I realized the total emptiness and nonsense-character of Ayn Rand's philosophy. Her ethics, for example, say absolutely nothing except that you ought to behave in any manner you like, as long as you do not harm (by physical force) anyone's right to life and property. In other words, two completely contradicting actions in a given situation (for example saving the life of a drowning child contra not saving his/hers life) may both be argued for and defended with help of Ayn Rand's ethics.I do not intend to go into more depth in my critique here (I know the above argument regarding saving a child may be subject to a discussion since it is not waterproof in the form as it is presented above). The worst aspect of Ayn Rands philosophy is not her ethics however, but the most harmful aspect is the DOGMATISM it represents, and it's irrational faith in absolute truth.For readers interested in political philosophy, this book is definitely worth reading, but not because its greatness, but rather as a warning against fanaticism and dogmatism which are aspects intrinsically interwoven in Rand's philosophy. For those of you who believe in liberalism and the freedom of man I would recommend the books by Karl Popper and Friedrich Hayek, two philosophers who differs significantly from Rands semi-intellectual dogmatism and who provides a much better defence of the free and open society."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Great book, but the cover is insulting. A pile of quarters? How does that represent Ayn Rand's message? The earlier edition had striking, gloriously stylized, inspiring art on the cover.

If Ayn were alive, she'd read the publisher the riot act over this cover."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"PERIOD!

Let me state from the outset that I believe capitalism is the best of all economic systems, but that doesn't mean I close my eyes to its deficiencies, of which there are plenty. Rand merely totes the capitalist party line without any critical eye to some of its inherent problems. Even master-capitalists Ludwig von Mises and Friederich von Hayek are not blinded by their fondness for capitalism the way that Rand is. Capitalism, and its concomitant minimal governmental intrusion, are to be commended, but in the way that critically evaluates both its virtues and vices, and Worldcom is just the most recent case of its vices. At least Ludwig von Mises and Friederich von Hayek recognize its vices, and, while acknowledging them, still demonstrate why capitalism is the superior system -- giving copious reasons and examples of why this is true. They also detail the vices of its antagonist, socialism, in a way that seems to elude Rand.

On Rand's view of concept-formation, all of our concepts are built up from perception. Somebody who's too stupid to _perceive_ hasn't exactly gotten off to a great start.It's this reviewer himself (or herself?) who is actually using bad logic. Correct spelling may be a necessary condition, but not a sufficient one, for clear thinking.

So I give it two stars."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"...but this book does a terrible job of expressing it.This compilation of essays, including contributions by young (read: pre-Fed) Alan Greenspan, supposedly extols the virtues of capitalism. Unfortunately, this ain't what Capitalism is about.I am a very strong believer that democracy, coupled with capitalism and a free market economy, is the most stable platform yet devised for economic growth and equitable distribution of wealth. Francis Fukiyama's well known book The End of History and the Last Man is repetitive and verbose, but it does a good job of developing this idea. Capitalism works.Unfortunately, in this book Rand takes positive, solid concepts like free markets and trade and takes them to a lunatic fringe extreme that turns them into nutty anti-government caricatures.The most disturbing, perhaps, are the essays written forty years ago by Alan Greenspan, who is now chairman of the Federal Reserve' arguably the most powerful man in the United States of America. In an article entitled 'The Assault on Integrity' he argues (correctly) that reputation is an important competitive advantage for corporations, and that they will act responsibly in order to protect this competitive advantage. He then takes this simple concept and extends it to the unsupportable conclusion that regulation by government entities in *any* fashion is unnecessary.Oh what a difference a few decades makes; as the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Greenspan has now grown up to be the most powerful regulator in the world. We also know, of course, that the views which he espoused in the Integrity essay are pure nonsense. Left to their own devices for-profit corporations will often choose short term gains even if by doing so they take the risk of damaging their long term reputation. Corporate management reports to the shareholder, and the shareholder is focused on quarter-to-quarter performance. If a drug company can release a new product, or an oil giant can initiate a new project, they'll do so if they think it will boost the stock price. If the product turns out to be faulty, or an oil spill results ' well they'll cross that bridge when they come to it.The situation becomes even more problematic when you consider the fact that the shareholders - the true owners of any corporation - don't actually run the business. Day to day operations are entrusted to a cadre of professional managers. Greenspan's thesis states that any entity will do \\"the right thing\\" because of a natural desire to maintain their reputation, but this theory obviously falls apart when the owners aren't truly calling the shots. Obviously Ken Lay (Enron) and Dennis Kozlowski (Tyco) weren't worried too much about running their respective companies' reputations into the ground; they were too busy enriching themselves at society's expense. Even Jack Welch, GE's highly regarded CEO and Wall Street's icon of managerial responsibility, has suffered some unflattering attention as of late. Yes, society needs to establish some rules, and make these guys follow them.Okay, okay: hindsight is 20/20 and yes it is easy to debunk old theories as wrong based on new information. Greenspan did not have a crystal ball forty years ago, and to his credit he's changed his tune. Indeed we could all stand to learn a thing or two from Alan; old theories need to be reevaluated, and when events prove them wrong they need to be discarded.Capitalism and free trade are both concepts that are positive for society. Unfortunately, this book is awful - full of outdated and incorrect ideas. If you want a book which gives a rational treatment of the many virtues of capitalism, Rand is an author to avoid. I can only hope that if/when Greenspan looks back at these essays that he contributed back in the early sixties that he gets a shudder of embarrassment. Ayn Rand has a fiercely loyal following and I know that this review won't make me any new friends, but capitalism and free markets are good concepts that get a bad treatment in this book. Bad economics. Bad science. Bad philosophy. Rand's devout might enjoy it, but readers simply looking for a balanced treatment of capitalism will want to skip this one."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Ayn Rand's legacy is that of an intellectual giant, a force du monde, who riveting impassioned essays provoked thought to the West as Plato did in Ancient Greece.

Those who value emotion over reason should proceed with caution while reading this book. Guilt and envy will surely raise their ugly heads for those unwilling to admit and accept that they exist off the efforts of others."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Being a collection of essays written in the 1960s by Objectivist, novelist and non-academic philosopher Ayn Rand and certain of her like-minded associates (including Alan Greenspan, prior to his arrival at the Fed), this book reads in part as a reasoned exposition of the moral and philosophical foundations of an ideal capitalist society based on individual rights and freedom, and in part as an emotionally charged, pejorative criticism of modern society for being misguided, amoral and a-philosophical.Ever wonder what's behind the truly remarkable economic success of the U.S. over the past two centuries? Ms. Rand explains that the U.S. began as the &quot;first moral society in history,&quot; uniquely founded on a Constitution that explicitly places limitations on government while guaranteeing the rights of private individuals. According to her thinking, inherent in man's nature (metaphysics) is his faculty of reasoning (epistemology). Only through having the freedom (politics) to reason, judge, choose and act can man exercise his individual rights (ethics), including his economic rights to acquire property and trade it freely with others. The purpose of government (police, armed services and court system) in laissez faire capitalism is reduced to that of protector of individual rights.As the authors' analysis goes, it is no surprise that the individual rights and freedom on which capitalism is based vaulted the U.S. economy ahead of all others in the world during the 19th and 20th centuries. However, as advocates of pure laissez faire capitalism instead of today's mixed economy (i.e., laissez faire capitalism mixed with government controls), the authors find themselves at odds with virtually everyone else--liberals, conservatives, altruists, collectivists, academic philosophers, pragmatists, logical positivists, the press, Berkeley activists, the Federal Reserve (note the irony of Greenspan as longstanding Fed Chairman), and the Pope. The authors even chide the business community for compromising capitalism by supporting antitrust legislation, the Sherman Act, in 1890.The authors' ideal society is an as-yet-unrealized world with no antitrust laws, no government intervention in the capital markets, neither tariffs nor subsidies, no compulsory education for children, no minimum wage laws, no inheritance tax, privatization of communication airwaves, no building codes, no FDA, no SEC, etc. Could such a world with moral law placed above society (&quot;No society is better than its philosophical foundation&quot;) reasonably lead, as the authors insist, to a higher standard of living, more prosperity and more fulfilling lives for all of us? If so, they've got quite a tantalizing proposition, at least in theory. . . ."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Many of us have been brought up on the idea that capitalism is a system which promotes the domination and exploitation of others by those in pursuit of personal gain. This is not capitalism, it is gangsterism. Capitalism is a philosophy which promotes the right of the free individual to trade with other free individuals without hindrance from the state.To criticise this book in a negative way is difficult, since neither I nor anybody else has lived in a society based on capitalism. But I have lived in a capitalistic society within the bounds of the United Kingdom. My observation is that the parts of the United Kingdom that tend more towards capitalism are more successful and prosperous than those parts that are not: the southeast of England being the greatest exemplar. Taking a step further, the United States of America with its greater capitalistic tendencies, is demonstrably more successful and prosperous than the United Kingdom.The clarity of the book is helped by the many examples provided by Ayn Rand and her contributors. Some of these are a bit historical for today&#65533;s readers, and the piece on what a patent applies to has been superseded by the recent allowing of patents for discoveries relating to human and animal gene sequences. A few examples from recent and ongoing state activity would be as follows:Cuba is regarded by the IMF as the best example of a third world country doing comparatively well by first world standards. But Cuba doesn&#65533;t have to be a third world country. Cuba has the human resources to compete perfectly well with the first world if the state were not in total control, as the enterprising Cubans who moved elsewhere have demonstrated.Zimbabwe has been reduced to a state of hopelessness and starvation because of gangsterism promoted by the state. Even more developed countries like India and Pakistan are borderline cases because their states choose to fritter away in excess of a hundred million dollars a year fighting each over Kashmir, instead of promoting a way for their people to take part in capitalism, and so improve their circumstances. The Palestinian situation is another example where the lack of a capitalist philosophy is creating so much trouble, its leadership preferring to loot and mooch, and gallivant in luxury around the world instead of staying at home and sorting things out.Where I come from, the economy is totally dependant on handouts from the British Government. This mean that anyone with sense and enterprise has to leave the province because the sources of start-up capital are too busy mooching from the gravy-train of government handouts and other sources of handouts from Europe and the United States ( the international fund for Ireland and the peace process dividend to name two ). And the so called Celtic-Tiger isn&#65533;t too far behind.In England the travelling public and commerce are benefiting from the fiasco that was the piece-meal privatisation of the rail system. This mess has come home to roost with a vengeance, and all because the private operators were being relentlessly interfered with and have ended up as the whipping boy for the state, which should have kept its hands off and let the competitive process do its work. The only good thing, so far, is that Steven Byers, the current transport secretary, got his butt kicked by the City.Not content with that the education system is to be partially privatised and interfered with. So again, the private part will take the fall for the state.And the Millennium Dome, what a mess that was. All they would have to have done was leave it be and run the thing as a leisure attraction under its in-place management for a couple more years. After all, the whole site has lain empty for that long, at a cost of a million pounds a month. But then the sate can afford to waste that kind of money, since its not theirs.Capitalism, as defined in this book, would seem to offer a better way forward than what is currently draining the life blood from the more civilised parts of the world."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Why didn't I read this in high school?

In addition, it contains two articles by Alan Greenspan. Most strangely, in &quot;Gold and Economic Freedom&quot;, he argues that the federal reserve is unnecessary, immoral, founded on a misunderstanding of economics, distructive to freedom and wealth, exists primarily to support chronic deficit spending and the welfare state, and was the cause of the great depression.

If the US is founded on capitalism, does that mean that the US is the root of all evil? Of course the answer is no!If you're interested in learning some of the facts about what capitalism is and should be, this is the book you want to pick up. This book should be required reading in college business, law, and all government classes. Ayn Rand covers all aspects of capitalism in a very organized, logical way. This book is very easy to understand and is clearly and concisely written. It is a must have if you want to pick up anything about capitalism."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"This is a great followup read to Atlas Shrugged! Atlas should impart a great knowledge of Rand's philosophy of life first, and the superb essays in this book should cover a lot of the more practical issues associated with free market capitalism.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Since I am a trained economist I dislike garbage written by charlatans who doesn't have a clue about social scientific methods. This is far from the worst I have seen but nevertheless has little merit in showing the virtues of capitalism.Take an introductory course in Economics instead!!! Another thing that bothers me are the cult-like properties of Objectivism. In Rand's books her followers find justification for behaving in a anti-social manner that is slowly destroying the fabric of the societies of the Western World. This egoism is supposedly derived from &quot;reason&quot;. In the real world however there is no reason for people not to find fulfillment and meaning from helping others and caring for their family and friends. The accusation that &quot;altruism&quot;, i.e. decency and goodness, leads to tyranny is nothing but products of a very paranoid mind. The craziest thing about this though is the fact that Ayn Rand has been raised to a saint-like status by her followers. No disagreement with her writings is ever accepted and if you disagree you are an evil communist/collectivist. To be a true individualist you must agree with everything she has ever written. Isn't this collectivism in a true sense? No, says her followers, those views are derived by reason and must therefore be share by all intelligent human beings. Pretty scary!! Note that Objectivism, like Marxism, Freudianism and Jungianism, is a closed system of thought in the sense that any critisism of the system is automatically seen as a symptom of unreason. This is what makes Objectivism a religion rather than a philosophy or scientific method. And this is also the reason for the fanatical behavior of her disciples."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Rand is easily my favorite 20th century thinker. However, as time has passed, I've grown slowly disattached from her theories, called Objectivism. Re-reading her works, such as Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, has the effect of focusing one's thinking, removing some of the unnecessary complications that have piled up since one last picked up one of Rand's books.This is not to say everything in Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal is true, or that it is even well said. Rand was a good non-fiction writer, but by no means the best essayist of the twentieth century. If you're looking for non-fiction rhetorical style, look elsewhere. She writes clearly, and the writers strongly, cutting out most of the graft and unnecessary details, with the benefit of presenting a philosophy with simple principles, easily understood by the most casual reader. Still, the brilliance of Rand best shines through in her fiction. Read The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged to get a sense of why people, instead of simply respecting her, are devoted to her.If you're new to Rand, I recommend reading her non-fiction first, and to read Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal first among the non-fiction. If you like it or dislike it, you'll be ready to move on to Rand's fiction with a better ability to question the themes she argues in her works."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"\\"Is man a sovereign individual who owns his person, his mind,his life,his work and its products- or is he the property of the tribe(the state,the society,the collective) that may dispose of him in any way it pleases,that may dictate his convictions,prescribe the course of his life,control his work and expropriate his products?Does man have the Right to exist for his own sake-or is he born in bondage, as an indentured servant who must keep buying his life by serving the tribe but can never acquire it free and clear?\\"These are beautiful words that relate with me and my thinking and It is RATIONAL,the book is for rational People, A Must for Conservatives and Political Junkies.

MARCH 26, 1967,she then goes on to rant about how Barbaric the Church is and That St Augustine was Against people being their own and that St Thomas Aquinas was the only one she admires in some words.Sadly As A Catholic it bothered me(Not because it's true) and the fact that she was an Amoral or Immoral Atheist does not help her arguments in the last chapter.Despite this setback the book is an excellent defense and seething rebuttal to common myths and outright lies about Capitalism."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"This volume by Rand and her allies at the time, Alan Greenspan, and Nathaniel Branden, is excellent. Rand's articles show how the only moral political and economic system is capitalism. Property rights, reason and rational thought are what has freed man from the shackles of mysticism, superstition, and religious tyranny. The best articles are Branden's \\"Alienation\\" in which he points out the fallacies of the anti modern ideals of Erich Fromm's \\" The Art of Loving\\". Fromm is exposed as an admirer of the Dark Ages and pines for the ideals of collectivism. Another great article is Rand's \\" The Roots of War\\" in which she condemns the Vietnam War and the draft. She rightly points out the futility of Vietnam and the slavery that the draft creates. She smashes the ideals of conservative collectivism in her article \\" Conservatism: An Obituary\\" by show the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of conservatism. She exposes the conservative worship of \\"tradition\\" and \\"order\\". She also ridicules the weak and sorry defenses that conservatives state for capitalism, and freedom.

Something about Force and Mind; Morality ending and the Gun beginning...I found this to be one of the more easily available non-fiction works from Rand, and the contributing writers are well known indeed. I find the topic of Mr. Greenspan's piece curious considering his current position and policy, but I suppose we are all allowed to change with age.Why only Four Stars? While providing some very distinct insights into objectivist philosophy, Rand's more notable works (Fountainhead, Atlas, Anthem, etc.) paint the incredible picture of Objectivism in Action. In 'Capitalism' we find the true possiblities of an unadulterated free-market economy spelled out in none too technical text. Given an un-addled mind, and an active imagination, one can think these ideas through to fruition. But, through the fictional works, we can see the 'final product' of an objectivist outlook, and what it means to the future of mankind.Too often do we find examples of moral philosophy rotting between two covers, never to see the 'real' world. It is my fear that this is what has happened in this work. Too many have picked it up, read it, and said \\"To what end?\\" without proper answer. Some might say that most who read it would be lacking in the ability to see the application of these ideas. Perhaps it is that in today's world of fad morality, the impact can better be had through the use of the readers imagination and mind; Allowing them to convince themselves of the grand possibilities of the human spirit, by seeing it enacted within a fictional work."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"yes 2008 caused by clinton fannie freddy n barney not wall styes mass produced housing can be a realityyes we can forget oil and go atomic, hek we made 104 atomic stations in 70s yes we can do better and shoot waste into sunyes the democrats are wrong about everythingyes madcow n stewert are moronsyes unions had no hand in high living standardyes the robber barons never existed only men of abilityyes philosophy is the answerfun fun readwill nuke all the green crony ideas in your headyou will come to see how str8 marraige should endprositution should be legaland unregulated free market make poor rich quickly"},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"This is a great fountain of ideas, good ideas, unfortunatelly so far from mainstream beliefs.... but so true and beatifull.

She was born in Russia and was 12 when Lenin became the Soviet dictator and her father lost her pharmacy. When she finally arrived in 1926, she stayed and got some work in Hollywood as an extra and a script reader. She wrote some scripts and published her famous novella \\"Anthem\\" in 1938. By mid century she published the best selling books \\"The Fountainhead\\" (1943), which became a movie with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal in 1949, and \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" (1957). She attracted a great deal of attention from the public and gathered some talented disciples.This book is a collection of essays by Rand as well a few of her more compelling disciples such as Alan Greenspan (yes, that Alan Greenspan), Nathaniel Branden, and Robert Hessen. The focus of this book is on the morality of Capitalism and, in my view is a mixed bag. Of course, I think that of all of Rand's writing. She is a compelling polemicist when attacking collectivism and on the righteousness of economic freedom and political liberty. When she extends her thinking to matters such as religion, altruism, copyrights, and patents things get much weaker. In other words, she is compelling the first few steps in arguing for capitalism, but when trying to use her ideas to create a society she becomes to narrow in her views. Her \\"objectivism\\" and focus on self becomes a hammer she uses to hit everything else as if it were a nail.Rand is still influential and controversies still surround her life and thought. For many people, she is a phase they go through when first coming to understanding their rights as individuals and free economic beings. However, few stay with her thinking for a long period of time. Some do, but most do not. I don't think you can recognize the Alan Greenspan in these pages with the policies he espoused as Chairman of the Fed (regardless of how you regard his tenure).If you are interested in Rand's political writing, this is a decent read, but I advise you to bring more than a pinch of salt as you read it. While some of her writing is powerful and persuasive, make sure you consider its implications before you jump on her bandwagon.Personally, I much prefer the conservatism of William F. Buckley Jr., Russell Kirk, and Whittaker Chambers, to name just a Conservatives who did battle with her during her period of greatest fame. Do NOT let anyone try to hang her around your neck as a foundational conservative thinker. She is not. She considered herself her own school (and her claims to being the greatest philosopher of all time have only become more laughable as the decades pass) and is not part of the conservative mainstream in American political thought. Reagan came out of Kirk and Buckley much more than out of Rand.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI"},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"The essence of this short book is to show that capitalism is the only social system consonant with man's nature as a rational being. Rand validates capitalism by showing that it is good in practice BECAUSE it is good in theory, i.e., the moral is the practical."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"The argument of many reviews below -- that many of Rand's supporters accept all of her ideas like cults accept kool-aid -- is well taken. I have noticed that this is often the case. However, two points of note: (1) The fact that some individuals buy capitalism hook-line-and-sinker wihtout understanding it or giving fair thought to its objections is not, in itself, an argument against a free-market. (2) the same could also be said of those who -- knowingly or unknowingly -- advocate the welfare state.Although this book is not to be seen as the end-all in the capitalism-socialism debate, it does give sharp points to anyone wishing to defend capitalism. While incorporating some of the arguments presented here, I have soundly demonstrated short-comings in the political position of many of my sparring partners. Many of my opponents -- and Rand discusses this point in detail -- are totally unprepared for a confident, calm, and intelligent thinker prepared to debate laisssez-faire capitalism. Often, when a socialist's first wave of arguments are answered, there follows is a hasty retreat into moral relativism, the impotence of reason, and all other sorts of curious, slippery positions. The debate between capitalism and socialism is no where near as one-sided as many socialists wish to think."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"I first read &quot;Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal&quot; as a high-school sophomore in 1969, a couple years after its initial publication.Back in the '60s, it was controversial simply to argue that capitalism was more economically efficient than socialism; to claim, as Rand did, that capitalism was morally superior to socialism was revolutionary.Times have changed. Nowadays it would require an invincible ignorance to believe that socialism can compete economically with capitalism. And to believe that socialism is morally superior to capitalism, now that everyone knows the truth about actually existing socialism in the former Soviet Union, would be morally depraved.Intellectually, the battle is over. Capitalism has won; socialism has lost. Capitalism is no longer an &quot;unknown&quot; ideal.Our new historical situation makes it possible to look more clearly at Ayn Rand's political writings.Rand was unquestionably right about the moral and economic superiority of capitalism.But was she also right about the political, cultural, and historical conditions required to create and preserve a free, capitalistic social order?Rand consistently argued that the motive force of history was ideas. Ultimately, it was intellectuals who control the course of human events.For example, in the second essay in this book, &quot;The Roots of War,&quot; Rand declares:&quot;Just as the destruction of capitalism and the rise of the totalitarian state were not caused by business or labor or any economic interest, but by the dominant statist ideology of the intellectuals -- so the resurgence of the doctrines of military conquest and armed crusades for political 'ideals' were the product of the same intellectuals' belief that 'the good' is to be achieved by force.&quot;In the same essay, she explains that it was not economic interest but rather collectivist intellectuals who pushed America into involvement in both World Wars. (True to her principles, Rand opposed the military draft and the American involvement in Vietnam.)However, Rand and her followers, by focusing on the contribution collectivists have made to militarism have tended to neglect the other side of the coin, the contribution militarism, war, and imperialism have made to advancing the power of government.As Randolph Bourne said, &quot;War is the health of the state.&quot; War provides an unparalleled opportunity for government to increase taxes, expand its control over the economy, suppress civil liberties, and pump up popular faith in the state.While intellectuals facilitated the destruction of Constitutional government in America during the twentieth century, the primary proximate cause of the growth of Big Government was the two World Wars and the Cold War.Rand failed to convey this lesson to her followers, most of whom have supported the current American imperial adventure in the Mideast.What then of Rand's basic analysis of the nature and purpose of government, laid out in two appendices, &quot;Man's Rights&quot; and &quot;The Nature of Government&quot;?Rand defines &quot;government&quot; as &quot;an institution that holds the exclusive power to _enforce_ certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area.&quot; Note that government is defined abstractly as &quot;an institution,&quot; even though any actual government must consist of particular, concrete human beings.A couple pages later, Rand declares, &quot;A government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control.&quot;Really?Given the historical record of war, militarism, imperialism, rape, pillaging, slavery, taxation, and mass murder in which governments have routinely engaged, is there any &quot;institution&quot; that is _less_ credible as a means of placing &quot;objective control&quot; over &quot;physical force&quot; than government?It would make as much sense to define the Mafia or street gangs as &quot;the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control&quot;!Even the officials of a minimal government, endowed only with a monopoly over legislative, judicial, and peacekeeping functions, as Rand advocated, have already, by virtue of that very monopoly, been given powers not possessed by their fellow citizens.Rand argues for a written constitution &quot;as a means of limiting and restricting the power of government.&quot; But of course, it is government officials who will interpret the provisions of the constitution, and they will have both the power and every incentive to use their power so as to evade any restrictions embodied in the constitution.This is not idle speculation. Precisely this experiment was carried out in 1787 in Philadelphia. Two hundred years later, we know the result -- a massively rapacious, militaristic, and imperialistic government which imperils the civil liberties of the American people, buries us in taxes, and claims the right to invade and dominate any other country anywhere in the world.If Madison, Franklin, Washington et al. could not make Rand's program work, it is fair to dismiss her program of limited constitutional government as a Utopian fantasy.A better definition than Rand's would be &quot;a government is a bunch of guys that have managed to get themselves in a position where they can get away with things (bombing, taxation, etc.) that most people could never get away with.&quot; That accurately describes pretty much all governments in the real world (and subsumes Rand's definition of government as a privileged monopoly over legislative, judicial, and peacekeeping functions as a special case -- since most ordinary people could not get away with seizing such a monopoly).Of course, any society does need some minimal consensus on how to deal with and generally avoid violent conflict. All human societies do in fact have various means for maintaining the peace, most of which have nothing to do with government. Ask yourself: how many times have you peacefully settled a serious disagreement with a friend, relative, or neighbor without involving the government at all?It is not in the nature of government to be successfully limited. Government has never existed to serve the governed. If we want a free, prosperous, and peaceful society, government must go.For more realistic, less Utopian views on government, I recommend Murray Rothbard's &quot;The Ethics of Liberty,&quot; H. Hoppe's &quot;Democracy: The God That Failed,&quot; and A. John Simmons' &quot;On the Edge of Anarchy.&quot;"},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"This is one of Ayn's best works!

Those who are not sympathetic with laissez-faire will have an entirely different opinion of the book's worth, but that's always the case with partisan political tracts: they appeal only to those who already agree with the views propagated therein. If you agree with Rand's political ideals, this book will seem like manna from heaven. If you don't, you will regard it as jejune rubbish. That is the trouble with ideological political writing: it nearly always amounts to little more than preaching to the choir.As a propagandist, Rand had at least one thing going for her that separated her from pack: she had a \\"vision\\" of things, an ability to see political and social phenomenon in a larger than life frame of reference and to describe and project that vision in incisive and compelling terms. And while there is much in this vision that deserves scientific criticism, one aspect of it really ought to be better appreciated. I have in mind Rand's contention that it is a creative minority that is decisive to the success of the free market, rather than the \\"consumer sovereignty\\" preached by the Austrians. Mark Skousen has challenged Rand's vision of capitalism from the Austrian point of view. But Rand's vision, at least on this issue, comes closer to the facts.It is regrettable that Rand chose to integrate this largely correct vision with an over-romanticized view of business. Her contention that everything \\"bad\\" ever associated with capitalism is either not really bad or is caused by government interference in the market is simply not supported by the historical evidence, if for no other reason that business and politics have always been inextricably connected and that it is a veritable law of society for it to be this way."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Capitalism, by Ayn Rand, is a collection of 26 essays that discuss more than what the title would lead you to believe. Most articles were written by Rand, while a few were penned by others including a much younger Alan Greenspan. Rand opens the book with a chapter called \\"What is Capitalism.\\" Greenspan writes on antitrust law and gold. Economics is rarely exciting, but the authors manage to make in interesting.One editorial review posted on the Amazon.com page for Capitalism states that the book is, \\"An interesting relic of the past,\\" and goes on to call it an \\"outlandish piece of propaganda,\\" but this is actually a classic example of \\"Extremism or the Art of Smearing\\" as explained in Chapter 17. While the liberals at Amazon.com and the Library Journal might consider Rand an outlandish relic of the past, her books logically explains the philosophy and principles upon which our economic system rests. Because we have drifted away from our founding ideals and the government schools no longer teach United States history well, or economics at all, capitalism has become the forgotten ideal and younger generations must seek out their heritage in the books of Ayn Rand and others. That is why these books continue to sell well.Rand was no friend of Judeo-Christian values, but she strongly believed in many values that most Americans once shared, limited government, laissez-faire economics and property rights.

I highly recommend this read to anyone with an open mind and of a philosophical bent."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Ayn Rand is one of recent history's most prominent defenders of the ideals - and as she would say, morality - of capitalism and the free market. For her it is not a question of wealth, but of individual rights that are protected only by a capitalist system and get trampled by socialism, communism and altuism. Rand's clear thinking is as important today as it has ever been in America's history. It seems the wealthier our country becomes, the harder it is to remember and retain the basis, and the nobility, of the system that brought us that wealth.Even within the reviews of this book there are cries against Wal-Mart and Exxon Mobil, but for what? We are constantly fed the idea that they are bad, or malevolent entities, but how? Wal-Mart provides low-cost items to tens of millions of Americans and jobs to untold thousands and yet the story we hear is how the jobs aren't good enough or how local stores have been run out of business. Who is forcing people to take those jobs? Who stops shopping at the local stores when Wal-Mart comes to town? By what right are people owed something more by Wal-Mart? Exxon Mobil puts billions of dollars at risk searching for new energy reserves and for twenty years endured horrible energy prices set by the free market. Now that prices have risen, thery're evil? By what standard? The fact that I preferred $1 gasoline doesn't make the company who provides my gasoline bad.We need constant reminders of the good that business people and businesses do in our society without any charitable intent or giving. Through their very actions and existence, they form the base that allows the rest of our country to function. They cannot exist, however, without policies, freedoms and rights protected by the goverment. That is why Rand's work continues to be critical to our future.This book is intended as Rand's non-fiction compliment to the fictional \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" I don't believe you need to read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" to get a lot from this book and this is certainly a less time-consuming option.Very highly recommended.

Talk to any socialist and nothing but dogmatic, demagogic, trumped up, scare mongering claptrap comes out. This book relies on logic to break every possible socialist argument into fragments. A socialist cannot take it for a second as when faced with logic, their argument falls to bits. Rand is wonderfully free of the demagogic mind control that we have gotten used to in our intellectuals. She cuts to the bone. She gets to the point. She hits the nail on the head...

It gives evidence and opinions regarding fascism, communism, marxism, vs capitalism; what has taken place, how it happened, and what will happen if we aren't very careful, and awake. It covers so much ground that it is difficult to list topics, but here goes; \\"There is no direction , no goal, no compass, no vision of the future, no intellectual element of leadership.

Since the introduction of controls necessitates and leads to further controls, it is an unstable, explosive mixture which, ultimately, has to repeal the controls or collapse into dictatorship. A mixed economy has no principles to define its policies, its goals, its laws - no principles to limit the power of its government. The ONLY principle of a mixed economy - which, necessarily, has to remain unnamed and unacknowledged - is that no one's interests are safe, everyone's interests are on a public auction block, and anything goes for anyone who can get away with it..... a mixed economy is rule by pressure groups. The only enemy is integrity.\\"Liberals\\" deride any political concern with such large-scale matters as an entire society or an economy as a whole; they concern themselves with single, concrete-bound, range-of-the-moment projects and demands, without regard to cost, context, or consequences. \\"Pragmatic\\" - not \\"idealistic\\" - is their favorite adjective when they are called upon to justiy their 'stance' as they call it, not 'stand'. They are militantly opposed to political philosophy; they denounce political concepts as 'tags', 'labels', \\"myths\\", 'illusions' - and resist any attempt to 'label' i.e., to IDENTIFY - their own views.

This book will reinforce what it is to be American and why we should take pride in the American culture and heritage."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"This book is a wonderful collection of 26 articles written by Ayn Rand (20 articles total), Nathaniel Branden (2), Alan Greenspan (3) and Robert Hessen (1). The 26 count includes the two articles in the appendix by Ayn Rand: &quot;MAN'S RIGHTS&quot; and &quot;THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT&quot;. I do have one criticism of this book but I will save it until the end here. All 26 articles relate in one way or another to the theme that 100% Laissez-faire Capitalism is the best Political-Economic system for mankind and that this fact is unknown to most people in the World --including most people in the United States. The first 13 articles deal with the THEORY AND HISTORY of Capitalism along with the opening article being true to form Ayn Rand: she defines her terms right away. Here she does it by positing and then answering the question: &quot;WHAT IS CAPITALISM?&quot;. The next 12 articles deal with and destroy so many myths about capitalism that it is probably safe to say that anyone who reads this book will find at least 12 of their own myths about capitalism somewhere within the book. The next 11 articles (#14 through #24) deal with the CURRENT STATE of the United States in the mid 1960's and it is amazing how pertinent and informative these articles still are today. For example, for pertinence see article #20, &quot;THE NEW FASCISM: RULE BY CONSENSUS&quot;, and for the informative see and discover the correct definition of 'freedom' on the first page of the article titled &quot;CONSERVATISM: AN OBITUARY&quot;. There is simply too much good in this book to cover it all in one short review. It is a must read for anyone who is serious about politics and economics. Even if you disagree you will be compelled to think about your own position and attempt to solidify your thoughts about it after reading this book. The two ending (APPENDIX) articles speak for themselves and either alone is worth the price of the book. All the articles in the book were written and copyrighted in the 1960's and the book itself as collection of these articles was first published in 1967. Back then, and this is my only criticism, back then Capitalism WAS an Unknown Ideal, but today thanks to Ayn Rand and others, including the contributors to this book, Capitalism is now the KNOWN ideal, consequently the books title is not quite as accurate as it was when first published."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"I was about to buy this book from Amazon.com, until I read the \\"Editorial Review.\\" Amazon[.com] put this on my 'reccomedations' page, as I'm a huge Ayn Rand fan - \\"an advocate of reason, egoism, and capitalism\\". Sadly, on that page was the first few lines of this review! Thank goodness that I *now* know that this book is a \\"relic of the past,\\" and an \\"outlandish piece of propaganda.\\" I think that Mark Pumphrey's assertion that the \\"author's overconfident sense of her own rightness and persistence at pressing her points with little respect for opposing views can quickly become more than a little annoying\\" applies more to that editorial review than to this book, a splendid collection of essays by Ayn Rand, Nathaniel Branden, Robert Hessen, and (the current U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman) Alan Greenspan. This book is more about the moral underpinings of capitalism, the only system in which we are free to choose how to labor, and how to exercise the fruits of that labor; than it is about the economics of capitalism, for which I would reccomend \\"Free to Choose\\" by Milton Friedman, or \\"New Ideas From Dead Economists\\" by Todd G. Buchholz - both available here."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Ayn Rand is not the only person who authored this books' essays. The works of Nathaniel Branden and Alan Greenspan both are worth the price. These two authors do not emphasize the &quot;moral&quot; aspect of capitalism but its bare bones practicalities. And as such nobody has ever been able to shoot their arguments down, on moral grounds or otherwise.In one essay, Branden dissects the criticisms of capitalism during the Industrial Revolution. He shows the relationship between the Industrial Revolution and the Population Explosion. More to the point he shows how Capitalism improved peoples' lives--by providing more sustenance for people to live on.Alan Greenspan's Essay &quot;Gold and Economic Freedom&quot; is a masterpiece frequently quoted elsewhere, but origionates with this book. If you want to know how the Fed kept inflation down throughout Greenspan's reign as Chairman, here's the essence of his philosophy and modus operandi in a few pages. Greenspan also in another essay explains how corrupt monopolies cannot exist--without the help of government.Rand herself, while sometimes going overboard on the &quot;Morality&quot; side, does make some very valid points in two essays in particular: &quot;The Roots of War&quot;, and &quot;Man's Rights.&quot; The theme of both is &quot;being generous with other people's fortunes.&quot; (If I had the ability to take all of your money, I will show you just how compassionate to the world I can be.)In &quot;Roots of War&quot; Rand explains that, outside of voluntary charity there are two ways to acquire something: take it, or swap something for it. Conquest or trade. There is no other option. Government is the agent of conquest, capitalism the agent of trade. She also shows the logical progression of each. In a conquest driven society, the pick pocket beats the honest man, but the robber beats the pick pocket, and the murderer beats the robber. Welfare states are not based on altruism but quite the opposite, and will eventually either collapse or look elsewhere for plunder. In a trade society, those who offer the best value win.In &quot;Man's Rights&quot; she goes over the same concepts as in the Roots of war but more on the individual's level. She also discusses how &quot;Rights&quot; have gone from claims you have on your own life to claims someone else has on your life, and its potential consequences.Finally, &quot;Extremism--or the Art of Smearing&quot;, is a powerful essay on how left-leaning collectivists smear their opponents. Change the names and you've got the exact same thing occuring today, but this essay was written in 1964! Goes to show that the fundamental tactics of collectivists have not changed in at least 35 years.All in all a very good book."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Ayn Rand's *Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal* is a rare disccussion of the rudiments of capitalism, how it works, what its benefits are, why it is the only moral system. It is the only book I know of that demonstrates the virtues of capitalism and discusses the roots of such virtues: that wealth is the result of producitivity and that productivity is the result of correctly identifying reality by means of a consitent use of reason. The book also refutes the many attacks on capitalism and the many mistaken evaluations of it. Highly recommended.Sincerely,Sylvia Bokor"},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"In what is probably her best work of nonfiction, Ayn Rand sets out to provide a _moral_ basis for capitalism, a social/political order in which the human rights to life and property are respected and there are no (other) limitations on freedom of trade. That capitalism is today to some degree a _known_ ideal is in some measure due to the influence of Rand's ideas as represented in this volume.One of this book's great strengths is its inclusion of helpful essays by Nathaniel Branden, Robert Hessen, and Alan Greenspan. This is the _only_ volume of nonfiction published during her lifetime to include essays by anyone other than herself and Branden. It is also the only such book to include a bibliography of recommended reading. (Non-Objectivist works are listed with a caveat that the ideas contained therein may not be fully consonant with Rand's.)And they are more than helpful: their presence suggests _why_ this volume represents Rand's best work. That she was willing and able to include essays by, and references to, other writers surely indicates that she was confident enough in her own views to acknowledge her need for supplementation outside her own areas of strength.In my own view, Rand was a first-rate political thinker, a pretty good ethicist, a lousy epistemologist, and not a metaphysician at all to speak of. (In the latter three fields, she would have profited from closer attention to the writings of Brand Blanshard, whom she respected highly despite some disagreements. _The Letters of Ayn Rand_ indicates that he sent her a signed copy of _Reason And Goodness_ when it was published.) Her philosophy is at heart an attempt to ground her defense of capitalism in ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics, and it becomes gradually less successful the further she wanders from her strengths.But in political theory, she was on firm ground -- and she knew it. And in this collection of essays she is at her best, arguing that the only proper function of government is the protection of individual rights, that individual rights are the only kind there are, that apparent failures of the free market are actually failures of the _government_ to restrict itself to its proper role, and generally, that capitalism is the only economic system fully consonant with man's nature as a value-seeking agent who survives and thrives through the application of reason to reality.So if you plan to read one nonfiction work by Rand, this is the one to read. If she sparks your interest, then go on to read the flawed but helpful _Philosophy: Who Needs It_ and _The Virtue Of Selfishness_.Then stop, unless you're just morbidly curious. Her works in epistemology and aesthetics do not measure up to the standards set in these collections and are of interest largely for the chroniclers of the bizarre personality cult that grew up around her. To find out about _that_, read Jeff Walker's idiosyncratic but interesting _The Ayn Rand Cult_."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Along with \\"Economics in One Lesson\\" by Henry Hazlitt, this is the best introduction I know to the topic of Capitalism and economics. With all the baloney out there, this book will give you the essential moral perspective and help guide you in fighting the anti-Capitalism fallacies we are all bombarded with on a daily basis, in America and around the world. The Appendix with \\"Man's Rights\\" is essential reading for everyone. Ayn Rand clarifies the basis for rights and why only the system of laissez faire Capitalism respects the rights of the individual, by taking the initiation of force out of human relationships. I have only read portions of George Reisman's lengthier book \\"Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics\\" which was influenced by Ayn Rand's thinking, but what I read added further insight and solid evidence of the rightness of Capitalism for human life."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"The only \\"outlandish piece of propaganda\\" about this book is the Library Journal's unabashed hit-piece pseudo-review of it on this website. The essence of capitalism is a political-economic system based on individual rights where all property is owned privately. If you wish to engage in thought about the authentic meaning of capitalism, read Ayn Rand's articles in this book, then if you decide to reject capitalism for statism, do so with the full knowledge of what capitalism is and be prepared to take the consequences for selling your soul."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Have you ever felt that there is something wrong with the world, but haven't been able to put your finger on exactly what it is? This book will do it for you. Ayn Rand, along with some interesting additions by Nathaniel Branden and Alan Greenspan, shows you how deep the rabbit hole really goes. This book is a collection of articles addressing the application of capitalism as a political system, or rather the lack of it, and consequently the inevitable demise of humanity due to the implementation of collectivist, anti-capitalist policies. By exploring different parts of society and the application of collectivist policies that govern us, Ayn Rand basically explains why collectivism (i.e. socialism) is the root to all evil.If you are looking for a book about Ayn Rand's ideas and philosophy of life, and are reluctant to engage in her lengthy, fictional novels like Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead this is definitely the book for you."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Although this book was written many years ago, it rings true for today's issues. The book is made up of multiple (25 or so) mini essays, each about 5-10 pages long.The book has a clear and logical philosophy that is consistent. Its' basic premise is that pure capitalism is the first and only moral system for man. This is because capitalism equals freedom which frees a man from coercive oppression, and that man can only create wealth and new ideas when free to use his mind. The book states that the US briefly came close to pure capitalism in the 1700 and 1800s, but is now heading to fascism, as the state leaves property in private ownership, but the state controls output and use of the private property.This book is the best I've read in several years, because it helped me unify my outlook on several fronts (political, economic, legal, social, etc) into one grand, consistent theory. I think this book will appeal to liberals and conservatives alike. Both are damned in this book by Rand, but I think the left, right, and center will recognize parts of Rand's philosophy that are dear to them too.Read it for yourself to see, the book is cheap."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"All right we all know that greedy Capitalists are the cause of all the problems everywhere. People are poor and have nothing to eat because some CEO wants another Million dollars. Honest, Hardworking people are driven to crime because of others greed.Ok think again. This book dispels all of the myths our public school education system and other liberal groups have put out for years. It also embraces Capitalism as not only the best economic model but also the only ethical one in existence.If you read this with an open mind there are many things you will take away from it. Some of the myths that will be dispelled are: Monopolies are always bad, Unions protect workers, War is good for business, and many more.This book is absolutely essential if you find yourself defending Capitalism from Communists, Socialists, Liberals, and other Statists that believe they are entitled to the fruits of labor of other people."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Ayn Rand offers a sound moral defense of the laissez-faire capitalism, but with moral reasoning rather than theoretical or statistical reasoning. Rand makes her case that the spontaneous natural economic order of free-markets is the only social system conducive to individual liberty and the natural rights. She shreds economic myths and fallacies with her sharp wit and reason. Rand also offers a scathing, yet logical critique of an interventionist state in the economy. Rand pokes reason in the face of her collectivist critics. Collectivist pursuit of economic and social equality has left hundreds of millions dead at hands of totalitarians in the past century. It's no wonder they loathe her every word. Some of her ideas stemming from her concepts of the \\"virtue of selfishness\\" and \\"rationale selfishness\\" are thought-provoking rebuttals to radical egalitarianism, but on the same token, her critique of \\"altruism\\" is rather shallow. The essays by younger Alan Greenspan in the 1960's alone are worth the price of admission. He offered a defense of sound money... yes a pure gold standard and other essays on anti-trust and consumer protectionism. Yet today, he is Fed Chief and head of the central bank, a statist institution which personifies an interventionist socialist state. Has he grown nave about economics with age? Or has he just sold out for power? You be the judge! Beyond this book, I cannot tolerate much if any of Rand's objectivist philosophy, particularly the atheism, materialism and relativism, which isn't overt in this book. Rand's philosophy holds to a materialism on par with Marx and in her zeal against collectivism, she espouses an individualism larger than life. (I guess I give it 3.5/5.0.)"},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Capatilism: the unknown ideal is the eighth book, by Ayn Rand, that I have read/ studied. It is every bit as good as all the others, only it is a non-fiction book and so it is not quite as much fun reading as are Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead.In this work, Rand shows how capatilism almost came in to full laisse faire existence in the 19th century, how that brief peoriod of the 19th century was the one and only time in the history of the world when men were able to improve their standard of living by such a tremendous amount, in such a short span of time; All as a result of capatilism, a free, unregulated economy and industry. Rand demonstrates how the liberal's efforts to regulate industry and the economy, both for the supposed &quot;good of society&quot; have since stifled the progress which, in the era of the 19th century, was only in its &quot;budding stages.&quot; Rand shows how the political interests of &quot;liberals&quot; have changed from the time of the new deal, when liberals still had ideas and values, to the present time when all liberals really want is to sieze control of all production, to the demise of not only those who are both producers and taxpayers, but of the supposed benificiaries of the liberals redistributive efforts. Rand demonstrates how not just liberal but altruistic agendas have been at work, through all of recorded history, in all societies of the world's past, attempting to stifle capatilism: (the only system in which man is rewarded for his individual production) by siezing control of the efforts of productive men, thorough regulations and taxation in worthless, grossly inefficent programs of redistribution of &quot;wealth.&quot; Rand lists and disects every common argument against capatilism which you will hear in every day life in the media, from politician, co-workers, and even in university classes. She demonstrates the internal fallacies and omissions within every such argument; This IS one are of the book which may prove to be very enlightning to even the most dedicated supporters of capatilism (of which, I am one). You will find interesting chapters on the interests of communists with regard to capatilism as well as (believe it or not) the interests of Catholics with regard to communism. And how, according to Rand, the Catholic religion formally stated, in the 1960's that it would prefer to see a reversion back to anti-capatilist times; something to the order of the Middle Ages.This is a great book! Rand is all for capatilism, and after reading it, you may find that you really didn't have a complete understanding of what capatilism is/ could be, or even of the periods of time in which it may ever have existed."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Another great book in defense of the commonly-misunderstood concept of capitalism is &quot;Capitalism&quot; by George Reisman."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"I read about this book in Beitler's \\"Rational Individualism\\"Rational Individualism: A Moral Argument for Limited Government & Capitalism.

WIth the rise of progressivism in the latter part of the 19th Century, our growth rate has been significantly moderated as more and more regulation has interfered with free markets (usually under the claim that the intervention is to &#34;fix&#34; a &#34;market failure&#34;).This book lays out the moral basis of free market capitalism. It further explains that we have never truly had capitalism under completely free markets -- there has always been some level of governmental intervention -- less in the early days of the industrial revolution, more later on, to near strangulation of free markets as we have today. (The U.S. economy is more properly described as a &#34;mixed&#34; economy -- a mixture of free markets and tightly regulated markets that usually distort investment and returns for political reasons.)There are many who disagree with Ayn Rand ... but, strangely, those who disagree often haven't read her actual books, but rather have read critics complaints about her work.

At her funeral in 1982 an immense dollar sign stood beside her casket, and the characters in her books are always sketching the symbol in the air like early Christians sketching the sign of the cross.For all her hatred of religion, Rand managed to turn herself and her ideas into her own private church, and her intolerance of dissent rivaled that of the Ayatollah Khomeini. One story, about Murray Rothbard, shows how far she carried it and how seriously she took herself.Murray, one of the world's leading free market economists and libertarian thinkers, was a lifelong agnostic, but his wife, Joey, was and is a Christian. When they were younger, they had some truck with Rand and her circle of worshippers, but then the Great One found out about Joey's faith.Rand gave Joey six months to soak herself in Rand's own screeds against religion. If, at the end of that period, Joey abandoned her beliefs, she and Murray could sign up with the Source of All Truth Herself. If not, Murray would have to divorce Joey, or else they would be exiled to the outer dark. Murray, quite properly, told Rand to go take a flying jump up in the lake (or words to that effect). He kept his wife, and his wife kept her faith, and somehow they managed to live happily without the benefit of Ayn Rand's wisdom."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"I'm delighted that what's left of Ayn Rand's teaching is slowly rotting away as people in general becomes more educated. No, and I mean no real economist takes her propagandistic writings seriously anymore, except as &quot;lightly read pulp sci-fi&quot; for confused teenagers. In her book, Capitalism, there is no empirics to support her views. The theoretical reasoning reveals a shocking ignorance of real economic theory.

Rand is popular with adolescents desperate to reconcile their confusion about self-interest and duties and &quot;Libertarian&quot; apologists looking for a theory to justify domination and exploitation.

She was an anti-philosopher, a propagandist, a cult leader, a demagogue, a self-appointed Messiah of 'Capatilism', an ill-educated and ill-read megalomaniac who knew little economics and even less philosophy. There were, and are, much more able defenders of 'capatilism' than she - and the hard fact is that people who misspell 'capitalism' are thereby indicating unfamiliarity with them (and thus insufficient competence in the field to review this book adequately).Neither their reviews nor those of the 'psychologisers' are to be trusted."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Consulting Ayn Rand about economics is like consulting Edgar Rice Burroughs about astronomy. She wasn't interested in the scientific truth - only in her \\"exalted vision of man\\" (John Galt cf. John Carter)."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"The following remark opens Ayn Rand's essay \\"What Is Capitalism,\\" reprinted from THE OBJECTIVIST NEWSLETTER, Nov. & Dec., 1965, as the first chapter of CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL: \\"The disintegration of philosophy in the nineteenth century and its collapse in the twentieth have led to a similar, though much slower and less obvious process, in the course of modern science.\\" Yep, you got it: the end of civilization, courtesy of Ayn Rand.Now, get a load of this: 'Thus Europe's thinkers did not notice the fact that during the nineteenth century, the galley slaves had been replaced by the inventors of steamboats, and the village blacksmiths by the owners of blast furnaces, and they went on thinking in such terms (such contradictions in terms) as \\"wage slavery\\" or \\"the antisocial selfishness of industrialists who take so much from society without giving anything in return\\"---on the unchallenged axiom that wealth is an anonymous, social, tribal product.'Charitable critics might attribute such misrepresentation of history to mere ignorance. Sorry, no sale. Anybody with a ninth grade education in 1965 was equipped to see through the baloney Rand was purveying. \\"...Europe's thinkers did not notice...\\"? The industrial revolution of the 19th Century BEGAN in Europe, not in America. \\"...[W]age slavery...\\"? What does Rand even THINK she's talking about? At the time, America was still committed to the institution of LITERAL slavery. \\"...[I]ndustrialists who take...without giving...in return\\"? Read a history of the Gilded Age. For that matter, read a biography of Theodore Roosevelt to get a perspective on the treatment accorded their employees by 19th Century American industrialists.Now, here's a quotation from Michael Reagan, \\"Restructuring the Corporate System,\\" THE MANAGED ECONOMY (Oxford University Press, 1963): \\"One of the greatest myths of what passes for conservativism in America is the belief that, if government would just stop rocking the boat, the status quo of economic institutions and the economic system would be self-sustaining.\\"The \\"myth\\" of which Reagan speaks is black and white and Rand all over. If history has ANY lesson to teach us about capitalism, it's this: capitalism can't thrive without an enormous supply of cheap labor. 19th Century America's workforce fit the bill nicely: black slaves, women, children, immigrants. Of course, the American labor movement changed things a mite during the 20th Century. Once employers had to start PAYING their employees, cheap labor became scarcer, and capitalist wizards accordingly began outsourcing jobs to sweatshops in the Third World (\\"wage slaves,\\" \\"industrialists who take...without giving...in return,\\" anyone?). Naturally, Rand can't abide the idea of organized labor. Rand-World, after all, is a capitalist paradise in which industrialist big-shots have rights but workers don't (again: \\"wage slaves,\\" anyone?). Rand-World, of course, is a JUST world: everybody actually gets what he really deserves. So in Rand-World, what one is actually paid is precisely what one OUGHT to be paid. Hence, anybody in Rand-World who thinks he's UNDERpaid is just an evil piece of crap who ought to know that he'd be paid more if he were WORTH more---which he isn't, because he's just one more mediocre rank-and-file schmuck rather than a capitalist Uebermensch. And, yes, everybody who's not a reality-denying Altruist retard accepts Rand's take on things, because nobody who's not a reality-denying Altruist retard can fail to discern that his/her employer is an enlightened capitalist savant. Come on, now! Don't try telling anybody that YOUR employer isn't a dyed-in-the-wool genius, isn't an infallible dispenser of social, economic, and personal justice! Surely your employer pays YOU precisely what you deserve and treats YOU exactly as you should be treated, right?Ya gotta hand it to Rand: the lady has set the standard of megalomania for the entire world. Who else but Ayn Rand could blithely announce in 1965 the end of philosophy, science, and life as we know it for no reason more substantial than that none of them was subservient to the demands of her own cosmos-dwarfing ego? Like Rush Limbaugh, Glen Beck, and Ann Coulter, Rand has the temerity to dictate political, economic, and social policy for the whole world, without ever having shouldered the responsibilities of political office or holding a position of executive leadership in any industry, without ever having had to negotiate with labor or anyone else. Never mind that what Rand knew about philosophy and science could be written in large block letters on the back of a postage stamp. Aristotle excepted, she damned every thinker with whom she disagreed about anything. Contradict her in any way, and you were consigned to the flames of perdition. You see, for Ayn Rand there ARE NO opaque epistemic contexts; consequently, there are no such things as honest mistakes, only willful \\"denials of reality.\\" Thus, according to Rand, you're never really wrong about anything---rather, you subscribe out of sheer perversity to views that you know perfectly well to be false.CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL splendidly exemplifies what almost certainly will be dubbed \\"Randyness\\" in the forthcoming psychiatric reference manual DSM-V. Randyness: the persistent delusion that one isn't nearly as stupid as one actually is; a degenerative psychopathology manifest in the professional excreta of Ayn Rand, Rush Limbaugh, Glen Beck, and Ann Coulter, of Objectivists and other fanatics generally; characterized by incontinent messianic pronouncements accompanied by a complete disregard of any factor that might inhibit the patient's own grandiosity; a condition for which there is no known cure and for which the only treatment of demonstrated effectiveness is derisive marginalization in all theaters of life, public and private."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"thaks to that other reveiwer who said speling is'nt impotent, capatilism is the gratest sistem ever weather or not we spel it write. but he said second-handers was gonna be the tittle of the fountainhead, he is rong it was gonna be second hand lives.anyway we sure do got to form concepts, i think thats way more impotent then lerning to spel write. capatilism is teriffic and if you do'nt like this book you are a SECOND HANDED."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"With &quot;defenders&quot; of capitalism like Ayn Rand, who needs enemies.

The goals of both social harmony and 'economic efficiency' are promoted, not by socialists' attempts to redesign human society in conformity with their own corrupt visions, but by observance of the Divine precepts of *justice* - of which prosperity is a beneficent side effect.Unfortunately, Ayn Rand, in her deeply ambiguous relationship with Judaism, saw fit to retain only half the truth - and without G-d at that! She did not regard religion ('mysticism') as the proper foundation for an ethical society - and she therefore replaced the revelation of Sinai with her own secular perversion thereof.But as many 'modern' people are discovering, there is no justice apart from a religious foundation, because on any other foundation there is no reason to think justice is important. If you, my fellow human being, are not made in the image of G-d but are merely an assemblage of molecules thrown together by the happenstance of purely material 'evolution', then why should I respect your so-called 'rights'?And so it becomes clear that the latter six of the Ten Utterances depend firmly on the first four. The proper basis of 'capitalism' is in the rejection of idolatry - and 'Objectivism', being a form of idolatry itself, will not help with that task.'Capitalism' and Divine revelation stand or fall together. A world without G-d was the vision of Marx and Lenin, not of the great classical liberals."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Love Amazon.com, but with great respect for Amazon, they also scare me -- the \\"Editorial Review\\" Amazon provided is slanted, opinionated and politically biased.

Today, capitalism is in &quot;fashion&quot;--yet, unfortunately people still don't fully grasp what it is, what it stands for, and what it requires to exist. Quoting Miss Rand:&quot;No politico-economic system in history has ever proved its value so eloquently or has benefited mankind so greatly as capitalism -- and none has ever been attacked so savagely, viciously, and blindly. The flood of misinformation, misrepresentation, distortion, and outright falsehood about capitalism is such that the young people of today have no idea (and virtually no way of discovering any idea) of its actual nature.&quot;...[I]t is capitalism's alleged champions who are responsible for the fact that capitalism is being destroyed without a hearing, without a trial, without any public knowledge of its principles, its nature, its history, or its moral meaning. It is being destroyed in the manner of a nightmare lynching -- as if a blind, despair-crazed mob were burning a straw man, not knowing that the grotesquely deformed bundle of straw is hiding the living body of the ideal.&quot;The method of capitalism's destruction rests on never letting the world discover what it is being destroyed -- on never allowing it to be identified within the hearing of the young.&quot;The purpose of this book is to identify it. [It] is addressed to the young -- in years or in spirit -- who are not afraid to know and are not ready to give up.&quot;&quot;What they have to discover, what all the efforts of capitalism's enemies are frantically aimed at hiding, is the fact that capitalism is not merely the &quot;practical&quot;, but the only moral system in history.&quot;Wow! Can this woman write or what!"},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"For anyone interested in an economic case for capitalism, this is not the right book - Rand was a philosopher, not an economist (in spite of her sound understanding of economic theorems.) However, for anyone interested in a moral defence of the system and an understanding of its intellectual history and opponents, this is a vital piece of work. Rand includes essays on voluminous topics, such as the gold standard, distortions of what actually happened during the Industrial Revolution, the proper role of government (I disagree with her on this), and so on. It is essential to understand that Rand was not a corporate shill, nor did she approve of the status quo - to the contrary, she strongly opposed the notion of corporate welfare and the like, and believed in a free market economy. Unfortunately, her adulation of big business gave ample ammunition to her critics. She replicates her essay on the rights of individuals toward the end of the book, which is in itself an excellent read. Taken in conjunction with The Virtue of Selfishness, this work will spur the youthful mind into further inquiry on the philosophical origins and defences of laissez-faire."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"I first read Rand's &quot;The Virtue of Selfishness&quot; in a political philosophy class in college. The book made an impression on me unlike any other book I had read before and a few years after I graduated I decided to reread it. I then read &quot;Philosophy, who needs it&quot; and &quot;Capitalism, the unknown ideal.&quot; This set of books is an absolute must read for any thinking person. Be warned, however; if socialism or religion is so deeply ingrained in your mind that nothing can wash it away, you most likely will find yourself giving the book a one star, like many of the reviewers did on this site. If you live in the USA, read these books (especially &quot;Capitalism, the unknown ideal&quot;) to find out why you live in the only country ever founded on moral principles. If you live in a socialist (or worst, a Communist) country, read the books to get a better insight of your own government. Finally, as an European who grew up in Europe and came to the USA in his teenage years, I must say that, although I have always sensed and known the huge difference between the European and American mentality, it's Rand who describes it so very eloquently in the last chapter of &quot;Philosophy, who needs it&quot;."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Essays on the value of Capitalism in a free society where men think and opine without fear of retribution from despots and, ideally, are shielded from them by a non-central and defensive infrastructure strong enough to do so.It is often incorrectly attributed to Rand, by her critics, that her unfettered, uncompromising belief of \\"autonomous man\\", as central to fulfillment in the individual life, is undermined by the defense of Capitalism when so many clear examples of corrupt, destructive behavior exist within that system. Whereas those same critics would argue this or that particular collective ideology is superior, what they do not acknowledge is that type of behavior DOES NOT represent Capitalism but the unethical and amoral actions of the individual(s). So, these critics are either ignorant of Rand's ideas or deliberately deceptive in their critique of her beliefs. I have yet to read or know of any advocacy from Ayn Rand's Objective epistimology which encourages or condones a purpose-driven life devoid of conscience from considering the simple difference between right and wrong...including the Capitalist system. Ideally, were ALL men to consider and execute the simple difference between right and wrong in their lives; Capitalism truly defines the ONLY financial system free men can live by as it enriches the creative and resourceful individual while beneficial to the \\"productive members\\" in the same free society. Here, the purpose of profit is easily understood. It rewards the unnatural practice of sacrifice by daring the individual with the lure of genuine success.Likewise....the dregs within a capitalistic society are neither provided or offered anything beyond their willingness to participate in a positive manner. As it should be. Those who \\"associate\\" or \\"equate\\" profit with greed in their indictment against Capitalism do so understanding they are wrong in their agenda driven analysis or are intellectually inept.There are some of Rand's epistimological teachings I am unable to absorb or, perhaps, just don't understand. I am no scholar yet believe with some writing a personal bias for certain things does exist outside of her Objectivist philosophy which inflects from the meaningful, enriched direction she sought for her fellow human being. Might I add a direction well-documented, supported and hopefully, timeless. That being said I support her belief in freedom from tyranny and a corrupt oligarchy to the benefit of mankind through positive egoism, ethical conduct, and purpose-driven life all individuals are capable of having and deserve the opportunity to realize."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Ayn Rand's &quot;Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal&quot; is an inspiring case against the plague of misinformed criticisms made by the &quot;New Left&quot;.

Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal was my introduction to the Austrian economic school of thought and to this day, after considerable research on the subject, I cannot think of a better introduction.Rand, in combination with Nathaniel Branden, Alan Greenspan, and Robert Hessen, provides an admirable compilation of thought portraying the very essence of laissez-faire capitalism. The book is based on the founding principals of America and an understanding that \\"America's abundance was not created by public sacrifices to the \`common good', but by the productive genius of free men who pursued their own personal interests and the making of their own private fortunes.\\"If you resent the fact that your life is your own responsibility and no one else's, then you will not like this book. This will account for the less than perfect overall rating this book inevitably will acquire as there are many among the masses who just cannot accept that they might have to be accountable for their own decisions. Such thoughts clearly do not speak to the quality of the book, rather frustration with the ideals; an understandable and anticipated response to a book of this nature.Anyone seeking to understand the logical and objective ideals of laissez faire capitalists will discover all they are searching for with this book and I highly recommend this to readers and critical thinkers of all views of economic thought."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Ayn Rand's book is not about religious cultivism - usually the only argument that critics manage to articulate. It is about the missing ideological link between human rights (individual rights) and economics. This book should be regarded as food for thought - claiming that only a free economy can be part of a free society. This is true by definition but Rand is simply one of the few non-technical minds that put it to paper without equations. (That government intervention is restricting our wealth and personal freedom has been proven infinite times before.) Another striking feature is the non-scientific assumption about man's selfish altruism. It was only decades later that her non-scientific assumptions were actually confirmed by the major biologists of our time. It is true that many of her arguments skip scientific explanations - but she is never dangerously far off from our biological and economic understanding of humans. A must read for every open mind. A must read for those who believe in the possibility of doing good for themselves and others at the same time.As a European - I know that 99% of all academics in Europe have never come even close to thinking about similiar ideas.

In her view, they are unwilling or unable to fight the battle on moral-philosophical grounds.The essays provide a plethora of gripping insights and novel angles.

This book is powerful, and Ayn Rand is not at all afraid to let us know what is wrong with America, and what would be better if capitalism were truly laissez-faire in America, rather than our giving it over to a mixed economy.The early articles are especially enlightening about the situation in the United States and how it evolved. She goes back to discussing the creation of the Federal Reserve and what was detrimental about it. She discusses the gold standard, and she takes on Franklin Roosevelt and how the Great Depression and his policies led us to becoming a mixed economy.The book also takes a lot of time pointing out why capitalism is superior to communism. While we now live after the Cold War--Rand lived during it and was herself a fugitive from the Soviet Union--the points about communism are still highly relevant, not just because communist countries remain but because communism has seeped into American culture in the form of collectivist thinking--the idea that the individual matters less than what is for the greater good. Ayn Rand gives many examples of this, such as taxpayers without children having to fund public education, and the United States providing assistance to other countries--Vietnam in her day--I'm sure she would be opposed to Iraq in ours. She suggests that our trying to raise up those other countries will only pull us down, and she blasts the idea that we must be charitable and look out for our brothers in other lands.More than any other writer of the twentieth century, Rand was not afraid to speak her mind. She takes on one of Pope Paul VI's encyclicals, she speaks out against the philosophy of Existentialism, and she explains how our culture's unwillingness to stand up for the American ideal and to have a clear philosophy about life has led to the confusion of the younger generations.Everyone will not agree with Ayn Rand on every point, but no one will go away from this book without being more knowledgable and a better thinker. Again! Why are her philosophies not given equal place in fields of study? Why are philosophy classes always ready to talk about Kant, Sartre and existentialism and not objectivism? If we ignore her voice of reason, we will be headed for a welfare, collectivist society ourselves--as she points out, we're already half-way there. Read this book!- Tyler R.

She also had the sense to include a shortlist of recommended reading, which she had never done before and never did again.So we can forgive this book some of its antilibertarian, statist flaws: for example, her defense of &quot;big business&quot; as &quot;America's most persecuted minority&quot; (Murray Rothbard had a few chuckles over this); her thoroughly statist account of &quot;The Nature of Government&quot; and her oracular dismissal of anarchocapitalism; her undermining of the Second Amendment by declaring that government needs a monopoly on the power of coercion (the whole point of the federalist system is to _avoid_ such a monopoly, though perhaps Russian immigrants don't always grasp this point); her insistence that the American commonwealth was based on the (also statist) philosophy of Aristotle (when in fact it owed a great deal more to John Calvin, though Calvin himself might have been surprised to hear it).In fact, forget her own positive account altogether; her philosophy itself was almost uniformly rhetorical-polemical nonsense. But she had a fine knack for picking apart the arguments of some of the _opponents_ of capitalism, and there's quite a bit of that in this volume.And her bibliography will introduce you to Ludwig von Mises. For _that_, we can forgive her a lot."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"In an earlier review that scrolled off the page long ago, I suggested that this was Rand's best book because (a) she stuck largely to political theory and (b) had enough sense to get help with the hard parts. You can click to the next page if you want to read the rest of the review.Here I'll add that it's an important book for another reason: between the lines, it makes a tremendous concession to non-Objectivist ethics.In the opening essay, on p. 24 of the current paperback edition, Rand acknowledges that there is such a thing as &quot;socially objective value&quot; -- her term for what Mises would have called _subjective_ value -- and says it is this kind of value that the free market serves.In the course of discussing this sort of value, Rand concedes (with her teeth gritted) that the values appropriate for what she called &quot;man _qua_ man_&quot; (and here defines as &quot;man at his best&quot;) just aren't appropriate for everybody.If this insight were followed up consistently, the whole Objectivist ethic would need to be revised from the ground up.

The theory of capitalism is laid out, given context using history relevence, and is compared to other modes of thinking, namely altruism. Rand makes fundamental arguements for the morality of capitalism in a philisophic sense, as well as making economic and governmental connections. She breaks apart altruism and its precipitation into government, ie. socialism/collectivism. The arguements made, and the thorough nature in which she makes them really made a connection with me and have had a huge impact on my political and philosophic views. There is really no better way of describing this book than by saying it is completely indispensible, especially for those entering adulthood, who are still forming themselves intellectually.

Her efforts, while noble, have proven to be a failure."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Rand claims the only reason to have a government is to protect \\"individual rights,\\" but nowhere in her writings does she show these rights exist in any form other than her own thoughts and rants.In Objectivist epistemology, things exist in reality (the physical world) or in the mind: as abstractions, emotions, precepts, etc. So then, these rights must be thoughts or they must be matter.These rights aren't matter, they are not made of tissue, of cells or DNA. Ask any doctor or biologist where the \\"rights\\" are located in humans. Ask them if they know of any \\"rights gland\\" that exists. They will laugh in your face.We can easily see that these rights are not part of our physical nature, they are not made of cells or atoms, so then, they must be thoughts.If they are thoughts, and if man is born with a \\"blank slate\\" as Rand says, then how could a newborn have rights, if he has no \\"rights concept\\" or no thoughts about \\"rights\\" at birth?That's easy: The newborn's rights come from Rand's thoughts, and these rights are subjective. Rand thinks about the newborn's \\"rights,\\" and then the baby has them. Notice that this is not only subjective, but also collectivist in nature: In Rand's world the baby's nature is created by the thoughts of another human. Rand believes the baby has \\"rights,\\" and then \\"poof,\\" the rights are created.How much do these rights weight? Where are they located? What color are they? Rand has absolutely no evidence that these rights exist, they are fantasy.Imagine a newborn baby in a world where all other humans have perished in some accident. Suppose a super genius space alien from another plantet gives the baby a medical exam with a super machine and super tecnology, etc. Will he find rights in there? Of course not. Why? because they are not there.The fact is these \\"rights\\" make no sense when thinking about the solitary baby, because Rand's view of rights demands another person (an objectivist) \\"thinking\\" about them for the warm emotioal feeling to develop, for the rights to be created.Based on these facts, Rand's arguments for capitalism are absurd. Get you ideas for freedom from Ludwig von Mises or Thomas Jefferson. Rand's idea of rights is subjective and collectivist in nature.

Instead of defending Capitalism on economic grounds (its ability to increase the standard of living of the masses, for example) she defended it on moral grounds. Man is a rational animal who is rightly concerned with his self-interest. Capitalism is the system of government necessitated by the nature of man.CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL is a collection of essays mostly by Rand (but with some by Alan Greenspan, Nathaniel Branden & Robert Hessen) which were originally published in the 1960's. Rand's essays share the virtues and shortcomings of most of her work. The writing is clear and exciting, but some of the argumentation is overblown. Her standard approach is to take a doctrine that she doesn't believe in (religion, for example), caricature it, and then draw all sorts of inferences about what a person must believe to hold such a doctrine. So her recreation of what Christianity or Conservatism is has little to with what most of its advocates believe.Although Rand's philosophy and her defense of Capitalism is problematic, there is a good deal of interesting social commentary in this book. I particularly like \\"Extremism, or the Art of Smearing.\\"Another excellent is essay is \\"The New Fascism: Rule by Consensus.\\" There is also a lot of dubious reasoning, which stems from the fact that Rand wasn't particularly well read in the areas she felt obliged to pontificate on. For example, she says that the era of peace from 1815 to 1914 was the result of Capitalism. A.J.P. Taylor (a socialist and not a religious believer from what I can tell), stated that it was the fruit of Christianity. She says that the founding fathers of the US wanted to create a totally new system of government, but the Declaration of Independence indicate that they sought conserve the existing system from English encroachments. Or, she states that businessman are the \\"persecuted minority\\" when in fact they benefit more than anyone from subsidies and various protectionist legislation.For defenses of Capitalism based on different approaches, the interested reader should consult the works of Murray Rothbard and Ludwig von Mises."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"I heard about this book and Ayn Rand's work on \\"Free Markets With Dr. Mike Beitler,\\" an internet-radio show that promotes capitalism and individual rights.

This work even includes 3 essays by Alan Greenspan, apparantly before he became a parasitic bureacrat for the ill-concieved Fed (morally and economically). The book is split between Defining and chronicling Capitalism's roots and meaning, and between observations of the perversion and destruction of Capitalism circa mid '60's.

But other then that, this collection of essays shows how brilliant of a thinker and writer Ayn Rand was. How she is able to expose the moral fallacies behind the current altruistic/collectivist philosophy is amazing. She puts into words the many things I believe many of us feel inside but don't really know how to express in words, or have been conditioned to suppress by our culture and schooling.This is quite an educational piece of literature. All to often, free-market and freedom advocates fail to make the moral case. They make the mistake of defending freedom and Capitalism from an altruistic perspective- it is the best economic system for the common good. But this is a mistake, as Ayn Rand points out, while that fact is ture, it alone is secondary to the fact that Capitalism is the only political/economic system that is compatible with individual rights. That is its true moral virtue.The Amazon editorial review is a disgrace! It is not an objective review, but a personal ideological attack. The statements made in that review are baseless and no attempt is made to justify them. Amazon should be ashamed!"},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"If for no other reason than that it includes three essays by fed chairman Alan Greenspan, this is an important, and sometimes even a thought-provoking work. True enough, the theories presented in this book will tell you a great deal more about the sentiments of their authors than they will about how politics works in the real world of fact, but that is true of nearly all books on politics.The main flaw in this book is that it is far too obssessed with proving what &quot;ought&quot; to be rather than with showing what actually is. Rand regarded politics as a mere extension of ethics. I would argue that this is a mistake. Politics is about power and the competition for social and political advantage. It is not about what &quot;ought to be.&quot;Rand regarded the theory of rights presented in this book as one of her great achievements. Perhaps on a purely theoretical level she is correct. But on a practical level, she is surely wrong. Theories of rights, when examined empirically, are merely speculative (and hence impotent) attempts to regulate the division of social advantage. In reality, however, no merely speculative theory of right can be found to regulate the division of social advantage: those individuals with the greater strength, intelligence, and shrewdness take the lion's share, regardless of what any moral philosopher might say. Nor is it clear how any theory of rights, even if it could be established logically, could be enforced in a real world dominated by vested interests and political sharks. It is for this reason that a great deal of what is presented by Rand and her colleagues in this book appears to me quite beside the point--a mere exercise in wishful thinking. The laissez-faire capitalism which Rand advocated is purely utopian. But it is not utopian for economic reasons, as leftists naively believe, but for political reasons: the corporation and politicians who run this country will never tolerate a system of laissez-faire (they are not about to give up their power)."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"This is a wonderful book. I am doing my senior thesis in college on 'why capitalism is a moral system' for my philosophy degree. I love Ayn Rand. She is an athiest and a capitalist...like me. It's too bad that the socialist professors I know look down upon her. It's also too bad how narrow minded the editor on this page was. Rand points out the double standards of how it's called 'social gains' when workers push for higher wages, yet 'greed' when employers (who holding all the risk in their hands) want to increase profits. Like I said, if you are truly socialistic, you will not like this book."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Now let's see: Rand was wrong about government financing, and she was wrong to be averse to &quot;violent civil resistance&quot; -- arguing that government requires a territorial monopoly on the legal use of force, in direct conflict with the Second Amendment specifically and the logic of federalism generally. So if we put her view of government into practice, we'd have a totalitarian State that couldn't pay for itself out of voluntary contributions, and we'd have an unarmed citizenry that wasn't allowed to resist. So the State would do . . . what? And this is moral? On what planet? (Am I the only one who sees an &quot;Ominous Parallel&quot; here?)She also invoked &quot;rational selfishness&quot; as the moral basis of capitalism, leaving out any &quot;garbage&quot; about the &quot;common good.&quot; Now, that latter phrase ordinarily means the good literally common to all human beings (usually within a single society). In leaving out such &quot;garbage,&quot; Rand would appear to have left out a powerful argument for capitalism: that it serves our _genuine_ &quot;common good,&quot; by providing a society in which the rights of _each_ person are protected and respected. (Rand _did_ claim to have provided an &quot;egoistic&quot; foundation for those rights, but (a) it mostly isn't in this volume, and (b) it mostly isn't any good. I won't critique it here since it's in _The Virtue of Selfishness_.)As for &quot;rational selfishness&quot; as the moral foundation for capitalism: the free market provides economic checks and balances on _all_ behavior involving exchangeable goods -- including &quot;altruistic&quot; behavior like philanthropy and charitable contributions. As a moral foundation, &quot;rational altruism&quot; would have worked just as well. In fact the entire egoism/altruism dichotomy is beside the point; it's the &quot;rational&quot; part that's essential. (And I beg to doubt that Rand's understanding of &quot;rationality&quot; was adequate anyway.)Hmm. There doesn't seem to be all that much left of Rand's _moral_ case for capitalism.Nevertheless, as I've stated in my previous reviews, I still think this is her best book for quite other reasons, and she does do a fair job of cutting through some _other_ people's nonsense. Just be careful with her own."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"It is sometimes difficult in public to be objective about the ideas of Rand, for the reason that the hatred of her detractors and the devotion of her followers borders on the hysterical. It is best to contemplate her philosophy in private, and then communicate to those who perhaps are still open enough to consider sometimes very radical ideas. Rand's thinking on ethics is brilliant, and the best in the history of philosophy, but this book, summarizing her thoughts on the political ramifications of her ethics, is very flawed, and there are some very outlandish claims that are made if one views them from a scientific perspective.Economics is a difficult subject, and some might say not a science. But the financial interactions of humans can be studied scientifically, given the patience and the mathematical tools. Rand, and the other contributors of this book, do not do this anywhere in the articles. They are at best a loose, qualitative description of capitalist economics, and as such are not useful to those who really want to understand the dynamics of the capitalist economy. Rand calls capitalism \\"an unknown ideal\\" and laments the state of society (at that time), in that its not fairly represented in education or the popular media. The evidence she gives however is purely anecdotal, and she makes no attempt to cite empirical or historical studies. It is one thing to argue for the ethical foundations of capitalism, which she does so with incredible originality and skill. It is quite another to describe the inner workings of the economy and to prove causal connections between historical economic events.For example, Rand states in the first article 'What is Capitalism\\" that depressions and mass unemployment are not caused by the free market but by government interference into the economy. What evidence of this is there? Rand does not cite any empirical or historical data for this assertion, and even lacking such data, does not attempt even to construct a quantitative model that would lend some plausibility to her argument. In economic studies, mathematical modeling sometimes serves to shed light on a particular phenomenon when empirical data is lacking. Such a model can then be altered as the data is collected. Attempting to find the causes of depressions is a nontrivial affair, and something that economists and mathematicians have wrestled with for decades (if not centuries). Rand is very cavalier in her assertion here, and again, makes no attempt to prove it using a calm, rational, and scientific framework.In another article, written by her former collaborator, Nathaniel Brandon, and entitled 'Common Fallacies about Capitalism\\", he argues that free markets make monopolies impossible. His arguments utilize a sort of 'principal of arbitrage' (my words here), in that he argues that a monopoly that attempts to set prices will result in a competitor entering the field to take advantage of the high profits, thus closing the artificially high prices set by the monopoly. This is certainly plausible, but the time scales involved for the competitor may be too long to take advantage of the profitability. Getting into a highly technological business, such as chip manufacturing or drug discovery, may be too difficult and time-consuming for a competitor. And, Brandon still needs to justify his assertions with either an economic model or with an empirical study. He does not cite any historical evidence to support his claim.Capitalism as discussed in this book may not currently exist by the standards and definitions held by the authors of this book, and indeed one might believe that it has received an unfair and distorted hearing in academia and other circles. But human ingenuity has exploded in the last two decades, and shows no sign of abatement, despite the actions of the government and the existing tax structure. Perhaps maybe it is time to stop fixating on government inefficiencies and ineptitudes and continue to innovate. A society smart enough to invent and use genetic engineering, to create thinking machines, and to travel in space, will perhaps find dealing with the government mundane and rather trivial in the whole scheme of things, and perhaps not want to waste intellectual energy on tirades against government bureaucracies.One can only speculate what Rand would think of the dizzying pace of technological development in the 21st century, but I think it would be fair to say, judging by the utterances of the characters of her novels, she would forget her moral outrage, and would find life in the 21st century exhilirating..."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"This book is a great defense of Capitalism and an excellent introduction to what exactly Capitalism is and is not.

Sure. Aside from the minor matter of monopolization and globalization, two examples of the very wealthy realizing that working together makes for still more wealth, when did compacts of distrust ever improve anything, let alone our relationships with one another?To blame the liberals and existentialists and socialists and Kantians for capitalism's limitations is a bit like blaming Mister Rogers for the fact that dangerous toys get taken off the market before they can turn a profit.We need to be appraised of the wonders of capitalism about as much as the &quot;virtue of selfishness.&quot; All of us see it operating every day, and usually to the complete disadvantage of the populations of people it marginalizes in the name of progress, good boundaries, and philosophical enlightenment."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"See Dr. John Robbins' Without a Prayer: Ayn Rand and the Close of Her System for a scholarly rebuttal to Objectivism."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"I truly hope that this book is widely read by the general public.

As Ayn Rand is the author most quoted by \\"libertarians\\", \\"free-traders\\", and advocates of \\"hands off\\" capitalism this also applies.Her philosophy of Objectivism is the philosophy of sociopathy, of the ego freed from the restraints of social conscience. All that is important is gratification of the ego. There is no room for community, no room for humanity, no room for God- the individual ego is God. To the objectivist, \\"altruism\\", lending a hand or doing good for it's own sake, is a dirty word. I have heard a leading spokesman for Rand's philosophy denounce Hitler primariy because he was too \\"altruistic.\\" Make of that what you will. In our own time, the proponets of unrestrained corporate power, and of the dismantling of elected government, love Rand. They tell you that only governments can \\"initiate force.\\" This is the Big Lie- there is no moral difference between shooting a man and starving him to death through economic control of resources- or controlling people through the threat of it. Rand and her objectivists are usually very adept at formal argument and logic. However, their basic premises are so absolutely inhumane that their arguments are mere castles in the air. Castles empty of humanity and God, but filled with evil.I sometimes wonder what sort of childhood abuse in her native Russia could have warped Rand so seriously.

I have a very high standard of living because of it.

Do you really think that letting people do whatever they like no matter how extreme is really the answer to establishing some kind of just and stable world conducive to creativity, never mind the utopia Rand drones about? How, for example, is unbridled capitalism supposed to deal with environmental issues? Take a trip to some crappy Third World country and take a deep breath and right away you'll learn what it's like not to have regulations on pollution. But don't drink the water! And how is the marketplace supposed to handle new pharmaceuticals, etc? simply wait for people to start dying off and let the marketplace punish the snake oil salesmen by simply letting them go out of business because nobody will buy their thalidomide anymore?

I was, at first, repulsed by it. Every fiber of my Catholic educated body told me that it was wrong. However, I was away from the Church, and the arguments seemed to make sense. As I progressed through my graduate program I discovered that libertarian ideas are highly attractive. This book became a hand book for me in every public policy class I took.From here I read Milton Friedman, Tom Sowell, and other free market luminaries. I was much more comfortable with Friedman and Sowell than Rand, but I was very taken with objectivism nonetheless. I had discovered a sure fire way to get A's on public policy papers. Plug EVERY issue into a simple formula:The argument is simply this: the government has a monopoly on the use of force; therefore the government is exceedingly dangerous. Free-markets operate without coercion. The end.This argument runs through this entire book, regardless of who the wrote the article in question.Now, several years out of graduate school, a father and a church goer, I am shocked at how gullible I was. Rand, an atheist, elevates the market to where only God ought reside. What results is a perverse ideology where \\"the common good\\" is a concept to be mocked. Rand's ideas are nothing new. They are recycled and economically presented social darwinism.Thus, Rand becomes part and parcel with the culture of death. In her thought abortion is a positive good as it allows a woman to pursue her goals in the marketplace without the encumbrance of family and children. Family loyalty, even love, are all superfluous in her hyper-individualistic vision. The older I get, the more I realize that the challenge for the true conservative today is to articulate why one believes that the market is the best way to pursue the common good. Justice is not an outmoded concept, and part of justice is recognizing that each and every person (regardless of their merit) has a right to dignity as a child of God.In the end Rand's vision as articulated in this collection of essays easily leads to the commodification of the human person. I am still a conservative. I still \\"like\\" the market. However, the market exists to be of use to human persons. Human persons do not exist to serve the market. Increasingly we are losing sight of this, and Rand is one of the intellectual founders of a strand of conservatism that is dangerously misguided and simplistic.All of this of course has much to do with what is happening in the Republican party right now. Currently, many in the party are disenchanted with social conservatism. \\"Abandon the stand on life issues and gay marriage etc.\\" they argue. Thus, we can focus on what really matters: free enterprise.The problem with this is simple. Real conservatives who have an understanding of natural law will not sit back and be silent while a bunch of hoity toity academics try to get us to turn our back on values that are objectively true, given the fact that every human being is a unique and created child of God.

He explains on page 107 that it is a \\"shabby secret\\" of repeatedly giving the American people \\"deficit spending as a hidden scheme for the confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights.

Rand distinguishes between the objectively minded individual and the second-handers by distinguishing between their respective cognitive approaches to their perceptions: The second-handers are concrete-bound; they exist in a perceptual world; they perceive images, shapes and sounds, they feel what others have decided is good or bad, right or wrong and they follow along never forming an OBJECTIVE opinion of their own, hence the name second-handers. They make much of perceptions (such as the spelling or misspelling of a word) without ever going beyond, that is: integrating their perceptions in to a concept and using in an attempt at problem solving. They are stuck at the perceptual level. Indeed, to them a misspelling of a word is a Great Big Deal: that is as far as their journey takes them; The conceptual meaning of a word isn't important to a second-hander, only the perceptual part matters, for that is the EXTENT of their understanding, Why, if you don't have that spelling correct, you must not know what you are doing! Implicit in the second-hander's &quot;logic&quot; is that if you could only spell everything correctly, keep all of your perceptual aspects in line, why you would, armed with such accomplishments, be able to surmount any and every problem that could come your way! As Rand makes clear in all of her writings, including Capatilism: the unknown ideal, (sic) the key to man reaching his goal, that is his individual happiness or individuality, is using his mind, in a very logical manner in solving the problems which befront him in his pursuit. The only way such obstacles, as one perceives in one's daily life, can be surmounted, is through CONCEPT FORMATION: the integration of one's perceptions in to a concept: a tool useful, to the reality of one's problems to serve as a means to a solution. This can be anything from a simple cause and effect relationship all the way to high level abstract mathematical reasoning.

In a nutshell, Rand defends Capitalism as the most moral system because it is the only one that fully respects property rights. Without property rights, no other rights are possible, and most of our economic and social problems stem from violations of individual and property rights.Most of the criticisms of this book overlook the fundamental theme. It is very possible you may not care for the way Rand presents her arguments, or dislike certain terms she uses. But if you don't like the salesman's presentation, don't blame the merchandise.Rand's views were highly influenced by the Austrian School of thought in economics, so if it is an economic treatise you're looking for, I suggest you start with the writings of Ludwig Von Mises, F.A. Hayek, or Murray Rothbard."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal is one of the most fascinating publications I have ever read. In it, Rand affirmed a strong belief in self-improvement through rational thinking and to place a higher priority on reasoning ability as opposed to having oneself guided by mere whims or emotions that have no foundational bases supporting them.It is quite noble how Rand tried to enforce the theme that for one to live life fully, every action must have a guided reason as much as possible. Living according to the dictates of others or being a mere reactionary to what happens on a day-to-day basis reduces one to a form that is less than an accomplished human being with defined clarity and purpose.From various angles, Rand attacked the philosophies and institutions, both secular and religious, that have espoused doctrines that are, in nature, altruistic. Frequently, she would cite that for a people to be free, the rights of the individual must be of primary importance, not those of the group or collective that the concerned person happens to belong to.From having read this book, as well as Rand's The Virtue of Selfishness, I can understand how one could be wary of those who might give speeches, formal or informal, whose main idea or motive (whether it has the best of intentions) centralizes the concept of where one is to be a part of \\"something that is bigger than myself\\". Rand intermittently argued from a personal, yet universal, perspective that for a philosophy to guide man's existence and to strengthen a nation, as a whole, it must keep the right of the individual intact and that any idea that subordinates the individual to a group is dangerous, locally and encyclically.Throughout, Rand stated that from the slightest suppression of individual rights has spawned problems hampering the ability of a society to function. Among the stated are political pull, mob rule, anarchy, political tyrrany, all of which essentially leave no room for anyone to act or communicate in a free manner.Perhaps, most importantly, Rand hypothesized how self-destructive it would be to forgo any attempt to establish an unwavering, meaningful philosophy, especially in cases where reason and emotion are mutually exclusive. Anything less would be compromise, leaving the individual somewhat unhappy, at best, or under the influence of physical and psychological abuse, at worst. A thorough analysis of this work of Rand might make one ponder the role that politics and religion should have in his/her life.Overall, this is a book that will make you think. At the introduction, Rand stated that in order to know better the philosophical foundations of Objectivist Ethics in Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, one should read The Virtue of Selfishness first, which I agree. If anyone wonders what could possibly follow up to Capitalism, I would recommend Return of the Primitive, which takes on not only altruism but also pinpoints on the causes, effects and patterns of nihilism, which Rand complained was being touted through the contemporary philosophy classes that introduced students to the ideas created and inspired by the writings of Immanuel Kant.In terms of how one might be positively influenced by this book, I would say that reason, as Rand described it, can be a most powerful tool in creating a win-win situation for everyone who achieves, not just self. One word of warning: Rand, through her words, even two decades after her demise, can leave an indelible mark upon minds that can still be molded. I would recommend that you should take the power of reason and of logical thinking seriously, but do not let it get confused with what could lead to taking yourself too seriously."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"While it's hardly arguable that capitalism is an economic system capable of generating immense wealth, not many people have tried defending capitalism from a moral viewpoint.

Not only does Rand et al dispell widely held myths and misconceptions about the workings of the free-market in theory and throughout history, but they also present a relentless moral case for freedom. There is no garbage about &quot;the common good,&quot; or &quot;the greatest benefit to the greatest number,&quot; but rather, a consistent appeal to the right of each human being to his life, liberty, and property. Moreover, not only is the case made from the simple standpoint of natural rights, but also from the more controversial framework of ethicial egoism, or, to put it more clearly, rational selfishness. Nevertheless, some of Rand's ideas concerning the actual framework of a free society are a bit off the mark, such as her scheme for financing government through a lottery or her aversion to violent civil resistance. Regardless of this, the work is solid, and I give it my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Read this book.My whole life i had questions i couldn't answer. Why did god create me and give me a free will for the sole purpose of forcing me to subjugate my will to his? How can they draft some one into a war and still pretend to uphold 'the right to life'? How come my parents should pay taxes to pay for a highschool drop out's unemployment? Why should education be paid for by everyone when my parents had 5 kids but there are some people who didn't have any? If there are people who are good at earning money with money, and there are people who can only waste it, then why tax the people who are good at making it and give it to the ones who will waste it? Why can't money stay with the person who made it in the first place?As i grew up... these questions still bothered me. I started reading philosophy... I started with Nietzche and Satre and even opened Kant a few times. They all said that truth was unknowable and that reason has no place in reality. Nietzche wasn't a very happy fellow. He told me to do what i want and that it was the right thing to do just because i wanted to. None of this particularly appealed to me or seemed right. Nietzche was fun to read.. but only because I would imagine playing drinking games with him..Then i read my first book by Ayn rand. She never expected you to accept anything on faith or on her good name. Every premise that she introduces starts at its base axiom then extends into the upper foliage of her brilliant philosophy. Nothing is added as a legacy to older thought or on faith or as some cloudy vague notion of spirituality or 'humanity'.Pointed in the right direction, i saw the answers to my questions.I understand that there are those who refuse to function on a logical level. (I wonder how these people hope to contribute anything but trivia to our culture. Feelings never built a bridge or even churned butter.) This book is not for them.If you fancy yourself a rational mind, this book is for you. This is one of her more eloquent and poingant works. This a good place to begin reading Rand.

Her arguments deal not with the trivial myopic analysis of trivial economic data but with timeless abstractions that span human history.

Of particular interest is Greenspan's essay on Antitrust, given the current government witchhunt against Microsoft. Alienation by Branden is a refutes the aformentioned Marxian concept, while the Man's Rights Apendix lays a good foundation for Rand's rights theory. Overall, most of these essays are worthwile.Of course, as an anarchist, I take issue with a few of the ideas presented in Capitalism, especially the Nature of Government essay which totally misses the mark on anarchism and makes a weak argument against polycentric law.Nevertheless, I wholeheartidly recommend the book, radical capitalism at its (almost) finest!"},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"I just finished this book and loved it!

It is, unless you want control over other people, or access to things they make!Being free to think and act (not forcing others) means owning the produce of that thinking and acting, ie property. Without the right to the product of your thinking and acting why think and act? What happens inder those conditions is well demonstrated by the impoverished communist nations like Cuba.Rand analyses each topic with the same insight and logic, debunking myths and exposing fraudulent ideologies - its a fascinating journey, often challenging.Definately a must have for anyone interested in liberty, in politics and in how some nations became rich, whilst others did not."},{"Title":"Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal (Library Edition)","review":"Perhaps one of the most powerful defenses of capitalism yet written, this book explodes most criticism of it.

I was hesitant, at first, to get this book because the articles are written from the late forties to late sixties, however, the timeless quality of the articles really shine through. They are so well put together that they stand the test of time. Contributing author Alan Greenspan was the longest sitting chairman of the Fed, so that alone is enough to understand the importance that this book has for current and past economic policy in the United States.Unlike many other essay collections, this book has a great progression of essays.

A few of my favorite essays contained within include:* What is Capitalism? -- Ayn Rand's delineation of Capitalism as a political system where individuals live according to the Trader Principle and have a minimal, but central government to prevent the initiation of physical force and fraud.* Antitrust -- Alan Greenspan's excellent essay that attacks Antitrust legislation as subjective, harmful and immoral.* Gold and Economic Freedom -- Alan Greenspan's essay on the need for objective currency. In particular, he suggests a return to a 100% gold standard.* Patents and Copyrights -- Ayn Rand's views on the necessity and morality of intellectual property rights.* Theory and Practice -- Ayn Rand's views on the invalidity of the \\"Mind-Body Dichotomy\\", which is also known as the \\"Theory-Practice Dichotomy\\" or the \\"Thought-Action Dichotomy\\".* The Wreckage of the Consensus -- Ayn Rand's views on the debacle that was the war in Vietnam. In my opinion, reading this essay really suggests how she would view the current war in Iraq.* Man's Rights -- in this essay, Ayn Rand discusses what individual rights are and where they come from. Specifically, she argues that rights come from the nature of man (not from divine origin, society or law) and what they mean in practice.* The Nature of Government -- this essay contains Ayn Rand's view on government's as an agency of force, how the only proper purpose for a government is to safeguard the rights of men, how the only legitimate functions of government are those necessary to preserve individual rights (i.e., police force, army and a court system) and the necessity for a strong, central government to serve as a final arbiter on the use of retaliatory force.

Capitalism was just the natural conclusion.In any case, the collection of essays presented here are an excellent example of historical evidence as well as philosophical reasoning behind the idea that Capitalism is the only moral political system in existence.That may shock many potential buyers of the book, but Rand et al present a series of compelling arguments backed up with historical evidence that spans the nation's history to prove their point: Never, not once in America's history, did free enterprise capitalism ever cause ANY of the economic problems that have plagued this country. From the railroads, to the child labor laws, to antitrust regulations...all were caused by Government regulation and interference in the free market.

I can understand that it may seem a little &quot;preachy&quot; to some, but you cannot deny the logic and intelligence of her ideas. All it requires is for people to think long and hard about it. An example of the logic: If you leave people to do whatever they want to do, whether it is working to make a profit or helping others, or both, they will do it better through personal choice than through coercion. You can see it in microcosm with the way individuals intereact with each other - whether it be trade or any other type of interaction. If it ever appears otherwise, that means there are other factors involved.

We voted for all the wrong things, and our representatives never stopped to explain to us that we were wrong. They liked the power. Now we have given them the power to be fascists.

The book begins with the basics of the various color spaces and how images are perceived by the human vision system. From that point, the chapters are grouped into the types of image transformations. Formulas are explained either graphically or with very simple mathematical notation. Before and after pictures are provided for each transformation. In chapter five, the author goes into some introductory computer vision and object recognition techniques. The handling of morphological processing is exceptional. The chapter on image compression does a good basic job of getting its ideas across to the reader. However, only the most basic compression techniques are explained in detail such as truncation and Huffman coding. JPEG and motion compression are just verbally described, due to the introductory nature of this text. More recent compression methods such as those involving wavelets are omitted. Part four of the book, \\"Image Operation Studies\\", is effective at hammering home what was discussed in the first three parts of the book. In part four, the author describes the algorithmic implementation of 39 of the image transformations described in the book, with the resulting images. This makes for an excellent summary and review for the student.

Alleyn, with the help of his assistant, Inspector Fox, and his Watson, Nigel Bathgate, is called in by an overbusy local police authority to investigate a murder among a group of people who are more stereotypical than realistic. But this is where \\"Overture\\" departs from most Marsh mysteries, for it was written mainly to cruelly and unfairly attack the writer Dorothy L. Sayers, whom Marsh loathed.The most prominent characters in this novel are two middle-aged spinsters: Miss Idris Campanula, a wealthy orphan, and Miss Eleanor Prentice, a cousin of the local squire. But neither is a realistic, three-dimensional character: they're both stupid, hysterical, pathetic, pitiful, worthless, dried-up old religion-mad harpies with both a Freudian hatred of sex and a secret unrequited passion for the local rector. They shriek, they howl, they stage scenes, they passive-aggressively meddle, they make life a living hell for everyone around them, and it's all so wildly unrealistic. It made my eyes glaze over and, worse, made it far too easy to figure out whodunit.So what does this have to do with Sayers? Marsh, who deeply distrusted anyone with a strong religious bent and who may have been personally offended by the events in Sayers'sUnnatural Death, believed that Sayers was a pathetic old biddy who had created Lord Peter so she could fall vicariously in love with a man who wouldn't pester her with tiresome demands for sex. This is of course a load of hooey: Sayers was as sexually adventurous as any woman of the time, as her recently published letters show, but she was very touchy about the fact that she had secretly borne a child out of wedlock and therefore kept her personal life under lock and key. (And rightly so, since had the fact been known to the general public both her careers - lay theologian and popular writer - would have been destroyed.) Careful readers of this book will notice that Henry, the son of the squire, is said to look more like Miss Prentice (his father's cousin) than he does his own father. One suspects that Marsh had got ahold of Sayers's secret and was originally intending to build the murder around Henry being Miss Prentice's illegitimate child which, given the misunderstanding of Freud that permeates the book, would have \\"explained\\" Miss Prentice's passive-aggressive, repressed hysteria. As is, she took the book in a different direction, leaving the clues in place possibly to twig Ms. Sayers. (Incidentally, both spinsters' surnames are meant to give away the game. Miss Campanula's surname means \\"bell ringer\\" and refers to Sayers'sThe Nine Tailors; Miss Prentice of the Hall refers to Prentice-Hall, Ms. Sayers's publishers.)The other characters are tolerable but all still fit into standard stereotypes: the modern young couple portrayed as wholesome and clean-cut despite seemingly smoking ten packs of cigarettes a day each, the robust county squire, the morally steadfast but emotionally weak rector, the romantically deluded doctor and the woman who's pulling the wool over his eyes, etc. This is all standard Marsh and doesn't detract from the mystery. Idris and Eleanor, on the other hand, are so stupidly offensive that they ruin the book.I don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Overture To Death (A Roderick Alleyn Mystery)","review":"Those familiar with Ngaio Marsh and her Roderick Alleyn novels know that her writing style isn't the frenzied roller-coaster ride so popular today. She takes her time letting you know her characters and slyly sending up the upper classes of her day. However, in \\"Overture to Death,\\" four or five chapters slip by simply exploring the petty machinations of two village harpies: a pair of gossipy, spiteful, meddlesome spinsters without equal. The endless focus of these parodies of the malicious spinster droned on so long that I nodded off several time. While sometimes humorous, a lot less of Eleanor Prentice and Idris Campanula would have gone a long way in helping speed the pace a bit.Once past the lengthy exposition and when the overbearing Miss Campanula gets what's coming to her and Alleyn comes on the scene, however, the novel picks up quite a bit. I recommend the book to Marsh fans like myself; however, those who make \\"Overture to Death\\" their first taste of Marsh are unlikely to be back for seconds. Newcomers are better off starting with \\"Man Lay Dead (The Ngaio Marsh Collection),\\" \\"Artists in Crime (Dead Letter Mysteries),\\" or \\"Death in a White Tie.\\""},{"Title":"Overture To Death (A Roderick Alleyn Mystery)","review":"Marsh introduces Nigel Bathgate (my favorite supporting character with the possible exception of Agatha Troy) in this book (and Troy by the device of a letter--similar to some of Marsh's other works). I do think he matures in her later works though. Still he's fun as is this book in particular which has far more humor than most of Marsh's other novels. She wrote 32 of them (about one every 18 months on average). As usual she employs lots of Britishisms but also interesting languaging: p. 17: \\"She's like a French caricature of an English spinster\\" & p. 206: \\"It's as clear as the mud in your eye.\\" She also employs an interesting technique in which she lists each character's thoughts/impressions consecutively during a meeting of the main characters. This gives a deeper insight than usual into the thought processes of the characters--lending additional depth to her novel. The overall plot is clever with numerous red herrings to tie you up in knots. Pun intended. It's a very nice read--one of her better efforts IMHO."},{"Title":"Overture To Death (A Roderick Alleyn Mystery)","review":"For Ngaio Marsh fans, this book is a must. The usual deft and scathing descriptions of small-town characters had me rolling on the floor. I can never play the Rachmaninoff opening bars again without collapsing in laughter.

One of the reasons that people look down on mystery novels, is that often they are about plot with scant attention paid to the literary aspects. Not so with Ngaio Marsh."},{"Title":"Overture To Death (A Roderick Alleyn Mystery)","review":"I'm uncertain exactly where to locate a review of the unabridged audio version of the book but this seems about as good a place as any. The reading is by a noted British actress and personality who uses a variety of different names for her readings. Nadia May it is for this one.Dame Ngaio is particularly well served by a reading-acting out of her text since the structure of many of her books reflects the staging of a play. In Overture, the first major section, setting up the characters and the crime, particularly reflects this approach, being dramatically sound, involving us deeply in the cast of players and the strong cross-currents which their love, jealousy, hate, irritation, fears, and other emotional responses engender, as they lead, almost inevitably, to the ultimate murder.Over-all, I would rank this book among the better ones in the Inspector Alleyn series, as she passes before our senses the classic types, the young lovers, the strikingly handsome but weak,though good-spirited minister, the aging head of an aristocratic family fallen on hard times, the spinster who comes to live in his home with the passing of her sister, his wife, and the wealthy spinster do-gooder who is officious and overbearing to a fault. There are fine characterizations, some excellent exemplary scenes, an interesting murder, and the usual team of Alleyn and Fox (which has become so familiar due to the TV production). Her portrait of the English Village gives one a sense of reality ( of what was) although I have no idea how well it reflects the actuality of her times. The puzzle is a good one, the killer a suitable one, whose very definition implies his or her guilt.The reader does an excellent job in giving each a voice appropriate to the role played, interest is maintained throughout. I can recommend the audio book (in unabridged form, the only one I have heard) to any follower of Marsh and to most detective story fans who are open to the classic mystery form."},{"Title":"Overture To Death (A Roderick Alleyn Mystery)","review":"Ms. Marsh is definitely one of the top writers of the classic English puzzle mystery, and this book bears that out.

I couldn't believe how quickly I fell back into Roderick Alleyn and his sidekick Brer Fox. It was like meeting old friends. Alleyn is unique in the detective genre. He's very much a gentleman, but smart as a whip. Ms. Marsh also does the English village mystery in style. Her characters are realistic and believable, and it feels like you can picture them as you read.

There are strange forces at work in this book, for good and bad. Ukiah is one of a number of complex, fascinating characters caught up in things they don't, at first, comprehend. He and his partner, his family, and a well-realized love interest are struggling to put together a puzzle with ever increasing stakes. This book is adventure, character development, mystery and near-future science fiction in one. The pacing is fast and even, the characters real, the prose beautiful but never intrusive. The climax is shocking, and the ending...well, let's say it lives up to the rest of the book. If you liked the movie Aliens, like mysteries, or enjoy science fiction, you should love this book."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"This is one of the better escapist fiction novels I've read in awhile. The characters have good development. The plot is complicated but moves well. The X-file elements are well done and different enough to provide continued interest. I've read all of the books in the series and would say that they were well worth the time to read. I doubt I'd ever reread these books but I would pick up a new novel with the same characters.I started this series because I discovered the author through his Tinker series. I prefer the Tinker series because the universe there isn't quite as dark as that portrayed in this series."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"This was the first book by this author that I have read and I have read a lot of scifi/fantasy. On the whole I enjoyed the book; I liked the charactors and the relationships between them.It's a little confusing at the beginning, because Ukiah hasn't figured out what is going on and why he is so different; so you learn as he does. If you don't like scifi/fantasy this isn't for you. If you do, you may like this one; I did."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed this novel, and like other readers, it inspired me to get two of the other two books in the series. The characters are sympathetic, and the book is well-paced. If you like scifi and werewolf stories and mysteries, you'll probably like this."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"This is one of those rare finds that you demolish in two days, keeping it strapped to your body so you can return to it whenever you have a five-minute break. Crisply written, events unfold at a good pace (clipping along, but at the same time, not too fast), the characters are interesting, what happens is believable and fascinating, and just when you think you have it figured out, something twists. Loved it!!!"},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"When I picked this book up I will admit to having been hooked by the cover, and the back blurb on content....but when I began to read this wonderfully unusual book...I fell in love with the character Ukiah and his mentor Max. The plot keeps you glued to the pages...the supporting characters are fantastic...I would love to see this become a series....and look forward to more from Wen Spencer. I recommend this book to all who love a mix of science fiction, fantasy and suspense."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"I have to say that this is one of the better books I have read this month. (I average 20 books per month) The characters were entertaining, as well as breaking from stereotypical roles. Ukiah, the main character, is well written, and the details of his talents are very well written. If you like suspense, as well as atypical heroes and heroines, this is one of my suggestions. The concept of the Pack and the Ontongard is very entertaining, as well as being a refreshing take on the traditional invasion motif. I don't want to say more, to avoid spoiling the book, but I wholeheartedly suggest this as a good book. I picked it up originally because of the cover art and the wolf theme, and I didn't put it down til I was finished.I look forward to seeing other works by this offer. ("},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"Alien Taste is one of the better science fiction I have read in the last two years. The story has depth. It has an appealing protagonist, a riveting plot and a colourful supporting cast. I am glad there are more to come. I wanted to give 5 stars but I am just irked by the writing style which has much to be desired. I hope Spencer would strive to improve her English. I am not asking for classic literature standard but the flow of words could be much better. Will definitely follow the series."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"I picked up both books in the series. This is a great new twist on the old werewolf stories. I am looking forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"Fantastic!!! It is always nice to find an new writer who can write a story that seems to flow off the pages. Wen Spencer is one of these people.Alien Taste has everything needed to keep your attention riveted to the story. A great story line, wonderful characters and fantastic action.This is a KEEPER.Don't miss the sequel."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"I've read and re-read Alien Taste several times now and still find myself noticing things that I hadn't in the past. The story line is a different twist on the &quot;alien invasion&quot; theme and will grab your attention quite quickly.The characters in the book, Ukiah, Max and the others are believably written and very well developed, which can be unusual in books of this kind. The action and suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat, and (for many) will have the hair on the back of your neck standing straight up !Definitely well worth reading, and a series well worth buying.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"Food and fiction have a lot in common: what distinguishes delightful offerings are often not the ingredients, but the way they are arranged. Wen Spencer's Alien Taste takes four motifs -- feral child, private eye, DNA manipulation, alien invasion -- and whips up a high-voltage, splash-in-your-face, original, really endearing novel with a pace, and sensibility, and voice all its own. Plus, this almost all takes place in Pittsburgh, with pinpoint spot-on gritty locale. A gratifying new novel by a new author for a new decade unfurling in science fiction."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"As a writer myself, I am quite impressed with Alien Taste. Especially as a first novel. Spencer has the gift of storytelling, and transcends the genre boxes that publishers try so hard to seal readers into. The characters pop off the page (which is a rare thing in adventure/thriller-type fiction), and I will remember them clearly when the denizens of books read afterward have long faded. The situations stand out, and they, too, will stick in my memory. Most notable, from a technical standpoint, is that though there is an amazing amount of sheer weirdness in this book, Spencer manages to introduce it seamlessly; in such a way that one goes &quot;Okay, I'll buy that for now&quot; through every twist and turn. Most importantly, this book is a page-turner. I will not be surprised to see Wen Spencer becoming one of the standard names in beach book reading in coming years (not to mention TV or movie fodder). There is a real spark here."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"Ukiah Oregon is a mystery. His past is a blank and even his name is not really his own. It was given to him by his foster mothers, who discovered him in the wild, being raised by a pack of wolves. Perhaps as a result of his unusual upbringing, his senses are more acute than those of most people and his sensory memory is phenomenal. He works for a private investigation agency that specializes in missing persons, and he has gained a reputation as an extraordinary tracker.One case turns deadly when Ukiah and his partner, Max, are called to a murder scene - 3 female house-mates have been killed and the fourth, a respected scientist, is missing. The police believe that the killer has her, and want Ukiah and Max to track them down. At the end of the night, the woman is dead and Ukiah is badly wounded.This is just the beginning of this fascinating story, because on that night, Ukiah discovers a thread that may lead him to his past, to who he really is. As he explores this road, he discovers things about himself that he never would have imagined, and his perspective on life is changed forever. The author has given a classic fantasy myth with a clever sci-fi twist and this reader looks forward to seeing how the series progresses.If there is one jarring note, it is that a secondary character figures out and accepts Ukiah's secret with extraordinary suspension of disbelief. SPOILER --- despite all the sci-fi shows on TV about vampires, aliens and other supernatural beings, very few people actually believe that such things actually exist on Earth. It is much easier to believe that another person has very strange abilities, than to jump to the conclusion that they aren't human at all."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"This is the kind of book you would love to nominate for an award. When I bought the book and read the back cover I still wasn't certain what the book was about, but since I have very eclectic tastes I deceided to try it. This has something to appeal to everyone; mystery, sci-fi, romance, action, drama, etc. It is so cleverly written that every time you think you've figured it out it takes another seamless yet startling twist. One of the other reviewers here (Charles W. Schultz) delivered an admirable synopsis without giving away any of the wonderful surprises. When I finished the book I felt like a chapter in my own life had ended. How can you top something that good? I told my Husband (a strictly 'technical manual &amp; magazine' reader) that I just finished one of the most wonderful books I've ever read (I average 4-5 books per week) and he asked me to tell him about it. That was a shock! But he said I sounded so excited yet looked so sad that he was really curious about this one. I told him the whole story; and in case you're wondering the only reason I looked sad was because I was genuinely sorry that the book had to end. This is the book you'll read over &amp; over again and refuse to 'loan' to your friends. Tell them to go out and buy their own copy - they'll want to keep it too!"},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"Ukiah Oregon has a photographic memory, but he can remember nothing of his childhood. He was raised by wolves in Ukiah, Oregon and found by a biology student who adopted and raised him. He has no idea how old he is, who his parents were - nothing. His moms (he has two mothers, no father) try to find out about his past by hiring a private investigator, but Max Bennett can find nothing. However, as Max learns more about Ukiah, he discovers that Ukiah's specialty is finding people/things so he offers him a job, and eventually makes Ukiah his partner. When three women are found dead and the fourth presumed kidnapped, Ukiah and Max are called in to find her. Using his heightened senses, Ukiah finds the fourth woman...and a clue to his past. The dead women leads Ukiah to The Pack, a dangerous motorcycle gang. Ukiah knows that they have information about his past, but are they willing to share it? (This is purposely a vague summary of the book because to give any more information would ruin the surprises and the storyline.)I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story was a fresh twist on the whole alien invasion and &quot;Wolf Boy&quot; stories. Wen Spencer has created finely crafted characters that the reader truly feels for. Yes, Ukiah has all of these special abilities, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't need help, that he doesn't get scared, that he doesn't wonder why he is different. Max, Ukiah's partner, is a suffering widower who becomes a kind of father to Ukiah and watches out for him. Indigo is a tough FBI Agent (the Pack calls her the Lady of Steel), but she has a soft spot for Ukiah and finds herself falling in love with him. Ukiah's family was also delightful - his two moms and his sister, Cassie added nice touches of &quot;normality&quot; (such as it is for this book) to the story.This book is set 2 years in the future (2004), but everything is recognizable. People have a few more electronic toys than we have now and we have successfully sent a machine to Mars, but Spencer doesn't really put anything in that couldn't be done in the foreseeable future.Wen Spencer has a very nice writing style (and a good editor - no typos) and the plot was well-paced. In short, this book is full of action and mystery and well worth your time!"},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"I'm not a big Science Fiction reader, but I've read the four books in this series and found them quite enjoyable. There were a few glitches that did not bode well with reality, but I shrugged it off. After all, if I wanted to read a true to life book, I would have chosen a realistic fiction.The main character is very likable. His sometimes childlike innocense mixed with deep wisdom (from where, not even he knows) makes you want to love him."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"This novel is a lot of fun. It starts as a sort of offbeat mystery with great characters, good action and nicely styled plot twists. Then it takes a zing off the beaten path and turns into science fiction teritory. through it all the characters remain true and well defined, the story keeps moving and the action even gets better. There's probably two full novels in here but this one works great for introducing the leads, framing the setting (Pittsburgh area) and setting the premise. A very good read for a first or even a fifth novel. I look forward to the next by this author."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"Speed.... High Speed. That's the way to describe this novell. You follow an &quot;former&quot; wolf-boy, with special ablities. You get no rest when you start to read this book. Even in the end of the novell, when it gets very SF, you want to know how it ends.I liked this story very much.The only downfall is the small size of the novell. 200 pages more would have been nice.Anyway, a must-read."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"Alien Taste (2001) is the first SF novel in the Ukiah Oregon series. It is set mostly in Pittsburgh, PA, within the current timeframe.In this novel, Ukiah Oregon is an adolescent male who had been running with the wolves for many seasons. During a bad winter at Umatilla National Park, the wolves were starving and the wolf boy was avoiding his pack. He found a trap with a dead rabbit for bait and decided to let himself be caught. He could always escape later.Mama Jo was a graduate student studying wolf behavior. When she found a feral human in her trap, she took him home to Pittsburgh. She named him after the Oregon town nearest the trap. She taught him biology and zoology.Mama Lara was a graduate student in astronomy. She and Mama Jo had wanted a child, so they raised Ukiah. She taught Ukiah astronomy. Later Mama Lara gave birth to his foster sister Cally.Maxwell Bennett is a private detective. Before his wife's death in an accident, Max had been a successful software magnate. Then he was hired to discover Ukiah's origins. Although failing that task, Max grew to like the boy and occasionally hired him as a tracker. Now they are partners in the private investigator business.Kraynak is a detective in the Pittsburgh Police Department. He and Max were military policemen in the same unit during the Gulf war. Since they were both from Pittsburgh, the friendship continued after the war.In this story, Kraynak has arranged a contract for Ukiah to track a missing woman in a murder case. Three women are dead within the house from what looks like sword wounds. The missing woman had fled through the back door.Ukiah follows tracks and blood traces through the heavily wooded area. He finds a cop dead from sword wounds among the tree and realizes that the missing woman was the killer. Then he finds the fugitive and is attacked by her. He gets off two shots with his pistol before falling unconscious.When Ukiah comes to, he sees the woman's body lying before him. He also hears a man and a woman having a strange conversation nearby. Then he finds a mouse in his blood and slips it into his shirt pocket.Ukiah is found by Kraynak, following directions from Max tracking the tracer in his gear. The EMS crew takes Ukiah to the hospital. The Emergency doctor tells him that he was lucky to get only a few cuts. Soon Ukiah is allowed to go home to his foster mothers and Cally.This tale presents a young man with an eidetic memory and an uncanny ability to read DNA traces. He also heals quickly from very serious wounds without any scars. His friends and family don't understand his abilities, but just accept them without undue questions.Then Ukiah finds relatives in a motorcycle gang. The next installment isTainted Trail.

But ultimately this novel falls flat. The dialog is very poorly written. And while science fiction writers can certainly assume a number of improbable things it is best to be parsimonious. The author dishes them out in medium-large expository lumps.On the whole, it was a bit too much like watching a remake of &quot;The Thing&quot; set in Pittsburgh."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"The book was a big disappointment.Highly hyped and recommended.The story fizzled quickly and the characters were duds.If I could say anything about the book, it would be that some really neat ideas were ruined by uncompelling writing."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"Actually I already have this book in hard copy and bought it to read again on my Kindle, it's a warm, interesting story that is rather unique. It's a keeper!"},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"Someone recommended this book to me ages ago, and it's languished on my TBR pile because I could never get past the title. Even now, knowing what goes on in the book, I hate it. It really does the book no favors because the mystery of Ukiah's heritage which is supposed to carry the first two-thirds of the book becomes not a mystery at all. It becomes a waiting game for Ukiah to catch up to the reader, which lessened my connection to him during that time. I also got drastically slowed down by the florid writing and exposition dumps in the first few chapters. Seriously, I almost put it down. I'm glad I didn't. About a third of the way into the story, the writing smoothed out into something more readable for me, and the story itself started getting more engaging.There are never really any surprises in this as most developments get telegraphed in advance, but the characters and the depth of feeling between them helps to compensate for that. I liked the relationship between Ukiah and his partner Max best; Max filled a much needed role in the young man's life. Though I liked the character of Agent Indigo Zheng, I didn't really believe the instant love that happened between her and Ukiah. Still, it was nice to see a strong woman who wasn't a bitch. I'll be picking up the second book in the series. In the end, it's worth it to hang around these characters more."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"Once I started reading I couldn't put it down.

Detective stories aren't usually a reread for me, especially right away, but I've reread these before they are due back at the library, and I think I'll buy my own copies sometime in the near future. I've loved her other works, and now I think I'll make her an autobuy. Wen Spencer is a good author who doesn't find one successful universe and stick there, rewriting the same type of story over and over (see Tinker), but I'll definitely read more about Ukiah!I don't \\"do\\" literary analysis, but I didn't find the writing style bad, as some have. It must be a matter of taste. I also won't review the plot, as has already been done.The mystery of discovering who he is drew me in despite the gruesomeness of some of the scenes. The relationships were good. I like characters who I can respect and who are, at the same time, not perfect. I like the slow character maturation.Warning, the third novel in the series has some \\"off-camera\\" violence against very young children.This is definitely worth a try, and I think you'll be sucked in as I have been by this excellent and inventive writer."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"This 1st novel is quite unique and well written for this first-time writer. This new twist in sci-fi horror is a fast-paced thrill ride. The plot unfolds slowly and there are quite a few characters that shine and are delved deeply in.Ukiah Oregon is found as a wild boy with a pack of wolves. He soon finds out that The Pack he really belongs to is a wild biker gang that is much more than it seems. Ukiah is then thrown into finding his lost heritage and along the way he finds much more. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is only because I thought that everybody around him just seemed to believe about his alien past a little too quickly and easily. I really wanted to give this novel a higher rating but there were some small weak points that I thought needed more addressing in this story, but since then, I found that there is a sequel, so there is much more to go.

Spencer does a marvelous job of combining the weird with the mundane so everything is believeable. Ukiah Oregon, despite his non-human roots, is remarkably identifiable and likeable as our hero. His discovery into his extraterrestial origins goes beyond the stereotype into something remarkably fresh and interesting. And he's sexy and adventurous, which doesn't hurt either.Even more than having a remarkable hero, Spencer has managed to craft an interesting supporting cast to run along side Ukiah. I can see where Max and he have a deep friendship that would transcend even Ukiah's personal challenges. The story itself has just enough bite of mystery and intrigue that kept me firmly glued to the book until I finished it.I should probably thank Wen for adding &quot;I've lost a mouse somewhere&quot; to my vocabulary among my friends."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"When I first saw this book, I thought, \\"Wow, this looks really cheezy, but I'll buy it anyway as a quick read.\\"Then I got into the premise. \\"Wow!\\", I thought, \\"I was wrong, \\"This could be really cool.\\" The idea of a tracker who can do what he can do because of a feral upbringing by wolves seemed to be working out well, and some of the plot twists were great.But as I got into it, character development for all but the main guy seemed to stop dead. Further in, I found the actions of the characters less and less believable. It started with the tough FBI agent who considers Ukiah, the lead, a suspect one day, and is madly in love with him the next. The casual acceptance of Ukiah's real story by all concerned in the book at their first hearing seems even harder to accept.Having said that, the plot is good, although there are some leaps that seem a bit sudden and poorly contrived. The concept is good, and it would have been a better book if it had been covered in more space so the characterizations and plot twists didn't seem so forced or wodden."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"I started these out of order, which is always confusing and a little frustrating.

Ukiah Oregon was abandoned as a child and raised by a pack of wolves. Discovered and adopted by humans at the approximate age of 12, he has grown to be a part of human life. He now works as a tracker for a private investigator, a finder of lost children. But he still has no idea of his true parentage, no idea who they were or why they abandoned him.The novel opens with his latest case -- a missing woman who attacks Ukiah when he finds her, forcing him to kill her in self-defense. This brings him to the attention of both the FBI and a group known as the Pack, a biker gang that is more than they seem. And, from this point on, things get *really* weird.I loved this book. It was great fun to read; it kept me glued to the edge of my seat, always wanting to know what happens next. The characters, especially Ukiah and Max, were well-drawn, complex, three-dimensional human beings; the villains were scary and evil without being cartoonish. I cared about these caracters; I really wanted the heros to win and the bad guys to be defeated. I was swept up in their lives. The plot was complex and fascinating; it kept me guessing. I don't want to give anything away, so I won't tell you how it turns out, but I will say this: this book eventually involves aliens. And the aliens are really original. Their method of reproduction, the way their memory works -- all of it is new and interesting.If I had one complaint, it would be that I thought the romance was rushed. Ukiah's love interest is a strong, fascinating woman, but the two of them seem to fall in love almost at first sight. I wanted the relationship to develop a little more slowly and fully -- but that's a very minor quibble. It didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book at all.Overall, I loved this book. It was well-written and compulsively readable. I will be on the lookout for anything else this author chooses to write!"},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"Ukiah Oregon is young--but is by far the best tracker in the business. Part of the Bennet Detective agency, Ukiah is unequaled in following the missing and the lost.When Ukiah is asked to trace a possibly kidnapped woman, he stumbles upon a dangerous group of people. People who can see in the dark, smell blood on the wind, and hear through walls. People who seem to recognize Ukiah, and want to kill him.The plot starts and continues quickly in this entertaining novel. The main characters are all engaging, and as things get more ominous, there are elements of humor, romance and poignancy to break up the tension. The premise is solid, but the main attraction of the book are the characters and their interaction. While the book is complete in itself, one looks with anticipation towards future adventure of Ukiah and his friends...."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"No one really knows how old allegedly twenty-one years old Ukiah Oregon is. He was found caught in a wolf trap when he was approximately twelve. The woman who captured Ukiah took him to Pittsburgh so she and her female mate Lara could have a child since the courts ignored adoption efforts by a same sex couple.Now Ukiah works with private detective Max Bennett. Ukiah is a world-class tracker who can find a trail with the faintest of clues. There are other oddities about Ukiah. His olfactory, taste, and hearing senses are much more acute than the average person's and he can read DNA with another unknown sense. He has suffered strange memory losses that only sometimes he regains. On one of his cases, Ukiah learns about The Pack, a loose coalition of bikers who take a sudden interest in him. When he finds out why, he also learns he is the key to saving the human race.ALIEN TASTE is an urban science fiction tale that takes place on earth in three years. However, new technological advances make the reader feel that Wen Spencer's tale takes place much further into the future. The characters are fully developed and understandable and The Pack is likable in a feral sort of way. This novel is keeper shelf material and hopefully Mr. Spencer will return with more tales starring the Pack.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book. The ultimate outsider is someone who thinks he is &quot;normal&quot; then discovers he is not. Much as all teenages do. Most kids grow out of it. What if you really were an alien in human form? How would YOU handle it?This story is a &quot;coming of age&quot; story. Everyone wants the answers to, &quot;Where am I from? Will my first love be worth the pain? Are my friends really trustworthy? Is my father worthy of respect?&quot; Nothing new here, yet the story has so many twists that it takes your breath away.The kid in the story is a tracker for a detective agency. So far so good. Then it turns out he has photographic memory. Okay. I can handle that. He can has a sense of smell that allows him to classify by DNA. Ooooo...boy, this is getting too weird. Then the woman he is tracking turns on him and he kills her. He wakes up in the hospital and reruns all the action and filters out all the gunk and centers in on two people who should not be there. Who are these people? Then the body of the woman is carved up by the coroner, bagged and the bagged organs turn into ferrets and frighten the coroner to death and the ferrets EAT the coroner's body.Ferrets? Ferrets? What the hell is going on here?Nothing is as it seems. Lots of blood. Lots of action. Some lyrical sex. Great mystery. Why are all these people fighting each other?On top of a great and different plot, the author has good prose style. Don't look at me that way! You know that most action books have nothing in the way of character development or background fill in. This book does."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by how this book sucked me in and held my interest from start to finish. Ukiah Oregon is certainly a character that you develop a sympathetic bond with, and the depths of his &quot;alien-ness&quot; only make him more human in the end. I really liked the way his character developed, along with the friendship with his partner Max, and his family relationships. The relationship with Indigo Zheng, the female FBI agent, was not convincing, and somehow seemed gratuitous, but all told it is a great read."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"The characters, some of which I could relate to at a deep level, pushed this book to three stars for me. I definitely enjoyed following the people through a complex situation--though some of it was a little too predictable, like the romance. I'd like to see a little more complexity in loving relationships for me to feel that it's real.Some of the science just didn't work. For instance, near the end of the story, during the climatic moment in a Earth-based Mars-rover control room, the speed of light delay for transmissions from Earth to Mars (and back) conveniently disappear. Here was a pivotal moment in the story ruined by an amateurish mistake, one that pulled me out of the story completely. Only the convincing characters compelled me to begin reading again--and this took awhile.The novel was a good effort, and I look forward to seeing what Wen Spencer will accomplish in the future."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"Alien Taste is a stunning debut novel- a fresh and original twist on a classic SF theme. From the very opening you find yourself drawn to these characters, especially to the narrator Ukiah Oregon, who is more than he seems and more than even he realizes.The author blends SF with mystery/action adventure, and throws in a dash of romance for good measure. Easily one of the best science fiction novels of 2001.If you are looking for something out of the ordinary, with a unique author's voice, then look no farther. You'll be glad you read this book."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"What a fantastic story this is. There is something for anyone - mystery, sci fi, a good dollop of romance. It reminds me a bit of Jim Butcher's series featuring wizard-private investigator Harry Dresden, although all it really shares is that Ukiah is also a PI with something 'extra'.Ukiah Oregon has run with the wolves - literally being raised by them until his teens - and only a few short years ago was discovered by a woman who was to become his mother. He now is dedicated to his family, to his partner Max and their PI partnership. He's a tracker, and a good one. More than that - there is no one who can match his tracking skills. After all, no one else can track identifying the DNA of the lost by touch alone, as Ukiah can. A serious case is referred to them. Ukiah and Max have to track a missing woman. Someone who it appears has gone completely mad, killing her friends / housemates and escaping into the woods. Ukiah identifies in her blood that she seems to have some kind of invasive virus. Using her blood he tracks her, finds her - and that's when the weirdness starts.I enjoyed all the characters peopling the book, from Ukiah's unusual family structure to the woman he picks to love. Here is a strong, masculine male that actually seems to enjoy showing people that he loves them. The plot is carefully paced as befuddlement turns into excitement builds on danger and culminates into mega risk, ultimately making me wonder what really is out there.The concept is unique and will grip you from the start. The opening concept of the book (a man raised by wolves) may not seem on the surface to be so different, but the treatment and development of the story definitely is. There are some interesting themes including what makes a family, and what it is to be human. I loved the gradual revelation of the meat of the story. Spencer resisted the opportunity to shock the reader with sudden revelations, and instead we learned with Ukiah. Unusually, most of the people Ukiah cares deeply about actually seem to deserve the depth of his feeling, being pretty great people in themselves which I liked it a lot - another resistance of 'pat' writing from Spencer as there are no betrayals from within.This is a great book, that left me with a couple of questions, a couple of 'huh's, and a great deal of satisfaction. I'm looking forward to go on reading of Ukiah in 'Tainted Trail'."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"I bought this because I loved the elfhome series. A well written story, just didn't like it as well as Elfhome."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"The understated hero through who's view we see, grows into a strong character with a central point that grows the world from what we know into a stand alone universe. An outstanding Sci-fi book I read more than once. You will wish even though it is novel length it were ten times as long."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"As the title says, I absolutely loved this series. Enough to push it on multiple friends (who likewise loved it), and to have read it maybe four times in the three years I've owned it. Ukiah is a fascinating character. From the outside, he seems like the 'strong, silent type', yet with a bit of a bad-boy vibe. Inside, he's serious, dedicated, naive, and a bit confused. It makes a nice contrast between his 'looks' and his 'self'. His background, along with what he is and how he came to be, add plenty of twists and turns... not to mention a crisis that has to be confronted. There is plenty going on here to hold the attention. (As a sidenote: if you're a fan of Final Fantasy VII, there are definitely parallels between the two stories that will likely make this an enjoyable read.)Now, I'm not going to lie: there is definitely room for improvement in the editing area, and each successive reading has made the little mistakes more apparent. This is not a perfectly written book or series. Still, none of the errors were glaringly awful, and when caught up in the story I managed to ignore most of them. In fact, after complaining about the misuse of words in some of my other reviews (and subsequently being lectured on how English is evolving), it's a pleasure to note that this author used words both correctly and creatively. In particular, she uses the word 'ovipositor' to describe a device in the second novel, and although it's an unconventional use, it's absolutely perfect.If I had to dredge up a complaint, it would be that Ukiah's relationship with Indigo is too pat, too perfect, too smooth. However, this is a science fiction series, not a romance series, so it's not really surprising that the romance isn't particularly fleshed out. It's a secondary or even tertiary aspect of the plot. And, given Ukiah's abilities, 'love at first sight' is fairly plausible.Bottom line? Even on the recent fourth read, with familiarity making the story less entrancing and the editing flaws more visible, this is still the best thing I've read in over a year."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"This is the third book that I have read by Wen Spencer and I just noticed that her real name is Wendy Kosak. Just a point of trivia but I did not know that Wen is short for Wendy.Very good book and a nice mix of fantasy and science fiction. In fact, some might call this book totally sci-fi. I've always liked jungle boy books and this is an interesting variation on that theme. I have ordered the three follow-on books to complete the series. Sadly, all four of these books are out of print so I had to purchase used copies on Amazon."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"Ukiah Oregon really knows very little about himself. He was apparently about 12 when a wildlife biologist found him--stark naked and unable to understand English--in a humane wolf trap, gnawing on the bait. Naming him for the town near which the trap was located, she took him back to her farm outside Pittsburgh and managed to socialize and raise him. Now he's about 20 and working as the partner of Max Bennett, a PI who specializes in missing persons. It's a peculiarly congenial profession for Ukiah, who has unusually developed senses: not only can he hear, taste, and smell things that escape most people, and see a trail that is invisible to anyone else, he can actually tell from a person's scent or sweat their sex, ethnic derivation, and approximate age, as well as that \\"her white blood cell count [is] high\\" and that her DNA has \\"odd fractures\\" in it. He can also selfheal from injuries that would kill anyone else, he has a photographic memory (Max says he could remember \\"the entire Pittsburgh yellow pages, if [he] wanted\\")--and he has absolutely no idea how he ended up running wild in the woods of the Great Northwest, though he supposes he was a feral child.When a woman murders her three roommates with a samurai sword and takes off into a nearby park, Ukiah and Max are called to help track her down. Evidence suggests that there's a connection between the murders and a loose association of five motorcycle gangs that call themselves \\"the Pack\\" and seem to have rather odd abilities of their own. And because the swordswoman was a scientist involved with the unmanned explorer-craft that has recently landed on Mars, the FBI, in the person of the tough but beautiful Agent Indigo Zheng, gets involved too--especially after Ukiah is forced to kill the crazed woman in self-defense and her body mysteriously vanishes from the morgue, leaving behind a messily murdered coroner. Slowly Ukiah finds himself piecing things together: the Pack is involved, indeed, but not the way Zheng thinks it is--there's another and even nastier group out there, called the Ontongard, with whom the Pack has a murderous mutual abhorration society. The latter's leader, Rennie Shaw, ducks in and out of Ukiah's life, dropping enigmatic hints that only add to his bewilderment--until, like Sherlock Holmes, having eliminated the impossible, he finds himself faced with a chilling however-improbable-it-must-be-the-truth solution to the case.In her first book (her real name is Wendy Kosak), Spencer creates a fascinating character on whom the fate of the entire world may turn, turns him loose in a venue long familiar to her, and builds her suspense skilfully to an almost unbearable pitch until it explodes in a violent confrontation between the Pack and the Ontongard, with Ukiah and Max caught in the middle. I was unfamiliar with her work before reading this novel, but I'm not at all unhappy that I took a chance on it. I'll be looking for the three sequels."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"This tale, into the future, tells us about a young boy ,who was rescued by a woman from a wolf trap,to become a trekker with above average senses from ordinary people, and with the help of this powers he saves the human race.

I've actually had to buy this book four times now because I lend it and then never get it back because the lendees keep it. This is one of the most original series I've read in the last decade. The characters are wonderful and full-bodied, the science is beyond cool, and the plot is fascinating. So buy your own copy.

This book is too. The plot and characters are spun in such a matter-of-fact and believeable manner that this is a page-turner. Can not wait to get to the other three. Thanks Wen........I appreciate it(them)."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"I got the recommendation for this book from Dallas Schulze, who, in addition to writing wonderful books, also has darn good taste.Ukiah Oregon was a boy raised by wolves. He's an extraordinary tracker with a photographic memory--of everything except his own past.Together with his partner and mentor, Max, he works as a private investigator, specializing in missing persons cases.As the story opens, they're called to a crime scene where three women have been killed, and a fourth is missing, presumably abducted by the killer. Tracking her is the start of something much larger, and results in encounters with a mysterious and sinister motorcycle gang called the Pack, and revelations about Ukiah's own history.A lot of the reviews about this book give away the punchline, which happens about halfway through the story. I'm not going to do that, but as a result, I'm leaving a lot out. It's written in Ukiah's POV, for the most part, and therefore, we readers know what Ukiah knows. Which isn't much, at first.The story is fascinating and clever, and the aliens (the title is Alien Taste--there have to be aliens) were unique and well thought-out. And they tended to prompt me to think Deep Thoughts about what it means to be human, always a good thing, especially when it's left up to me, the reader, rather than spoon-fed to me.Huge thanks to Dallas for the recommendation. I wish I'd gotten to it sooner. The next book is in my e-reader."},{"Title":"Alien Taste (Ukiah Oregon, Book 1)","review":"I have read this entire series and just cant get enough.

Its like MM's you just cant stop at one.I just want to know when the next book in this series comes out."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"While the &quot;personal&quot; Johnson is given adequate attention, this book works so well because it concentrates on the political realm, a rarity in these days of social history and psychoanalytical treatises. Of course, the impeachment trial is of primary interest, but the focus on Johnson's overwhelming ambition was appreciated as well. Despite his stubborn attitude, inflexibility, and undeniable racism, Johnson was a committed Jacksonian and sought throughout his political life to promote policies friendly to his agrarian philosophy. Because his presidency represented a key transition in American history (a definite weakening of the Executive until TR as well as a regrettable loss of Reconstruction opportunities), Johnson is, with Polk, Lincoln, and Jackson, one of the key figures of the 19th century. Overall, a solid book worthy of a wide readership."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"I read this book in my ongoing project to read a biography of each President. The best part of this book in my opinion was the length. A lot of biographers lengthen their book to a point where it becomes too detailed and hard to read. That was not the case here.Johnson was not a great president, nor was he a great person. And, other than the Civil War and Reconstruction he didn't have a key stake in American History. Why go overboard? And the author didn't.I've read many very wonderful presidential biographies. Truman was fantastic and was 900 pages because it shouldn've been. The 3-part bio on Nixon was 1800 pages and should've been because a lot went on during Nixon's life in politics.This bio, much like the Andrew Jackson bio I read, was between 300 and 400 pages.... detailed enough to tell the story but not detailed to the point where I got lost or just flat lost interest.I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to read about Andrew Johnson but if you are looking to make a life out of studying the man it is probably not the book for you because it is not overly detailed.It was exactly what I was looking for though, well-written, well-researched and gave me a good overview of a President that I have always wanted to know more about. He definitely was not of high moral character and definitely played to his southern base with his actions surrounding reconstruction. That said, I did find it interesting that he was demonized at times by both his colleagues and the press.Sounds like aside from his thinking in regards to blacks and slavery he was a good and honest man that tried to do what was right most of the time. That was something the author did a very good job detailing and I appreciated it."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"Hans Louis Trefousse's biography of Andrew Johnson paints a balanced portrait of this unique political figure. After completing the work I walked away with a feeling that Trefousse was neither a cheerleader for the president nor out to condemn Andrew Johnson. The book gives good detail on his rise to power and his continual fight for the homestead act and against government intervention. It also shows that Johnson was far from a perfect figure and never could overcome his own prejudices against the former slaves. The book also has good detail on the impeachment of Andrew Johnson but does not make it the sole focus of the book. In general it is a good read, but at times becomes cumbersome in its detail. Overall, I would recommend the book to anyone looking for a more complete picture of the country's first impeached president."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"For those looking for a thorough and fair book on Andrew Johnson this is the place to start. His tumultuous career from building himself from nothing to achieving the presidency proves to be a fascinating story. The look at rural Tennessee politics through the state machines of centered in Nashville provides a fascinating contradiction of times to today. Quick thinking and stump speaking were the tools of the politicians and Andrew Johnson proved to be a master.Johnson may have been on of the most conservative presidents in our history favoring the reduction in government and keeping government out of all aspects of life and trade. His viewpoints provided a strong counter to the internal improvements crowd of the time and he went so far as to even oppose government funded roads. His strong sense of union left him in a position to be an obvious candidate for the vice presidency despite his previous breaking with party lines. As Lincolns vice president he would serve a function of representing the south's interest. Before his ascension to that position he had been the military governor of Tennessee and worked tirelessly to bring the state back into the union and ensure that it would be loyal afterwards despite accusations of his forming a dictatorship.Johnson served as president between two strong factions that Lincoln had kept balanced out. Johnson did not have Lincoln's political savvy and it led to his impeachment but not conviction. While he was unable to run again for the presidency he was able to stay active in politics and served his party well. Andrew Johnson is a great political enigma and one that is often ignored. This is a highly recommended biography to learn more about a man who is not studied often."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"I am currently reading a biography of every President in order. Hans Trefousse' biography of Andrew Johnson certainly seemed to be the best choice for a comprehensive biography of our 17th President.From an academic standpoint, it is hard to criticize Trefousse's work. He has obviously done the necessary research and is thoroughly well versed in the history of the times. Indeed, this biography is complete and in depth enough and should meet most everyone's expectations. Trefousse clearly understands Johnson and his proper relationship to American history. The only reason I was unable to give this biography a full five stars is the writing is a bit uninspired and doesn't achieve a level of excellence that merits special recognition. The book is more than satisfactory in completing its task but ultimately is only going to appeal to those already interested in the subject matter.After reading this biography I am still of the opinion that it is likely the best one available for Andrew Johnson. Indeed, it certainly exceeds expectations for a comprehensive biography of a relatively unknown President."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"Treffousse's look at the 17th President of the United States is a fair and well-balanced look at this driven politician. The reader will be left with little doubt that Johnson's racism was his biggest flaw in both his political and personal life. The impeachment is featured but does not dominate the book as it should not."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"I knew almost nothing about Andrew Johnson before reading this book other than he inherited the presidency after Lincoln. I was most interested to see how he handled such a difficult situation and found that he didn't. I had no idea he was such a racist - basically undoing all that Lincoln had set about to do to grant basic rights to the freedmen from emancipation - while letting the Southern secessionists off the hook. What a mess he left us in. I have read a half dozen presidential biographies and find Johnson to clearly be the worst. The book is painstakingly researched and the detail at times is too much - especially about Johnson's political wheeling and dealing - it got so I had to skip sections to get through it - or needed a huge scorecard to remember who was who."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"Andrew Johnson, although in disfavor at this time, is one of my heroes. He is the only President who had no classroom education at all, yet became a voracious reader (the story that his wife taught him how to read is a myth); he defended the rights of the states, as the Constitution plainly lays them out, in an era when this was political suicide. He instituted Lincoln's plan of Presidential reconstruction - as Lincoln clearly described at his last cabinet meeting - and had all of the seceded states, except Texas, back in the Union by the end of 1865, only to have his work undone by the Radical Republicans. In summary, he was the last President of the Old Republic. This led to am impeachment trial in which the nominal issue was, decades later, decided in Johnson's favor; the real issue, of course, was whether the United States would have a parliamentary system of government or the one established by the Founders. It seems that we are gradually aiming for the first after all.Dr. Trefouse obviously dislikes Johnson, yet his biography is (mostly) balanced; he recognizes Johnson's tremendous gifts in advancing from obscure poverty to the highest offices and also his great courage, physical as well as moral, during the Civil War. The author, however, does not comprehend a few events of the era. For example, an antebellum speech by Andrew Johnson referring to the American society'sopenness for individual advancement and drawing the allusion of a ladder, which any man may climb, caused a national uproar. The reason for the uproar (not evident to Dr. Trefouse) is that Johnson was a Freemason and the ladder analogy is Masonic - this, at a time, when the power of the Masons was a vital political issue. Another speech, given by Johnson in Congress, in response to comments made by a Southern opponent, quotes Shakespeare (Julius Caesar, Act 4, scene 3 - \\"Go show your slaves how choleric you are...\\") - Dr. Trefousse, who certainly had more formal education than Andrew Johnson, again does not appear to recognize the quotation. Finally, the author's claim that the term \\"weaker sex (or vessel)\\" is a characteristic of the nineteenth century, is incorrect (see I Peter 3:7).One is reminded of a recent book on the subject of Lincoln's rhetoric, which compliments Mr. Lincoln on his invention of the \\"house divided\\" analogy. Neither the author, nor an eminent modern-day Lincoln scholar who reviewed the book, were aware that the phrase was used by Christ to refute those who said He was an agent of the Devil. Evidently our PhD's are not reading the New Testament."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"It gave a good overall picture to Johnson's life. It gave details about his life, home, and political tenure. It was a book that was usually interesting because of the author's style of writing. It picutured him in an objective light so that the read could form his or her own opinion about the former President."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"The book clearly stated its purpose in the forward and it accomplished that purpose.This biography is not riveting (not many are), but it certainly keeps the reader interested through excellent retelling of the political circumstances surrounding Andy Johnson's life. The reader is constantly informed which players took what positions and why, as well as how everything from the past circled back in his life to the given present moment. But the best part about it is that it really gets inside Johnson's head on everything, and all of the questions as to why he acted the way he did as President become answered due to the clarity with which his thought processes are conveyed. This is the aforementioned \\"goal\\" of the book- to vividly illustrate the circumstances leading up to and through the impeachment and trial.Where it falls short is in several areas. First, there is little about his pre-Greeneville, TN life; of course, there may not be many resources on this, but still the book glosses over those times. Also, there is a glaring lack of personal life details once the book gets to his Presidential years; there are some \\"oh, by the way\\" updates on what he did as a White House host, but really there are very few specific stories or quoted letters.All in all, I would recommend it as probably the best resource out there to truly understand the impeachment circumstances; it also gives a good layman's overview of the immediate causes and effects of Presidential Reconstruction without getting too detailed."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"I found this book was fair to Johnson, despite the author's reputation as friendly to the Radical Republicans. I found myself believing that the failure of the Senate to impeach Johnson was a good thing, since he obviously was not guilty of an impeachable offense--even as our current president was not. Johnson was actually an able politician and a good President, but his bias against blacks caused him to err grievously in regard to them."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"Take any list of the worst presidents in American history, and Andrew Johnson's name will feature prominently at the top of it. On one level, this is hardly surprising. Succeeding as he did the assassinated Abraham Lincoln, he faced the formidable challenge of restoring the peace after the bloodiest and most divisive conflict in American history. Given the task at hand and laboring as he did in the shadow of the martyred president, criticism was inevitable. Yet as Hans Trefousse shows in this book, Johnson's own rigid adherence to his beliefs prevented the sort of compromising that might have smoothed the path toward his goals and forestalled the impeachment that forever distinguishes his term in office.The irony in Trefousse's account is that such rigidity was uncharacteristic in his youth. As a budding politician in antebellum Tennessee, Johnson often shifted positions as he sought to define his political identity to voters. His impoverished background, however, served as the foundation for his unwavering support for the rights of the poor, and his admiration of Andrew Jackson ensured that the would be identified with the Democratic Party. Trefousse makes the interesting case that Johnson was in many respects an adherent not as much to Jacksonian Democracy but to the Old Republican ideas of Thomas Jefferson. Such views would put him increasingly at odds with the industrializing nation that emerged in his lifetime, yet this proved less of an issue in his home state than it would when he became president later on.As an ambitious border-state politician, the outbreak of the Civil War posed the greatest challenge of his career, and in terms of those ambitions he made what would turn out to be the correct choice. But Trefousse makes it clear that Johnson decision to stay with the union did not entail any reconsideration of his views on race. This became an issue once he became president, as he supported generous terms that left the freedmen in a legal position little different from slavery. Johnson's stubborn commitment to his views alienated the Republicans in Congress, empowering the Radicals among their ranks to push for impeachment. Trefousse shows the impeachment as a rushed affair, with a trial quickly demonstrated the hollowness of the prosecution's case. Johnson's victory proved a Pyrrhic one, though, as he found himself reduced to irrelevance in the aftermath of his acquittal. Hungering for a return to a national stage, he saw his election to the Senate in 1875 as a vindication by the people, albeit one cut short by a series of strokes that killed him soon afterward.Trefousse's book serves as a solid account of the political career of America's 17th president. Having written biographies of some of the other key figures in the impeachment controversy, he brings considerable insight to bear on the central act of Johnson's political career, showing it as a far messier and more muddled affair than might otherwise appear to be the case. Yet his description of Johnson's pre-presidential career suffers from an absence of similar insight, and provides little more than a chronicle of his career and achievements. Nonetheless, his book stands as the best biography available of this controversial figure, one that makes a convincing argument that his place in history was ultimately defined by his inability to practice that central skill of a successful politician - the art of compromise."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"Not a bad book, but it had some serious drawbacks. One is the convoluted manner in which the author covered Johnson's presidential years. You need to keep a list nearby to keep track of who was who and in which party, etc. (Democrats, Republicans, Unionists, Whigs, Conservatives, etc.) Also, the author gives painstaking details about the most trivial things, but when it comes to a female assassin stalking Johnson in the White House, he mentions it in passing (doesn't even devote a full sentence to this event), and moves on. I don't need to know the make and model of stagecoach Johnson rode in, but I would like to hear about the fistfights he engaged in (another tale just glossed over by the author). The finest chapter was the one leading up to Johnson's becoming Lincoln's running mate. None of us will ever see a Republican choose a Democrat as his running mate, but that is what Lincoln did, and it was fascinating to see how it developed. I give the author credit for that."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"This is an outstanding work of history. Trefousse used some excellent sources and proved his thesis that Johnson's opposition to civil rights ensured that African-Americans were disenfranchised for close to 100 years. The author showed that Johnson was a shrewd and successful politician who accomplished a great deal for the state of Tennessee. However, his fanatical devotion to state's rights ensured that his presidency was doomed to failure.Trefousse contrasts the flexible and pragmatic Lincoln with Johnson, a man who was constrained by an ideological straitjacket. Johnson made a myriad of political enemies and held grudges against anyone who had ever offended him. This is a very interesting and informative book. It was well researched and is probably the best biography of Johnson in print."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"I think any dissatisfaction with this book stems from flaws in the subject rather than with the author.The book was well-written and well-researched, but the subject matter was not always interesting or sympathetic. Johnson was a man who should never have been, and under normal circumstances would never have been, president. He was basically a skilled but small-minded provincial politician who was elevated to the vice presidency solely because they needed a southerner on the ticket, he was a loyal unionist and he was not perceived as a threat to the Republican power-brokers. Had he not been president after Lincoln's death, reconstruction and race relations in our country likely would have progressed quite differently (and better) than they did.Anyway, back to reviewing the book rather than Johnson. If you are looking for a single volume full-life biography of Andrew Johnson, I think this is not only the best choice, but to my knowledge it is also the only choice. Fortunately, it is a good one."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"Johnson's story is one of \\"rags to riches.\\" During his journey from uneducated tailor to U.S. President he embraced the upward mobility that America prides itself on. Through pure motivation, cunning, and business acumen Johnson was able to elevate himself into political positions that allowed him the stage necessary from which he could showcase his greatest talent, oratory. In the antebellum south, Johnson's core values of protecting white supremacy and the union, and promoting the distribution of federal land through his Homestead Bill, resonated. Naturally, inhabitants of the north took issue with Johnson's principles. Once he crossed the threshold into national politics, it seemed that Johnson won most elections simply because his party did not like any alternatives. He was chosen as Lincoln's Vice Presidential running mate, not because he was a good man, but because Lincoln needed the votes provided by the opposition Democratic Party. Johnson's strict allegiance to the aforementioned principles (allegiance is something most politicians are incapable of) forbade him from evolving his ideals to a different, post-war America. His feeling of white supremacy, abuse of executive power, and impartiality to Confederate dissenters led to impeachment proceedings by Congress. Although Congress was unable to convict Johnson, they made certain that he was unable to pass any legislation. His stubbornness and inability to work with Congress made for one of the worst Presidencies to date.Trefousse provides a detailed, sometimes superfluous, description of Andrew Johnson's life. Details are certainly a necessity in the composition of a biography. However, the weight and balance of the details the author chose made for difficult comprehension at times. While the microscope is focused on Johnson's local political career, we receive little information about national politics, and vice versa. When Johnson makes the shift from Tennessee state politics to U.S. Senator, the reader is thrown into national politics with little or no introduction (the Missouri Compromise, Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Know-Nothing Party; essentially most events outside of Johnson's radius of influence leading up to the war are not discussed). When Johnson is appointed Military Governor of Tennessee during the Civil War any details of the war itself are left unexamined. Conversely, there are over analyzed portions of Johnson's story that are difficult to tread through. That being said, Trefousse'st history of the politics of Reconstruction and Johnson's impeachment trial are superb. As a biographer, Trefousse has completed his task. As an author keeping the reader stimulated and informed, in my opinion, he fell a bit short."},{"Title":"Andrew Johnson: A Biography","review":"Necessary reading if you're trying to understand Andrew Johnson, a man who created enemies with ease. From Johnson's early days to his passing, this books help one to understand his peculiar personality.

The Western Marches had not yet been subdued by English authority, and clouds of banditti continue to make inroads into English territory. Our characters are besieged in a castle that only at the moment of crisis is it put into a posture of defense to withstand the siege. A phlegmatic Fleming and his daughter form the sensible counters to the hot-blooded English family who owns the castle. Intrigues and sorcery (the product of the times), conflicts between religion, the foreign wars, infighting within the family (when a son would murder his father for his possessions) all have equal place here. A fascinating glimpse of the times, and a highly readable story make this yet another jewel in Scott's wonderful body of historical fiction."},{"Title":"The betrothed (The works of Sir Walter Scott)","review":"I enjoyed this book. The plot is set in medieval England and focuses on a young woman named Eveline who feels herself compelled to marry her deliverer from the Welsh. Her deliverer is forced to embark on a Crusade to the Holy Land before their marriage can take place. The two will be betrothed for at least 3 years, if the man returns alive. In the meantime, he has a very chivalrous and attractive nephew who will stand as Eveline's guardian. I was surprised by the ending which is unlike other Sir Walter Scott books.

This makes them targets for counterfeiting. So a special series of processes has been developed to poduce such documents.The things that can be controlled in the printing process are essentially the paper, the ink, and the printing equipment/process. This book discusses all of these and more as it talks about the technology of making documents secure enough that forgeries can be immediately recognized by people with little training.In recent years the advent of color copying has forced a whole series of changes in the security printing business. This means that new technologies such as inks visible under special lighting conditions, micro printing, holograms and many other techniques have become available and are covered here.Finally there is a section on marketing security printing along with some discussion on the risks involved."},{"Title":"Introduction To Security Printing","review":"I have been trying to purchase this book for a month.

The path towards her past takes her back to Greece during and after World War II, back to the story of the Greeks Jews and those who saved them. The novel unveils the diverging versions of history left in the memory of her protagonists. Ellen Boneparth very cleverly interlaces their personal stories with the history of the Eastern part of Europe. It is a fascinating tale with an expected ending, beautifully written with intense dialogue. I strongly recommend his novel to both Jewish and non-Jewish readers as an insight into the trials of people who are often forgotten in traditional history books."},{"Title":"Days of Atonement: A Novel","review":"Ellen Boneparth's \\"Days of Atonement\\" is an intriguing and fascinating story, which captured my attention from beginning to end.

Beka is a strong, intelligent, accomplished woman whose inquisitive mind leads her to uncover her history and realize her desires."},{"Title":"Days of Atonement: A Novel","review":"Review of Days of Atonement by Ellen Boneparth (2005)This novel rang bells for me on every page. It's the story of Beka, an American Jewish woman who goes to Greece on a journey of discovery in search of her Greek Jewish roots. In the course of her trip, Beka uncovers some fascinating World War II history involving heroic Jewish partisans, scoundrels and women of courage. As I read, I became increasingly fascinated by the web of family relationships she's caught in, as she searches for her own spiritual identity and for romance. A particularly intriguing aspect of the book for me was the questions it explores about alternative strategies for Jewish survival - assimilation v. living in isolated communities in the diaspora v. going to Israel. I also loved the memorable characters, including an aging, idealistic but grumpy kibbutznik, a young bride trying to save her family from the Nazis, and a Hollywood agent with a guilty conscience. This is a book that works on many levels: as a historical novel, as a tale of return to roots in the old country, as a contemporary love story and as a chronicle of multiple generations of a complex and vibrant family."},{"Title":"Days of Atonement: A Novel","review":"I read this book cover to cover in one sitting, and I don't often do that! Ellen Boneparth writes a novel that spans decades, incorporates several different points of view, shares details of the Greek Jewish experiences in World War II, and makes us care about her finely drawn characters and their relationships to one another. Her sense of place (California, Greece, Israel), her detailed research, and her storytelling expertise combine to make this a great read. I learned from it, and was moved by the story. I'm still thinking about these characters several days later."},{"Title":"Days of Atonement: A Novel","review":"We (my partner, Dik Posey, and I) have come a little late to the reading of Ellen Bonaparth's excellent novel,\\"Days of Atonement\\".However, when we sat down to read, we both stayed up late into the night.Definitely a \\"page turner\\".Dik valued the relationship that developed between Beka and Grigoris:a mutual strength, mutual compassion, mutual support.But it's only on the last page that one finds out whether or not it will continue to grow.I particularly valued the aspect that the history of the Jewish Greeks at the time of WWII comes alive on the pages in a way that it never could in a dry history book.This was a Story waiting, needing to be told, and now it is a Story waiting to be READ!

That was over 30 years ago; she recently came to mind again and so, when one of her books became available through an online book swap, I decided to give her a try and see how she held up all these many years later.Unfortunately, I have to be totally honest and say she doesn't hold up well; Christmas Carol Kauffman's writing is unpolished, stilted and simplistic. Her characters and setting are lacking in development. However, in Not Regina she had an excellent story line and that is what kept me reading. The writing itself probably deserves two stars; however because of the plot I'm giving it three.The setting is 16th century Switzerland; Europe was roiling in the Reformation, and in Switzerland the government had followed the reforms of Luther and instituted an official state church under the leadership of Ulrich Zwingli. However, a group of people emerged called Anabaptists who took Reformation a step further than the official church, rejecting the baptism of infants and asserting that only adults should be baptized upon their confession of faith. For this they faced imprisonment and even death, and many fled or went into hiding. The battle between the Anabaptists and the official church divided friends and neighbors, even close family members. Eighteen-year-old Regina Strahm lives in a village in northern Switzerland that is torn by this strife; as she sees good people being led to prison she is led to question her own faith and the church in which she has been raised, but which doesn't seem to bring her any peace or answers.Besides an excellent story idea, Not Regina contains many other characters and elements that could make for a really gripping tale; Regina's own family torn by this conflict, with one brother converting to Anabaptism while another remains loyal to the state church; the pastor she goes to live with as nanny, who has no peace, struggles with what to preach to his congregation, and who increasingly turns to drink for solace; the young and handsome groomsman of the local lord who falls in love with Regina; the lord's kitchen maid who is herself in love with the groomsman and therefore jealous of Regina and out for revenge. This is a time and place that hasn't been covered much in Christian fiction; I would love to see what a story like this could become in the hands of a truly gifted writer."},{"Title":"Not Regina","review":"I love ALL of Christmas Carol Kauffman's books and this one was no exception! Another title for the same book is \\"Escape from Kyburg Castle\\" so be careful you don't buy the two titles and then find out it's the same story."},{"Title":"Not Regina","review":"Easy reading, historical fiction of early Anabaptist church persecution and beliefs during the Great Reformation.

I had just planned on reading the section preparing a participant in the week prior to the race. After I read that particular section--Chapter 12 Racing Strategies--I was hooked. I ended up reading the whole book and really benefiting from it.What is commendable about the book is that it not only makes worthwhile recommendations for runners but it ALSO is very helpful for those of us, over 50's, who perhaps cannot quite run like we used to but still can walk very fast as fitness walkers perhaps even participate in racewalking. I have been racing since the mid 1990s but have never been able to run a whole race, yet I have been able to achieve racewalking speeds and have often placed in my age group. Chapter 6 Proper Walking and Running Form details not only proper running form and technique but also explains what is racewalking, what is proper racewalking form and technique and how racewalking drills can improve your form. For those who are even slower but STILL want to participate the author even has a section on proper fitness walking form and technique.Unlike a previous reviewer I think that this book contains a LOT more information then what you could get out of just a reading a RUNNERS WORLD or WALKING magazine. That is NOT giving this book the proper credit it deserves. For instance, in addition to Chapter 6, particularly useful information was contained in Chapter 7 Warm-Up/Cool-Down and Flexibility Exercises, Chapter 8 Strength Training and Chapter 10 Training and Competition Nutrition for Runners and Walkers. I also particularly like Table 4.1 Dressing for Success:How to be Comfortable Whatever the Weather (recommending clothing choices for actual temperatures ranges) and Table 5.1 Commonly Diagnosed Injuries for Runners and Walkers (listing not only potential injuries with symptoms but recommendations for their prevention and treatment if they occur).I was really impressed that the book was written by a registered dietitian with a Masters of Science in Kinesiology certified by the American College of Sports Medicine as a Health/Fitness instructor and ALSO an accomplished triathlete, duathlete and master runner. In part due to her suggetions, I was able to shave off two minutes in my last half-marathon.

Published in 1952, Mr. Darwin's book is amazingly prescient about what the next fifty years would bring: energy shortage (oil), food shortage, and the \\"pressures\\" of overpopulation. While the author speculates what the remedies can or might be implemented for resolution of these problems, Mr. Darwin is primarily interested in the essential problem - Man -- and how his essential problematic human nature can be perfected from the wild animal that he is to one that is controlled and perfected so as to reach his or her maximum effectiveness in a world of limited resources. Thus, it is not until Chapter VIII of this 11-chaptered work that the general dullness and mechanical verbal probity of the rhetoric disappears and the reader is palpably confronted with a horrifying but superficially scientific creed which asserts that inheritable wealth comes from the inherited ability of successful and wealthy families, and that because these wealthy familes, generation after generation, have proven themselves \\"successful\\" because of their consistent \\"success\\" through time, they, therefore, must be of superior intelligence and ability over the rest of mankind, and, concomitantly, these families, and the individual members of these families, alone are fit to be the elite and to rule over and control the rest of the human race.Charles Galton Darwin foresees a future in which human beings are farmed and bred like animal stock (page 184), each to a specialized purpose (including the use of drugs and artificial use of hormones to remove the sexual desire out of \\"inferior\\" human beings), completeley controlled by the so-called successful elite. In this new creed, it will be necessary to revise the old doctrine of the sanctity of the individual human life as well and to create policies that would allow the very unlucky in life (including babies) not to survive and not selfishly waste limited, precious, natural resources needed by the functional upper classes.The author concludes, presciently as well, that China will be the civilization emblematic of the future the elite are planning as it not only has endured for century after century, longer than the Roman Empire, but the very way of life in China, socially crowded and politically cowed, is a good paradigm for what the future of the entire world shall broadly look like in the 21st century with its provinces, dynasties, and collectivism spearheaded under one central head or world government owned and run by future descendants of the Darwin family and other \\"successful\\" familes in addition."},{"Title":"The next million years","review":"I tried top read online this trash-book, here in Brazil. This book was writen by Sir Charles Galton Darwin (1887-1962), a grandson of Charles Darwin. And such as Charles Darwin, he was an eugenist.And this book was writen in 1950 decade, when the eugenists became claiming that they were now under then new titles of \\"malthusianists\\" or \\"neo-malthusianists\\". This trash-book is divided into eleven parts. The first is the introduction and the last is the epilogue. Second part has as title \\"population\\". The third part has as title \\"The four revolutions\\".The introduction is a strange misture of nothing with value, lies and believes.In the chapter about population, page 37, the author follows the same weird believes preached today by Greepeace and WWF. He is cleary against the improvements of live of persons, by a construction of a dam in India.Even, when it anything with value, there's flaws.One example is when he talks, about celibacy in Catholic Church. Repeating decades old eugenics' arguments against celibacy, while he forgest that European Catholic countries became far better than China, that had a system with his admiration.The chapter about limitation of populations, he claims sterilizations for Malthusian reazons, while remembering eugenics. In fact,the author was a knowed eugenist. Malthusian lies are spread in all this book. The author also tells dozens of agronomical lies, repeated today by mafias such as Greepeace.The last chapter is the epilogue and is even worse that the chapters.

This is a minimal book of 5 short essays written in an academic style. The essays end on page 91, followed by 52 pages of footnotes (mostly citations), with the bibliography and index taking the book to 174 pages.So much is missing from this book! For example, the feasts of Pre-Christians (Romans and Barbarians) and Christians are contrasted in the abstract but never described in any detail. What was on the table? Dr. Effros explains that she didn't write about the food that was eaten or how it was prepared in Merovingian Gaul because &quot;these questions had already been addressed elsewhere more capably than I could have undertaken myself.&quot; Yet her footnote directs the reader to multiple sources, none of which address the questions directly."},{"Title":"Murder on Capitol Hill","review":"The second in Margaret Truman's \\"Murder in Washington\\" series is better than the first. In \\"Murder on Capitol Hill\\" Truman has a surer grasp of character and plot than in \\"Murder in the White House\\", but her research is still done from memory and the story is predictable. Senator Cale Caldwell is murdered at a party, leaving readers a finite number of suspects as heroine lawyer Lydia James leads the investigation. Truman gives us an interesting and well-drawn array of suspects, but most readers will have worked out the plot halfway through.As in \\"White House\\", Truman relies heavily on her Washington memories rather than researching new ones. So instead of interesting and detailed insights into the Senate's back rooms, we get a lot of chats in restaurants and bars. Despite its title, there is very little description of Capitol Hill. Readers interested in juicy insider insights will be disappointed. With a few pen strokes, the book could be set in any city.

This collection is uneven - and not Thompson's best - but fans will still enjoy it.Review - After Hunter S. Thompson's dreadful Generation of Swine (1988), I was tempted to write him off as a total has-been. Swine was so bad that I thought that HST might finally have gone \\"one toke over the line\\" and lost his muse, forever. Songs of the Doomed, then, is a nice surprise - a modest success that will appeal to HST's devoted fans.The best stuff in Songs is fantastic. In a section on the 1960s, Thompson gives some history on some of his famous works. In an excellent, short 1976 piece titled \\"High-Water Mark\\" (pp. 140-142), Thompson recounts what it was like to participate in the 1960s; he realized - even then - that the experience would not come again. Another favorite is \\"I Told Her It Was Wrong\\" (pp. 191-206) - a pure-Gonzo, Rolling Stone article on the Roxanne Pulitzer divorce trial in Palm Beach. There are several other great pieces in Songs.As much as I enjoyed the short articles, Song's real treats were excerpts from two unpublished novels. The first is Prince Jellyfish, a coming-of-age tale set in 1950s Manhattan. The excerpts of Jellyfish - while only pretty good - are interesting, as Thompson's first (known) attempt at a novel. Even better is The Silk Road, a novel set in the Florida Keys during the Mariel boat lift (1980). The tale concerns drug and immigrant smuggling, a sexual triangle, and lots of Gonzo behavior. Chances are that both novels remain unfinished, or finished only in draft form. So, Thompson's fans will pine over \\"what might have been\\" after reading the excerpts.Though I am a Songs fan, it has drawbacks - which are also apparent in Thompson's other late-career writing. The material is uneven and the reader has to wade through the failures to get to the gems. (Am I mixing my metaphors?). Apparently, Thompson was - as usual - short on material and filled in by reprinting old material; unfortunately, Thompson repeated the same material in multiple books. (For instance, \\"Midnight on the Coast Highway\\" is here and in at least two other books).Perhaps the most-disappointing aspect of doomed is Thompson's coverage of his \\"lifestyle bust\\" in 1990 when he was hit with eight felony charges after a hot-tub party at his home went very wrong. (Thompson was exonerated). Songs concludes with HST's coverage of the case, but the section relies - not on HST's writing - but on notes from attorneys, newspaper stories, etc. I can understand why Thompson spent his time fighting the charges, but the reader wants of his take on the case.Songs of the Doomed is a qualified success. Thompson would have his renaissance in the 1990s and 2000s, though, he never matched the groundbreaking Hell's Angels (1966), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971), and Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail (1973). Still, Songs of the Doomed is well worth a look for Thompson's loyal followers."},{"Title":"Songs of the Doomed: More Notes on the Death of the American Dream","review":"OK, it's been a while since I read this, but remember it being essential Hunter S.

I think this is the third installment of the Gonzo Papers, including Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail 72'. I think it is a collection of essays which span all the above years, and they have been very carefully selected. I think this is Hunter in prime form and would recommend it to any Thompson reader.

Happy reading!Songs of the Doomed: More Notes on the Death of the American Dream"},{"Title":"Songs of the Doomed: More Notes on the Death of the American Dream","review":"Great overview of all his work. Mike should buy it now and never look back!"},{"Title":"Songs of the Doomed: More Notes on the Death of the American Dream","review":"In a review of Hunter Thompson's early journalistic work compiled under the title , The Great Shark Hunt, a retrospective sampling of his works through the early 1970s, many which appeared in the pages of Rolling Stone magazine during its more radical, hipper phase, I noted the following points that are useful to repost here in reviewing Songs Of The Doomed, another later , similar compilation of his journalistic pieces:\\"Generally the most the trenchant social criticism, commentary and analysis complete with a prescriptive social program ripe for implementation has been done by thinkers and writers who work outside the realm of bourgeois society, notably socialists, like Karl Marx. Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky and other less radical progressive thinkers. Bourgeois society rarely allows itself, in self-defense if nothing else, to be skewered by trenchant criticism from within. This is particularly true when it comes from a man of big, high life appetites, a known dope fiend, a furious wild man gun freak, and all-around edge city lifestyle addict like the late, massively lamented, massively lamented in this quarter in any case, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson. Nevertheless, although he was far, very far, from any thought of a socialist solution to society's current problems and would reject such a designation, I think out of hand, we could travel part of the way with him. We saw him as a kindred spirit. He was not one of us-but he was one of us. All honor to him for pushing the envelope of mad truth-seeking journalism in new directions and for his pinpricks at the hypocrisy of bourgeois society. Such men are dangerous.I am not sure whether at the end of the day Hunter Thompson saw himself, or wanted to been seen, as a voice, or the voice, of his generation but he would not be an unworthy candidate. In any case, his was not the voice of the generation of 1968, my generation, being just enough older to have been formed by an earlier, less forgiving milieu, coming of adult age in the drab Cold War, red scare, conformist 1950s that not even the wildly popular Mad Men can resurrect as a time which honored fruitful and edgy work, except on the coastal margins of society. His earlier writings show that effect. Nevertheless, only a few, and with time it seems fewer in each generation, allow themselves to search for some kind of truth even if they cannot go the whole distance. This compilation under review is a hodgepodge of articles over the best part of Thompson's career, the part culminating with the demise of the arch-fiend, arch-political fiend, Richard Nixon. As with all journalists, as indeed with all writers especially those who are writing under the pressure of time-lines and for mass circulation media, these pieces show an uneven quality. Hunter's manic work habits, driven by high dope infusions and high-wire physical stress, only added to the frenzied corners of his work which inevitably was produced under some duress, a duress that drove his hard-boiled inner demons onward. However the total effect is to blast old bourgeois society almost to its foundations. Others, hopefully, will push on further.One should note that \\"gonzo\\" journalism is quite compatible with socialist materialism. That is, the writer is not precluded from interpreting the events described within a story by interposing himself/herself as an actor in that story. The worst swindle in journalism, fostered by the formal journalism schools, as well as in the formal schools of other disciplines like history and political science, is that somehow one must be \`objective'. Reality is better served if the writer puts his/her analysis correctly and then gets out of the way. In his best work that was Hunter's way.As a member of the generation of 1968 I would note that the period covered by this compilation was a period of particular importance in American history, the covering of which won Hunter his spurs as a journalist. Hunter, like many of us, cut his political teeth on wrestling with the phenomena of one Richard Milhous Nixon, at one time President of the United States, all-around political chameleon and off-hand common criminal. His articles beginning in 1968 when Nixon was on the rising curve of his never ending \\"comeback\\" trail to his fated (yes, fated) demise in the aftermath of the Watergate are required reading (and funny to boot). Thompson went out of his way, way out of his way, and with pleasure, skewering that man when he was riding high. He was moreover just as happy to kick Nixon when he was down, just for good measure. Nixon, as Robert Kennedy in one of his more lucid comments noted, represented the \\"dark side\\" of the American spirit- the side that appears today as the bully boy of the world and as craven brute. If for nothing else Brother Thompson deserves a place in the pantheon of journalistic heroes for this exercise in elementary political hygiene. Anyone who wants to rehabilitate THAT man before history please consult Thompson's work.Beyond the Nixon-related articles that form the core of the book there are some early pieces that are definitely not Gonzo-like. They are more straightforward journalism to earn a buck, although they show the trademark insightfulness that served Thompson well over the early part of his career. Read his pieces on Ernest Hemingway-searching in Idaho, the non-student left in the 1960's, especially the earnest early 1960s before the other shoe dropped and we were all confronted with the madness of the beast, unchained , the impact of the \`beats' on the later counter cultural movements and about the \`hippie' invasion of San Francisco. The seminal piece on the Kentucky Derby in 1970 which is his \`failed' (according to him, not others) initial stab at \\"gonzo\\" journalism is a must read. And finally, if nothing else read the zany adventures of the articles that give us the title of the book, \\"The Great Shark Hunt\\", and his \`tribute' to his friend the \\"Brown Buffalo\\" of future legend, Oscar Acosta. Those are high water marks in the great swirl of Hunter S. Thompson's career. Hunter, I hope you find the Brown Buffalo wherever you are. Read this book. Read all his books.\\"As for the pieces here, mainly the journalistic pieces that form the core of this compilation, the format of the book is divided up into decades starting from the pre-gonzo days of the1950s (although you can detect a certain flare for putting himself inside the story even then, note Prince Jellyfish) to the woe-begone mad efforts (on local law enforcement's part) to legally destroy Brother Thompson in the early 1990s. In between, Thompson runs through side commentaries on the whys and wherefore of his famous \\"fear and loathing\\" works that were the bedrock of his version of gonzo journalism. Additionally, in the 1980s he makes, to my mind, something of a comeback with his reportage on the Pulitzer divorce proceedings in Palm Beach and some of his work (published more extensively elsewhere in another compilation as well) for the San Francisco Examiner. One piece, one short piece that may sum up what Hunter Thompson was trying to do, and what make be his best individual piece of flat-out king hell king good Hemingway/Fitzgerald writing is High Water Mark from Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas. That is \\"high\\" Thompson as well as very good exposition of where and when the tide ebbed for those of us seeking a \\"newer world\\" in the 1960s.

George MacDonald certainly walked a mile or two in everykind of worldly storm -- his theological beliefs, particularly, rocked the religious boat in his day. Independent thought, however, is the first of those characteristics which mark the great writers. Of course, it takes one to know one, and in this case Michael Phillips has certainly gotten to know his subject and proven himself the scholar capable of penning such a tremendous biography. George MacDonald: A Biography of Scotland's Beloved Storyteller, is a masterful piece of work. Phillips paints the whole portrait, not merely the man, but the man in his relationships personal, public, and professional with those around him. We get to know his family, and it sometimes seems as if Phillips stepped back in time and walked along with MacDonald, across the Scottish highlands, along the English and Mediterranian shores, and down the streets of MacDonald's very boyhood.I am somewhat saddened that the works of George MacDonald were introduced to me as a young reader. Certainly his voice and his spiritual convictions that ingrained themselves so deeply, and positively, in the lives of the men and women of his generation could be the healing balm, or perhaps the catalyst for change, for this modern generation. Phillips shows us of MacDonald as man, as preacher, as scholar, as awestruck child of a living and powerful God who, despite the trials of life and the naysayers, persevered. I am happy, however, that introduction has finally been made, and I can think of no one better chosen for the task.Michael Phillips' writing talent shines through in this rich and inspiring work. Readers will come away with the desire to know more of Mr. MacDonald's work -- not to mention wanting to read more of Mr. Phillips' other works as well."},{"Title":"George MacDonald: A Biography of Scotland's Beloved Storyteller","review":"Meet the man that C. S. Lewis and now Michael Phillips call their mentor. If you're wondering why you should take the time to become acquainted with a Scottish preacher, poet and novelist, perhaps the greatest endorsement of MacDonald comes from Lewis. Lewis expressed the thought that though MacDonald was not error-free, he knew of no writer who was so continually close to the Spirit of Christ. In his presentation of MacDonald's faith, Phillips makes the words of Lewis ring true.Some of MacDonald's ideas are controversial but much of his thought gets at the core of what it means to follow Christ. His mystical side, which could see the hand of God in all of nature, and his emphasis on doing all that Christ said, remind one of St. Francis of Assisi.MacDonald was a multi-faceted character and Phillips does a masterful job of fleshing out the person. Particularly fascinating is the glimpse we get of MacDonald's inward struggle to discover what God was really like. He had a difficult time reconciling God's nature with the stern Calvinism of his day that could leave a child in tears for failing to adequately learn his or her lessons about God. You see in his journey what led him toward the thought of universal redemption, an idea that circulated during his time.MacDonald saw that for some Christians, hell was the greatest reality. But how does one reconcile the idea of eternal punishment for sin with a God that MacDonald came to believe was good and loving. His mystical side believed that even as the sun melts the snow; sin, death and even hell itself would eventually give way before the love of God.One cannot help but be sympathetic, as Phillips is, to this remarkable account of one man's attempt to reconcile apparent opposing realities. On the other hand, some of his views are a little confusing and appear to contradict Scripture.Those like MacDonald, who believe in a universal redemption, view the idea that some are lost forever as a defeat of God's ultimate plan and intention. They might say that to see it otherwise makes our sense of justice higher than God's. I don't think it necessarily follows that God has suffered a defeat because some are lost. God clearly states through the prophet Isaiah that we cannot fully fathom His thoughts and ways. We don't want to make the mistake of pronouncing as one thing what God sees as something else. We often see the death of a Christian as tragic, but for God it is something that is precious in His sight.Our finite minds cannot always reconcile what seems to us contradictory. For example, many have tried to do that with the ideas of predestination and choice. That attempt has been a cause of error and a source of disagreement among Christians. On this particular issue, as in others, wisdom is found in acknowledging all that the Bible teaches while recognizing that from God's perspective, there is harmony.Phillips portrays MacDonald as a seeker after the truth, and he does an excellent job of showing us where MacDonald's search led him. But it's still hard to understand how he could embrace the idea of universal redemption, when it's not clearly taught in Scripture. There's much more to MacDonald than this particular issue, but this book serves as a fascinating study of it.I now understand why a Calvinist, one who among other things believes in a limited atonement--Christ died only for the elect, would want nothing to do with MacDonald. It's interesting to note that Calvinism is reportedly making a comeback today among the young. It's not the strict Calvinism of MacDonald's time, but the essential doctrines are the same. That Calvinism would begin to experience a renewal of sorts shows that a divide remains between Christians when it comes to the finer points of doctrine.Whether it is in relation to disagreements, or one's views in general, some people make themselves almost despicable through their pettiness. MacDonald was the exact opposite. He was exceedingly broad-minded, a noble soul that inspired and elevated those he touched through his life and writings. He was, as he came to be known by friends, Mr. Greatheart of The Pilgrim's Progress. His thoughts were often grand, original and challenging.We are the richer for this insightful glimpse into the heart of the man. I can't imagine a better book on MacDonald's inward journey, and I can't escape the conclusion that he was a strong believer in Christ. The majority of his thought is profound and valuable to any Christian. It's amazing to see how widely he is read and quoted even today.Originally published in 1987, this revised and updated edition commemorates the 100th anniversary of MacDonald's death. It starts off slow because of the abundance of background information, but it's a great read for those who want to get to know a life that despite challenges and controversy was exceptionally noble."},{"Title":"George MacDonald: A Biography of Scotland's Beloved Storyteller","review":"The most thorough bio on George MacDonald that is readily available today. Author makes extensive use of MacDonald's own writings as well as the accounts of Greville MacDonald, his son. I find it comforting and helpful that someone like MacDonald lived as he did, unabashedly. I feel he is something of a living template for many of us today. And I trust someone who you can tell loves the Father and knows he is loved by the Father as well. This is all reflected so well in the bio. Of course, as great as the bio is, it is still no substitute for MacDonald's actual works which is where is spirit really shines through. I would recommend a good dose of MacDonald reading before taking on the bio...the details of a man's life can lessen what is in his heart sometimes.

Read the sentence aloud with emphasis and feeling7. Mark off the sentence's basic rhythmic units, eliminating \\"laundry list\\" formulations and repeated sentence patterns8. Count the words in the sentence and try to reduce them by halfThe weakness of \\"Revising Prose\\" is a direct consequence of its strength--it is the very essence of simplicity. Its eight steps are easy to apply and easy to remember. It also limits itself to sentence revision, rather than paragraph or text revision. In fact, \\"Revising Prose\\" is more a concision rubric than a style handbook. Hence, it provides neither the detail nor the scope of books like Joseph Williams' \\"Style: A Lesson in Clarity and Grace\\" (which I highly recommend, by the way). Nevertheless, since Lanham's book performs its chosen task superbly, it constitutes a fine addition to any library of writing improvement materials and will no doubt prove helpful to any writer. My only reason for downgrading the rating from 5 to 4 stars is the ridiculous price, which is unfortunately typical of Longman titles."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"I got clear through high school, college, and grad school without finding the process Richard Lanham lays out so concisely in this book. I was always told that revising meant planting my posterior in a chair and just muscling through, and I told my students that, too. Imagine my shock to find that a simple eight-point process for revising most kinds of prose has existed, in black and white, for over thirty years.Lanham's revision structure dismantles sentences, removing what he calls the \\"Lard Factor,\\" leaving prose that is active, streamlined, and comprehensible to general readers. I was initially bothered that Lanham's system favors sentences over concepts, until I saw that repairing damaged sentences exposed weak ideas. This process turns flabby, uninspired prose into something people would actually want to read.Moreover, Lanham proves revision important beyond academia. Business, legal, and other official writing is often overstuffed and weak, frequently concealing flaccid thinking. Lanham shows how excising the crap reveals the real heart of the message, the heart writers often conceal.Lanham occasionally wanders off the ranch. His asides expound libertarian politics incidental to writing, afflicted with rah-rah boosterism that infects his chapter on Electronic Prose. A devotee of new tech, Lanham gets excited about the tools electronic writing makes available. But anyone who's sat through most PowerPoint lectures or celebrity Twitter feeds knows that ability to say things in new ways doesn't give people something worthwhile to say.These problems aside, Lanham's uncomplicated but potentially revolutionary system offers hope to writing students and teachers, business writers, lawyers, and anyone else who needs to revise their work. It also offers a glimmer of hope that language as a weapon of obscurity can be beaten. I'd like to give this book to every teacher in America."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"The book explains a simple method to analyze and rewrite a sentence.

One of the most helpful writing books I own."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":".Reviewed by C J Singh (Berkeley, California)* * *Years ago, I attended a weekend workshop for instructors of college composition that was led by Professor Richard Lanham, author ofRevising Prose, visiting from UCLA, and Professor Joseph Williams, author ofStyle: Lessons in Clarity and Grace, visiting from the University of Chicago. They presented witty and lucid summaries of their books, Lanham focusing on revising at the sentence level and Williams on paragraphs. Although their books have gone through several editions since, the core concepts remain the same. Both self-teaching books are on my amazon Listmania's list \\"Expository Writing: Top Ten Books.\\"In the preface to \\"Revising Prose (5th edition)\\" Lanham notes: \\"Writing may have been invented to keep bureaucratic accounts....As the world has become bureaucratized, so has its language....Revising Prose was written as a supplementary text for any course that requires writing. Because it addresses a single discrete style, \\"Revising Prose\\" can be rule-based to a degree that prose analysis rarely permits. This set of rules -- the Paramedic Method --in turn allows the book to be self-teaching.\\"In each of the five editions of \\"Revising Prose,\\" Lanham added fresh examples and exercises to its core content: the Paramedic Method comprising eight steps as follows.1. Circle the prepositions;2. Circle the \\"is\\" forms;3. Find the action;4. Put this action in a simple (not compound) active verb;5. Start fast - no slow windups;6. Read the passage aloud with emphasis and feeling;7. Write out each sentence on a blank screen or sheet of paper and mark off its basic rhythmic units with a \\"/\\";8. Mark off sentence length with a \\"/.\\"Basically, Lanham's Paramedic Method advises you to delete prepositional phrases and \\"is\\" forms and replace them with active verbs.Below are four brief examples and a test-yourself exercise from the book.Original sentence: \\"Physical satisfaction is the most obvious of the consequences of premarital sex.\\"Revision: \\"Premarital sex satisfies!Obviously!\\" (page 3).Instead of 12 words, 4. Lanham labels this achieved concision as the \\"Lard Factor.\\" It's computed as the number of words in the original sentence minus the number of words in the revised sentence, divided by the original number of words. Here, the Lard Factor is: 12 minus 4, divided by 12 equals 0.66 or 66 percent.Original sentence: \\"Perception is the process of extracting information from stimulation emanating from objects, places, and events in the world around us.\\"Revision: \\"Perception extracts information from the outside world\\" (page 8).Instead of 21 words, 7. The original sentence has five prepositions, the revision just one -- preposition deletion ratio of 5 to 1. Lard Factor computes to 66 percent.Original: \\"In light of the pervasive problem of overcrowding at UC Lone Pine, providing another coffee house on campus would offer the university's growing population some kind of compensatory convenience.\\"Revision: \\"Overcrowded UC Lone Pine needs another coffee house\\" (page 70).Lard Factor: 75 percentOriginal: \\"Hypertext was invented to facilitate the process of navigating through a presentation of interrelated topics.\\" Revision: \\"Hypertext was invented to navigate through interrelated topics\\" (page 72).Lard Factor: 55 percentIn this complete book, Lanham provides 35 exercises for the readers to try on their own. Let's pick one at random.Exercise 14: Original: \\"The manner in which behavior first shown in a conflict situation may become fixed so that it persists after the conflict has passed is then discussed\\" (page 154).My revision: Next, discussion proceeds to behavior persistence after conflict.Instead of 26 words, 8.Lard Factor: 70 percent.If the original sentence comes from one or more authors, I'd revise it: Next, I/we discuss behavior persistence after conflict.Lard Factor: 73 percent.or: Next, I/we discuss post-conflict behavior persistence.Lard Factor: 80 percent.Try it. You'd probably do better than my quick efforts.In \\"Revising Prose,\\" his witty and blessedly brief book, Lanham gifts a five-star jewel to all expository writers.[Addendum: Richard Lanham's also appears in a less expensive versionLongman Guide to Revising Prosethat reprints the 134-page main text. The excluded 30 pages comprise a brief glossary of grammatical terms and 35 exercises for the reader. Since the 35 exercises in the complete book do not present the author's solutions anyway, I suggest an easy procedure to make either version self-teaching as follows.First, read the book through -- it won't take long; it's slim.Second, note down on an index card each example of the flabby sentences in the main text that includes the author's solution.Third, do each of these examples on your own and compare your solution with the author's.(For my sample solution to one of the 35 exercises without the author's solution, take a look near the end of this review of the complete book.)]"},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"Take a deep breath, ignore the hefty price tag, and click Add to Cart. Lanham does a fantastic job providing simple techniques that allow anyone from the the casual writer to the technical writer streamline their prose to create clearer and more powerful sentences, paragraphs, and documents. As an English major, this book was by far the most helpful book I read to improve my writing."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"I first read this book in 1980 as a graduate student and it changed the way I write. I still remember the shock I felt then at learning that academic writing did not have to be tedious, wordy and stuffy. Everybody to whom I've given this book (back before it became so expensive)has also found that it radically changed their writing for the better."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"Professor Lanham correctly finds the problem with the Official Style people pick up as they go through school and their jobs. They write noun-heavy, passive sentences that pile up prepositional phrases on each other. Having diagnosed the problem, though, his Paramedic Method for solving it worships at the altar of his Lard Factor, the ratio of his revised sentence to the original sentence length. Since he only deals at the sentence level, he rewrites each gargantuan sentence into exactly one smaller sentence, and this is where he goes wrong and often loses the meaning of the original sentence.For instance, he takes this sentence:Pelicans may also be vulnerable to direct oiling, but the lack of mortality data despite numerous spills in areas frequented by the species suggests that it practices avoidance.And turns it into:Pelicans seem to avoid oil spills by avoiding the oil.Even by his own method, this sentence is far too long. It could just be:Pelicans seem to avoid oil spills.But, he goes on to ask immediately after \\"Have I left out anything essential?\\" He at least asks the question, but he doesn't answer it. This is where he fails. A good reviser retains meaning and has to ask himself what the original sentence actually asserts. Lanham is distracted by turning one sentence into one shorter sentence that his Paramedic Method doesn't stop to consider if one sentence should turn into two or more sentences. Assertions, the very reason we communicate, should be the priority.In the Pelican example, there are several assertions:* There is no mortality data* There are numerous oil spills in the area* Someone thinks pelicans might be vulnerable to direct oiling (as opposed to shipping?)* The oil doesn't seem to affect pelicans* Someone (who?) guesses the pelicans just avoid the oilIn Lanham's revision, he only conveys the last assertion, which is not only the least interesting one, but the least supported one. Most of the original sentence is about someone's conjecture about the problem and its effect. The qualifications are necessary to let the reader judge the information correctly. The revision removes that completely. A better, but longer, revision might be:We think pelicans are vulnerable to oil spills, but we haven't found many dead pelicans among the numerous oil spills. Maybe they avoid the spills.I find the proper analysis also lacking from his discussion of the active voice, where he might use an active verb but doesn't choose the right actor. That sentence is not about pelicans. It's about someone drawing conclusions about pelicans. Even in Lanham's own writing, the passive voice is common and misguided.He's quite proud of \\"skotison\\", the word he uses to describe inflated prose, and uses an example of Alexander Pope's translation of a poem into plain english. Pope's satire isn't the basis for an editorial philosophy though, as it loses almost all intended meaning just as Lanham's pelican example does. Poems don't exist to codify a series of actions. Instead, they try to describe perception and feeling, using imagery as best it can. Simply saying \\"shut the door\\" does not do that. It's cold, sterile, and utterly boring.As such, if you are not a writer or an editor, this is a decent enough book to start your revisioning education for your own material. However, it's not a good enough guide to become even a decent editor. There's too much that the Paramedic Method ignores."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"This slim writing guide by Prof. Lanham is a must have for anyone in the writing field, the business world or the government.In under 150 pages, he attacks the &quot;Little engine that couldn't,&quot; &quot;is,&quot; &amp; &quot;to be,&quot; verbs, peoples' over use of prepositional phrases and the official dialoug.&quot;Revising Prose,&quot; uses strong verbs to get the Lanham's points across.

Starting from analysis and reconstruction using small number of rules, progressing to the philosophical question of why you should revise prose, this book remains interesting after multiple readings. I can't speak hightly enough of it. A true eye opener."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"If you read this book, you will discover how to recognise what is wrong with bad writing, and how to transform it into good writing.Having read this book, I can recall books I have read in the past which used tedious stuffy prose, and convert it mentally into better language. Good prose has an operator, an action, and an object. It does not have passive verbs such as 'is.' If you take the is out and replace with a more active verb, your writing will glitter and glow.Winston Churchill said: 'We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the shores.' Operator we. Action fight. Object beaches.He did not say: 'Hostilities shall be commenced on the coastal perimeter.' Unspecified operator, action, and object.In addition, you can learn much more than this, the academic style has become somewhat too popular, although there may be contexts in which it is appropriate, but if you wish to polish up your prose, and make it vastly more dynamic, you can do this in a matter of hours with this book, and eliminate a lifetime of passive noun styles.Other lessons include using 'is' less, the less you use passive verbs like is, the more powerful, and attention grabbing your prose will become.If you're like me, it will change your whole understanding of writing style, an enable you to make your point clearly, briefly and succinctly, in about half the words you normally use. More active prose leads to a more active and clearer mind.Here on Amazon due to a searching glitch you may come upon an expensive version of this book. You can find a version by the same author, same publisher #Longman#, almost the same title, and exactly the same book for a fraction of the price.Longman Guide to Revising Prose: A Quick and Easy Method for Turning Good Writing into Great Writing. I wonder if you found this helpful.I recommendAnalyzing Proseby the same author, if you can get it at a reasonable price. Most of all, I recommend you check outShakespeare's Wordcraft #Softcover#which explores the language patterns of Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"I have the second edition (1987) and it cost me all of $2 on a secondhand stall. I'm sure the current $38 pricing is from some idea of marketing it as a school textbook to be purchased in bulk...an interesting sidelight on the way publishers see the schoolbook market...or the desperate need of corporations to get remedial aid for the illiterate college grads they have to hire. But, pricing aside, it is in many ways an amazing book.Many guides to writing English will tell you, in a general way, to avoid unnecessary complication, use active rather than passive verbs, and so forth. Lanham goes beyond this by really digging into the components of a sentence and the way they may be linked together by essentially useless prepositions and the feeble \\"is.\\". The \\"Paramedic Method\\" brute force approach to rephrasing is a breath of fresh air. It deals with what I've seen defined as \\"Valueless Complexity.\\" (The topic was business processes, not language, but the term applies nicely.)Also, I liked Lanham's philosophical ruminations on the \\"Official Voice\\" and why indeed it exists. Some sharp analysis there on our interactions as social beings, and the role played by language. Another plus: the excellent and concise summary of English grammar in the Appendix. And another: the importance of the the SOUND of prose.Now, that said, I have a few reservations (the 4-star rationale: really 4 1/2!):Sometimes his rebuilding of a complex piece does indeed change the author's original thought. Well, the new thought may or may not be better than the old thought, but we're going beyond \\"revising prose\\" here.In 1987 he was just beginning to come to terms with the electronic word processor. It led him into some rather unsuccessful (to me) ideas about using oddball typefaces to help understand sentence structure. Would be interesting to know what the current editions have made of all that.Then, if this error is repeated in later editions - for shame! He lambastes some writer for correctly using the word \\"supersedes\\" and thinks it has a \\"c\\" in it! An English professor yet! Obviously not much background in Latin and the history of word derivations.And finally, he's happy with \\"Who's kicking who\\" versus \\"Who's kicking whom.\\" Sorry, Richard, I don't buy it. It doesn't sound more natural to me - it grates like squeaky chalk.But a heck of an interesting book."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"In brief: this book is amazing. Lanham will teach you to write with precision and clarity; and he will help you with revising and self-expression. Academics must read this book - and especially graduate students.

I can't wait!This book does a fantastic job of covering everything from how to write and critique a paper, how to cite sources, editing, organizing, writing letters from complaints to resumes, how to prepare for taking a test and more!

When I formulated this goal in my mind, I knew I would need a guide. Following the advice of my teacher, I picked up this dandy little book, and I can only say one thing: what a big help it has been! The section devoted to the subtle nuances of the English language, such as the differences between eminent/imminent, lay/lie, who/whom, that/which, etc., is well worth the cost by itself! In addition, the book provides lucid guidelines and step-by-step instructions for writing a letter, report, summary, or any other genre of paper.Put simply, this is a book every English geek should have."},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"thats what i thought when i was writing my first essay in the 9th grade last year...this book was a lifesaver! along with every writing assignment my english teacher gave, writer's inc. was by my side. unfortunately, during our move, the book was lost, so now I have to buy another copy..."},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"Ok, maybe my summary isn't EXACTLY true, but if not, it's very close.

Item is new, clean and great quality. The interior has exactly what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"This is the writing resource that I wish I had been introduced to back in high school when writing essays and term papers. It is accessible for high school students but can also provide guidance for those out of school.With writing becoming increasingly important in high school (the SAT is about to add a writing section), this is an invaluable pedagogical resource for the teacher and student. High school and college student with superior writing skills will always differentiate themselves from their peers. By using this book, the student will improve organization and construction of essays and term papers as well as improve analytical reasoning and thinking. There is even a section of appropriate language for business writing. Teachers will find the most improvement in student's revising skills, a step that most high school students skip over in the writing process.It is more useful as a writing resource than as an authority on grammar. For a grammar resource, I recommend Dianne Hacker's Writer's Reference. Another useful writing resource for those out of school is Peter Elbow's Writing Without Teachers. Elbow's book is quoted several times in Writer's Inc. for providing suggestions for lifelong improvement of writing out of school. Another perennial favorite is E.B. White's Elements of Style.More parents, students, and educators should be made aware of this book. It is a good investment."},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"This book served me well through high school, college, my first job as a newspaper reporter, and also as a content writer for an Internet integrator. Highly recommended. I believe all schools should do what my high school did with this book: but a copy for every student to keep forever. It is an invaluable resource, with the right approach, and a little attitude.Fun, witty, smart, direct, and simply the best reference book I've ever owned, Writer's Inc. is exceptional not only for its utility, but also its content. Writer's Inc. is not only a grammar guide and reference, but addresses the THINKING and LEARNING processes in a way that most schools fail to do directly.Read this book. Keep it on your shelf all through school, college, a career, and the rest of your life after this and you will have a richer mind for it."},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"We are using Writers Inc in homeschooling our 10 and 12 year olds. It provides clear, concise explanations of grammar that even 4th graders can understand. We've used it for teaching sentence construction, grammar, speech, and book report and research paper writing. It has sections on just about everything relating to communication at all levels. There are even many unexpected resources including conversion charts, maps, a calendar and much more. An extremely valuable resource!"},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"This is the best handbook for writing I've ever had the privilage of using. It was my course book for my junior and senior year in high school, and now here I am in college, and I still use it frequently! It is indispensable! If you like to write, you'll read each page over and over until you are saturated with the wonderful ideas within, and even if you hate writing, you'll appreciate the conciseness and clarity of this book. The index is extremely easy to use, and the topics cover nearly everything you need to know!"},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"As an English and Special Education teacher I've found the Writers Inc. books to be a very helpful reference book for my students. However, the hardback versions are better organized and easier to find information than the softback. So, spend the few extra dollars...to get the better book."},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"I bought this book in 1993 as a requirement for my high school freshman English class. I have used it so much over the years that the spine is barely holding together! The information is laid out so simply and it is wonderfully easy to understand. The only reason you'll ever need to update it is to keep up with new rules on sourcing. My copy was written before there were even encyclopedias on CD-rom, much less the internet! But I still use it today -- 10 years and a master's degree later!"},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"When I went to buy all the required books for my english class, I thought that this would be just another boring book. I was wrong, this book is interesting, user friendly and easy to read. I used many, many, many times outside of that english class. It shows you how to write those difficult bibliographies for any situation and reference. It also includes sample resumes. This book is not only good for students, but for adults. It will make business letters look more intelligent by helping you to choose the correct grammar and sentence structure. It is very much written in plain english. This would also make a great gift for graduates entering High School or college."},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"When my daughter entered high school, her English teacher recommended this book and informed the parents that it would become the \\"bible\\" for writing papers. How correct she was!!! This book was used extensively by my daughter in high school. Now that she is away at college and took it with her, I purchased another one for my son. I believe it is the most used book in our house, besides the dictionary. No one can write a paper correctly without owning this resource."},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"The latest edition of Writers Inc is a great resource for any student or teacher, but does not provide the extensive list of prefixes, suffixes, and word roots included in my copy of the 1996 edition published by D. C. Heath and Company, a Houghton Mifflin company. I recommended this book to a student who was looking for such a list. We were both disappointed that these lists had been removed. If you have an earlier version, don't count on this one being exactly like a previous edition."},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"I was introduced to this book in high school where we were required to have a copy and use it throughout all four years of English classes. I found it so invaluable that my first copy was worn out during college. Combined with \\"The Elements of Sytle\\" (Strunk and White), there is no excuse for poor writing."},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"I purchased this for my grandchildren who are now in 10th grade. My daughter found it and I have only briefly reviewed it. The book is several years old, but contains a large amount of material on writing and grammar. By my daughter's statement, the twins have used it and have benefitted greatly from the text."},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"This book is the go to guide to well written research paper. However, times are changing. I have the 1st Edition (1989). It looks like it's time to upgrade. What is the difference between the Hardcover (2006) vs. the Paperback (2000) edition.

The definitions and examples are clear enough for young writers, while the topics are detailed enough to handle most writing and English questions for college students and beyond. The only thing that I can imagine anyone complaining about is the way the index lists item numbers instead of pages. However, this is the better way to organize the book for quickly finding the exact item one is looking for, so what might start as a complaint will soon become a selling point for most users.Overall, this is a great tool for writers."},{"Title":"Writers Inc.: A Guide to Writing Thinking & Learning","review":"Amazon has everything you need to excell in school and this is one of the best books to get to help you in english and at a great price .

It even has a student Almanac at the back, covering, Language, science, mathematics, geography, government and history. There is a wealth of knowledge in this book."},{"Title":"Flashback","review":"The overall plot is pretty interesting; the problem lies with the execution of the story. I found that the protagonist's adventures/missions too simple and sometimes laughable. (For example, an arms dealer ask a kid to steal something important for him.) Another thing is that this novel lacks momentum. What I mean is that it doesn't have enough suspence and tension to drive the reader to read on. There is also not enough descriptions on the characters' emotions. I can't really connect with the characters at all."},{"Title":"Flashback","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. The plot keeps you guessing but is not so complex that you get lost. Exciting and vivid characters that draw you in and make you a part of the story. It's the most exciting book I've read that let me go all over the world and stay in my own living room."},{"Title":"The Great Alternative & Indie Discography","review":"This book covers many musical artists that have not been included in many books-Tortoise, Art Attacks, Arab Strap, and even Furniture!

Now I know what my son is talking about when he discusses the Internet. And I know more about the chat rooms he goes to. Good educational Web sites too."},{"Title":"Algebra 1: An Integrated Approach","review":"This book makes no sense. It is overwhelmingly confusing. Simple problems are made much harder than they should ever be for no reason. Save your money."},{"Title":"PRIVATE ENTITY","review":"What a ride! Anyone who loves espionage and spy thrillers will NOT be disappointed!"},{"Title":"PRIVATE ENTITY","review":"I loved this book! Private Entity was one of those books where you find yourself up at 2am, exhausted, barely able to keep your eyes open, yet you can't stop reading. The characters were rich. The plot kept you interested and on your toes, waiting to see how this was going to end. The narration was so detailed and full of imagry that there were times where you felt like you were actually there, experiencing it firsthand, and not just reading about it. Derderian is such a talented writer; I'm waiting in anticipation of his next brilliant piece of work!"},{"Title":"PRIVATE ENTITY","review":"Private Entity was an outstanding story that kept me glued to the edge of my seat. I literally could not put this book down. The international intrigue and conspiracies of the plot add to the excitement. The twists and turns of the different story lines come together to make this plot and its fascinating characters into an electrifying thriller that kept me guessing right up until the very end. This first novel by Derderian is extremely well-written and one I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Nietzsche and the Transcendental Tradition (International Nietzsche Studies)","review":"Green's work deserves a prominent place in contemporary Nietzsche scholarship for several reasons. Firstly, he refuses to shrink back from the many weird or odd things that Nietzsche says; Green isn't interested in &quot;domesticating&quot; Nietzsche so that he sounds just like another analytic philosopher. Secondly, he insists on the connections between Nietzsche's thought and the philosophy and science (both natural and social) of his day, thereby making Nietzsche look like less of a Wunderkind and more like a serious philosopher, deeply engaged with the thinkers and issues of his day. Thirdly, by placing Nietzsche's epistemology in relation to Kant and neo-Kantianism, Green succeeds in showing both that Nietzsche does in fact have an epistemology (which both traditional analytic philosophers and more &quot;postmodern&quot; thinkers have doubted) and that his epistemology has little in common with the &quot;pragmatism&quot; and &quot;empiricism&quot; with which English-speaking philosophers are comfortable. In short, Green demonstrates that Nietzsche not only believed very strange things, but that he had excellent reasons for doing so, and those of us who are attracted to both Kantianism and to naturalism should follow Nietzsche's lead in working through the consequences of these positions.My primary criticism of this work would be that &quot;the French Nietzscheans&quot; (i.e. Derrida, Foucault, and above all, Deleuze) are rudely dismissed early on. Green implies that Nietzsche should be read as a &quot;naturalist&quot; and not as a &quot;postmodernist&quot;. But why accept this false dichotomy? Given the ways in which Nietzsche radicalizes traditional (i.e. Kantian) categories by way of his Heraclitean naturalism, it at least seems plausible that the post-structuralists are following Nietzsche's lead quite faithfully. One of the origins of &quot;postmodernism&quot; would then be seen to lie in the conflict between Kantianism and naturalism that animates Nietzsche's work."},{"Title":"Nietzsche and the Transcendental Tradition (International Nietzsche Studies)","review":"I have only read the first two pages of this book, but I already give it five stars for the joke on page two. In his critique of Kaufmann's (whom he calls a soft Nietzschean) critique of Nietzsche, Green says something to the effect that one gets the idea from Kaufmann that the overman could very well be a Princeton philosophy professor! I have still not quit laughing.I just hope the rest of the book is this good!"},{"Title":"Meskel: An Ethiopian Family Saga, 1926-1981","review":"I purchased this book at the publishing house on my tour of Ethiopia. Being &quot;hooked&quot; after the first page, I found it hard to put down while on my journey. It is the family saga of Greek immigrants living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia during a terrorist regime. A very stong but gentle story of the blending of two cultures, filled with history and appreciation of the very unique Ethiopian people, their gentleness and their struggles to maintain religious and peaceloving values amidst the turmoil of socialist rule. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it highly to people of all ages and backgrounds."},{"Title":"Meskel: An Ethiopian Family Saga, 1926-1981","review":"I write this review on behalf of many who lived a good part of their lives in the heart of Africa and who share my views. Ethiopia has left a print in our hearts and now after almost 25 years, Lukas and Mellina Fanouris have managed, with their book 'Meskel', to bring to life some of the happy times and, albeit, some of the sad and painful days that spoilt a once beautiful country. Through some painful but very accurate descriptions, this couple have managed to record an era that will go down in history. For those of us that were fortunate enough to have 'escaped' in time, this is a true testimony of what happened when the leadership of a country fell into ruthless hands."},{"Title":"Meskel: An Ethiopian Family Saga, 1926-1981","review":"This is a remarkable effort from unknown authors who not only put their heart and soul in writing this heart-rending story about my country, but were brave enough to have it published at a time when their lives could have been at risk. Mengistu Haile Mariam's brutal military revolution destroyed the lives of innocent people causing great suffering and humiliation. This is an excellent, well written tear-jerker that touched the core of my heart. A great read that keeps you glued until the very end."},{"Title":"Meskel: An Ethiopian Family Saga, 1926-1981","review":"I read this book some time back and am delighted to see it on the amazon web. A truly emotinally gripping adventure story of two different cultures blending into shared human experiences which often move to tears. I was hooked from the first page by its blend of interesting historical information always presented through the eyes of individuals from different cultures experiencing history in the making. A real page turner."},{"Title":"Meskel: An Ethiopian Family Saga, 1926-1981","review":"I actually bought this book while I was visiting the region. I found it good reading with a lot of information about the &quot;Red Terror&quot; period of which we heard relatively little in Europe. It is obvious the author is not a professional writer, but her involvement make up for the lack of stylistic sophistication."},{"Title":"Meskel: An Ethiopian Family Saga, 1926-1981","review":"This is a book that should be on Oprah's list!
