On the contrary, as soon as I had started to read it, I couln't put it down! This is a work of great depth and Hardy has an amazing way of expressing himself, one that really captures the imagination (like Dickens)!

I recommend, as she does, that the reader not try to empathize with the characters; it'll make you too angry. I wanted to reach into the book and strangle Angel a few times, for reasons that are obvious to anyone who has read the book.I must point out that one reviewer has stated incorrectly that Tess was &quot;raped.&quot; If she had been, the book would not have had the force it does. It would have just been another &quot;victim of society&quot; or &quot;victim of men&quot; book. Take a close look at Tess' confession to Angel on their wedding night.Think of this book not as an indictment of marriage and Victorian mores (although it certainly was meant to be, as &quot;Jude&quot; further develops), but rather look at it as the relationships of three people who are never quite able to understand themselves and their natures well enough to avoid disaster. An excellent book. But once again, don't try to empathize with the characters."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"When is pain the necessary entry price for involving oneself in great fiction, and when is it simply something you might call \\"author abuse\\"? I believe the tipping place can be found somewhere in the pages of Thomas Hardy's most famous novel.In it, we meet young Tess Durbeyfield, a simple English farm girl who struggles to make it through everyday life. Her father, convinced he's the rightful heir of an extinct family of Norman nobles, the D'Urbervilles, is a shiftless layabout who drinks and lets his numerous children do his chores. The family starves quite pitifully until fate puts in the first of several appearances. Tess meets a rich young bravo who goes by the D'Urberville name and decides to merge his bloodline with that of Tess, no matter what she thinks about that.Alec D'Urberville is one of two men whose attentions cause Tess much heartache and make up the substance of the book. Actually, there are three such men if you count Hardy, which I pretty much do. Alec is a right cad and Angel Clare, the other man, manages the impressive feat of being much worse, but neither lays for Tess the snares Hardy does, of horrible coincidences, contrived reverses in character, and way too much tolerance for ill treatment. There's even a letter-swallowing carpet. Man, I hate when carpets do that!When Hardy isn't pounding poor Tess into the ground, he's doing the same to us, pointing out how Tess in her misery represents the nullity of our common existence. \\"She might have seen that what had bowed her head so profoundly - the thought of the world's concern at her situation - was founded on an illusion,\\" he writes. \\"She was not an existence, an experience, a passion, a structure of sensations, to anyone but herself.\\"If only!Here's the rub. \\"Tess\\" is a pretty pleasing book to read if you manage to ignore or at least discount the plot. Hardy writes with great verve and knowledge about the world of his characters, fictional Wessex with its villages of hayricks and barn dances. At times it's like reading Wordsworth, and at others it's like reading Lovecraft. I don't know how else to describe a writer who can wax so lyrical and then shift into something darkly surreal and macabre without missing a beat. He was a master of description at the height of his powers in 1891 when he published this.\\"Tess\\" is also a deep book, with much Biblical allusion and symbolic foreshadowing matted into the subtext. Reading the novel with an online study guide helps bring out a rich harvest of Hardy's learned genius, as you can see the careful layering and connecting up he does throughout the book.Alas, it doesn't make the story itself any more digestible.Tess herself is hard not to care for, but she's frustratingly passive in a way that can not be blamed simply on the time and place where her story is set. She seems more of a piece with something Hardy was trying to say of the human condition, of suffering being one's lot in this vale of tears. You keep hoping things will turn around, but pretty soon you see the author has other ideas. Hardy pretty much wants her to suffer, so she does.Maybe in some imaginary alternative existence, I'll be treated to the scene of Hardy being called to some kind of literary court of law, answering for the misery he put me through here. I'll gladly waive my charges against him - only if they let me watch when it's Tess's turn to collect."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess of the D'Ubervilles is sooo tragic! I can't even... So good, so romantic... so sad... so wonderful. Shakespeare's tragedies never EVER touched me like this! Promise me you'll read it! Just promise me!The most I can say in the way of analysis right now (and having just finished this story I probably shouldn't be writing this review with tears and the utter agony of human love and despair both streaming down my face) is that Tess is a classically tragic tale of what might have been but could never be. I hate to write anything so simple in the way of anyalyzing anything this vast, and there is no ONE LAYER or way of reading this story, but this to me is the overriding principle.That, at least, and the concept of what does it mean to be a pure woman/person? Clearly Tess was pure, even in light of all that had happened to her. What a fool Angel was to let such a treasure slip out of his hands, and what a hypocrite! I know I'm understanding this from an American, 21st century way of thinking, but come on, Angel?! Seriously!? You don't blame the victim for their crime, and YOU had done the same thing WILLINGLY! Blame yourself for bringing her to this end, you and the elitist group of fools you come from (author's note: I realize it's not very sound to be venting so much rage on a fictional character, especially one in a story particularly designed to make a social comment about the day in which it was written, but seriously, why didn't he just scoop her up in his arms and run away with her when he had the chance? Bad form, Angel! Bad form!)."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I went into \\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" with full knowledge of the harsh fate waiting for Tess, but that knowledge still could not prepare me for how harrowing and painful that journey was for her, and the reader. The character of Tess is so moral, innocent, kind, and unselfish against the society that is anything but, that Hardy's message of fate and social hypocrisy reveals itself full force in the novel. Tess has a love for life and an optimism that takes the harshest and cruelest society to beat down, and that is heartbreaking to behold.I thought this was going to be a stuffy English novel, despite the fact I quite enjoy (most) Victorian novels I read. However, I discovered that Hardy's prose flows well and is even beautifully poetic. Some of the best lines come from Tess's mouth, showing that she is not only morally upright, but also smart and incredibly perceptive.Hardy has a great way with words; romantic scenes are intensely passionate, emotional letters drip with feeling, and narrations delve into the feelings and thoughts of the characters so that the reader can understand, pity, empathize and sympathize with them. Most surprising perhaps is Hardy's understanding of the female mind; I think he has developed Tess into a believable and realistic heroine, and he has many interesting things to say about the differences of the genders, especially during that time period.\\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" is a gorgeous yet heart-breaking novel. Not only does it entertain with its poetic prose and social themes, the novel also opens one's mind to the hypocrisy of the times; hypocrisies that even now may still appear in the thoughts and actions of people in this \\"modern\\" society."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I read Tess of the D'Ubervilles two years ago. I have read several of Hardy's novels and this is his best work. I recommend that everyone should read this novel.I am somewhat confused on some of the low ratings of this book and do not agree with the opinion of Tess. Tess is a strong woman who has weathered through some tough adversaries and situations. As with many books written in this time period, many women are weak, can not handle themselves and require a husband - not so with this novel.At the time this book was originally published there was much controversy and reviewers were very negative against Hardy (he stopped writing novels after bad reviews of Jude The Obscure). This is unfortunate since this novel teaches us many things about life and respecting people even after 105 years.Update:I have read most of Hardy's novels and still believe that Tess of the D'Ubervilles is his best work. I have since bought the Hardy complete poem edition by Palgrave and am looking forward to reading his poems (I like some poetry but not a total fan; I am sure I will his poems)."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This was the first book of Thomas Hardy's, and I read it in my English class. The book is, at times, difficult to read, and it is filled with Biblical allusions that the average reader may not comprehend. Nevertheless, it is a powerful story, one that I would highly recommend. Beyond the story is Hardy's description of the English countryside, which, in themselves, are masterpieces. Granted, it is not an idealistic in tone, but still, it is an astounding novel. Anyone who does not read Thomas Hardy is doing themselves a disservice."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"The classic tale of Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a deceptivly simple story. What at first appears to be a story of a young woman becomes a symbol of nature versus the mechanical world, love and hate, and good versus evil.The pure, sweet, young Tess is at odds against the world and in seeking to aide her family in their struggle to survive she becomes entrapped in a new world of deciet, betrayal and pain. Her quest to ask the aide of recently discovered, distant kin leads Tess unwillingly into the arms of Alec her &quot;cousin&quot; and from this action her life falls into a spiral of difficulties. Her misdeeds and those of others lead again and again to trials in her life. Hardy creates wonderful full-bodied characters and sets into motion one of the greatest stories of a woman of all time.

I was in awe of Hardy's ability to flesh out this woman, Tess Durbyfield, and just give her total realism. The other main character, Angel Clare, is also brilliantly flawed, and shows you that in real life there is no such thing as a prince charming. If you can sit and work through the sometimes tedious 19th century style of Hardy, you will come away from this book moved.

This is not a book for the average Daniel Steel- Stephen King reader. Tess is highly reccommended only for those who can respect and understand great literature that has lived through decades of readers and prints.

Beautiful for how he uses words to for sentences to form paragraphs to form a book. Yet horrible on how he can do such a thing to his characters.

However, times have changed and its relevance is not as immediate as that of Hardy's last novel, Jude the Obscure. Still, the message of this book is far from foreign.

It's long and the writing style is a bit wordy by today's standards, but stick with it and you will be rewarded. The story centers on poor, innocent, good-hearted, beautiful Tess who, at age sixteen, is persuaded by her parents to visit their wealthier relatives in hopes that they will help Them out financially. Tess gets taken advantage of by her sleazy \\"cousin\\", Alec d'Urberville, and returns home pregnant, her reputation ruined. Thus begins Tess's sad, sad tale. Tess eventually marries Angel Clare, a man she idolizes, but on their wedding night.... Well, I'll let you read it for yourself and find out what happen. The story really picks up in the second half, so don't give up on it.Tess, Alec, and Angel are all complex and fascinating characters. The story deals with issues of religion, morality, class differences, the changing English economy, and the double standard that pertains to men and women. It never loses its focus on Tess and her incredibly moving story. It builds to a devastating conclusion that I never saw coming.

I have read many books in my life, quite a lot of them classics, but I have to say that this book just about drove me bananas. I think there is a general misapprehension in thinking that a classic must be good.I dare not even think of how many times I probably came close to being committed to an asylum for acting suspiciously on the train while reading \\"Tess\\" (every two seconds I would sigh, roll my eyes, scoff or just plain throw my hands in the air from frustration). Many reviewers had rightly pointed out that the character of Tess is the shubbiest excuse of a woman in the whole Solar System. How can anybody, in any age, on any continent, be as spineless and masochistic as she is? This woman is more of a martyr that Joan of Arc, for crying out loud.The excuse that this book takes place in Victorian England doesn't quite cut it. I saw more strength and backbone in Hester of The Scarlet Letter (which story took place in a much more prudish and puritanical setting than England of 1800's).I think Thomas Hardy invented himself a woman who would act like his cocker spaniel; no matter how much he beat the crap out of that 'faithfull friend' the poor dog would always come crawling back and lick his boots, which is pretty much how Tess acts throughout the book. The whole scenario smacks a lot of a perverted male fantasy. Maybe Hardy had a nasty mother, who knows. I bet psychiatrists would have a field day with the author.I am disappointed and feel cheated of the time that I could have used to read something else; Dickens, for example. Or just Maeve Binchy, if I wanted female driven narrative. \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" would have been a much better book if that idiot-of-a-husband and Tess herself would fall into that bloody river in the middle of the book (exactly as Tess wanted it) and have done with it.

They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Having a degree in English Lit., it seems sinful for me to accuse Thomas Hardy of being a terrible writer, but there it is. Any writer today submitting a manuscript like this would have it rejected out of hand. This is not a book for an audience seeking a good, fast-paced story that speaks for itself. If you read this book, you will have to interpret every word, description, and action, try to guess what universal message the author is attempting to convey and what the characters are thinking and feeling at any given time. In short, the kind of book that college English professors love, and try to emulate, and remain college English professors because they will never get such a thing published.First of all, character development is not only lacking, it is absent altogether. It might be assumed that the book's title character, at least, would be strongly drawn, someone we could sympathize with, empathize with, or relate to in some way. Not the case. While Hardy expounds upon Tess' physical appearance ad nauseum throughout, never did I gain any real insight into her thoughts and feelings, her motivation. Maybe the insight is hidden in these endless physical descriptions or her inane actions, but frankly, if I'm reading for pleasure I don't want to take the time to search. Sorry. And it follows that if Hardy failed in his title character, forget about all the others.Secondly, his wordiness is irritating. One paragraph of half-way interesting action is followed by a full page of useless description and genuflecting. Perhaps essential to hidden meanings and motives and social commentary, but again, I'm not taking the time to search. I found myself skipping over these, the result being my finishing the book in two evenings.Conversely, Hardy seems to gloss over the most important event in the book, cloaking it in overly subtle tones. Granted, this was written during the sexually-repressed Victorian Era, for an audience with \\"delicate sensibilites\\", but come on. Something as traumatic and life-shattering as rape, in fact the event that is supposed to drive the entire novel, deserves more than an allusion to medieval knights taking advantage of peasant girls. Not that I want graphic details, on the contrary. But please, give me a break; even if her society deems she take it as a matter of course, let us see, clearly, her inward rage, hurt, bafflement at what has happened to her. Something. Anything. Make her human, in other words.If you really must read this, a synopsis would be enough. The novel's idea is a good one, and could have probably been done brilliantly by someone else. Hardy fails it miserably."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"A great windbag of a novel, Hardy seems to think that not only does a grassy meadow take half a chapter to describe, he thinks that everyone else agrees with him. Please. Not the largest complaint I have, but surely the first, is that Hardy's style is like looking up looking up &quot;stone pillar&quot; in a thesaurus, then two others, and then writing down every single synonym. It takes pages for him to describe a dairy farm, and at some point you wonder if he's introducing the farm as a character, it gets so much time.Not that he seems to spend that much time on his characters; they are created with little that interests, and contain less development that a homeless shelter under President Bush.Tess is described, at great length, and quite often, as a beautiful woman. Okay, so what? Her personality is so weak I wonder if he even thought about what she would do in a situation, or just had her do whatever the other characters wanted her to do, until the very end, when she makes an out of character action that is supposed to be shocking, but is more perplexing; the character described in the rest of the book wouldn't do that, and there is nothing to indicate why she has a sudden change of being.Angel is built up as the &quot;perfect prince in shining armor&quot; until he finds out about Tess's secret, when he suddenly acts like a selfish and snotty child that is the very opposite of what he has been in the rest of the book. Then he switches back at the end, with little thought as to why by Hardy, at least not much that is apparent in the book.Let's see, boring writing style and poorly done characters, what else is there? Ah, plot. The only way to describe plot is that it made the description seem riveting and his characters thought out. He's spend the time to talk about Tess getting a job, then the next chapter she is suddenly running away from it; I felt robbed of the time spent in the build up, and knowing more in detail of what happened in the intervening time from when she got the job to when she quit would have helped with her character. And when you think there is no need for detail, Hardy's got more than enough. He spends ages talking about Tess and Angel's time together at the dairy farm, but none of their actions change the way they feel about each other. He could have cut our some of their horse riding, and no one would complain.In short, Hardy's the kind of writer who is analogous to a storyteller that likes the sound of his voice; just because he can say something, he does. And in his endless drivel, what might be interesting is skipper over. This guy could have used and editor.When it first came out, this book was ill received, and I see no reason for anything to have changed since."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This may be entirely shallow, but I bought 8 of these books just because I was obsessed with the cover design.....they look so great on the shelf, and I am sure they are good reads too!

The average Stephen King/Sandra Brown reader will not be one that should read Tess, especially if they don't order Classic Novels on their dinner menu.

It felt like I was doing something wrong by reading Tess, even though I did not have a reason to believe why.

Your spirit feels free, that's what Thomas Hardy can do to you as a person."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Ok, the first time I too this book out of the library, I got halfway through it before I hurled it at the wall. I couldn't stand the characters and I was so mad and frustrated with them I returned it without finishing it. A month later, it was drivng me crazy not knowing how the characters fared, and I took it out and finished it. But this time, I knew how to read it: I didn't try so hard to relate to the characters, I just read their story. And I found if a fascinating study of suffering and sorrow and love and all that good stuff. So just get throught the very frustrating middle and it's good, really. Strange, gothic ending, but good.

Nothing could top Pride & Prejudice, but this is a real literary masterpiece. The way Hardy creates depth of character leaves you feeling utterly heartbroken...like it was happening to one of your own loved ones...or even yourself. Even Alec, as the antagonist, becomes something more than just someone you automatically hate.I would recommend this book to everyone that enjoys well written literature with captivating stories. However, I would say that is isn't at all for the faint of heart. I was nearly inconsolable for an entire night after I finished this novel, and I still find myself thinking about it a week later.

I like to read books other authors have read or recommended or quoted. I like reading period pieces and about the lifestyles of how people lived and viewed the world at different times in our history, and this book falls into that category. It's a love triangle with serious characters and story line. Sometimes I make the mistake of thinking people were not sophisticated 2 hundred years ago, but they were and had difficult issues in which to deal within their cultures. As the author was an Englishman, there were loads of vocabulary learned with reading this book, but it was fun because it's so easy with the Kindle to look up a word. It's a story of innocence lost, love found, lost, found again, and ultimately lost again (and ever so tragically).

Hardy has such a wonderful way of spinning a tale and with great insight into the characters soul and personality. Many olde English words you can't even find in the dictionary. Not many words go to waste here."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Thomas Hardy's novel, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, is truly a classic. Hardy's use of vivid imagery to evoke emotion was magnificent. His ability to bring life to the scenes of the novel made the comprehension of the story much easier. The sad story of Tess' demise was provided with a great deal of emotion, which made the novel incredible to read.We follow Tess throughout her life, experiencing all the emotions associated with her horrific teenage years. We are able to see the progression of her character and the emotions that drove her all the way towards the end of novel. It was evident that Hardy used his keen ability to address his opinion of the imminent will.Hardy has done an outstanding job, and though Tess' story, he has addressed serious problems with society that have transcended to even this era. An outstanding job! To see that the only a few people have given this novel five stars amazes me! Tess was an extraordinary novel; the power of this work of literature is unlike any other. It is unique and a must read for any high school student. I'm proud to say that this novel was enjoyable and an interesting read. From start to miserable finish, Hardy kept my eyes glued. His vivid imagery and interesting diction proved to be a great addition to an already interesting plot."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"A must read. Thomas Hardy's diction is unforgettable. Just like a Shakespeare play, every sentence must be savored. Despite the seemingly overwhelming amount of detail included, the novel is extremely readable. All this detail allows the reader to have vivid pictures of each and every scene painted in their minds. From the action filled beginning to the somewhat predictable but nevertheless fantastic ending, the reader will be on the edge of his or her seat, wondering what misadventure Tess will fall into next. The protagonist, Tess, can easily be classified as a heroine of the Victorian era. Her character is impossible not to love, tragically selfless, humble, and beautiful inside and out. The events of the novel make one feel an anger towards not only some of the characters, but towards what they represent and the society which they live in. From the misogynistic, deceitful character of Alec to the well-intentioned but foolish character of Tess's mother, even to our main character, the wide eyed, innocent, ever altruistic character of Tess, every character has a statement to make about the world that Hardy places them in. And with Tess's fatal flaw, one can't help but think of how applicable it is even in today's time. Making bold statements on gender lines, social status lines, and the inevitability of fate, this novel transcends time. A quick recommendation-though at times the book may seem to drag out, it is certainly worth it to continue reading and finish the novel. Also, as the novel progresses, the wording certainly gets easier to understand."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"The stories and the characters may seem simple and dramatic, however, of the classic nature of Greek mythology, consistent with other books by the author, such as The Return of the Native, and the Mayor of Casterbridge. The essence of the book seems to me, is about the tragedies humans suffer, caught in the conflicts between nature and culture. The nature is harsh but straightforward as love is, but the culture presents hypocrisies and judgment, separating people between splendid star and blighted one. Whether to worship the sun, or to worship the standards of Judeo Christianity? There are different judgments in wealth vs. poverty, religion vs. spirituality, men's honor vs. women's purity. And there is plenty of ambiguity in all of them but ultimately, the \\"anachronism of love and chance\\" leads the characters to classic tragedies in the end. Beautiful writing."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"The title character Tess journeys across the rural English countryside amidst a stark voyage of discovering exactly who she is. Her story is one filled with various sorrows, cathartic or otherwise, punctuated by only fleeting amounts of peace and happiness tossed somewhere in-between. It's not an easy read--nor is it meant to be--for a few reasons. Hardy thrives on description, some of which might seem unnecessary to the modern-day reader (particularly the extended glimpses of the dairy farms), though we do need to understand the Victorian world we're in. Consequently, the author wants to garner as much support as he can for his protagonist, who loses her innocence quickly and spends most of the book scraping up the pieces of a wreckage that was never her fault in the first place. And these glimpses into her troubled consciousness ache and resonate with us a century on. So if we understand the atmosphere she has to contend with, we begin to understand Tess--and sympathize with her plight and misfortune along the way.When the meat is torn off the skeleton, it's a solid (albeit lengthy) read about the meshing and clashing of various characters in nineteenth-century England. The choices of some of the characters throughout, some of which might be construed as twists, are not entirely believable though add definite color to the work, especially the last two \\"phases.\\" These culminate in a conclusive ending that is both haunting and beautiful. This won't be for everyone, though if you can withstand some archaic language here and there, you might enjoy this tragic tale about love, loss, and a stringent society that tried so desperately to dictate both."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This is a great book. The desriptions are beautiful. I was shocked to see how many people trashed it.Look, Thomas Hardy was portraying the tragic struggle of a simple country girl living in the 19th century. Women weren't treated well, let alone poor women. In my opinion, he spoke of Tess with tenderness and compassion. He was not trying to say she deserved all that anguish, but the reality is that that's the way it was. If anything I think he was trying to advocate respectful treatment of women."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I first read this book as a teenager. It has been a few years since I was a teenager, to say the least, but it will always stay with me as one of the \\"best books I have ever read\\" that is for sure. Among many wonderful attributes Hardy brings alive the English countryside so incredibly well. Tess struggles and loves so deeply and I wanted so much for her to be happy. I understand why and how she came to do what she did."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This review is for Amazon.com - don't read if you don't want a spoiler for the ending. I loved this book - it had great character development, a truly elegant writing style, and a plotline that kept me enraptured right up to the end. Hardy's forte was capturing the irresistability of temptation even with the most staunch of intentions. However, I'm quite irritated at the amazon.com editorial review that gives away the entire ending. What's up with that? Thinking that Amazon of all places wouldn't be so daft as to give away the ending in the review, I was expecting the ending in the middle of the book and was sorely disappointed to learn that WAS the ending and that I had known it all along. Please update the editorial review and remove the details of the story ending.As for the ending itself, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending wasn't quite as expected. While the plot of the ending wasn't unexpected (especially having read the editorial review), the turn of events and seemly strong character traits of Angel and Tess appear to have evaporated in an instant. While Angel had to spend a year away from Tess to work up to his acceptance of her prior transgression, he doesn't seem to think more than a blink of her having killed a man. And Tess holds such a strong belief in her own low self worth, that she is unwilling to marry the man she loves for disgracing him. And then, kills a man without as much thought as deciding to boil a cup of tea. So, even though the writing style and the majority of the book were fantastic, the ending is the spoiler and the reason for only 4 stars. This book is still very much worth a read simply for the enjoyment of the journey."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Just a fantastic novel. The larger issues it addresses, as is the case with Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, are the very largest that we face. But the detail is also there, all the way down to every scent, sound, and emotion of the daily commute of a young milkmaid in Victorian England. That such strikingly detailed imagery sits easily atop the largest issues of our existence is a marvel. An amazing, important novel. One of the best."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite novels. Hardy expects you to be intelligent enough to understand the classical references in his novel without having to explain them to you. Even if you miss all of those however, it's still an excellent read. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading.Eric Gundberg"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Exquisite writing, fascinating story, a rural English world so real it's as if you're walking through it, smelling every meadow and farmyard, hearing every hoof beat and raindrop, feeling the sun and the mist, seeing every color change as the light shifts. Readers who like Tom Clancy will probably find Hardy too slow. Readers who like James Joyce will probably find Hardy too old-fashioned. The more time I spend in Hardy's world, the happier I am, even when the outcome is unhappy, as it is with Tess. It's hard to pick a favorite of his books; they're all so wonderful, but if I had to choose only one to take to a desert island, this would probably be it (though a tough choice between this and \\"Far From the Madding Crowd\\"). My husband and I dream of going to Dorset because of Hardy. I hope one day we make it. You simply can't do better than Tess of the D'Urbervilles.

It was just too slow...Tess took forever to make her mind up. Liked the descriptions and characters but so little in the way of action."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"It is easy to see why this book is considered a classic. To the modern reader, this tale of love and morality may seem like kid stuff at first glance (they talk about more serious situations in my niece's junior high sex education class).Hardy's genius is in his incisive character portrayals and the depictions of the social and moral structure of 19th century England. Tess and her feelings and decisions stay with you long after the last page is finished. I kept wishing we had read this in college so that I could have argued with someone about the moral themes."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This is a startling book and one in which Tess is forced to make difficult decisions in the face of awful circumstances."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles plays out in Shakespearean tragedy-like fashion, but maybe there is more to the word tragic in the case of Tess, being that her problems are not self-inflicted, but more in line with blind fatalism. In fact, Hardy underscores the theme of injustice playing out in the common folk's lives, with Tess being the microcosm of ill-fated individuals. The book isn't an uplifting read, but who's to say that a tragic--or even downright depressing-- novel can't have power, essentialness, importance, and beauty. Some condemn this novel as being \\"boring and depressing\\", but I would argue that there is a beauty in Hardy's prose, as he such a power in its way of making Tess' story coming to life with poetic descriptions, and this adds such an element of pathos to passages depicting her fate. Despite her suffering and pitfalls, Tess is a tragic character you feel for by novel's end, and there's a sense that Hardy is sympathizing with his tragic heroine all along.When Tess' father learns of supposed relations with a family of nobility, this sets in motion a series of events which leads to Tess leaving her family to go work at the D'Urbervilles estate in hopes of getting in good with the family. Tess' foolish father sets the tone for the themes of poor calculations and mistiming repeated in the novel. As it turns out, Tess' family is not related to the D'Urbervilles (a fact which no one from the family realizes). Tess, while here, falls under the clutches of manipulative and superficial Alec D'Urberville. Returning home pregnant and somewhat disgraced, Tess experiences more setbacks when her baby, who she names Sorrow, falls sick and dies; she cannot even get a proper Christian burial for her baby. For the duration of the novel, Tess' existence is synonymous with an emotional rollercoaster. Just as she is mourning her loss, she then goes to another place to work, where she encounters Angel Claire, a man she saw previously at a dance. Slowly, the two begin to get to know each other and fall in love, although Tess, based on earlier experiences, is mostly resistant to the idea of marriage. Tess wants Angel to know about her earlier experiences, but has a difficulty bringing herself to tell him; finally, she attempts to leave a letter, but once again fate intervenes and Angel never sees the letter. After Angel wins her over, they decide to exchange their previous indiscretions after their marriage. However, as fate seems to plague Tess, Tess is more forgiving of Angel's previous affair with an older woman than his forgiving of her relations with Alec. He can't forgive her. There is a sadness experienced as Angel leaves Tess; perhaps we feel even more pity because we know that Angel, for all his goodness, is acting a bit too impulsive and rash, hypocritical at an important moment in Tess' life. While it is a sad scene, Hardy is able to evoke great power in this moment. Tess once again finds Alec and Angel later in the novel, and each character acts in line with their character, but, as others have alluded to, the stars just seemed to be against Tess, and she makes a foolish, hasty decision.Despite this range of pathos experienced, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a powerful, poetic read, one that moves you. Hardy takes on a ride of emotions through Tess' life, and, she becomes a sort of martyr for the injustices in the world, a point that Hardy insinuates throughout. Hardy can capture the essence of detail one moment, and then invoke humanity the next. Sure, it's not a picnic reading Tess, and it is a bit emotionally draining by end, but this is a deep, emotional novel that works on many levels, one that has stood the test of time for a reason. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one novel I'm glad is required reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I know this is great literature, and I'm glad I finally read Tess of the D'Urbervilles, but I could not get past the fact that our plucky heroine Tess is a bit of a twit. While the injustices done to her may have reduced a lesser person to perpetual self-pity, Tess actually comes out the hero and pulls herself together, making a real life for her away from her family and her tormentor, Alec D'Urberville. It's only when she meets, falls in love, and marries Angel Clare that she begins acting the twit, the fool, and the loser. For some bizarre reason, she decides to be excruciatingly honest with her newly-wed husband (on their wedding night, no less), about her past trouble, involving apparently a rape, and her child born out of wedlock. I suppose it's hard for modern audiences to understand Angel's reaction (leaving her) when he realizes that she is not a virgin. Ah yes, the hypocrisy of Victorian culture. I understand that there's a huge sub-text going on in this novel about the social hypocrisy of the Victorian age, but it doesn't make sense that our formerly plucky Tess would now allow herself to fall to pieces.Great story, in all. The writing itself, however, is not great. Hardy's prose is really rambling, roundabout, and he just does not get to the point. Sure to wear out even the most patient modern reader. So, great literature, although Tess is a twit and the writing itself is rambling."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"The most depressing book in the English language. And yet, I think I was the only person in my high school English class that actually liked it. Does this mean I'm depressed? We'll leave that question for my analyst and just say I think I have a thing for melodramatic novels.Tess starts out a poor peasant girl with a drunk father and a stupid mother. After their only horse dies, they send her to their rich \\"relations\\" the D'Urbervilles, to beg for work. Her supposed cousin, Alec, rapes her and she has his child. The child dies in infancy and Tess leaves home to seek a new life and better work at a sunny dairy farm. At the dairy farm, she falls in love with a clergyman's son, Angel Clare and they get married. On their wedding night, he tells her he is not as virtuous as his name, that he went on a bender in London and slept with a prostitute. She says \\"That's great, because I'm not a virgin either - now forgive me.\\" And he's like, \\"Um, no. My hypocritical moral beliefs will not allow me to be with a woman who is 'impure'. Here's some money. I'm going to Brazil to be a farmer.\\"So he leaves her and she wanders the land again searching for work and a new life. She's doing back-breaking labor for little money on this awful farm when who should show up but...Alec D'Urberville, her rapist cousin. He's found Jesus -- until he sees Tess's face again, and then he goes back to smoking cigars and being a general d-bag. He tries to get her to marry him, so he can possess her legally. She says no multiple times, until her father dies, leaving her family with no home and no money. So her mother sells her into marriage with Alec (This is the point in the novel when you, the reader, start thinking that suicide would be a good option for Tess).Who should show up next, but Angel Clare! He's back from Brazil, having realized what a hypocrite he is. He finds Tess and begs her to be with him -- she tells him it's too late. After Angel leaves, Tess kills Alec with a bread knife. Then Tess runs after Angel, tells him what she's done and asks him to forgive her -- again. He's like \\"Whatever, we gotta get outta here. You're on the lam now.\\" So they run away and get as far as Stonehenge before the fuzz catch up with them, arrest Tess, then execute her for her crimes. The End.A fun, feel-good novel for the whole family."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Hardy writes beautifully, tells stories, evokes feelings and describes landscapes, times and cultures that touch the reader's core.Read this novel for the story and description, savor it later for the depth of existential questions and half-answers. Hardy is an early modernist, raising the big questions, describing the loss of classical innocence and hinting at potential paths to solutions. But, he does not provide definitive answers. His work suggests that the time of certain answers is permanently gone, to be replaced by a difficult journey, at best.Man has a burning need for significance and meaning, but can find neither fully. Character is the most important thing, shining through all situations ... but it is partially shaped by fate, chance, history, family, society and the environment ... and while potentially noble, ultimately inadequate to fully address the challenges of life.The reader leaves the book exhausted from the journeys, the hopes and the many pursuits. The flow of life and history continues in spite of the heroine's choices. In the end we are left with a bittersweet memory of this life which Hardy personally inserts as narrator, \\"will never be forgotten by those who knew her\\".Perhaps this is the best current answer to the ultimate questions."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles may be Thomas Hardy's greatest novel and would certainly be almost anyone else's. A dark, sweepingly tragic vision, it is a masterpiece in nearly every area: characterization, plot, meaningful themes, prose, and more.Hardy is well-known for being depressing, and this may be his most depressing novel. The structure of his dark novels is greatly influenced by Greek tragedy, and this is probably his most purely tragic. Many have thought of him as taking a near-malevolent attitude toward characters like Tess, who indeed seems born only to suffer. The concatenation of dire circumstances engulfing her is truly stunning, and perhaps even more notable is the ceaseless way in which they flow together to wreak the greatest possible devastation. Hardy is famous - or infamous, depending on whom you ask - for complex plotting and melodramatic coincidence, and this has some of his most highly wrought examples. Tragedy of this extent requires a very deft hand to pull off well; it is all too easy to become hyperbolically implausible or even melodramatically corny. However, Tess is so well planned and finely executed that the events unfold not only with verisimilitude but almost with inevitability.This last is another distinct Hardy characteristic. He had long been an agnostic by, abandoning belief in a benevolent overseeing power - nay, in any force that took account of humanity at all. Added to this was a profound awareness of human insignificance and a consequent absence of conventional meaning. However, he wrote nearly throughout his artistic career about a concept that he eventually came to find very plausible - the Imminent Will, a blind force controlling the fate of humanity and perhaps all else. Hardy is also generally considered a naturalist - a writer depicting environment as a crucial, almost insurmountable force in shaping personality and destiny. Like all of his greatest fiction, Tess dramatizes this vividly, portraying characters unable to escape wretched circumstances and even more wretched fates. Such ideas held great sway with nineteenth century writers and thinkers but was almost entirely replaced by existentialism. Few will now agree with the shadowy forces underpinning the book's tragedy, but the dramatization is so well-done and stunning that it will at the very least provoke thought about important philosophical and theological issues - and of course bring admiration for Hardy's great artistry.As all this suggests, the novel is incredibly moving. One would be very hard-pressed to find a more pathos-drenched story, and Hardy runs us through a dark emotional gamut. Much of this has to do with the character of Tess, generally considered Hardy's best and seemingly his favorite. The subtitle calls her \\"A Pure Woman,\\" and so she is in a sense; an innocent, nave, and ignorant country girl of the kind no longer possible in the developed world, she is far closer - in spirit and otherwise - to people from civilization's first few thousand years than anyone from the last century or so. Hardy plays up her symbolic worth, making her a sort of Eve and giving her many pagan goddess elements. He is well-known for his heroines and generally for depictions of women far removed from Victorian stereotypes. Though not current feminist ideals, they stood out as strong individuals with real feelings and thoughts; Hardy's gender and sexuality views were well ahead of his time, greatly influencing his portrayals. Tess is his most famous, fully realized, and complex example. The most obvious sense in which she is pure is sexually and otherwise morally, but she is not the virginal domestic queen of most Victorian fiction. The pivotal scene in which she loses virginity is deliberately ambiguous, leaving it unclear if she is raped or seduced. Either way it is a sort of reverse Genesis story, as the pure woman is made impure - by Victorian standards - by a worldly, sensualistic man.Hardy uses this dramatic scene and its aftermath to boldly confront gender and sexuality issues that had always been central to his artistic concerns. He pushed the proverbial envelope in these areas from the start, often facing censorship and always struggling to get his point across in print. A few years before Tess he wrote a famous letter saying his goal was to destroy the doll in English fiction in order for England to have a fiction at all, and Tess was his bravest and most direct attempt. She is in many ways a simple village girl but is not unaware of her beauty, and Hardy was one of the very first modern writers to even acknowledge that women could experience sexuality. We must remember this was several years before Freud revolutionized this area and also keep in mind that this was a time when statues were covered and it was not socially permissible to even mentions legs or ankles. Women were idealized as non-sexual beings meant only for domesticity and with no thoughts beyond it. It is now near-impossible to appreciate just how daring the character was or adequately convey her impact. Hardy's depiction and the issues he uses her to discuss made him world famous - the talk of high society and casual conversation as well as the literary world. For example, in his autobiography, he recalls how a society hostess told him she seated guests according to whether or not they sympathized with Tess and then had them debate. The novel received many glowing reviews but also about as many condemning it as perversely immoral. Hard as it is to believe since it was positively pass&eacute; even a few decades later, many thought it nothing less than pornographic - and a shockingly bad influence to boot. Perhaps the greatest sign of how much things have changed is that Roman Polanski's faithful 1979 film version was rated PG in the UK.This was clear reactionary hyperbole from a society so repressive that it had become pathologically hypocritical. Tess was a long overdue wake-up call. Victorians were essentially scandalized by the idea - from a man! - that it might not be a woman's fault if she is raped or seduced. This would be laughable if it were not so sad, but their offense hardly ended here. The novel vividly portrays the plight of many women at the time, especially lower class ones. Far too many women unfortunately identified strongly with Tess' problems: unsought attention from higher-class men that may have been flattering but was above all confusing; pregnancy resulting from rape or seduction without a father to raise or even acknowledge the child; suffering at the hands of grossly unfair sexual double standards from prospective and actual husbands; and, perhaps worst of all, consequent ostracism not only from society but often even from family and friends. Hardy was astounded by how many women, including quite a few high society ones, wrote him saying they were in Tess' position or a very similar one and how much the book meant to them. All this shows how strikingly well the novel dramatized contemporary issues; it is in many ways a novelistic equivalent of Henrik Ibsen's contemporaneous \\"problem plays\\" dealing with current social problems.This was a large part of the reason for Tess' impact and success, but the book would not still be so widely read and appreciated if it were the only feature. As Hardy envisioned, time has proven him right and the reactionaries wrong; the violent outbursts are now seen as perversely fascinating and mildly amusing historical curiosities, but the book's themes shine at least as brightly as ever. Feminists have unsurprisingly long had great interest in Hardy and this novel particularly, which has many themes of note to them and numerous others. Sexuality and morality aside, Tess strikes a somewhat subtle but ringing chord for women's rights via its bleak depiction of their woefully low Victorian status. Hardy movingly and accurately shows how barren life was for women, especially intelligent ones; there was not only a dearth of intellectual stimulation but hardly any stimulation at all. Sexual politics are still hotly debated and may never be resolved, but hard as it may now be to believe, rural women at the time of the novel's setting were actually kept in such ignorance that it was possible for them to not be aware of seduction even as a concept. The novel shows the tragic consequences that could so easily result from this and associated complications. Perhaps more importantly, and even more movingly, the novel also shows the grinding poverty that many rural English women faced. Worse still, it starkly portrays the consequent necessity of earning money without training, help, or encouragement. Hardy sometimes goes into considerable detail to describe the farm labor that girls like Tess had to turn to, putting particular emphasis on then-new machinery. Some may find this somewhat boring, but the point is well taken, especially as the infernal imagery used to describe the machines is particularly emphatic and highly symbolic.This leads in to some of Tess' other themes, giving the novel relevance to many with no particular interest in women's issues. Rural poverty in general - a perennial Hardy theme - is on grim display, letting readers see just how much life has improved for farmers and other laborers in the last century plus. Hardy's work is also notable for showing what one critic calls \\"the ache of modernity,\\" and Tess possibly depicts it most painstakingly and memorably. It is important to remember that Hardy grew up in a world without automobiles, electricity, railroads, and many other modern conveniences that were beginning to appear when the novel was written. Tess shows how such innovations were slowly filtering into rural England, profoundly changing a society that had altered little since the Early Middle Ages. It is thus of significant historical and sociological interest.Relatedly, and as always with Hardy, place is of great importance. Perhaps no one equals him in depicting settings with such close detail and vividness that they become an integral part of the story; setting is never mere backdrop in Hardy. Tess is one of his Wessex novels depicting the part-real, part-dream country, based on his native Southwest England, that he made world famous. We get a good idea of what Hardy country looked like and how its people lived. The landscape is not as important as in some Hardy novels, but we still get an unforgettable depiction of a bygone era.But the novel is great over and above all this; one can indeed love and appreciate it without knowing any of these factors. The engrossing and profoundly moving story is a large part of this, but Tess herself is at least as important. One of literature's most sympathetic characters, readers have found her irresistible from the start. It is often said that Hardy's depiction is so idealized that he almost seems to be in love with her - and there are indeed some interesting biographical stories behind the claim -, but beauty is only one of the factors making her memorable. Hardy describes her so minutely and reveals her inner thoughts with such breathtaking force that she seems truly alive in a way very few characters do. Labeling her \\"Pure\\" caused more controversy than any other element, and perhaps all will still not agree, but it would be very hard to find another character so much more sinned against than sinning. Some of her thoughts and actions may seem extreme - or, in our greatly changed society, perhaps absurdly nave -, but only the few who have suffered comparable sorrows can say what they would do in her situation. It would take a very hard heart indeed not to feel for Tess, and the strength of her characterization, along with gut-wrenching depiction of her downward spiral, continues to fascinate and move readers - and indeed viewers, as the novel has been filmed no less than seven times and also been adapted into numerous plays, operas, etc. - more than a century after she first became a sensation.Nor is she the only worthwhile character; Tess has perhaps Hardy's largest, most varied, and most interesting cast. Though set almost entirely in Wessex, we get a good cross section of humanity: Angel Clare, who is intelligent and sensitive but selfish; his father, who is a Christian in the truest sense and a rare example of Hardy depicting a minister positively; Alec D'Urberville, the kind of hedonistically and hypocritically evil man who habitually preyed on girls like Tess; Tess' father, an alcoholic and possibly insane deadbeat of the kind who may first seem harmless and even comical but who inadvertently lead many rural families to ruin; and Tess' mother, who though well-meaning, has a combination of harsh practicality and ignorance leading to near-Machiavellian scheming that often has unforeseen negative consequences. Characterization is not Hardy's acknowledged strength, but this proves that he was on par with the greatest writers here as well as elsewhere.Another of the book's biggest and most easily recognizable assets is incredible prose. Hardy was a poet at heart, and it shows. An autodidact, he has a distinct style with a strong self-taught air that can be hard for current readers to immediately grasp; his eccentric vocabulary, full of archaisms and \\"dictionary words,\\" and his heavy use of dialect can easily make his work seem stilted and older than it is. However, this is the apex of his prose as prose; its beauty and power are simply undeniable. Though a very dark novel, the writing often reaches heights of sublime beauty, and philosophical asides about humanity's insignificance, the absence of providence, fate's apparent malice, and social stigmas' drastic effects are immaculately phrased and stunningly forceful. The narration during Tess' lonely ride, the short segment with her son, and the final chapter is almost unmatched in literature, and the writing throughout is incredibly strong - so much so, indeed, that the book would be worth reading for it alone.In reality, of course, there are many other reasons. Elevated prose and other complexities may mean it is not the best Hardy introduction, and new readers would probably be better off with more accessible masterpieces like The Return of the Native or The Mayor of Casterbridge. Some who have read Tess first have also said they found it so depressing that they vowed never to read Hardy again, but its undeniable greatness forced nearly all to break the vow. Thus, whether you read Tess first or not, Hardy is a must read for any serious lover of literature, and Tess is at or near his considerable summit."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"There are many good things I could say about this novel: it is excellently written, the characters are vivid, the message is clear and important, the setting is richly textured and gives a detailed glimpse into the past, and it is never boring.Yet, one thing I cannot say is that it was a fun read. Even in the essay in the back of my copy of the novel, critic Irving Howe admits that, \\"The book begins to mobilize and direct large masses of tension which, until the last page, will make the reading of it an experience slow and grueling, a drain upon emotion.\\" There is such a ludicrous amount of tension and tragedy in this novel that reading it is a stressful experience. In a way, it reflects how *good* the author is, because he made me care so much about the characters that I wanted to throw the book against the wall when one of them did something stupid. Finally finishing the novel created a feeling of palpable relief.Despite how stressful it was for me to read this book, I still appreciate its many qualities. There is just something about the characters and the compassionate voice of the author that is very moving, and will surely linger in my mind."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"my language arts teacher had my class choose a book to read. I had no idea what I wanted, because she wouldn't allow me to read anything by Stephen King, and I had no other ideas for something worth reading. My friend suggested Tess of the D'bervilles, and so I took it from the school library.Unfortunately, I started reading it a week before I was supposed, and finished it the next day, and so I must choose another book to read for class.This is an excellent book that makes you think about what women had to go through a few hundred years ago. It makes you think about the complete lack of backbone shown in Tess untill the very end, when she finally realizes the injustices done to her were NOT her fault. You must remember that she had not been brought up to understand certain things, and could not have understood how to cope, or over come with problems that many women of her time had to face.The ending was excellent, and rather sad.If you enjoy learning about history, I suggest reading this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This book is tragic and wonderfully written. Hardy uses words to create a scene for you that creates the visual for you completely. I think that the sadest thing for me was to realize people did live like this, life really was that hard. As a 21st century woman I was outraged at the way that Tess was treated by men and by society. Who is the true bad guy, Alec or Angel? When we read it with our societies mores we perceive it one way, but if we were ken to the morals of that society how would we see it? Are they really dastards, or are they all just victims. I am not a scholar, I liked the story for being a good story.After reading the book I rented the A&amp;E movie. As I watched it, I realized how well the book translated into video, because I had already seen the exact same scenery in my mind. The only thing that surprised me was the bleakness of the trunip farm and Tesses horrible conditions. I couldn't imagine anything that awful.There are a lot of words, similar to DH Lawrence, but I wouldn't get rid of a one of them. If you come to this book as a great story and not as a classic novel, you will hold Tess to your heart and never forget her tragedies."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Tess. Many years ago, after completing a grueling mind-numbing week of exams in college I sat down to read this story, as a sort of reward for living through the previous five days. I have since read many of Hardy's novels, but Tess remains the dearest to me. Early on, in chapter 4, Tess is on a journey at night with her little brother Abraham and he is asking her if all the stars in the night sky are worlds similar to ours. She compares them to apples on a tree and concludes that most of them are &quot;splendid and sound - a few blighted&quot;. &quot;Which do we live on?&quot; asks Abraham. &quot;A blighted one,&quot; says Tess. Minutes later, their carriage crashes into some oncoming traffic... the family horse Prince is killed, and Tess is plunged through this incident into predicaments that will result in her complete undoing.Those who are familiar with Hardy will know of his fatalistic tendencies. His themes were not exactly &quot;jolly&quot;. And here, in the above incident he sets that ominous tone that is so omnipresent in his work. Tess is the story of an exceptionally gifted and beautiful peasant girl of decayed aristocratic stock who is betrayed by two men: one is the rich and sensuous Alec D'Urberville, the seducer of her body and for a while of her emotions; by him she has a child which dies in infancy. The other is the intellectual free-thinking son of a clergyman (Angel Clare), whom she loves with her whole being, and who abandons her when he hears, immediately after their marriage, of her earlier violation. Here is a picture of that Victorian double-standard that similarly condemned Hester Prynne in Hawthorne's &quot;The Scarlet Letter.&quot; Angel fully expects Tess to forgive his own past indiscretions (and she does), but he, in turn, will not forgive hers. More precisely, he flounders in his disillusionment, and cannot move from forgiveness to forgetness... as is obvious when he says to her in Chapter 35 &quot;O Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case. You were one person; now you are another.&quot; The double-standard breaks our heart even as we read of it.And hearts are broken here. It is not until many years later that Angel realizes his error by pondering on the Biblical story of &quot;the wife of Uriah being made a queen&quot; (2 Sam.11:1-27). Realizing (a bit too late) that he had judged Tess by the deed rather than the will, he searches for the girl... only to find that the extreme poverty of her family has driven her back to the other man. So strong is Tess's love for Angel Clare, and so powerful her disgust at what Alec D'Urberville has forced her to become, that she kills Alec. Now husband and wife are re-united but on the run from the police, and they spend a few days of loving reconciliation before Tess is arrested, tried, sentenced to death for murder, and.... (read the book).Hardy considered this to be his finest novel, and claimed that Tess was the most deeply felt character he ever created. Originally published in 1891, it yet remains a timeless story of the power of love to overcome the most profound betrayal. Significant is Hardy's choice of the subtitle: &quot;A Pure Woman&quot;.&quot;...Poor wounded name! My bosom as a bed shall lodge thee.&quot; - Shakespeare -"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the best books I have ever set my eyes upon. I have tried to finish the book in one sitting but found out that I can't because there is just so many things to figure out in the story. No doubt, fate plays such an important role in the life of Tess Durbeyfield and it is due to her noble descent that spawns the events leading to her own demise. The ending of the story is somewhat disturbing. Should we feel happy that Angel fufiled Tess's wish or should we feel sad for Tess?"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"The great thing about Tess of the D'Urbervilles is the poetry and the depth of the main character.Tess is an extremely complex character and yet a very simple person. It is hard to explain her:Hardy seems totally in emphatuated with his character. She is a thing of beauty like a beautiful flower growing on the road side. The flower knows nothing of why it is or how it grows, and so Tess is naive of her existance and surroundings only driven by the knee-jerk of her emotion, egged on and commented on the romantic and love struck Hardy.Hardy makes a character , falls in love with her and then day-dreams about her. Guarding her innocence amd jealously defending it by - 1)making her so complex that no other character in the book can love ,know and understand her truely.2)She ends up tragic so no one else can have her. Thus destroying her and tearing himself away from his ideal.It is true he builds her up only to tear her down. Such a tragic figure makes the reader feel a lament amd deep sorrow for Tess having tried to fathom her whilst becoming enchanted by her.I found all of this made the book frustrating and it flawed the main character. It is a very difficult, long and hard book to read- which would have made the book very hard to write by anyone other than a very idealistic romantic poet. 4 stars because I am a romantic fool for Tess as well."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"There really isn't much I can add to what has already been said about this wonderful Thomas Hardy novel. One of the things that really struck me about Tess was the importance of setting and how Hardy relates Tess's emotional state to the setting in which she finds herself. The contrasting settings of Talbothays Dairy and Flintcomb-Ash seem to represent the opposing forces in Tess's own life.At Talbothays, the air is &quot;clear, bracing and ethereal,&quot; the river flows like the pure River of Life,&quot; and the atmosphere &quot;set up (Tess's) spirits wonderfully.&quot; For Tess, the valley where the dairy is located is akin to Paradise and she feels an emotional high while she is there.In the dairy, itself, the milkers form &quot;a little battalion of men and women,&quot; often &quot;singing songs to entice the cows to produce milk.&quot; Everyone works together to bring about a common goal, a common good. At Talbothays, Tess is able to escape the pressures and prejudices of Victorian England. She is at the peak of happiness in her life and falls in love and marries the intellectual and difficult Angel Clare.It is when her marriage to Angel fails, that Tess moves to the dreary and desolate Flintcomb-Ash. Flintcomb-Ash is in direct contrast to Talbothays. There is not a single &quot;green pasture,&quot; nor anything besides &quot;fallow and turnips everywhere&quot; at the &quot;starve-acre place.&quot; Here, Tess reaches a new emotional low and her heart is as empty and dark as the setting in which she finds herself. In contrast to the camaraderie at Talbothays, at Flintcomb-Ash, &quot;nobody come near (Tess)&quot; as she stands &quot;enshrouded in her uniform&quot; working &quot;hour after hour.&quot; The other workers at Flintcomb-Ash do not fare much better and most are kept busy in the fields in order to earn enough money to simply survive. There is no time for friendship in this place.Obviously, Hardy was a master at description and the use of setting to emphasize the emotional state of his characters, Tess in particular. Although this book is a masterpiece of sensual language, Tess is also a wonderful example of the use of contrasting settings to convey strong emotional states in a way that mere words alone never could. Tess is a book that should not be overlooked by anyone."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I am a Senior at Linville High School. I recently read Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles for my term paper. I chose it because a teacher told me it was very good. I was quite disappointed with the book in general. After reading the description on the back of the book, I inferred that Tess would be confronted with a problem, but being the &quot;heroine&quot; she was described as, she would overcome it victoriously. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. Tess depressed and frustrated me extremely throughout the book. She cowarded down and let people run over her. The only thing that was good was the little surprises inserted every now and then. The whole book depressed me and I would rather not read another book of Hardy's again."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I decided to read this book after reading the Fifty Shades series....our main character in those books,Anastasia, refers to Tess several times and identifies with her.

Be good to yourself and read it."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess Durbeyfield is beset by guilt over the accidental death of one of her family's horses - a main source of family income. In an attempt to create a social connection and to gain financial assistance for her family, she entreats the d'Urbervilles to acknowledge an ancient familial connection. Unfortunately, Alec d'Urberville is taken with Tess and rapes her. Her life is haunted by his sexual assault from that point forward. Eventually, Tess begins to recuperate and finds employment elsewhere as a dairymaid. Her days as a dairymaid are happy and peaceful until she falls in love with Angel Clare. She agonizes over telling him of her tainted past, and when she confesses the truth on her wedding night, Angel is repulsed over her past and her deception of waiting to tell him. Tess is parted from her true love and never fully recovers, even when he returns to her.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is more than a sad story. It pays homage to the type of unhealthy family atmospheres that many children are raised in. The death of the horse is a direct result of her father's drunkenness and irresponsibility, though Tess never realizes this. When her parents hear of her misfortune, her mother reprimands her for not seeking marriage to the very man who raped her. The story also explores the mental effects that sexual assault can have on a person. Tess experiences extreme guilt, depression and feelings of unworthiness - common feelings for victims of sexual assault. In the end, as she is continually subjected to Alec d'Urberville, she experiences insanity which results in extreme actions.This particular edition included an introduction and notes about the text which I found helpful. However, I thought the girl on the cover did not resemble the maiden of the book. The girl on the front is plain and unremarkable, whereas, Tess, according to the text, is remarkable.I can see why this book is considered a literary classic, but I can't say I enjoyed it. That being said, I think everyone should read this book once. Tess is a memorable character that one can not help being fascinated with."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I bought it because it was mentiones so much in Fifty shades of gray, that I had to know Tess!

Hardy does indeed capture the English landscape fairly well into his somewhat lengthy, verbose paragraphs. But his plot (to be frank) stinks.The moment the reader meets Tess Durbeyfield he or she knows exactly what her fate will be. The book is a ridiculous web of intertwined coincidences which finally succeed not in giving the novel the air of a distinguished and accomplished work, but of a silly contrived plot line filled with poorly developed characters that could easily be crammed into 20 short pages. And the book might be all the better for it.The point is that after I read this book and labored through the hundreds of pages and looked up archaic English phrases and fluffy words that Hardy seemed to fill the pages with, I was struck at how much time I had wasted to learn so little, how disappointing it was to be forced to read so much obsequious symbolism and heinous happenstances.Don't read this book unless you have to.

For a modern love story containing these themes, check out Sophie Simons'l'Amour, available on Kindle."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I read this novel immediately after viewing the PBS Masterpiece Classic Theatre version starring Gemma Arterton as Tess. As the production follows faithfully all the key plot of the story, it really helped me with the book. In lieu of this, read the Wikipedia entry which outlines the plot in depth.The book is wonderful for analysis and discussion. There are many questions that can be created. The book has a lot of symbolism and foreshadowing.For instance, after Angel Clare and Tess marry, Angel finally learns from Tess why she has hesitated for so long to marry him. He mentions once that the only way he can feel released from his difficulty with her past is if Alex D'Urberville was no longer alive. One wonders if this is a seed planted in Tess' subconscious. Technically, Tess had no real functional reason to murder Alex. He was no woman beater, Angel had finally reached the point he needed to be in in order to accept Tess again, etc.The very first scene of the book is the cornerstone that starts the sealing of Tess' destiny and fate and nothing she does or doesn't do from then on can stay her from this. Her father's learning of the real family name of D'Urberville and not Derbyfield leads her to meeting up with Alex, her rape/seduction, subsequent pregnancy, inability of initially being able to marry the love of her life (Angel Clare), Angel's initial inability to live with his new wife, Tess' murder of Alex and her ultimate fate by a hanging execution.To me, the whole of the book is greater than it's individual parts. That is it's ultimate greatness. One can criticize the hugely long section of Angel and Tess' courtship at Talbothays Dairy where Angel/Tess seem to go on endlessly coming together and falling apart as Tess struggles with whether Angel can accept her if she tells him all the details of her past. (And then the subsequent hugely long time it took Angel to come to see a way to have a full married life and future with Tess.) But I took this time to appreciate Hardy's writing style, the way he uses Nature as a character in and of itself, to learn the real and authentic \\"what it was like to live\\" in that time in England, etc.I don't feel inclined to pass a negative judgment on Tess. In many ways she was the most moral, strong, and contemplative of everyone. Alex attempted to turn good by becoming a traveling evangelist but couldn't keep up the pretense. Angel, who rejected the more obviously suited to his moral viewpoints (Mercy Chant) to choose his more emotionally compatible love, Tess, had to undergo a huge personal struggle to rise above his concerns over what society would think of them. Angel's concerns were such that he states that even if they traveled as far off as America or Australia, that they couldn't be really certain Tess' past wouldn't come to affect them and even said it could continue to affect even the lives of their children. I really felt that Angel had the weakest courage of all the various main characters.Tess, on the other hand, continuously makes tough choices in life. At times, she uses pride to keep her head up and at other times, leaves pride aside to choose paths she feels benefits her family, her ability to be a good friend, to support herself honestly and the like. For her, love should conquer all and she struggles valiantly to understand Angel's point of view.I definitely will be reading more of Hardy's novels."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"The shipper sent an email immediately that they were on vacation so would be cancelling the order.

Undoubtedly, I approached this book with much doubt and skepticism. If you know Hardy, you immediately recall his superfluity of detail and monotonous landscaping, which inevitably impedes character and plot development. Suprisingly, though all discouraging factors were present, I found the book exceptionally appealing. Hardy's portraiture of Tess validates him as a captivating author. He draws us into her persona, leaving us trampled and bruised with the grievances of life. He walks us through her struggles, though mangled with her inability to step forward, she still persists.I highly reccommend this book to any avid reader of British literature."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"How amazing. Thomas Hardy actually makes you fall in love with his leading lady, Tess, yourself. Other reviewers have complained she allowed herself to be walked on; that is not true.

Tess of the D'Urbervilles is now one of my all time favorite stories. It's so hard to recommend a book that is at times utterly painful, but it's the effect it has on you that makes it so awesome. I was actually weeping audibly at times. These characters are so real you feel as if you know them. I found myself yelling at them as if somehow I could intervene in their lives. Thomas Hardy is a poetic genious with the ability to create people and places vividly awake in your mind. Is there anyone out there who can write like this anymore? When I say haunting I mean I was effected for days after I closed the book and placed it back on the shelf. This is a classic work of fiction that cannot afford to be missed. Read it! You will be better for having done so.On a lighter note these penguin classic hardcovers are amazingly beautiful. They are my new obsession. This one is no exception and the notes in the back were so helpful."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess is a novel written by a man about a woman who is mistreated by other men until she defies the men's acts with a crime conceived by the men's cruelty inflicted upon her. In short, it is a passionate statement about man's cruelty to a woman.This book understands the differences between man and woman, and for the most part, it is not complimentary to men. Exceptions exist. \\"The sun, on account of the mist, had a curious sentient, personal look, demanding the masculine pronoun for its adequate expression.\\"And during the hard times inflicted upon her, Tess refuses to reproach those men who made her life a miserable existence. It starts with her father, whose newfound nobility engage him in a mead house where he misses a deadline, requiring her to carry on the family business, which results in a horrible accident and family economic loss. From there, she must endure hard work, be sexually mistreated by an employer, move away from her castigated self from a problem to which she had no cause, live a life as a simple milk maid, and then marry.When she marries, it seems that all is well. But, her husband, when discovering during their honeymoon that her flower was violated (even though without permission) by one before him, immediately exiles himself to Brazil and leaves her in poverty and public humiliation. Her life is not good - and she knows it: to the point where she contemplates suicide.But, one day, when walking in the woods she sees maimed birds (hunting's collateral damage) which slowly walk about to a cruel and painful demise. When seeing their tortured final moments on earth, she says, \\"Poor darlings - to suppose myself the most miserable being on earth in the sight o' such misery as yours!\\" \\"And not a twinge of bodily pain about me! I be not mangled, and not bleeding, and I have two hands to feed and clothe me.\\" She is miserable, but she understands the relativity of such emotion.Men in this book really have to take the blame. Like the hunters who irresponsibly leave half-shot birds to limp to their graves, her husband must atone for his terribly misguided and failed judgment of her and her unwelcomed sexual experience. She was by modern standards too young to consent, and certainly did not consent. And, after years of review of the issue, her husband concludes what modern men would have been capable of doing in moments - ask for her forgiveness and pity her. \\"Thus from being her critic he grew to be her advocate.\\"But, this is not a love story with undertones of happy endings. Shakespearean in many ways, devoted to tragic ending, this book raises the title character to sainthood. And, like most tragedies, only the cold can complete the final pages without welled eyes."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\", first published in 1891, is set in Dorset (or \\"South Wessex\\" as Hardy called it) during the latter part of the nineteenth century. It tells the story of Teresa (\\"Tess\\") Durbeyfield, a beautiful and innocent country girl who is seduced by a wealthy gentleman, gives birth to his illegitimate child, and is eventually, after numerous vicissitudes of fortune, hanged for his murder.This was a controversial subject in late Victorian England, although perhaps not as controversial as we might think. Today we like to flatter ourselves that all great nineteenth century writers were effectively twenty-first century spirits avant la lettre, voices crying out in the wilderness against the hypocritical moral code of their contemporaries, and therefore doomed to be misunderstood by a scornful bourgeoisie. The truth is always more complex than that. In the case of \\"Tess\\", the subject of illegitimacy and unmarried motherhood was not unprecedented in English literature; Dickens, for example, had dealt with it in \\"Bleak House\\", as had Elizabeth Gaskell in \\"Ruth\\". The reception afforded to the novel was by no means uniformly hostile; indeed, Hardy himself admitted in the preface to a later editions that \\"by far the majority\\" of reviewers had \\"generously welcomed the tale\\".Hardy was a countryman, and all of his novels are set in the rural area of South-West England which he named Wessex. He had not only a deep feeling for the English countryside but also the ability to convey this feeling in vivid descriptive prose. This is not, however, mere description for description's sake; the landscape becomes a vital part of the structure of his novels- at times it can almost be regarded as a character in them- and Hardy uses description of the natural scene in order to amplify his descriptions of his characters' feelings.There are two passages in \\"Tess\\" which particularly exemplify this. The first comes when the heroine, following the death of her illegitimate son, is working as a dairymaid on a farm in the Frome valley in southern Dorset; it is here that she meets Angel Clare, the man who is to become the great love of her life. The second comes when Tess has been abandoned by Angel, after he discovered the truth about her past, and is forced to find work on a farm on the Dorset Downs, slightly further north. The scenes set in the valley take place in summer, and Hardy's writing is dominated by images of heat, of ease, of fertility and of luxuriant growth, symbolising the burgeoning growth of Tess's hopes for her future happiness. The scenes set on the bare, stony Downs take place in winter, and the imagery is of cold, of hardship and of bleakness, symbolising the dashing of those hopes.In this novel Hardy's powers of description are matched by his powers of characterisation. There have been few, if any, male English novelists who have had such a gift for creating memorable female characters- Dickens' heroines are pale and insipid by comparison- and Tess is perhaps his greatest. The author used to speak of her as though she were a real person, and wrote \\"I have not been able to put on paper all that she is, or was, to me\\". If it were possible to fall in love with a fictional character, I would have fallen in love with Tess and so, I suspect, would most of Hardy's readers.Another feature of the book is that it reads as both of its time and timeless. It is not set in some unchanging Arcadian landscape but in the real English countryside of the late nineteenth century, a period of rapid social change. Agriculture was becoming increasingly mechanised; one key scene takes place while Tess is operating a steam-powered threshing machine. The position of the traditional landed gentry was being challenged by the rise of a new moneyed class, a phenomenon illustrated by the history of Tess's own family. The start of her tragedy is the discovery, by a local antiquary, that she is a descendant of the aristocratic and once-powerful d'Urberville family, of whose surname her own is a corruption. Her seducer goes by the name Alec d'Urberville, and Tess mistakenly believes him to be a distant cousin, but in reality he is neither a relation nor an aristocrat, but a parvenu. His father, a wealthy financier from Northern England, changed the family name (originally Stoke) when he purchased a Dorset country estate.The countryside has also been changed by new learning and ways of thinking which have challenged the power of old ideas. Although Tess is from a poor family, she is significantly better educated than her parents' generation. Hardy describes the gulf between Tess and her simple, superstitious mother Joan as being as great as that between the Victorian and Jacobean eras. Angel, the freethinking son of a pious clergyman, represents the growing force of religious scepticism, although his views on sexual morality turn out to be just as puritanical as those of his father's generation. Indeed, Angel's Puritanism may be connected with his personal philosophy; he seems to have kept the Christian injunction to hate the sin while rejecting that to love the sinner.The book's timeless quality derives partly from Hardy's prose style, formal even by the standards of Victorian novelists (although Hardy can be demotic when writing dialogue for his rustic characters). This style is characterised by an elevated vocabulary and by allusions to the Bible, to Greek and Roman mythology and to Shakespeare and other English poets. These allusions help to create the idea that Tess is not just a Victorian country girl but also a tragic heroine comparable to the heroes of Shakespeare or Aeschylus. Tess's downfall can partly be attributed to the social structures of her day, which made it all too easy for a rich man like Alec to take advantage of a poor girl, but also to a tragic flaw. She may be pure and innocent, but she is also a poor judge of character, too besotted with Angel to realise how priggish and self-centred he is, making excuses for him even after his callous rejection of her.Having recently reviewed Manzoni's \\"I Promessi Sposi\\", widely considered the Great Italian Novel, I started wondering what might be considered the Great British Novel, and thought I would celebrate my 100th review for Amazon by putting forward my own candidate for that honour. The book is a complex one, both in terms of its plot and of its themes, and there has not been space to do full justice to these aspects in this brief review. What I have tried to do is to set out some of the reasons why Hardy is my favourite novelist and why I regard this as the greatest of his novels. I cannot think of another novel with so loveable a central character, nor one whose plight has affected me so deeply. This is a work of immense emotional power."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I rapidly read this book in high school for a test the next day. I knew that I wanted to read it again because it was so good and I was missing the subleties. I loved it. The theme is that our lives are goverened by what we think of ourselves. Poor Tess was so wrong, but for the times understandable. Hardy writes without including the graphic details, but the story remains. A story that is suspended in time."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Thomas Hardy, who wrote Tess of the D'Urbervilles, also wrote one of my favorite poems, The Blinded Bird, and another wonderful one called The Darkling Thrush. He has beautiful gift for words, character development, and emotional imagery. He has some vivid descriptions of the passion of love and the beauty of life. As many critics complain, Hardy seems to view life with some skepticism. He seems to believe that life is hard and people sometimes are not treated fairly by the very ones who should be there to help and protect the hurting. This philosophy parallels the feeling of many people that the Church has hurt them. A friend of mine wrote an impassioned essay about the personal pain she and others had experienced through transgressions of the Church.The difference is that she recognized a loving, all-knowing God who loves us deeply and whose love is sometimes not reflected in his people - whereas Hardy's story reflects the world's perception that a callous church represents an absent God. Still, I detect in his writing a subtle thread of hope as reflected by the hope of his characters, though not by their plight. I appreciated this book because it made me realize I am the hands and feet for the people in the world whose hope is gone.Anyone who hurts for others will be as greatly frustrated if you read this book. But you will also gain so much if you keep the perspective that God is in control and cares deeply about every person's plight. In this story, I see the undying faith Tess had in Clare as a picture of the way our faith in Christ should be, and the kind of love I want to have in another person.Tess' pain would not have been so hard to bear if the church had acted toward her as Jesus acted toward tax collectors and sinners in Luke 15, and as the people in those three parables acted. If the Church had applied the anxious determination of one who has lost an important object, Tess would have received the support she needed during her time of hurt. It makes me ponder the question: What will I do for the hurting Tess's of the world?"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"The story is well known; one can choose from many editions or printings. If given the choice, choose Norton Critical Editions for the classics.This edition includes factual background provided by Hardy's pre-eminent biographer, Michael Millgate, who opines on the \\"originals of, and models for, Tess Durbeyfield.\\" Absolutely fascinating.Critical essays include contemporary criticism: Robert Louis Stevenson panned it; Henry James enjoyed it despite it being \\"chock-full of faults and falsity.\\"Virginia Woolf's six-page essay regarding \\"Tess\\" is worth the price of this edition.But most illuminating is the verbatim interview with Thomas Hardy himself concerning the ending of the story. When asked why he gave \\"Tess\\" the ending he did, he answered: \\"For the simple reason I could not help myself...When I got to the middle of the story the characters took their fates into their own hands, and I literally had no power.\\"Reading \\"Tess\\" without the supplementary material and criticism will leave you having enjoyed a most wonderful buffet but having missed out on the dessert.One will also get so much more enjoyment from \\"Tess\\" if one reads either Millgate's or Martin Seymour-Smith's biography of Thomas Hardy. I prefer the latter."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This book will capture you and pull you in as you follow Tess Durbeyfeild, the blameless rape victim whose tragic jounrey through Wessex, England brings her love, despair, comedy (yes, there is some), friendships, tears, self-awareness, empowerment, but ultimately tragedy.This book is sad...yes, but Thomas Hardy's poetic prose litterally makes the insides of the reader do summersaults. This story printed on the pages of \\"Tess\\" are more than a novel, they are a portal into the world of a blameless woman. You'll feel the pain of these characters, escpeically our heroine Tess."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"One favorable evening, Tess in her white garb attends May-Day dance in sleepy town of Marllott. A passerby not used to sophistication will incline to notice her. It is not the extravagance, nay the ostentatiousness of the girl's beauty, but the softness in spirit and demeanor conspicuous on her big, beautiful eyes that sets her apart. The same passerby endowed with experience will not pinpoint Tess among the young, comely girls as someone prone to vicissitude of tragedies. Unfortunately, this is not the case.Tess Durbeyfield later known in the novel as Tess d'Urberville is the hapless victim if not the heroine of this tragic tale. Born from poor parents, she is whisk away to work for the rich d'Urberville family. There she meets Alec, the handsome scion of d'Urbervilles clan. His incessant seduction of the young maiden results in violation of her rights. Forlorn, she returns home to the embarrassment of her parents and her neighbors. Stripped of clear prospect in life, she travels miles and miles away to be a milkmaid. While in the vast dairy field of Thalbothay, Tess falls madly in love with Angel Clare, the fledgling agriculturist of noble descent, convinced to make the newcomer his wife. Thus the journey that leads Tess from one farm to another is side by side with her lamentations over the two Englishmen and becomes her heart's landscape that stretches beyond endurance.Hardy, an architect by tuition, molds his male characters in an anvil of insensitivity. Their frozen hearts incapable of thawing by burning tears of a woman's pleading. As to his female character like Tess, Hardy constructs her similar to obelisk with solid foundation of faith that gradually narrows at the peak.Unsurprisingly, Victorian society scorned Hardy when this novel came out in 1891. The way he chose to describe Tess and her violation were less subtle in comparison to Eliot's writings. At present society however, Thomas Hardy is as impeccable as the clock ticking on the wall. He is in command of his story as if time is in command of denizens elsewhere. Under no circumstance he pauses to please his readers. He continues and takes them where nothing exists but the certainty of time."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is among the best novels I have read when judged on its purely literary merits. Hardy's command of imagery in his creation of the nuanced satire of society and the values it imposes upon Victorian women is outstanding. And, Hardy uses nature to structure the novel and reflect the plot. He is also able to introduce a fatalist approach to the characters' actions that flows seamlessly with his characterization of them. However, Tess is more than an invaluable piece of English literature.Tess of the D'Urbervilles is also a strong insight into the forces of nature that shape our lives. It is a tale about the unlucky girl Tess, who has to endure suffering on two fronts: from the man who takes advantage of her, and the man who rejects her. She is symbolic of the person within us all, who is oppressed by the outside world, and depressed from within. She is humanity, and her story will speak to anyone who reads this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I read this in about 8 hours. I loved the prose, the descriptions, the whole feel of the book. I have to say I have a hard time with the type of heroine who just lets things happen to her like this. You know the characters I am referring to---I mean this book was kind-of like an 8 hour train wreck. I knew what was going to happen, well, at least that it wouldn't have a happy ending. But the writing is so great I couldn't help myself!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This book has touched me in a very different way than many others have. It is a tragic story and envelopes the reader in a different kind of sadness - a sadness which one cannot pull out of quickly or just draw aside. Many thoughts contained in this book are worthy of reflection. Each lingers in your heart. The happy moments are all tinged with a bitter taste. Each character is flawed as a natural human being and each mistake they make reflects on their future and affects them drastically. Tess Durbeyfield is one of the most tragic characters I have ever read of. From the moment she leaves her home to the supposed D'Urberville relatives, she is pushed into catastrophes and heartaches that just lead to more doom. I recommend this book to any reader who is willing to undergo the myriad of emotions that accompanies Tess's journey through demise. It is not for the flippant, unconcerned, and unsympathetic reader. Everything that happens to Tess happens for a reason, and the reader must be able to realize how each affects her to appreciate this book. Read this book and expect to ponder on many philosophical wonderings. This book WILL affect you! It is worthy of any person seeking a deep and life-affecting novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"My review is based on the Oxford Classics Edition.Thomas Hardy seems to have been interested mostly in sad, unhappy characters who lead troubled, disappointing lives, struggle against fate, and lose. There is beauty in artistically represented sadness, though, and notably so if we are only spectators. I am not giving away the ending by writing that &quot;Tess&quot; is a sad novel. I think most people who choose to read this book do so because they know it is a sad story, or they have read Hardy before. In my case, I had to read it for school, and what truly surprised me is the ambiguity that Hardy so masterfully portrays in order to make his heroine more of a real person instead of a mere character. By the book's end we really do not know whether Tess was raped or seduced by Alec; whether he took advantage of a sleeping girl and forced himself upon her, or she allowed it in a moment of weakness, tired after a strenous day and grateful to him for &quot;saving&quot; her from the other workers. However it happened, Tess's life is radically changed after the fact and this event will have grave consequences for her and Alec.The ambiguity is troubling with the entrance of Angel, the hypocrite who falls in love with Tess because she looks angelic, virginal, and beautiful as a child, but rejects her when she tells him that she is not a virgin (therefore not a child) anymore. Her other qualities are there, but Angel equates purity with virginity --something many people still do when it refers to women-- so he can construct a perfect excuse for his terrible behaviour towards the woman he has said he loved. In spite of the forebodings that Hardy drops before Chapter 35, this particular chapter, at the beginning of Phase the Fifth, is very powerful and almost surprising in its intensity. The level of troubling ambiguity goes up several notches at the end of the novel, when it appears that Angel may indeed get his &quot;little girl&quot; as a replacement for the one he just lost.&quot;Tess&quot; is a sad and beautiful story. There is much more to write about this novel, but I have decided to concentrate on what Hardy seems to have intended when he wrote so beautifully about so sad a theme, but in such an ambiguous way. He calls Tess &quot;A Pure Woman,&quot; and she is that. But as only a truly great writer would, he does not present her as an outright victim: there are plenty of opportunities for Tess to escape Alec before they have sex, and plenty of opportunities for her to deal in a different way with the cruel hand that fate has dealt her. She does not escape Alec, and she chooses Angel (rotten luck with men). There are tragic flaws in Tess, and that is what makes her human while making &quot;Tess&quot; into a true tragedy. Hardy knows this. His prose is elegant and, at times, it reads more like poetry, going from good to beautiful.This edition of the novel is helpful, but it could be better. I prefer foot-notes rather than end-notes. If they have to be end-notes, they should have numbers. The Introduction by Simon Gatrell is original, although I do not agree with its main premises: that there are two Thomas Hardys at work in &quot;Tess,&quot; and that &quot;A Pure Woman&quot; refers not to purity, but to &quot;essential, wholly&quot; woman. This is valid as an opinion but unsupported by evidence. I recommend &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles.&quot; If you have never read Hardy, read this. If you have read him, you know what to expect."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I was supposed to read this book 25 or so years ago in high school. It was heavy going, and pretty meaningless to me at the time. It has come to be one of my favourite books, and I have read it more than once. The thing about hardy is that the sense of place, and time is so evocative. I have lived as an adult in Dorset - hardy Country, and recognise many of the locales he writes so beautifully about. More astounding is that some of the social mores and economic system ( indentured labour, tied villages) still exist. Like Dickens, coincidence plays a heavy hand in Hardy's plot development, a contrivance that is a little agitating to the modern, more cynical reader. Still, I find it entiely appropriate to an era when people were most often trapped in a life dictated by circumstance, when free will didn't play nearly as large a part as it does now, in a Britain where there was no place for a meritocracy, class and social station being everything. Some vestiges of that are still very evident in English life (Royalty representing the apex of the class system). Tess is a classic, well worth the effort on a number of levels - the rhythm of language, and what it says about its time and place."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"But if you get the Wordsworth Classics edition, don't read the introduction until you finish! I'm going to make this standard practice for all classics from now on. I was hoping for some background on Hardy but before I even realized what had happened I'd read a summary of the entire story in one paragraph, plot twists and all. And it really did ruin the climactic last couple chapters for me. I hate it when editors / publishers assume that if a novel is famous and critically acclaimed then the reader must already be familiar with the story. Completely false: In this day and age reading for pleasure isn't as widespread as it used to be and the old classics are fading into the distance. The story in \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" is certainly not common knowledge anymore, so when you discover a gem like this I beg you not to ruin it for yourself by reading the canned introduction.Still a fabulous read, certainly. The story centers on the simple, sincere, hard-working farmgirl Tess Durbeyfield who is fated to stumble into a few serious and unfortunate challenges over the couple years that the novel spans. Hardy spins a truly magnificently written and plotted tale in narrating poor Tess's adventures & mishaps.I read another Hardy classic, Far From the Madding Crowd, several years ago and enjoyed it immensely. For the life of me I can't remember any of the story in that novel except that the central character was rather strange, but a few pages of \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" instantly resurrected my memories of Hardy's unmatched power of narration. He truly brings every scene and character to full animation and vitality, does the poignant scenes full justice, and even handles humorous situations with aplomb.Easily five stars, one of the best classics I've ever read. Just don't read the introduction!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This is a classic novel that is one of the saddest. It involves a very likeable, innocent country girl who is seduced by a cruel employer. She has a child by that union that dies early in infancy. She later meets a man who loves her but upon learning her past rejects her. She then meets up again with the first man, who forces her to be his mistress. The ending is very sad.Through it all Tess maintains her dignity and is a very likeable character. This novel shows the extreme cruelty of legalistic morality that is not tempered by compassion and respect for others, particularly women during this time period.The book is very well written if you like poetic descriptions and vivid imagery. Hardy is a master of both, and of the human drama."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"A question that often appears in agony aunt columns relates to the age old dilemma of telling, or not telling, your spouse about an affair with another. Hardy comes down firmly on the side of keeping it quiet. Tess, with excellent intentions, but misguidedly, spills the beans and comes to a sticky end. As her mother says, she is a 'little fool', though a very disingenuous one, to be sure. But there is much more to this book than that.I first read this book about 40 years ago and have revisited it a few times. It is an immensely powerful, brilliantly written, witty, devastating critique of Victorian morality, religion, and sexual hypocrisy that even today is immensely moving.If Hardy has a weakness, it is in the plotting of his novels, and you have to admit that perhaps there are one too many coincidences, but this is a small quibble.This is one of the greatest of all novels. To me it is right up there with Anna Karenina, so I have to give it five stars."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I went into \\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" with full knowledge of the harsh fate waiting for Tess, but that knowledge still could not prepare me for how harrowing and painful that journey was for her, and the reader. The character of Tess is so moral, innocent, kind, and unselfish against the society that is anything but, that Hardy's message of fate and social hypocrisy reveals itself full force in the novel. Tess has a love for life and an optimism that takes the harshest and cruelest society to beat down, and that is heartbreaking to behold.I thought this was going to be a stuffy English novel, despite the fact I quite enjoy (most) Victorian novels I read. However, I discovered that Hardy's prose flows well and is even beautifully poetic. Some of the best lines come from Tess's mouth, showing that she is not only morally upright, but also smart and incredibly perceptive.Hardy has a great way with words; romantic scenes are intensely passionate, emotional letters drip with feeling, and narrations delve into the feelings and thoughts of the characters so that the reader can understand, pity, empathize and sympathize with them. Most surprising perhaps is Hardy's understanding of the female mind; I think he has developed Tess into a believable and realistic heroine, and he has many interesting things to say about the differences of the genders, especially during that time period.\\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" is a gorgeous yet heart-breaking novel. Not only does it entertain with its poetic prose and social themes, the novel also opens one's mind to the hypocrisy of the times; hypocrisies that even now may still appear in the thoughts and actions of people in this \\"modern\\" society."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Like other novels by Thomas Hardy, this is a beautiful and densely written work; I have read several of his other novels, but it is the character of Tess that sticks most in my mind. This is a tragic story, make no mistake, and as such it left a deep impression upon me. Numerous scenes and details linger in my memory, due to Hardy's rich prose style - the terrible death of the Durbeyfield horse; the texture of Tess's cheek, unwillingly yielded for Alec to kiss (as \\"damp and smoothly chill as the skin on the mushrooms in the fields around\\"); Tess's humane execution of mutilated pheasants, preyed upon by careless hunters. I could go on...but then half of the pleasure of reading is a sense of discovery, so I shall end there.Hardy's usual pastoral idyll is present here (in the form of Talbothays and eloquent descriptions of the bounties of spring), but this is thrown into powerful contrast by the increasingly bleak events that overtake the hopeless Tess as she progresses.I recommend it for any reader willing to try 19th century novels, and particularly fans of Eliot - Hardy was of a proto-feminist persuasion, like Eliot, but I think he writes with even more emotional power. It is interesting to observe that modern male writers seem relatively unconcerned with creating such singularly memorable female characters, although Hardy was admittedly an oddity of his era.If you have struggled to get beyond the first few chapters - as I initially did - I found that a total-immersion policy helped; the intensity of the denoument means that this is a book best read over a short time. I grew so attached to the characters and settings of the novel that I felt lost when I finished reading it.If you have read this and relished Hardy's fatalistic approach as much as I did, then Jude the Obscure is definately worth reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"if i'm being truly honest most 'classics' leave me cold.

Tess was a page turner , populist in the best way and strangely, considering cinema hadn't been invented yet , rather cinematic in it's description and creation of scenes . Even the passages that described the countryside add to the overall feel and mood of the book, rather than just describe for describing sake . As for the reviewers who accuses Hardy of being verbose, I can only say that for the time he's positvely Hemingwayesque.Yes, the book is a little melodramtic and if it wasn't for all the tragedy and downbeat ending you could see it being made into a mini series on tv but frankly.... what's wrong with that ? It's precisely this approachability that lets Hardy get you thnking about issues like women's rights , men and women's relation to each other and predeterminism.Finally to those that say Angel and Alec's behaviour is inconsistent .I can not agree. Alec is exactly the kind of person who rushes from one passionate extreme to another and Angel is exactly the kind of idealist who has trouble excepting the realities of life and the failings of the average person.Finally a word on Tess herself .She is one of the sexiest characters i've ever seen written in victorian fiction .It interests me that a man should write such a character and then have her killed as if such beauty (both internally and externally) can't be allowed to exist on the earth becuase of men like him, me and maybe you...."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Bleak and depressing, as far as the plot is concerned it's sort of like Hardy was experimenting with how many terrible things he could make happen to a trusting, wonderful person, until she's finally crushed under the weight of the world and her society. Really makes you feel awful to read it, honestly, but that's ok because the writing is beautiful and the structure is flawless. There are moments of pure poetry on a Shakespearean level, that make you want to weep for all humanity. The characters, especially Tess, are very believable, and the psychology effecting their decisions is what drives the story, for me. I'm impressed, I'm going to read more Hardy. I've looked around and it seems like most of his books are similar - a great set-up to a disaster, all the while people's hearts being ripped out of their chests and their hopes and dreams crushed one after another by a cruel world and cruel circumstances. He obviously had a pretty tragic and pessimistic view of our human situation, but a view that must have filled him with sympathy. He really goes into his characters' heads and makes you feel their pain through it all, going through the stages of their grief, with really amazing descriptions that feel dead on. Or at least that's what he did in this book.Also, it's pretty amazing that he blatantly pointed out the sexual double standards of his time and their utter hipocrysy. It's so crazy that people in Hardy's day were outraged after the publication of this book by the subtitle, \\"A Pure Woman,\\" because Tess was raped.

I should like this... a good book with a strong heroine.\\" If you want to read an enjoyable story of a girl, read The Witch of Blackbird Pond. Anyways, this is the sort of very sad pathetic story of a girl who falls head over heels in love with a cad. As we girls all know, that has probably happened to each of us.., and who in their right mind wants to be reminded of that? And the very sad pathetic thing is she will do absolutely ANYTHING to get back with him. It is very realistic, its her first love... But if you want to read a story of a girl falling in love with a guy and they live happily ever after-read something else. This is the sort of story that shouldn't be read.

Tess is the quintessential protagonist to pity, sympathize with, and root for. Wronged by at least three men--her father, her cousin, and her husband--she remains pure in every sense by the corporeal. There is an overriding sense of despair that pervades the novel. Yet, what's a Hardy novel without that feeling?With this book, Hardy solidified his place as my favorite author. The author's ability to perfectly describe the English countryside, the charm, yet provinciality of the country folk, and the repressiveness of Victorian morals, makes this book one of his best. His subtlety often makes the reader question what it is that he just read, and leaves many things open to interpretation. Thus, as with many good texts, rereading it might lead to different understandings of different scenes that took place.All in all, there are few books that I have read that have made me want to give up sleep just to read them. I adored Tess, and I adore this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I am collecting the Penguin cloth covered books.

Now on my kindle fire and will go with me everywhere."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" tells of the titular heroine; a simple rural girl who, because of her beauty and gentle, trusting nature, is used and abused by those around her. The story begins when her impoverished family is informed that they are descended from a local wealthy clan. Her family sets about trying to better their situation by having Tess approach their distant relatives; unfortunately, this decision results in Tess meeting the devious Alec d'Uberville, who agrees to help Tess, with the intent of seducing her. Despite being the victim, Tess is the one who will pay over and over again.Hardy has created a genuine masterpiece. The characters are complex - even the seemingly simple Tess. The incredibly sad story is used to explore human nature and the ways in which people treat each other. I found myself highlighting passage after passage of the book and noting the fundamental human truths Hardy describes. I was particularly struck by a passage in which, after her seduction, Tess ponders, \\"The past was past; whatever it had been, it was no more at hand. Whatever its consequences, time would close over them.\\" She further muses, \\"To all mankind besides, [she] was only a passing thought. Even to friends she was no more than a frequently passing thought.\\" How true, but unfortunately, Tess' past would never stop haunting her.When Tess meets the aptly names Angel Clare, she thinks that she has finally put the past behind her. Angel accepts her unquestioningly. Once again, though, fate intervenes and Tess is made to suffer for her past misdeeds, which are not really even misdeeds. At times, her victimhood is a bit much, and Tess appears weak, but her treatment is reflective of the sexual mores of the time, and Tess's willingness to endure mistreatment to protect her family and others is noble. The plot marches toward tragedy, with Tess managing to miss every opportunity for happiness. A truly devastating book.Note: This review is for the Kindle Duke Classics version. The text has fairly few noticeable errors aside from a few scattered misspellings. Occasionally, a paragraph has not been indented properly. However, these problems are minor and do not impinge much on the reader. The only major issue is that the Table of Contents is not linked, which is a hassle with such a long book. It is also decidedly no-frills -- no introduction, no appendix, bland cover."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I purchased the movie and wanted to read the book also.

Hardy's classical allusions alone make the book worthwhile, even though I already know it's a train wreck in the making and dread every page turn because I know Tess is going to take it in the chops, over and over.But why do I know we've got a train wreck on our hands? Because of the bleeping Introduction, which gives everything away! Please! Post a spoiler alert, for the love of all things literary!What I really wanted to share, however, is that this is a lovely book, just as far as the book itself goes. I read a lot of books on my Kindle and am very happy with it, but there is something so very seductive and special about this hardover edition with the pretty sheaves of wheat (red, of course...that crops up a lot in this story!) and I love the little red satin bookmark that is included.

The rigid 1800s society and the wickedness of Alec were what really killed Tess by increments, but through it all she was a noblewoman in the truest sense. Thomas Hardy creates a strong female character that is sure to continue to stand the test of time with flying colors."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Truly an excellently written book. From the very beginning, Tess comes alive. Her parents are witless drunks with two many children, and Tess must care for them. When news comes to her idiot of a father that once the Durbeyfields were the D'Ubervilles, a family with a famous past, money and land, her life takes some terrible turns.One of the best things about this book is that it is not happy-go-lucky. When terrible things happen to her, Tess has no where to go. If you want to see what life for women was like, you can easily find out through Tess.The end is very unexpected, and absolutely perfect, and very satisfying as well. I didn't need to know what happened next, I wasn't dying to read a sequel, I was content.For you people who love happy books, that have happy endings, middles, everything- read something by Jane Austen. If you are into reality, check this book out."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This is possibly the saddest novel I have ever read. I have been thinking about it ever since I finished it. Few novels have evoked so much emotion in me. Tess makes me feel sad, frustrated, and angry.Tess of the Durbervilles is the story of Tess Durbeyfield, the daughter of poor, alcoholic parents who learn that they are of a noble bloodline and send Tess off to work for her noble \\"cousin\\" Alec Durberville. While there, Alec rapes Tess and she has his illegitimate baby. This event ruins Tess's life. She is no longer pure, and virginal, and therefore brings shame upon her true love Angel Clare when her past is revealed.It is hard to believe, in this day and age, that Tess is shamed and ostracized because she was the victim of a horrible crime. Hardy's novel is a powerful statement on the questionable morality of Victorian society. Tess, who is a heroic, brave, caring, selfless woman, is not worthy of Angel because she is somehow impure due to the rape. Angel, who has lived with a woman out of wedlock and is clearly not a virgin himself, feels justified in punishing Tess when he learns of her past.The writing is beautiful, but the story tragic. It will stay with you a long time."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I love all of Hardy's books but this is my favorite thus far. The ending is definately not what I expected and I could not stop thinking about it for days afterward. It is a break from his earlier works in that things do not really turn out for the better in the end. In typical Hardy style, people and events in the main characters past come back to bite her in the behind at the worst moments. This story is like a powder keg which is gradually packed over time until the fuze is lit and everything explodes into a million pieces."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I think Thomas Hardy is an interesting mixture of romantic poet and social realist novelist although his dramas take place in primarily rural settings. The poetic strain in Hardy's temperament makes him romanticize some of the same things the romantic poets did. For instance few settings in his work are more powerfully evocative than a ruin. And his sense that we are at the mercy of both nature and our own emotions makes reading a Hardy novel a bit like reading romantic poetry. So if you like romantic poetry especially the bleaker of those poems you will like Hardy's novels. Tess was made into a great film by Roman Polanski in 1979(and another more recent film version appeared on A&amp;E) and it is hard for a Victorian novel to compete with that kind of entertainment but what the novel has that the movie versions do not is Hardy's descriptions of landscape. You may remember a scene from the (Polanski)movie when Tess is walking through a field and as beautiful as that scene was visually it is even more beautiful to read Hardy describe it poetically linking Tess to nature in a very sensuous prose passage. Hardy is not known for his optimism ( most romantics aren't after all so very optimistic) and both his prose and poetry seem to seek out the starkest surrondings and settings to offset and emphasize the fleeting nature of those rare moments of beauty. If you like spending time in the country this novel is a kind of hike back in time and into the countryside where men and women live out their days affected by forces they cannot altogether explain and that conspire in ways that do not lead down the rosiest of paths. Most of the men in this novel are weak, but Tess's strength which is perhaps linked to her heritage makes this an unusual and powerful story. She is perhaps the best bit of poetry Hardy ever came up with. She is certainly the strongest thing ever to appear in a Hardy landscape."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I will admit that I read this for an advanced high school English class last year, making me one of those notorious 'immature high school reviewers.' However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Much else has been said.

Such a tale!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess was a very boring book. From an analytical point, the book's major theme was FATE. However, you must be interested in the victorian era, in order to enjoy the book. It is the same thing with the Scarlet Letter, to enjoy the book you must know about the time era. The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This book, while perhaps well written, is just so ridiculous and self-contradictory that it's maddening to read. While it's necessary to forgive him some annoying parts of his style as being a part of his age, one cannot overlook the horrible plot and characterization.Not one of the characters in the entire book is coherent or believable. He begins with a stereotype--the innocent country lass (Tess), the skeptical intellectual (Angel), the depraved rich dandy (Alec)--describing mainly their appearance and superficial thoughts, so that they never rise above the stereotype. Then, if they stereotype doesn't suit the plot, he'll simply have them act in complete contradiction of their previous shoddy characterization, without any explanation of how they might have changed. Angel's rejection of Tess, for example--he, the skeptical nonconformist who questions conventional social mores, suddenly repudiates Tess for being the victim of a rape, despite his own questionable conduct. I might expect that behavior from a conceited hypocrite, but not the all-around good guy that Hardy has made Angel out to be. And it's not like we've made a discovery here about Angel's real nature, because Hardy goes right on describing him the way he had before. Of course, he takes her back, which is perhaps believable, except that he has not a moment of hesitation when he finds out she murdered Alec. So when your wife tells you she was raped, you leave her, but when she kills someone, you help her to escape without even a second thought?Then there's Tess. She seems like a pretty resourceful and sensible girl right up to the point where Angel leaves her for a stupid reason and she spends the next five years or whatever pining for him. She writes him one scolding letter, and then regrets it. And even though she can't muster the courage to approach Angel's father, or tell Angel off, or rebuff the advance of Alec--although Hardy describes her as having \\"natural fearlessness\\" at one point--she can somehow stab Alec later.Alec, of course, is the one who first becomes a preacher because someone talks to him on the road, and then gives it up because Tess is just too darn beautiful. You'd think some more convincing would be needed for either conversion, but nope, Hardy can't spare any time for actual character development when he could describe Talbothays again.Finally, I can take an example from a minor character. At one point in the book Hardy describes Izz Huett, a milkmaid, as \\"by nature the sauciest and most caustic\\" of the milkmaids; a mere 20 pages later he describes her as \\"a girl of tact.\\" Did he read what he wrote before sending it to the publisher?Aside from the contradictions in every one of his major characters (and a lot of the minor ones too), there are also points in the book that are just plain ridiculous. I mean, Stonehenge? Come on. How cheesy can you get? Not to mention the fact that he sent sixteen cops after them so they could be surrounded in the morning. It's as if he put stuff into his book because he thought it would be cool. Same deal with Angel going to BRAZIL. Also, apparently Angel can pick berries with his whip. Hardy also tends to get carried away with his own writing. He once mentions the plains of Brazil (if by \\"plains\\" he meant \\"rain forest\\") and describes a cow's \\"large-veined udders.\\"Lastly, the book oozes prejudices about country folk and women--mostly to the effect that they're naive and ignorant. In fact, Hardy seems to share the prejudices of Angel Clare. In any case, this book is a lot of reading in return for all the reward of a trashy romance novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I'm a French student of English, in my third year at university. I have to read \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" for my British literature class and it's just terrible. The author spends so much time describing Tess' beauty, virtue, kindness and courage, that I wonder why her name is not Mary Sue. There is no character development : instead, we are told a hundred times that Tess' eye colour is somewhere between blue, violet, grey and black -- seriously, can you picture that ?Furthermore, the heroine's so-called \\"kindness\\" is nothing but stupid weakness in my opinion. Her love interest, Angel Clare -- who, for some obscure reason, is also loved by most of her dairymaid friends --, blames and rejects her for being raped, and yet she still worships him and behaves like his obedient slave, despite his cruelty to her. This is merely a ridiculous and unhealthy obsession, not a true love story.To my mind, the only likeable character is Alec D'Urberville. Although he is supposed to be the \\"villain\\", I find him rather funny and much less annoying than Tess and Angel. Too bad that Thomas Hardy did not choose Alec as the main character. The novel would have been more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"When i started reading the novel,i did't feel like droping it.I felt so touched that the herione of the novel could still carry on with life,and reconcile with Angel who is hypocritic about the religion he criticizes and yet practices when discovering the past of Tess who forgave him of his sin which could not be weighed with hers,but failed to do likewise."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"tom hrdy was a \\"wimp\\".

No more than anyone else, perhaps, but a decent few that i could get my hands on.I've never read Hardy, and though his style was different, it was not hard to follow. The flaws in his characters are realistic enough, but it is those flaws that made me dislike the book. Tess is a simpering simpleton who should be smarter than she is. Angel is a Devil, who is the most hypocritical, bigoted, delusional idiot that walked in the book. The evil man, Alec D'Urberville, was terrible, but his evils could be comparable to Angel's. And in the middle is the lost child Tess, who can't be counted on to have a milliliter of sense or perception concering people throughout the entire book. She worships Angel, and blames herself for her rape, because Angel blames her despite his insisting that he doesn't.The plot could have been better, the characters could have been likable, and for God's sake it could have been less repetitive.

It is so beautifully written that even through the frustrations and hardships the heroine faces, you are drawn on by the power of the language and the force of the story. Hardy was trying to make an important point in the writing of this story, and while such a tale seems unimaginable in today's world, it nevertheless resonates, particularly with women. Shocking in it's day, Hardy's efforts were felt. Tess is a provocative look at the plight of the 19th century woman, unnaturally naive to a world run by world-wise men. I'm not sure I've ever recovered from this book, and it has been a powerful influence in my own work.But yes, it's always wise to read the forward and preface LAST in any book, particularly literature."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"A MUST READ!

And I love that the story is complete... almost a series of stories following Tess, flowing from one stage of her life to the next. I can't go too in depth with this review without giving away important details I think you'll enjoy discovering along the way.

The language was full of beautiful imagery and the characters were unforgettable. Hardy's use of birds and colors as symbolism provide a vivid picture of the novel. Tess's story is compelling, tragic, and beautiful. Despite the difficult language, once one begins to catch the flow of the novel, it is almost impossible to put the book down.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is the tragedy about a young maiden who is seduced/raped by an incorrigible Alec Stoke-d'Urberville. Her life from there only becomes worse. She falls in love with Angel Clare, who does not know her secret, so their relationship is doomed from the start. Circumstances and human nature drives the innocent Tess to unspeakable bounds, finally leading up to a murder and an execution. Like a bird, Tess has unknowingly flown too high and tragically falls from grace. She is the 19th century version of Eve. Hardy's subtle yet profound allusions to the Bible, more specifically Genesis, cannot be mistaken.This novel is one that should, or must, be read by all.

From my point of view, the majority of people who wrote a review where FORCED to read the book in school, and people don't like to be ordered around. I picked this book out myself at a bookstore and thank myself for doing that, it was a last minute decision to buy this book. What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness. Usually a book has a fierce female fighting the mean, crude, bad man.

In other words, there is absolutely no way you could relate to this book, and anyways...why would you want to relate to books?

Couldn't put the book down.

My wife will attest to the fact that I have a strange affinity to depressing stories. With that in mind, let me say that I really enjoyed this book.The writing was at times a bit too much for me for the reason that I get annoyed at many 18th and 19th century novels...namely, that Hardy focuses far too much on minute descriptions and in-depth analysis of setting and location. Don't get me wrong, I love a vivid and lush environment and I much prefer a fleshed out character to a flat one. I just sometimes feel that all of the flowery descriptions slow down the story telling element too much. There were a few paragraphs/pages that I tried to skim through in order to get to the next relevant points of plot. Still, I don't know that I'd want to edit out the descriptive text since it does comment on the narrative itself in a metafictional sort of way.The main characters in this book are wonderfully composed. They are absolutely and completely frustrating but they are superbly crafted nonetheless. I wanted to smack each of the main characters on many occasions.Tess is far too willing to simply be acted upon and then to bemoan her fate. Alec is an absolute pig (although towards the end of our experience with him, it's debatable just how awful he truly is). And Angel is far too inconsistent to be liked at all...at first he seems almost lovable...then he deserves to be hated...then he seems slightly adequate...then he becomes repulsive again...he's just far too wishy-washy in his behavior and ideals to ever be fully redeemable.The story itself falls into the realm of realism taken to its extreme. The plot elements felt almost like the Bible story of Job...whatever could go wrong willgo wrong. And even though Tess was generally found to be almost whining about her circumstances rather than trying to make things better for herself, the story was still rather thought provoking since it makes you wonder just how you would handle horrific circumstances and what can truly be done about them. Is it better to try and solve the problem or better to just let fate and happenstance take its toll.Personally, I try to make the best out of any bad situation...perhaps that's why I like \\"depressing\\" stories...they make me realize my life could be worse and they help inspire me to always think of the best possible outcome.I'm sure this book won't be for everyone. Those who want a happy fairy-tale romp through a girl's life would do better to stay away. Those who are easily frustrated by fallen characters, will find themselves hating all of the primary roles in this book. The book isn't terribly lengthy (~300-400?) but some of the longer descriptive passages do crawl by at times.Still, I whole-heartedly recommend this book to those who are willing to look imperfection and awful situations square in the face and come away smiling. It's not a happy book. It's not a terribly fast past book (which can also be frustrating...I wanted to shout Just do it to Tess many times).But it is a wonderfully rich book and definitely worth getting into.*****4.5 stars (out of 5)"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Any woman who has been pursued by the likes of an Alex D'Urberville will appreciate with a shudder his sinister characterization. Hardy's pastoral description is beautiful as is his handling of diary life especially if one is familiar with such rural settings and labors.However, as Tess's persistently over-sensitive conscience regarding her past rumbles on and on and on, I began to wish she would find the river and put herself in it. But there are philosophical gems here and there such as \\"By experience...we find out a short way by a long wandering\\" that make the reading worthwhile."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Thomas Hardy is a definite for anyone serious about literature. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is not to be passed up, it's a treat. I didn't find it at all over descriptive nor boring."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Having read Tess several times years ago and then revisiting it now, I am reminded how frustrating a book it can be: frustrating that Hardy's 19th century England could be so cruel; frustrating that Tess (and others) blamed herself for being ruthlessly violated at 16; and frustrated at Angel's initial behavior after he learns of Tess' tragic and blameless past. It's just too incomprehensible for someone living in the 21st century to relate to--and you wonder about Angel's incompatible behavior--for someone of his supposed character. As much as I love the pastoral beauty of Hardy's described vales and heaths, I loathe the society under which the characters lives are always ruined. The whole books starts to seem silly and tedious when viewed from such a perspective."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Although written well over a century ago, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a surprisingly modern novel with unmatched poetic beauty. The author, Thomas Hardy, jabs at the age-old issues of sexism, social class, and morality in this seemingly simple tragic romance. The heroine is the titular Tess, an elegant but unassuming countryside beauty from a poor farming family. Her misery begins when the family discovers that they are not the shabby Durbeyfields after all, but rather the descendants of the illustrious and ancient D'Urbervilles. But Tess' doom goes hand in hand with her heritage. Introduced to her newfound rich relations, she is forced to become the mistress of her cousin Alec D'Urberville. Naturally she is blamed for her \\"defilement\\" and resulting pregnancy. Tess of the D'Urbervilles cynically examines the high-strung, sexist Victorian society and the hypocritical Anglican Church, while simultaneously providing a window into the human soul. Hardy captivates the reader with his luminous heroine, a saintly creature forced to commit terrible deeds against her will. He questions the very nature of morality, asserting that neither society nor the church has the authority to judge virtue. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a masterpiece of literature--tragic and romantic, poetic and critical--a wondrously perceptive literary work. The reader is captivated from start to finish, from the opening imagery of the lovely English countryside to the fateful, deeply symbolic conclusion set amid the cragged rocks of the Stonehenge."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Deep. Tragic. Memorable.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a wonderful read and highly recommended. I had high expectations of this book and they were all surpassed after reading it. It is very moving and the story stays with you long after you've read it. It is also full of memorable scenes such as the one wherein Angel sleep walks with Tess in his arms.Read it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles must be one of the most moving and beautifully written novels ever created. Hardy's writing doesn't just move the plot from one point to the next, it undulates and flows from season to season with Tess as her life flows from one point to the next. As has been pointed out in other reviews, it does have a good amount of pagan imagery and associations. Tess is dancing on May day (the first of May) when Angel and she first cross paths, Angel often calls her by the names of pagan godesses when he is wooing her at the dairy and she agrees to work for Farmer Groby until \\"Old Lady's Day.\\" The imagery that Hardy interweaves in the novel is even more pagan. Tess is virginal and innocent and hopeful, like a nymph or thing of nature. And even when she's no longer a virgin (a rather important event in the novel) she's still innocent and hopeful. Truly, she does not lose her hope until the very end and then she is allowed to regain it, if only momentarily. The hardest thing about reading this novel is that it is tragic, for Tess anyway, the whole way through. But that's the way Hardy meant it. And in the end it breaks your heart. But not in a melodramatic way, drawn out, Hollywood ending/Braveheart kind of way. More like the slice of the guillotine: quick, clean, but certainly not painless. It's definitely worth the time and effort to read this masterpiece of a novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Angel's perceptual turnabout comes a day late and a dollar short. In Hardy's Victorian world, the victim was the co-perpetrator. He had to justify to his audience that despite her technical loss of virginity, Tess was pure in essence. She was a victim of bad luck, particularly that of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. I loved when Irving Howe remarked that \\"Tess is...goodness made interesting.\\" Unfortunately, Tess never got to appreciate or even recognize her goodness. She was so full of (unmerited) shame and a sense of inferiority. Angel's liberalism and code of ethics gave way to censure, and he reinforced Tess's self-doubts. He could overlook her being a milkmaid from the fallen D'Urbeville lineage, but not a victim of rape. That even a man like Angel would be influenced by the Victorian attitude (and not recognize the timeless double standard) is Hardy's sharp social critique."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Several years ago when I was in high school we had to read The Mayor of Casterbridge (also by Hardy). I did NOT enjoy it under the circumstances, but decided to give Tess a try a few years later. I must say, it has certainly become one of my favorite all time books. Hardy really lets the reader see and feel what is happening in the lives of the characters. I must admit that I even shed a few tears at the end (something I rarely do while reading). This book is a must read for anyone who likes literature at all!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles,&quot; by Thomas Hardy, is a book about a young woman who struggles to find her place in society. When it is discovered that the low-class Durbeyfield family is in reality the d'Urbervilles, the last of a famous blood line that dates back hundreds of years, the mother sends her eldest daughter, Tess, to beg money from relations with the obvious desire that Tess wed the rich Mr. d'Urberville. Thus begins a tale of woe in which a wealthy man cruely mistreats a poor girl. Tess is taken advantage of by Mr. d'Urberville and leaves his house, returning home to have their child, who subsequently dies. Throughout the rest of this fascinating novel, Tess is tormented by guilt at the thought of her impurity and vows to never marry. She is tested when she meets Angel, the clever son of a priest, and falls in love with him. After days of pleading, Tess gives in to Angel and consents to marry him. Angel deserts Tess when he finds the innocent country girl he fell in love with is not so pure. This touching story depicts how difficult it was being a woman in the 1800s.There are many reasons to recommend &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles.&quot; It is a story one can easily relate to. If anyone has ever suffered prejudice, then he/she will want to read this book. The book is also thought-provoking. &quot;Tess&quot; is also interesting in that the author gives the point of view of all the characters in it, not simply that of Tess. This means that the reader gets a better understanding of the plot. Thomas Hardy writes in an eloquent and descriptive manner.&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; does have perceived flaws. It has been described as rather verbose, but one finds that this is not the case, and that the details only add to the book. The plot is tragic, which might make it depressing to read. However, one finds that it is tragic in a beautiful and compelling sense, not in a sad sense. &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; is a book that will touch your heart."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"By today's standards certain passages of this book may seem rather vague and subtle, but they were shocking when first written--enough that the book was subject to heavy censorship--vital passages from it were removed. And that is really what makes this book so grand. Its take on the double standards of the society in which fictional Tess lived may seem very distant from today's post-60's equality society, but it was very real then.The book follows Tess' journey through the English countryside, but what makes it so fascinating is the constant flow of her thought patterns as she tries to rationalize the hand she has been dealt. The modern reader may be befuddled, as her thoughts are representative of another culture and another time, but what is fascinating is the little insights on human nature that shine through. The joy she feels tempered by the despair in her past. The ignorant self-righteousness of overzealous youth. The mistakes that even very good, well-meaning people can make, without realizing it, that hurt others deeply. We hope for her as she lives through the initial tragedy, the slow recovery, the surge of joy she experiences, we are disgusted at the hypocritical betrayal that eventually leads to her final breakdown.The prose itself too has a personality, often taking time to smell the roses and indulge in the lush scenery, fascinating historical anecdotes and social interactions that Tess deals with on a daily basis. For those who over-glamorize the past, here is a very honest look at the physical and mental hardships people faced in it. Hardy quotes Ascham: 'We find a short way, by a long wandering.'"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I had to write a review just to bring up a rating that was unfairly knocked down by a handful of obtuse reviewers. I wasn't an English lit major like some of these reviewers, but I have read upwards of 10,000 books in my life -with a concentration on literature- and have to say that the descriptive writing in \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" is the most beautiful and poetic I have yet encountered. It is not the most exciting, nor the most stunningly transformative(that honour goes to \\"Altas Shrugged\\") book, but the construction and execution is exquisite.The book is in fact slowly paced - so much so in the first couple of chapters that I was rebuffed the first time I started reading it. However, a little patience will grant you entry into the gorgeous spell Hardy invokes. Yes, it is a \\"victorian\\" novel, but the sublimity of the writing and of the plot's tragedy emancipates it from the staidness of the genre.The upshot is that you shouldn't turn to this book if you want a fast paced thriller or \\"clever\\" writing.

All through the story I kept hoping that at some point she would find happiness or at least peace with herself. instead her situation kept getting more and more complacted and depressing.

Many people lament the fact that Tess is somewhat of a weak woman, not a strong woman, defying Victorian convention and fighting for the rights of women. I'm not entirely sure why Tess's tragic and weak personality has people so up in arms enough to say that the book is terrible and unrealistic.Personally, I found this to be one of the greatest books I have ever read. I didn't find the text to be as easy to read as some of the other reviewers, and I was an English Lit major in college! It is difficult to get through in parts, you will yawn every so often, but fight through it-- use your brain and you won't regret it!The story is tragic and offers very little in the way of an explanation for Tess's extreme punishment. So if you are looking for a book about a woman who fights convention and social injustice, go read something else. If you want a story that illustrates the cruelty of fate, comments on the injustices of the world, or a shows how, if one doesn't fight, one can be trapped by the past... read this book.I certainly recommend it."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This was the first Thomas Hardy novel I read, and it is still one of my favorites. The hypocritical late 19th century society views, and the strains they put on the human spirit. Hardy had a keen eye for what went on around him, and he was aware of how the old ways were being replaced - Edwardian enlightment was on it's way but Tess is the symbol of land of Wessex itself, violated, forsaken, and like the wounded birds she finds, longing to be put out of her suffering, despite how she endures until her situation becomes even more unbearable. Christian versus pagan, rural versus urban, her true love's struggle from his family's religious views and the restrictions of society's rules, end up costing Hardy's herione more than himself. Young Tess Durbeyfield, daughter of a poor farmer, finds herself at the mercy of a ne'er do well scoudrel, Alec d'Urberville, thought to be a wealthy relative. The girls' parents, in their naivete and ignorance, put their eldest child on a disasterous path in an attempt to improve their situation and trade on the ancient and noble family name. Tess's situation makes her an outcast, after giving birth to the cad's baby son who dies not long after birth, but she never asks for pity, and finds work at a dairy farm, only to fall in love with a provinicial minister's son, Angel Clare, who cannot forgive her past. Tragedy ensues at nearly every turn.***some spoilers herein***I think both men were unforgivable, both were terrible to Tess in different ways. Granted, Angel was nowhere near the controlling cad that Alec was, and yes Tess loved Angel. Alec thought his wealth could buy Tess's affection and possession was love. For Angel, since Tess didn't fit his idealized version of her, and that she wasn't a virgin (never mind the fact that she was raped), he couldn't bear that and took to the hills like a coward. His hypocrisy is maddening, especially since he considered himself to be such a free thinker and more open-minded than his pious family. He did see the error of his ways, returned her and they had a few days together before she was executed, but too little, too late. Tess is the most extreme victim in the novel, with Alec next, being the cause of her hardship and downfall, and for being the villain. And yes, I did say that Alec is a victim, a murder victim, but not an innocent victim. He had no qualms about manipulating situations, taking Tess against her will and using her father's death, her family's destituion, her husband's desertion and her hardships to possess her. In a time when women had virtually no rights and the fact that he had taken her virginity and fathered a child with her gave him a totally wrong sense of ownership and his determination to get her any way that he could is what lead to his fate. Both characters are doomed, while Angel must live with the fact that his actions toward the woman that he loved led to this tragedy. Not that Alec had no part in it, if he hadn't violated Tess and impregnanted her, no doubt there would have been a different outcome to her life and to his. But of course, there would have been no story, and no commentary on the standards of the time in the novel if those events had not taken place.There can be no happy ending, as this is a Hardy tale. But it makes its mark, and was immensely popular at the time of its publishing, despite the brutal critical response it received. The aching misunderstanding of longing love, the loss of innocence and a herione victimized by the standards of her era.A timeless masterpiece of literature. Tess lives beyond the pages of the book, as though Hardy knew a girl who embodied his most famous character. Worth adding to your library."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Published in 1891, this book was Thomas Hardy's best seller, and has become a literary classic. This was why I chose to read it, and I must say that I really liked it.When the middle-class Durbeyfield family learns that they are genealogically related to the noble family of d'Urbervilles, they send their beautiful daughter Tess to meet them and possibly receive a fortune from them. Tess discovers the d'Urberville family is actually of no relation to the real d'Urbervilles, and simply bought their prestigious name while they made their fortune. Tess stays and works at the d'Urberville household, and gets to know Alec, their son, who, er, treats her quite badly. I won't give away any details, but Tess has to deal with the results of Alec's treatment, and tries her best, though unsuccessfully, to move on.Though I don't usually go for many of these sappy character dramas, I really like how Hardy brought forth this novel. One develops immediate sympathy for Tess and her plight, yet she can at times be a very strong woman. The character development here is fantastic. I also liked the way Hardy juxtaposes the issue of social class (I think there must have been a law in England that every book in the nineteenth century had to confront social class in some way). Hardy also brings in symbols regarding Christian sin as well as paganism in this novel.I can see why some people would criticize this book as being slow or dull, but those readers would also probably say the same about any piece of 19th century British literature. I didn't find it especially slow, however. If you like books like Pride and Prejudice, Middlemarch, and Wuthering Heights, you'll love Tess of the d'Urbervilles."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I love the story of Tess. Considering many of the classics I have ever read, I think Tess is one of the easier ones to understand. The work itself is a masterful story. However, I take issue with Penguin's version. The Notes are just awful- referencing back and forth from your place in the book to the back is a nightmare and many times isn't worth breaking your flow. Some of the Notes are helpful and even necessary to understand the sentence, but others are pointless and annoying. I recommend a different version, either without notes entirely or with more reasonable ones."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I think part of the reason I kept so interested is because I had heard some horror stories about not being able to get through the book. So, in turn, I dilligently read and looked for the hard parts. I really didn't find anything. It kept my attention. I loved seeing the journey that Tess was on. I watched her character change drastically from beginning to end. It was fun to see that change. I will read more Thomas Hardy because of this experience."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"In today's permissive day and age, it may seem far-fetched that 'Tess' was received as a bit risque by the British readership of the time. To readers a century later, the tragic story of Tess is very moving, and the nobel heroine evokes extreme sympathy from us.The novel also artfuly portrays the dynamics of life in 19th century England. We are presented with a crude, colloquial variety of the English language then spoken, in stark contrast to the stuffy, self-satisfied brand of sophisticated English that modern authors and film-makers would have us believe is all- pevasive amongst the English, in contrast to the bland, pedestrian English spoken by their brethren overseas.Hardy artfully portrays the dynamics of rural life on an English dairy farm; life that, despite the industrial revolution, is here probably not so different as it was centuries earlier.His characters are beautifully portrayed, with signicant depth. &quot;Tess&quot;, like the &quot;Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;, depicts the thoughts, hopes and dreams of those consigned to a rual existence; those who are peripherally aware that the industrial revolution and the opportunities presented thereby, are radically altering life only a hundred kilometers away.Both 'Tess' and the 'Mayor' are brilliant tragedies. The astute reader knows that tragic events will ultimately prevail, but the dynamics, twists and turns of the plot in 'Tess', make it more of a compelling page turner: an excellent piece of 19-th century British lit. (If I had been forced to read it in high school, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it immeasurably less, so I commisserate with those students who were undderwhelmed by the book- read it again ten years later!).A brilliant story of an admirable, virtuous girl, who can only withstand the castigation visited upon her for the sins of others, for so long. A classic, tragic, heroine."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"There are people who will start reading this book then about 100 pages into it realize that it's going nowhere fast.

It is an extremely moving and powerful work. I don't care what Aristotle says- it is tragic. Tess is one of the most real heroines I've ever met. If you find yourself a little bored in the beginning- don't give up. I almost did, but I am so glad that I forced myself to read on. By the third phase I was hooked.

Hardy's style is not to everyone's taste; some argue that it is laboured and far too flowery, and this may be true in some cases, but the moral message and the profound nature of this novel far outweigh the archaic style of writing that Hardy chooses to adopt.The novel, as the title suggests, focuses on one woman in Victorian England. Her foolish and drunken father finds that he is the descendant of the ancient and landed family of the d'Urbervilles, and Tess is sent by her parents to meet one of her descendants in order to get some help from the family's financial difficulties. Alec d'Urbervilles then seduces Tess, and she is left, with illegitimate child, to deal with the consequences.After her child dies, she finds work on a farm and falls in love with Angel Clare. She feels that she cannot marry him because of her past, and, after his insistence, gives into her heart and marries him, although consumed by guilt. Eventually she confesses her past, and Angel leaves her, travelling to Brazil without her.This is not, as one reviewer described it, \\"like a bad TV movie\\". Hardy's novel is a comment on Victorian society. Tess is the ultimate victim, as many have pointed out, but she is not the victim because she chooses to be, but because society puts her in this position. Those who criticise her for being weak and being unlike any other \\"feisty\\" women in other nineteenth century novels forget that, unlike characters such as Emma Woodhouse and Lizzie Bennet, Tess was poor; and that, unlike Jane Eyre, Tess was raped. Tess is the perfect example of a blameless woman who cannot escape from the confines of society. Arguably the point of the novel is that Tess cannot change how people perceive her, and, because she has no means to support herself, she has to hide the truth and battle on with the terrible injustice that has been done to her. Victorian society would simply have ostracised a woman who had had an illegitimate child and not married the father, no matter the circumstances, so I find it deplorable that people feel that Tess was spineless when she was placed in such an impossible position.Also, any new reader, and, indeed, any old reader who hasn't accepted this point yet, should perhaps try to understand that Tess is suffering, throughout the novel, from terrible grief, guilt and depression, which is surely enough to earn anyone's sympathy, not their scorn. Hardy did not invent a \\"cocker spaniel\\" of a woman; she is a literary construct and is used in a wider sense to illustrate those taken advantage of in Victorian society; and the only reason she comes back \\"for more\\" punishment is because she cannot escape it, no matter how she tries.Additionally, it has been claimed that Hardy's characters are one-dimensional and contradictory. I take issue with this. Alec may be one-dimensional in some senses, but he is an unremittingly unpleasant person; it destroys the comment being making if Alec was an abused child, or in any way a redeemable person. And yes, Alec is turned into a preacher, but anyone who believes that he sincerely let go of his previous persona must not have understood his character properly. It is a perfect way of introducing him again into the story, and a perfect way to illustrate his own falseness, by comparing him with Angel's father, who is the Good Samaritan. It is the contrast between what Tess could have chosen and what she did - in fact, arguably, not meeting Angel's father is the only mistake that SHE makes (opposed to outside forces placing decisions upon her).Angel on the other hand is in no way one-dimensional. Although his opinion of Tess does change rapidly, it is not unbelievable on careful reading. He likes to think of himself as a maverick and someone outside of society's rules, but he is an excellent portrayal of how we all are constructs of our society. Angel, although he loves Tess, keeps referring to the fact that she is \\"pure\\", which she is not (through no fault of her own). This is a clear indication, early on in the novel, that Angel has painted himself a false image of his bride-to-be, and, for all his good qualities, he is as flawed as the next person. I fail to see how this is a shallow portrayal of a character.Tess is also not a nonsensical, weak being, but a beautiful, sad creation of Hardy's used to show injustices, and highlight practises that should be stopped. Besides that, in her own right, she is a clever, melancholy character who really should inspire the reader's pity.I have no objections with people who dislike this novel because they dislike the style or because they dislike some character development for sensible reason; but when people decide to abuse a novel because they don't seem to have bothered to read into it properly, I find it irritating to say the least. This novel requires people to put themselves in the place of another and feel sympathy with another person.One reviewer commented that the novel was ill-received when it came out, and should have stayed that way. The novel was considered offensive because of the implied sexual context and because of its criticisms of Victorian morals, but this does not make it a bad novel; this means that it encourages people to think, to question and to re-evaluate. Any novel that is so brave as to find an injustice in society and write a whole novel criticising it deserves our praise; and Hardy's writing, far from doing the idea down, only helps to elevate the moral: that society can be wrong."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Having just finished this book a mere few hours ago the pain of it is fresh in my mind, but I'm sure it will distract me for weeks, such is the intensity of this tragedy. The only other novel of Hardy's I have ever read - Jude the Obscure - was a good book, stable and interesting, though not compelling until it's heart-wrenching twist three quarters of the way through the book. It was, in essence, more a social commentary, so it was with some surprise that I absorbed the constant emotion and passion that was this book. The basic storyline is as follows: Tess Durbeyfield, a young woman of a poor country family, is sent to visit her rich cousin, Alec d'Urbeville, after learning of her (perhaps mythical) relation to the ancient family which bears his name. In the obscure randomness that fate casts over life, innocent Tess is then pursued by perhaps the only man she could never tolerate (Alec), who is as his most evil in the early parts of the book. At Alec's house Tess works as a keeper to the poultry and is assaulted by Alec's constant sexual attentions until finally (and this is suggested rather than explained), exhausted and numb, she submits to intercourse with him. She later gives birth to a baby, whom she names Sorrow, who soon dies; and then meets a man she had glimpsed once years before at a dance: Angel Clare. Working together at a milking farm, they become drawn to each other despite Tess's unwillingness to incite the attentions of any man. Their love for each other grows but Tess knows that she dare not enter into marriage considering her past and a society that is both ludcrously religious and prejudiced. The strength of her love finally wears her down and they wed. However, on that very night she confesses her past, and is cruelly thrown aside by Clare, who now begins to view her as an impure woman separate to the Tess he had always loved (despite his past containing a similar history). After suffering years of solitutde and hardship, Tess finally gives up on Clare and falls in the way of Alec d'Urbeville again, relying upon him for the care of herself and her family. Sick and wasted, Clare eventually realizes the mistake he has made in casting Tess aside and finds her at d'Urbeville's mansion: too late. This brings the story to its close where greater tragedy ensues.The book was brilliant in its emotive persuasion and its depiction of Tess, who is impossible to not feel for, and, indeed, love. The misfortunes of her life are never self-inflicted, and we are left to wonder at the end at the awful nature of a world that would bring such sorrow upon one person. Tess is wonderful, stoic, and pure in her unyielding love for Clare; d'Urbeville is horrible in his initial portrayal as the villain who will singlehandedly destroy Tess's life, though is perhaps a little less repulsive at the end as one understand's the depths of his feeling for her; and Clare is the one who holds in his hands the ability to restore all past wrongness and find joy himself, but tragically fails to do so because of pride and convention.Overall, there were only two problems I had with the storyline: the first being Tess's succumbing to Alec's sexual persuasion in the beginning - if we are to believe that she is repulsed so many times by Alec's advances so completely and bodily, how are we to believe that she so easily concedes in one (unmentioned) incident? Her strength is greater than that. And the second is one which has been mentioned by another reviewer here: the ending, where a minor, unimportant character is introduced as a means through which to resolve everything, where in fact she is incapable of doing so, since we know nothing about this character, and can therefore put no faith in her.Despite these minor quibbles the whole of the book, with its engaging plot and brilliant prose, is worth more than the sum of its parts, with the pain of lost love being the principle effect one experiences long after the reading is over. Tess is beautiful."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This novel, contrary to some of the other comments, is a wonderful piece of literature. Although not the most uplifting, it is a great example of Hardy and Deterministic and Naturalistic fiction. Despite Tess' best efforts (like Jude in the other Hardy novel), she is unable to escape the poverty and misfourtune which she attempts to leave behind. Although somewhat lengthy, the novel is one of the better pieces of British fiction to come out of the period."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is an intensely depressing but brilliant depiction of the connections between love, fear, and guilt. The vivid clarity with which Hardy draws Tess as a vulnerable innocent struggling, and ultimately failing to come to terms with the merciless world makes this a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES is well worth reading; it is one of Hardy's finest works.In the beginning of the novel, Tess Durbeyfield's irresponsible father is informed by a local minister that is a descendent of a noble family, the D'Urbervilles. Her parents (and especially her father) are greatly heartened by the news that they are, however distantly, nobility. Tess is therefore sent to her richer relations, the d'Urbervilles of Trantridge, to claim kinship and benefit from their superior finances.Upon taking her position as a bird-tender, Alec D'Urberville is captivated by Tess's natural country beauty and seduces her. Tess is an innocent, and she returns home to bear her child. After bringing shame upon her family, Tess must attempt to build a respectable life out of a situation that denies her every particle of respectability she once had.Hardy writes in a rather long-winded, flowery style. His vocabulary is rich, but it can become tediously melodramatic at times. The plot of this novel is full of coincidences that seem rather implausible, but it is a wonderful portrayal of the prejudices of society. Tess is an absolutely heartbreaking character, enduring trial after trial silently, feeling it is her due.TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES is a solid read, but be prepared to be thoroughly depressed and disillusioned with society at its finish."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"A question that often appears in agony aunt columns relates to the age old dilemma of telling, or not telling, your spouse about an affair with another. Hardy comes down firmly on the side of keeping it quiet. Tess, with excellent intentions, but misguidedly, spills the beans and comes to a sticky end. As her mother says, she is a 'little fool', though a very disingenuous one, to be sure. But there is much more to this book than that.I first read this book about 40 years ago and have revisited it a few times. It is an immensely powerful, brilliantly written, witty, devastating critique of Victorian morality, religion, and sexual hypocrisy that even today is immensely moving.If Hardy has a weakness, it is in the plotting of his novels, and you have to admit that perhaps there are one too many coincidences, but this is a small quibble.This is one of the greatest of all novels. To me it is right up there with Anna Karenina, so I have to give it five stars."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"One of my friends recommended that I read Thomas Hardy, but she cautioned me: &quot;Thomas Hardy isn't for everyone.&quot; I discovered while reading &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; that what she may have meant is that Thomas Hardy didn't write light works to be read and then forgotten about. Through this book, Hardy addresses issues that society in his day didn't want to face: the fate of the farm worker in the increasingly industrialized society, predjudices held against minority groups, and the inequality of women. All of this is not to say that this is a dry or boring work -- &quot;Tess&quot; is gripping, riveting, and almost overpowering in its emotional appeal. One cannot read this book without becoming involved in Tess's situation. I have never been so angry with a character in a book as I was with Angel Clare at a certain point in the novel. So, in conclusion, &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; isn't for everyone. . . but it should be for every thinking person, everyone who isn't afraid to face issues, think deeply about them, and apply them to life."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Some great discussions come out of this book. Thomas Hardy has a very distinct style, and uses the environment essentially as another character, so it may be beneficial to at least have some familiarity with England before reading. No one can read this book without having strong opinions about the characters, especially the two main men. This is one of the standout pieces of literature of its time and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" describes the experiences of a woman who, through no fault of her own, falls outside of the moral code of the Victorian era in which she lives and suffers long-reaching consequences as a social outcast. Hardy's novel is carefully well-drawn, but the novel's content demands far more than Hardy could acceptably give it in the nineteenth century. For example, the rape scene is only is carefully stepped around, inferrable only from the fact that Tess subsequently has a child; Hardy also has to carefully frame some of the scenes, such as that of Alec d'Urberville's murder, in order to avoid too closely examining the psyche of the criminal. Hardy's writing is at its best in the scenes surrounding Angel and Tess's estrangement - a safe enough environment - when he can freely move within the minds of his characters. In short, \\"Tess\\" is the stuff of a twentieth-century novel written in the nineteenth, which leaves some of the emotion that modern readers are accustomed to lacking."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Even reviewing Tess makes me choke back tears. Hardy develops one of the most truely beautiful female characters in all of English literature; then, like an evil wizzard, slowly tears her to shreds and finally grounds her into dust.A modern young woman growing up now might find it hard to identify with Tess. She is a poor farm worker and a product of the cultural changes at the beginning of the industrial revolution in England. But there is enough of a study of basic human nature here to make her story valuable to just about any reader.Hardy's prose is gifted, deep descriptive narative and character development. You may end up loving Tess; it's hard not to hate Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This book has it's place--and that place is in an American Literature course at a university.

Tess herself is a dynamic character; but the novel as a whole becomes dreary and calls for skimming."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy's second to last novel, published in book form in 1891, is considered by many (Hardy himself included) to be the finest novel by the great Thomas Hardy (1840-1928).The story centers around Tess Durbeyfield, a wife who is ancestor to an ancient and powerful family. She goes to live with some guy named Alec and falls in love with him or something. I never read it but have studied Thomas Hardy's works and that is all I know about this classic. I also know it has a very sad and tragic ending because I ruined it for myself by reading spoilers on wikipedia so don't ruin it by doing that, read it and reach the tear jerking ending, if you can survive a TOME! HA HA HA HA! (Of course you can \\"survive\\" this one. I was just cracking a joke about the length of this book. Thomas Hardy was one of the greatest writers who ever lived and this book proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt)The story attacks the role of woman in Victorian society and because of that, it wasn't really well received in 1891 but at least it did better than Hardy's final novel Jude the Obscure, published in 1895 (some sources say '96 I'm not sure) Jude the Obscure was hated so badly that it was mockingly renamed \\"Jude the Obscene\\" and Hardy stopped writing novels altogether and focused on poetry.This is essential Victorian age literature and is Hardy's most famous novel. Read it today!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I was a little bit disappointed by Tess, but it is a good outlook of late Victorian Era on the progress of woman.

However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my oldest granddaughter.

I highly recommend this book and am anxious to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This book was well written and I found it very interesting to learn about history and I felt stronger in my faith after reading this."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I really, really liked this book! Was it perfect? No. Was it historically accurate? No. But, here is the key: it is a fictional novel. This is the author's interpretation of what could have happened. The historical inaccuracies are not as important to me as the story. I agree with many of the posts that this was written with a modern, rather than a historical voice. Perhaps the author's intent was to make it accessible for a larger audience. I don't know about you, but I am currently reading the Old Testament. There have been many chapters that had me wanting to gouge my eyes out. Adding a little life is not necessarily a bad thing. The modern voice was not a distraction to me.I'm giving this a 4-star rating because I would have liked the characters to have more depth. A few of them just fell a little flat. More importantly, I wanted to be moved emotionally. There were brief moments of emotion but there could have been more. I think this would have happened with more character development. I wanted to see into their very souls.Where the author really succeeded was in showing how bad some of these kings were. It is amazing how little it takes to start down the wrong path. Good King dies, unrighteous king reigns and tragedy befalls the people. Let me tell you, this King Ahaz was not one of the good ones!!! Additionally, we see the fall of an individual who makes concessions on his faith with the belief that he will then bring everyone back. Little does he know where that one choice will take him! The journey to evil doesn't usually start with one dark, dastardly deed. Usually, as illustrated so adeptly by the author, it begins with small steps leading down a path toward that deed.I look forward to seeing what the author has to offer in the next book of the series."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I wasn't expecting what this book delivered.

Lynn Austin is a talented writer. She kept my interest from beginning to end and I couldn't wait to begin the next book in the series. This series brought the individuals to life, along with giving nuggets of spiritual wisdom, so much so that I opened my Bible to read the accounts of Hezekiah, Manassah, and the children of Judah first hand.

Well written, I could not stop reading.My only issue is with a lot of the other reviews that say this is a Christian book. It is not, Google King Hezekiah and learn that he is of the House of David and Jewish.

I have to admit I wouldn't have downloaded if if it wasn't free as I had already purchased one too many, but I am extremely glad I did! It was well worth the read and went on to purchase all the other books in the series.The only thing that I felt was undeserving was the $0.00 price tag. For all the emotions and faith it stirred in me I would have wanted to purchase this book to support the author, but if her intention was to capture new readers with a $0.00 price tag, she has certainly succeeded. I had never heard of Lynn Austin prior and have only just caught onto Christian fiction and she has already made it to my list of authors to watch out for.My mother in law has just finished reading this book and she tremendously enjoyed this book as I have and is now onto the second book.I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This book brought the Bible to life.

My teenage daughter read it first and said she thought I'd like it. She was right! I recommended it to my teenage son and he was on book 2 within a couple days.

You are not reading about the past, you are living it, feeling it, practically smelling it (smoke, incense, etc.); it is that real.Many times, I put the book down and picked up the bible for verification of characters, lineage, etc....it was all there.Get to know your biblical kings in all their glory (or lack thereof).

While I knew the name \\"Hezekiah\\" was from the bible, I was unaware of his story. On a whim, I downloaded the book off kindle because it sounded interesting and of course, it was FREE! And out of sheer boredome one day I decided to read it...WOW! From the first page, I was hooked. This story has everything from betrayal to murder and love. It is suspenseful, heartwrenching and heartwarming. A true page turner. Of course, the story is slanted toward christian religious beliefs, but if that stuff doesn't bother you (or you agree with it) this may prove to be a good read. I took it for what it was: fiction. And I enjoyed every single minute."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Like so many other people who have read Lynn Austin's Gods and Kings, I appreciated her fine writing skills and excellent story telling ability. However, her editors must have struggled with the manuscript translation to ebook style. There were so many lines that did not separate into paragraphs, punctuation problems, words not separated or separated words when not needed, and words run together, that at times it was difficult to read. I can't believe that Bethany House would release a script with this many errors in it. An author of this caliber deserves a better production than this gobblygook."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I was given this book to read as part of a Book Club with the ladies of my church.

A great read!!!!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"A series of books that I pass on to others because there are so good. Thank you so much Lynn for writing this book series, it is one of my favorites. It taught me so much in history and of God's Word. I likely would read them again. Our entire family of 5 has enjoyed them and my 16 year old son has it down as his favorite book series. I highly recommend these books."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I have always been very skeptical of \\"biblical fiction\\" because creative license can border on heresy if the writer is not careful, so I reluctantly purchased Gods & Kings the first book in Lynn Austin's Chronicles of the Kings series. Wow, was I pleasantly surprised! Ms. Austin has taken a few meaningful lines of old testament Scripture and brought them to life with believeable dialogue and suspenseful plots that although speculative, do not contradict biblical truths and bring honor and glory to our GOD. The way she describes how the Israelites under the rule of King Ahaz slowly and steadily turned from the one and true GOD and allowed idol worship to appease other nations, it is very easy to see parallels with our society today and it is very sobering! However, instead of leaving us with a feeling of doom and despare, Lynn gives us hope through the young Prince Hezekiah and a handful of faithful prophets of GOD -- it is not too late to wake up America!I look forward to reading all the books in the Chronicals of the Kings series, and hope she continues to write stories about the old and new testament."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I wish I could give this book 10 stars. Lynn Austin is a fabulous author and her writing is scripturally sound. Once you start this book, you don't want to put it down until you have read the 5 books in this series. I highly recommend this book and have bought several as gifts for my friends."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Gods and Kings by Lynn Austin is an excellent biographical fictionized version of the Old Testamnet king, King Hezekiah. The book starts off however when his father, the idolatrous King Ahaz is still in power. Wanting to gain favor in the eyes of the idol god Molech, Ahaz calls for a human sacrifice of the eldest sons of his people. He himself sarifices his oldest son Eliab. Hezekiah, who then was still a mere child witnesses his brother being engulfed into the flames of Molech.While the country is in the brink of being attacked, King Ahaz calls forth another sacrifice to occur. This time however, Hezekiah is now the eldest since he was born second. Frightened to death b/c he know he is about to die he hears the prophet Isaiah prophesize to King Ahaz about how the country is going to be in ruins. He hears Isaiah also tell him, \\"When you pass through the flames you will not be burnt.\\" As Hezekiah and the other make their way up to the flaming mouth of Molech he calls out \\"Yahweh!\\" hoping someone will save him. When the priest of Molech asks which one is the eldest, Uriah, the palace adminstrator who happens to also be the High Priest of Yahweh places his hand on top of Amariah, Hezekiah's half-brother. It is here that Hezekiah realizes the Yahweh saved him from being sacrificed.The rest of the book describes his growth in Yahweh, and then how a major event in his life happens which then makes him ignore Yahweh for many years until he becomes king at age 25.The book is very addicting let me tell you. Lynn Austin is known quite well for writing heart-tugging novels. While this one may not be very emotional it is rich in history and you can also imagine you were right there along with the characters.I especially liked near the ending when Hezekiah claims he hated his father's idolatry but he realizes he himself is an idolator. Hezekiah was following his own wisdom and intellect instead of trusting in Yahweh's judgement. When we follow our own wisdom that too is considered idolatry.I reccommend this book to anyone who loves Lynn Austin's other books (such as me since she's my fav. author! lol) or anyone interested in biblical history. Lynn Austin did quite a vast amount of research to write this series and it is cleary shown in the words of the book. Never have I been so fascinated by a Old Testament king who brought his nation back to God."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Believing Yahweh as a myth of his ancestor King David and desperate to appease the idol Molech that he believes is the power, Hebrew King Ahaz of Judah decides to sacrifice his last son Hezekiah. By killing his son in sacrifice to Molech, Ahaz hopes to gain favor to win a war that has so far devastated his army and people. Only the lad's mother Abijah might be able to save her son's life, but she trusts no one yet needs help to keep Hezekiah safe. That help comes in the form of a miracle when Yahweh the true God makes his presence known at the altar.Surviving his evil father's excesses when he was a child, Hezekiah is now the king with only two people loyal to him out of love for him; his mother and his wife, but they know they must allow him to rule. Besides showering him with love, they pray to Yahweh to guide their beloved; for both knows his male role models have been abominations including his dead father, drunken grandfather, the power hungry disbelieving High Priest and foreign born instructor. Yet he must also deal with the Assyrian invasion and the scorn of the Great Prophet Isaiah.This is a terrific work of Old Testament historical fiction that provides an insightful look at two intriguing Hebrew descendents of David Kings Ahaz and Hezekiah; the former prayed to an idol while his son implemented needed religious reforms and a return to the One God. The story line is very entertaining while bringing to life a fascinating segment of the bible. Lynn Austin entertains her myriad of fans with her first of five book Chronicle of Kings series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"this was an incredible book, and I was so disappointed when I finished the last of the series. I absolutely love historical fiction, but this went so much further than just the typical entertainment I get from most books I read.

From my POV, all the parts concerning \\"Yahweh\\" so thrilling to believers were incidental to the historical narrative, which was rather interesting. While this entity means nothing to me, I accept that Yahweh meant a lot to the ancient Hebrews, and yes, the story is lifted from the rip-roaring Old Testament -- and if this first volume in the series is any indication, the ride will be worthwhile. I've downloaded number two in the series, and expect to read them all. Recommended for an unusual, historically compelling setting!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"God and Kings was a book I simply could not put down.

I can't believe how Lynn Austin took such a short segment from the book of 2nd Chronicles and built a whole novel around the story of King Ahaz and the rise of King Hezekiah to the throne.

I've read the Bible through several times, which of course includes Kings and Chronicles.

Except for three historical errors, I find Gods and Kings quite true to the Bible and history. The first error is when Hezekiah was taken to watch the Moloch sacrifice of his older brother. that couldn't happen. Children sacrificed to Moloch as well as Baal, Chemosh and Dagon were sacrificed when they were between three and five years old. Hezekiah would have been between two and four years old. Children were not weaned until they were three and didn't go to worship services until they were five. Hezekiah may have seen half-brothers sacrificed but not his older brother. The second error is, Hezekiah couldn;t be sacrificed to Moloch. Moloch, Baal, Chemosh, and Dagon required the first born child. The third error is children didn't wear clothes until they were five in Biblical times."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"The book made the story interesting and revealed the power of God.

This book gave me much greater insight into what he faced and how the nation of Judah was politically, socially, and religiously during that time. It was a great read and I highly recommend it whether you are a student of OT history or not. It was hard at times to keep in mind that this was a novel.

I forgot about it and started reading another book... I got tired of that one but finished it anyway and when I finally got to this book I was instantly captured!

Very beautiful story of God's love for His people."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I could not believe this was a free book. I figured out why after reading it: I immediately went and bought the others in this series! The second book is better than the first, which is definitely not the norm. The depictions of the characters and their struggles mirror many things we face today. The description of the time period makes you feel as if you are there, and I found myself thinking of these characters long after the book was done. It is also very scripturally sound. Who knew the Old Testament could be brought to such life? If you like the 'Mark of the Lion' series, you will also enjoy these."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"First of all...this is a work of FICTION based on biblical accounts of the reign of King Ahaz. Ms. Austin has researched this to try and be as accurate as possible to the events of the time. She used the NIV translation when quoting scripture...which is not a bad thing...especially when overall, all biblical text is translated and interpreted by someone.Again, this is a book of fiction, and even novels written by Jewish authors have \\"westernized\\" or \\"modern\\" inflections, because that is how it is...despite best intentions when trying to write how the story \\"might have happened\\" this is going to occur.Putting that all aside, I LOVED THIS BOOK! I could not put it down. I've always been fascinated with biblical fiction. Filling in the gaps of what might have happened to provide a great story. Ms. Austin's writing was fabulous and made me feel like I was really their seeing what was happening during King Ahaz's reign. Did this sway me from thinking that this is what really happened. Absolutely not...because 1) I have the bible and can look up the references and read and 2) I know it is a work of fiction.This book is beautifully written, and I cannot wait to read the next 4. I'm glad I saw this on amazon.com as a free Kindle book!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I am typically not a fan of Christian fiction because I think it gets sappy, overly emotional, and unrealistic. I think, \\"No one would ACTUALLY think and behave that way.\\" This story caught me from the very beginning with characters that felt so real. From little children to kings, from the common man to the priests, each character speaks and acts in a way that you really believe. The story feels so real and you really feel the characters experiencing God's will in their lives instead of your typical fiction where the characters are all talk.I would recommend this book to anyone, especially to those who may have grown cynical about typical Christian fiction. After finishing the book, I pulled out my Bible and began to reread Kings and Chronicles with fresh eyes and enthusiasm. I can't wait to read the next book in this series."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I never thought about reading a religious fiction book before.

This book got him reading!Great series you can't put it down.Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Good biblical fiction remains faithful to both Scripture and its characters while bringing ancient accounts fully to life. Lynn Austin has done a fantastic job of creating a vivid, insightful, page-turning story that I stayed up all night to finish. Austin has very romantically yet realistically depicted noble Hezekiah, the prophets Isaiah and Micah, and numerous other biblical characters. The heroes (and villains) are fully fleshed-out. The story line never slows as it unravels a tale compiled from numerous biblical texts (with which the author shows herself thoroughly knowledgeable). The backdrop of history and geography exhibit serious historical research.I'm a fan of biblical fiction, and I haven't found any better than this.WARNING: Don't even pick up Gods & Kings unless you're willing to commit to the five book series. You'll be hooked until the last page of book five."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I purchased this book as an Amazon recommended read. I was completely SHOCKED how much I loved this book! I picked it up and read it in a day.It is an inspiring read. I love the dynamic love relationship that develops with Hezakiah and his grandfather, as well as the relationship with his mother. This story will inspired in me a renewed faith!Sometimes as a Christian you can read bible stories and you gain the historical significance, but this book allows you to relize the personal significance and dedication to God. It was wonderful!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"My son-in-law had been encouraging me to read this series for some time, so I decided to try it. I imagined it would be slow, but good for the biblical knowledge it held. Well, by the end of the first page I was hooked and could not put the book down. This book gave depth and insight to the lives of Ahaz and Hezekiah. Two totally different men;Godly and ungodly. Although the account was some time ago, our world is really not so different. With each page you can relate to the characters and the life lessons they go thru. It reads like a Joan of Arc or Gladiator movie. I belive Lynn Austin was truly inspired by God to write these books. I am now on book three!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I'm a former MK(missionaries kid), have been a fundamental Christian for more than 40 years, a preacher's wife, and an avid reader of Christian fiction.This is my favorite series ever. I first checked it out from the Library and now have bought the first book twice to give to others. It is as close to historically and Biblically correct as any books that are based on Biblical characters. These are not romances, though they have love and relationships in them. The books are informative and entertaining, and just the right length. Austin is a gifted writer!I was sent to my Bible time after time to check and make sure that what was written was Biblically accurate, and it was! I learned so much about myself through this series! Though I want to own them all for myself, I keep giving them away to others. MY FAVORITE SERIES EVER!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This book is not just about ancient Judah. It is about here and now. Judah's leaders squander the nation's wealth in tributes to the Assyrians. Our leaders squander ours not only to other nations but in tributes to favored factions here at home. Judah's leaders slaughter their own children in sacrifices to the god Molech. By abortion we sacrifice ours to our own idols of sexual license, materialism, and self-interest. Judah abandons its heritage of faith in the one true God Yahweh, and the rulers of Judah silence the voices of the prophets and the few remaining believers in Him. And are not the Faithful today under attack in the public schools, in the media, and by government mandate? As this book comes to its final chapter, there is hope for the nation under its new king Hezekiah because of his renewed faith in Yahweh. Unfortunately, our nation does not yet have this renewal of Faith and has just re-elected the evil king it deserves."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"A very good book.

I had a hard time putting it down! Can not wait to read the next one!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This is the first in a series, CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS; Book 2 will be called SONG OF REDEMPTION. This story concerns the events in the lives of two kings of Judah, Ahaz and his son Hezekiah, from 732 to 687 BC. I was intrigued with the front cover, showing a rearing riderless horse connected to an empty Roman chariot. Where is Charleston Heston?In 931 BC, Jerusalem was divided into separate kingdoms, Israel the larger to the North and no longer governed by a descendant of King David, after King Solomon died. The Southern nation called Judah is where this narrative takes place. Uzziah was dead and Zachariah was drunk, begging God to let him die. \\"Can I ever find forgiveness,\\" he beseeched his friend, but Uriah was angry and with self-loathing lashed out at Z. \\"I admire you so much; I had wanted to be just like you. You had the most brilliant legal mind the priesthood had seen in generations. You're a disgrace.\\" Pity, guilt, and grief raged inside Uriah as he saw that his mentor had 'feet of clay.' \\"You're lying.\\" It is never good to place someone on a pedestal.Ahaz was only twenty years old when he became king. However, he was paranoid and was always imagining that people were out to get him. He had ordered Uriah to execute Z as he erroneously thought that Isaiah, who was of royal blood, and Z were plotting against him. They had attempted to cause a revolt by humiliating him in front of the entire nation.They had a new king and hoped that maybe things would be different as King Hezekiah's coronation took place. He was the second son of Ahaz. The prophets are our only hope, and they did keep things going. Isaiah was one of the best, but my favorite for a long time was Jeremiah.Ms. Austin has written a trilogy about the Civil War previous to this series, which earned her the Christy Awards for Historical Fiction. She is one of the best to come along in a long time."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"As you can probably tell from other reviews, this book was written primarily for religious people, and in particular Christians: the religious Jews are all good, the idol-worshippers mostly villianous. (I knew it wasn't written for Jews since the author spells out the Y-H-V-H Hebrew name of God in a way that no present-day Jew would consider appropriate, and I found one poorly-hidden Jesus reference). I wouldn't say it is as sophisticated or as interesting as good secular fiction, but it is minimally readable - the sort of thing one could read in a dentists' office or an airport, but not really worth foregoing other books for."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I had a hard time putting this book down. I felt so involved in the story and the characters' lives. I cried at times. I loved how it has so many perspectives - political, religious, parental, marital. It's full of emotion and gives a great vision of how things were during that time....I absolutely loved reading it! I'm eager to continue the series!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"The bible comimg to life is what happens when you read this book and with that you remember it more clearly and can identify with the characters.I can't wait to start on #2.

I gained a wonderful insight to biblical history in a way that I've never had before.

And unlike some modern authors, she is tasteful in her writing style, although not hiding facts from us."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Although this is fiction, it is an interesting way to present what the Bible says about Ahaz and Hezekiah. This book follows Hezekiah from childhood. It is so intriguing. I loved every page. Lynn Austin brings the characters in the Bible alive and makes them so real. I found myself searching the scripture to see what the Bible actually says about what happens during this time.

The books for the most part concur with the scriptures as far as the historical facts. What I liked was the fictional fleshing out of the characters in the novel.

I plan to get the rest of the series and let the rest of my fellow students know about these books."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I love to read Bible stories in the fictional form. They add life to the old stories we've heard so often. This book does a great job in telling us the story of the ancient kings. I've read other reviews, and they speak of many typos. Well, in the Kindle edition, they may have corrected some, but they missed quite a few in chapters 18 and 19. Because I am a student of the Bible, I found some of the repetition somewhat tedious. It was still an enjoyable read. I wonder if we could get the rest of the books in the series for free when we find typos in them."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I don't usually write reviews on the books I read.

To take a novel approach to a Biblical story is risky, but this was brilliantly done - especially because this is a very difficult story to tell.

I would definitely recommend yhis book."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Just finished reading Part 1 of the \\"Chronicles of the Kings\\". Wow, what an emotionally-charged book and convicting read that was! The author did an excellent job in bringing to life the events of biblical history in such a dramatic and compelling fashion. It is amazing how similar in a way we are with the people way back then.. It is both sobering and refreshing at the same time. Sobering because of seeing the extent and pain of what sin does and knowing that God is a righteous and just God. Refreshing because God is merciful and His love unfailing and has many ways of redeeming His people back to Him. Truly God is the same yesterday and forever! I am thoroughly enjoying this and am looking forward to completing the book series :-)"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Although familiar with the Old Testament, this particular story is not one with a lot of detail, or often retold.

Like the wind He is real even if our human eyes cannot see Him.Read this book I beg of you and return to the grace only the Lord my God AND YOURS can provide.

I have read the books of Kings and the books of Chronicles in the Bible, and for the most part, the words and names just slip through my mind as a long ago story. This book makes it very real.

Her characters are believable and the dialogue is engaging. There are a few anachronisms (such as the use of post-Exilic terms \\"Abba\\" and \\"Rabbi\\" in a pre-Exilic setting) but they do not detract significantly from the verisimilitude of the period. The thing I most enjoyed about this story is the way Austin shows the relevance of the Old Testament to our own culture . . . we too engage in the sort of compromise and idolatry described by the prophets (especially Isaiah), and their message is one we need to hear more often. I found myself reexamining my own thoughts and actions after reading this book, but Austin's tone is never \\"preachy.\\""},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This was the first Lynn Austin book I read, and I could not put it down. I quickly read the following books in this series.

If you have ever had the pleasure of reading a Francine Rivers novel, you will enjoy Lynn Austin as well. While I meditated on Rivers novels for days and even weeks, I found Austin's stories a bit faster paced and entertaining yet at the same time thought provoking and nourishment to the soul. I greatly enjoyed the first three books and highly recommend them. I am waiting for the fourth and fifth!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This is a good historical fiction book. I did not feel it preached to me or tried to relay an underlying christian message. It is what the description says it is. However, the editing is very poor considering it was published professionally."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"The book is engaging the reader from the first page. The writer has a way to get inside the mind of a reader drawing him/her into the story. The reader knows what is going on inside the characters' heads making them feel so real. The story has been written well. It is an easy way to learn something from the bible. But I am not sure how much has been added or changed from the bible. A drawback to this fiction biblical story is that the author did not include numbers of scriptures. It would serve better for studying bible.Another drawback about the book is that the author has written it in a language that would be suitable to young adults.Since it is a historical and biblical novel, I prefer when the author would challenge the reader. I was looking for more descriptions and richer choice of words.Overall, the book was good, and I will be looking into the next book of that series.It is a simple read moving at a faster pace. It is perfect to be read when you are tired.I wish that the author would develop more descriptions and move much slower, but that did not destroy an overall story and messages that the writer decided to get across to the reader."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I have recommended this book to everyone in my Bible Study classes. I love how it feels like you are reading a modern novel. I can't wait to read the other books in the series."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Hezekiah, prince of Judah, lives in a kingdom under siege from hostile forces within and without. His father, King Ahaz, has abandoned the worship of Yahweh and led his nation into idolatry. Gods & Kings chronicles Hezekiah's coming of age, detailing his turbulent childhood when he saw his father sacrifice his older brother Eliab to the pagan god Molech. Overwhelmed by fear, Hezekiah first encounters the life-changing touch of God through the love and teaching of his grandfather, Zechariah, a Levitical priest. These seeds of faith are all that Hezekiah has to guide him in a kingdom threatened by invasion and corrupted by idolatry. But surrounded by threats to his very existance, can he hope to survive and be given the chance to change the future of his country?This is one of the best biblical fiction series out there, easily on par with Angela Hunt's Legacies of the Ancient River series. I don't feel that Austin's writing is as strong or her characters quite as well-developed as is evident in her later books (such as the Christy award-winning novels Candle in the Darkness and Fire By Night), but that's a very minor issue. Austin does an excellent job bringing the world of ancient Judah to life in all of its color, pageantry, danger, and intrigue. She breathes fresh life into the character of Hezekiah, creating a flesh-and-blood man whose struggles and weaknesses make his triumphs as one of Judah's greatest kings all the more inspiring. And the book lives up to perhaps the best measure of whether or not biblical fiction succeeds or fails - it inspires study of the actual biblical text.When reading this book (incidentally this was my second time), I was struck by how timely the story felt. Hezekiah was one small drop in an overwhelming sea of danger and false gods, but God used his life to literally change the course of an entire nation and people. So read, study, and be inspired as Austin helps to bring to life the truth of 2 Chronicles 7:14 -- \\"if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.\\""},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"In my opinion, most religious fiction is not very good as everyone is just too nice or the scenes just aren't realistic as it's not \\"Christian\\" to write about how people really are. Lynn Austin, on the other hand, does a really nice job of fictionalizing a brief passage of the Bible into a full-length novel, and gets you into the heads of the characters. The imagery and scenery are very realistic and, for example, I could imagine me walking the dusty streets of the Middle Ages. The thing that struck me the most was this book really got me thinking and getting more out of the story than a random section of the 28th chapter of the book of Second Chronicles and makes me want to read the next one in the series: with the volume of books I read on a monthly basis, having one stick with me and recalling various sections of the book long after I read it (about a month ago) is, to me, impressive and tells me this was really a good book.I initially got this book during a Kindle free promotion and, as I write this review, the price is now $5.38 in the Amazon Kindle store - you will certainly get a lot more than $5.38 in entertainment value if you get this one!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Every now and then, I enjoy \\"escaping reality\\" by reading a good Scriptural (and historical) based novel. I purchased the first book, \\"Gods and Kings\\" at a discount store, not even knowing that it was part of a series, and could not wait until I found it's sequels! I have read all 5 of the \\"Chronicles of the Kings\\" series and I hope that Lynn Austin writes more sequels to this particular series.I did get a bit confused at Amazon's website while looking for the rest of this series, so I am going to list them here in order for the convenience of future buyers:book 1 \\"Gods And Kings\\"book 2 \\"Songs Of Redemption\\"book 3 \\"The Strength Of His Hand\\"book 4 \\"Faith Of My Fathers\\"book 5 \\"Among The Gods\\"Another author whose sequel I am eagerly awaiting is Ellen Gunderson Traylor's \\"Jerusalem The City Of God - Part Two\\", also set in Old Testament times. These types of books really \\"take you back in time\\" to the way that things really were."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I loved this book (series) because not only was it a very interesting read, but more importantly because it gave me such a good insight into life during the Old Testament. The stories of Kings Ahaz, Hezekiah, and Manassah have never been so real to me as when I read that book. I will never again read the Biblical accounts the same way!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Ms. Austin has taken the reader on a journey back into time weaving truth with fiction in such a way that she has managed to pen a read that is not only descriptive but good as well.This is the story of Hezekiah who will eventually assume the role of king as a descendent of King David. This story opens with Hezekiah as a young boy and we grow with him as he faces many challenges to both his life, and his faith. His father is King Ahaz, and he has plotted to sacrifice Hezekiah in order to gain the favor of the gods, and win the war that has currently decimated his army and killed his own brother. Hezekiah's mother Abijah will do all that she can to spare her last son from his father's evil machinations. She has only two men that she can rely on, but can she trust them to save her beloved son?Hezekiah is destined for great things and manages to survive his childhood but he is now a man and the dangers to him have not dissipated. He is now King, and his mother and his wife, two women that love Hezekiah, must now stand back, and wait to see if his faith is strong enough to help him survive the treachery and violence that surrounds him. Will he be strong enough to stand by his beliefs and save his country?This was a very moving read as well as being very descriptive. Fans of Christian novels will find no fault with this vivid story and characters. Ms. Austin has managed to bring the Old Testament to life in a way that is not only entertaining, but educational as well.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"The Chronicles of the Kings series are THE BEST Biblical novels I have ever read. Lynn Austin's writing is so captivating, you won't be able to put the book down! While reading this series, I actually had to make myself not even touch the book before I went to work - because several times I did just that, lost all track of time and wound up arriving late to work!I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. It really fleshes out certain Biblical characters and events, enabling you to really feel involved with the Biblical accounts. They become more than just words on a page in a history book - they become living, breathing people that really walked this earth. I was pleased that the author stayed very true to the Bible. I have read novels in this genre before that took great liberties with the facts as presented in the Bible. I did not feel that this was one of those. In fact, the author uses direct quotes from the Bible at all times when the prophets delivered their prophecies! At the front of the book, the author lists the scriptures used to write the story and encourages you to study it more deeply.This is a well-written, page-turning, true-to-the-Word book that will keep you reading for hours and deepen your appreciation for God's love and grace. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Went out a few days later to purchase the next one. I am now on Book 5. My husband is now reading them. He loves them too. I hope the series continues. The story that I have heard before in the Old Testament comes to life. The characters are wonderful. Start reading you will not be dissappointed."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This book is really interesting and well written but there are so many typos. Some are just missing punctuation that are easy to over look but there are also words missing in some paragraphs that are really frustrating and confusing. It really disrupts the flow of the book. I'd love to read the rest of the series but I hesitate to pay money for such poor quality. I'm glad this one was free. I reported the errors so hopefully they will look into it because this is a really good book."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This book was awesome, in the truest sense of the word. The writing was so fantastic, I was unable to put it down and stayed up half the night for 2 consecutive days to finish it. It brought the Old Testament to life in a way that you don't find often. Despite the fact that I try to limit my Kindle reading to the free stuff, I have already bought book 2 and can't wait to start!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Ms. Austin is a skilled and polished writer with a well-developed knack for grabbing a reader in the first two pages and pulling them in by presenting a dire situation for characters we have only just met, yet somehow, we already care about. In this case, the book opens with gentle children being threatened by a band of tough soldiers who storm into their bedrooms and take them captive.The horrible plans for those children quickly become apparent - they are to be burned alive as an offering to a pagan god. And the author does not flinch from the brutality, or let her readers look away. She dutifully has the young boys tossed into the brass maw of a bestial idol, where they scream horribly as they are engulfed by flames.If this sounds like raw, edgy, cutting edge fiction, well, maybe it is, but this is Christian literature. I almost never read this genre because I am not a Christian, but I am willing to read anything with an open mind as long as a compelling story is being told. And this book delivers that - for the most part.For me, again, not a Christian, I found many of the scenes rather preachy and repetitive of the basic Christian themes that the \\"True God\\" is one of \\"endless love and compassion\\" and that those who turn away from Him to worship false gods will face calamity in their lives, and so on. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with this - it's what Christian readers enjoy reading and what they want to read. They enjoy reading a compelling story, while also having their belief system reinforced for themselves. I'm all for it! Go for it!However, as an objective reviewer, I have to make other readers aware of what they are getting when they purchase this book. Yes, it's a historical novel, a take on the ancient Kings of Judah in and around the years 700 B.C. to 800 B.C. - but one needs to know that this is historical FICTION, but more accurately, fiction as seen through the lens of and colored by a modern day, mainstream Christian belief system.So if you are a believing, practicing Christian, this might be a 5-star read. For the rest of us, well, I'll give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This is one of my all time favorite book series! Loved everything about it and have referred it to many people who feel the same way. It put flesh to some of the people of the Bible and made me love the old testament even more. I can't recommend it enough!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Summary from Amazon: Gods and Kings is the story of King Hezekiah, heir to the throne of King David. When his evil father plots to sacrifice him, Hezekiah's mother, Abijah, searches frantically for a way to save him. But only two men can help her, and neither of them seems trustworthy. In a time and place engulfed by violence, treachery, and infidelity to Yahweh, Abijah and her son must discover the one true Source of strength if they are to save themselves and their country.My Thoughts: I first picked up this book because it was free on kindle. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Austin brought the characters from the Old Testament alive. I have read the Old Testament stories but rarely thought about the feelings or the humanity behind the words. These people went through the same struggles and temptations as I do. Reading this book made me want to reread the chapters about Ahaz and Hezekiah, seeing them in a new light.The action is steady and exciting. Even though I knew what was going to happen since I have read the books of Kings, it was still a fast-paced adventure. The events line up with scripture and are evidence of Austin's research.

This series was THE BEST! The first three books essentially make up the story of King Hezekiah, and the last two books are about different characters.

You don't have to be a fan of the Old Testament to enjoy this novel, but if you like historical fiction of any type, I highly recommend it. The characterizations are spot-on, the scenery and historical details are vivid and believable, and the story unfolds like a suspense thriller. You literally cannot wait to find out what happens next!I originally downloaded this eBook with some trepidation because it was a free kindle download and let's be honest, there are a lot of lousy free eBooks out right now. But the publisher's marketing ploy worked, because I loved Gods & Kings so much that I've now purchased the next two novels in the series and I've already finished the second one.

I am part way through no 4. The story is fast moving and totally captivating. I couldn't put it down. I totally recommend this book and will look at reading others written by her. This was the first time I had read anything by Lynn Austin. She was recommended to me and I glad they did."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"The beginning seemed slow but as I got past the first few pages I became engrossed and couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I simply could not put this book down. I love historical fiction books, but this one is so much more. It opened my eyes to the real historical events in the bible. This story is taken right from the book of 2 Chronicles, 2 Kings and the prophecies of Isaiah and Micah. It is the story of King Ahaz of Judah and his son and heir to his throne Hezekiah. When I finished reading it I read the whole book of 2 Chronicles. I had a hunger to know more. I have since read the 2nd and 3rd books in the Chronicles of the Kings series and am getting ready to download the 4th of the series. I hope in reading this series you too turn to the books of Kings, Isaiah, Micah, Chronicles, Ezra, Jeremiah and read them for yourselves. These books have helped me to understand the old testament much better. Thank you Lynn Austin!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Gods and Kings, purchased from Amazon, seems to be an accurate novel interpretation of scripture. Detailed descriptions are graphic. Probably a good historic account of what took place during this period in Hebrew history."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This was the first of Lynn Austins books that I have read. I loved how she gave the scripture references from where she took her storyline. For me it was a book that was hard to put down. I enjoyed the second book in the series as much as the first, also the third book. I am now on the fourth book and my only disappointment is that Amazon does not offer the fifth and last book in the Kindle edition or paperback."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I have read a ton of historical fiction novels but never one from this time period.

The historical content was excellent as it came to life. I could not wait to see what would happen next. Makes you reflect on what values are really important to you and how easily you can be sidetracked and never get back to the place you should be in some instances. On the other hand with some perseverance you can get back on track and be in good standing."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This book and the entire collection of the 5 books are incredibly faith building! If you love old testament stories it is a MUST read! I could not put the books down once I started! I have a re-invigorated AWE of God and a fresh understanding of the Torah and all that went on in the Temple. I can see more clearly the purposes of the sacrafices made and the horror of idolitry. I can also read the book of Isaiah with better understanding of the times of that day. Thank you Ms. Austin and Thank you LORD for giving her the anointing to write so beautifully!!!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Very good story, quick reading and held my interest.

Its much better than watching a movie."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This is first in a series of books about some of the Old Testament kings, their relationship with God, good and bad, and how the country was affected by this relationship. The Bible only gives the bare facts, but Lynn Austin has filled in the gaps by giving her take on what could have happened in their day to day lives. I learned alot about what life was like in those times and am looking forward to reading the rest of the series. Lynn Austin is one of my favourite authors and she did not disapoint me with this book."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I would recommend this to anyone. This is a book that I have been able to refer back to my bible with and it grasps you from the beginning. It was pleasant to learn and read yet another great story from the bible."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I'm a lover of history and of course God's Word. This book was a culmination of both! I couldn't put it down. I felt as if I were really there in Judah \\"peeking\\" into the palace and the minds of King Ahaz and his son, King Hezekiah. I can't wait to read book 2."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This is an excellent series. The author has made the characters come alive and made the readers feel like they are living with them. I'm impressed by the author's attention to biblical detail: even characters mentioned only once or twice in Scripture (such as Hephzibah) are included in the story. She has also done her homework, and even with all the imagination that goes into a historical fiction series, the story remains true to what COULD have happened, i.e. it is biblically, historically, and culturally accurate. The author has paid attention to the Old Testament as a whole, not just the accounts of the kings themselves, but also which prophets were alive at the time, and the Laws of Moses that Hezekiah and the other characters would have (or should have) been following and how those laws would have affected their lives. I have often found myself looking up in the biblical account to compare it to the book, and being surprised to find that some of the key characters of the book, such as Hephzibah, Zechariah, Hilkiah, and Shebna, are actually named in Scripture. Of course, they may not have been exactly as the author describes them, but this series is a good reminder to me that even these people about whom we know so little did really have lives and families, and faced choices and good and bad times, just as I do. Which is, I suppose, one of the purposes of a historical fiction series!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"The story kept me turning pages. Ms. Austin brings the Old Testament to life and gave insight to what can sometimes be overlooked passages. I found myself anxious for Hezikiah's life and his return to Yahweh. I can't wait to read the remaining books in the series."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I loved this book. It accomplished the most important 3 things I look for when I read any book. 1. I didn't want to put it down and stop reading. 2. It made me \\"feel\\" a range of emotions, (I felt Hezekiah's fear, Abijah's pain and Zechariah's shame). 3. I felt like I learned or gained something new or valuable from reading it. Plus it made me want to actually pick up my bible, which I did afterwards to see how close or far from the source was the fiction. Can't wait to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I was lucky to get this book as a free kindle edition. I tore through it and have ordered the second book. It is extremely well written with amazing detail."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I wasn't sure I would like this, but a friend recommended it and I enjoyed it very much. The author has an excellent ability to bring the old testament to life. Nicely done."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Very good book! Makes me want to read the actual old testament accounts. Can't wait to read the next book!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"AFter reading this, I had to search the Old Testament for the story of Hezekiah, Ahaz, and Isaiah. Very entertaining read. Can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I don't usually like historical fiction set in Biblical times, but someone gave me this book, and it only took one page for me to be hooked! It's not only a great read, but it's also Biblically based so you can read the story line in the Bible, too. Beware, you'll want to buy the other books in the series as soon as you finish!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I greatly enjoy reading the books of history from the Bible's Old Testament. They are incredibly exciting, full of battles, politics, intrigue, assassinations, lust, greed, and everything that makes for a good thriller. And this book is a pretty good thriller while setting up some descent character development and plot threads for the upcoming books in the series. I have not read the other books in this series, but I look forward to doing so soon. If they are on the same level as this one then they would be well worth the read. And of course, you have all the time that the mercy of God and the psalms of David are mentioned. I especially appreciated how the psalms were consistently shown as being such a natural part of people's lives that they would sing them to themselves at odd times. We sometimes forget that the psalms started out as praise songs. We sing songs to ourselves all the time in modern times, so why wouldn't they do it in ancient times as well.This book does a really good job of explaining how a child born to a godless father could eventually become one of the most godly kings of Judah. Nothing in here contradicts the Biblical record and I really love how details of the way in which the ancient Jewish peoples lived and interacted with each other are included in the story. Also, the political climate of the day, both on a national and international scale, are convincingly included here and it is all very entertaining reading. As with any book series, there are a few too many minor characters introduced here who don't do much at all to advance the story but might come into play in other installments of the series. That makes the first part of the series drag just a little in some areas, but still well worth the read."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This series of books by Lynn Austen bring the history of the Kings alive. She weaves in the facts of the events of the times with a clear presentation of Kings and Chronicles from the Bible. Best series I have ever read. Must be read in sequence."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"You will not put this down, takes you directly to the time and setting of our history! You will LOVE this...all the Kings books are a MUST!!!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Lynn Austin wove a wonderful story during a very critical time in bible history. You will be taken back in time to a place that comes alive with the struggles of life and belief in God against all odds."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I read this series at the same time that I read the book of Isaiah. It was fantastically written. Keeping in mind that this is a work of fiction, the author did quote and follow the biblical time line and her story telling helped take me back in time and imagine what it may have been like in these ancient times."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"There are times when \\"Why\\" is a very good question. Like when this first came out and I merely thought that the cover looked interesting. I could've cared less about it... until about 3 months ago. I'd gotten a couple of free tapes with sermons by Steve Farrar from his Mens' ministry. One of them \\"just happened\\" (like everything is coincidence, right?) to be from a series called \\"Living Lessons From Dead Kings\\". It was about King Uzziah, who is briefly mentioned in this book. And I admit that my first thought was \\"WHO CARES?\\", yet it was a gift, and I was willing to give it a chance. It was awesome! Needless to say, I bought a pack of about 19 tapes and CDs with sermons about Kings. Uzziah was among them, Jotham (who is very briefly mentioned) was one of them, Ahaz (one of THIS book's main men) was one of them, and so was Hezekiah. So, like I said above, it all goes back to my question of WHY!? You know something? I really don't know, but I'm sure glad that it happened, regardless!I had to say that I considered buying the first book of this series a risk on my part. Did Lynn Austin do her homework, is was this just another historical work with simply names? After hearing the sermons, I really didn't know. Now I know that I can't wait to read the rest of this series! She was right on, because King Ahaz was nothing short of a loser! Baal Molech was idolatry back then, just like homosexuality is pretty rampant today, and it was very popular. The Assyrians were nothing to mess with either. They'd skin people alive, just like you might do a catfish for supper. So, is there anything GOOD about this? You'd better believe it, and YAHWEH IS IT!!! Read on.If anybody knows Hezekiah's story, you know he was a very Godly man. But what shaped him? Did he have the perfect childhood? If you know ANYTHING whatsoever about King Ahaz, then you probably know that it was less then ideal. But something shaped this man, and God's hand was on it the whole time. Yahweh was in control the whole time, and He still is. I really don't want to give a lot of this away, but I thought it was quite superb. I consider myself blessed that I had the chance to read this. Lynn Austin has my complete respect. I can't wait to get the rest of this series. The title, \\"Gods and Kings\\" is titled appropriately, because it doesn't ask \\"WHY\\", but it does as something, and there is only 1 correct answer. The other answers are wrong. Are you ready for that question? Too late! Here it comes. Who is YOUR God and King?"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Not very pleasant to read. Author's dialogue and third party passages were dull. I didn't finish it. About 1/2 way through, I deleted it."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"The author made a good attempt at trying to bring some bible characters to life, but PLEASE DON'T BASE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE OLD TESTAMENT ON THIS BOOK. The characters say and do things that dont really seem to fit with the Ancient settings.... I kept having to remind myself that it was set in ancient Israel...because the characterisation doesnt fit the setting. I shouldnt have to remind myself of that...a good book should do it. This story had a lot of potential though, had it not been published I would have had some contacts who could have helped you develop the story better and develop characters more fitting to the scene."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It helped to bring to life the characters from the Bible. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Lynn Austin is my new favorite author. I really like the way she writes her books. So far I have read 3 of her books and they are all good ones."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This book was fascinating. It took a short passage from the bible and painted a picture of how it could have been. I will definitely be reading more of these books."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This series was incredible. I enjoyed the biblical history that was intertwined with Lynn Austin's imaginative story of some of Israel's kings & their lives. While reading this series, I was also drawn into worship with my God. His love & redemption are lived out by the characters as God's plan for Israel is unfolded. It made me wish I could still go to God's Temple on the Temple Mount & worship him like the Israelites did in their early history!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"It was okay. It was slow moving and repetitious. I heard great reviews about it so maybe it was just me."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This was not the book I had expected when I down loaded it but Anyone that has any knowledge of the Bible and Its documented history of the Kings of IsraelWill enjoy following this series. Its mainly about Heziekial who grows up to be king of israel and how he outsmarts his enemys and brings peace to his peopleIts a harsh life with harsh outcomes at times but well worth reading if only to realise how history influences modern living"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"One of the most interesting books I have read for ages. Couldn't wait to read the rest of the series. Suddenly the bible and message of the Old Testament came alive and made me realise the importance of what a relationship with God was all about. It also reminded me of the awesome nature and greatness of our God and how by disregarding Him can have dire consequences. So relevant for our country today. Everyone should read this book. Once the first page is read, it is very difficult to put it down. Incredible author."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This book was very easy to read and understand I will give it 5 stars. It was a very good description of the bible verson. Its makes you think of how it was back in the day."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This really brought to life a part of the Bible that is important but only scantily covered. I often wondered how the faith of Judah's kings changed so drastically from one to the next: I now have an idea of how it could have happened. I enjoyed it so much, I read all five in the series."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Some would say I downloaded \\"Gods and Kings\\" on a whim...after reading the first chapter, I felt \\"divine intervention\\" more aptly describes why this story came into my life. As a work of fiction, the story is compelling, draws you in quickly, keeps your attention, and brings you to a point of completeness before appropriately introducing you to the next story in the series. As a man on a life journey who is seeking to strengthen his spiritual relationship with God, \\"Gods and Kings\\" vividly highlights my core obligations to God and the impact His power has on our daily lives.\\"In the spirit given, so it is received.\\" Thank you."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Got this as a free Kindle read and so glad I did. This was one you did not want to put down and felt as if you were there in the scene, as you were drawn into the story. I liked that it was not repetative, as some writers will repeat points already made. The story was fast moving, engaging, and certainly of interest. A true test of any good book is if you want to read the next in the series and I'm there."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This series of books is really interesting,and historically accurate! The author takes some passages from the bible as basis for a gripping story,bringing to life the thoughts and feelings of the ancient characters....I can't put it down! Excellent portrayals,making the names I'd read come to life! Also, author gets the point across without being overly graphic,which I appreciate."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This is a gripping dramatization of the Biblical account of Judah's history under the leadership of King Ahaz, their falling away from Yahweh , corresponding slip into idolatry and resultant desolation. Capping off the narrative is the nation's return to Yahweh under the leadership of its new king - Hezekiah.True to scripture, with many scriptural quotes, Mrs. Austin does a beautiful job of employing artistic license to bring ancient Judah and the Old Testament to life."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This is one of my favorite books. The story of Hezekiah is enthralling, and the biblical time comes to life under Lynn Austin's pen. Before I read it, I was afraid this Old Testament time might be slow reading. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I read the first three books of the series straight through, and I'm looking forward to reading the next two, but don't worry. Each book is complete in itself."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. After getting it for free on Amazon, I had to give it a chance. It so happened that I was reading through the Bible at the EXACT location that this book takes place around. Though some of the details were obviously implied and imposed by artistic liberties, it was believable and not too far fetched or blasphemous. I would give a 5 star, but the writing was a bit elementary. It was a great read, though, and kept me interested for sure!"},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Great Book!

So much biblical truth and so applicable to life today."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"The king sacrifices his firstborn to the idol Molech in the land of Israel. God had chosen Israel as His nation, but throughout the history Israel did not always choose God. During the reign of king Ahaz, idolatry was rife in Israel.Hezekiah witnesses his brother being sacrificed to Molech. Will he survive or is his father going to sacrifice him too? How many sacrifices will there be? Will Judah repent and listen to the prophets?Are the Levites strong enough to stand for their faith in God? Do they still believe in God? When the high priest is promoted, will he be able to withstand the temptations?\\"Grandpa?\\" he asked at last, \\"couldn't Yahweh kill all our enemies and save us? Then my father wouldn't have to spoilHis Temple. Couldn't Yahweh do that?\\"\\"Certainly He could! Don't you remember the story I told you about how Yahweh helped David defeat Goliath?\\"Hezekiah nodded?\\"And remember Joshua and the battle of Jericho? And how Yahweh caused the sun to stand still so Joshua could defeatthe five Amorite kings? Yes, of course Yahweh could defeat all of Judah's enemies.\\"\\"Then why didn't He, Grandpa?\\"Zechariah's face looked sad as he shook his head. \\"Because our nation no longer believes in Him... and so no onebothered to ask Him to.\\"Lynn Austin thoroughly researched the history of Judah during the reign of king Ahaz. She turned history into a beautiful story allowing the reading to experience different emotions while tension builds with the turning of each page.The story reminds us that God is the only God to serve. When we replace Him with idols, our hearts are hardened and it becomes difficult to hear the voice of Truth.\\"Belief in Yahweh doesn't come with your mind, Hezekiah. It comes with your heart. When you only believe in thingsyou can see with your eyes and touch with your hands, it is idolatry.\\"What I enjoyed the most, is how the characters came alive in the pages, pulling the reader into their emotions, fears, victories and love.I highly recommend Gods and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"Loved the connection not only with history and the Bible but also with Lynn's interpretation of the characters.

I actually read this entire book in one sitting, and when I got the second and third books from the library, I devoured those in one or two sittings each, also, which is rather unusual for me.I love the way the author develops the characters, and most of all, I love the way she remains true to the Biblical story. Various times I paused my reading to say what the Bible said about a particular incident, and I was amazed to see how closely the fiction story and the Bible agreed--character names, place names, and other specific details. This book (and series) has given me a new perspective on the times of the kings of Judah, and I will always read those sections of the Bible with a new vision and understanding of the history and culture surrounding the events."},{"Title":"Gods and Kings (Chronicles of the Kings #1)","review":"This is a 5 star book because the writing is excellent,very descriptive and exciting.

Post-Keynesian economics represents a coherent alternative to mainstream economic theory by emphasizing certain features of the market economy while simultaneously questioning the analytical validity of the main assumptions that make up the mainstream view.Post-Keynesian economics, like Austrian economics, believes very much in the radical uncertainty of the future. Since action is always directed toward the future, and this state is unknowable, then the concept of equilibrium is self-contradictory.However, post-Keynesians differ with Austrians on matters of policy, because unlike Ausrtians, post-Keynesians do not believe in the existence of \\"forces\\" that mainstream theorists typically ascribe to the economic system. For example, post-Keynesians do not believe in the \\"law of substitution\\" which explains the effects of relative price changes. For every other economist (Austrians included), this law is fundamental. This is how markets are presumed to clear. If goods in one area are not used, their price will fall causing entrepreneurs to substitute them for other goods. This leads to full utilization and efficiency in production. Post-Keynesians disagree with this argument for many reasons. Without going into great detail, I can say that the various criticisms by post-Keynesians of this theory are all presented in this book, ranging from Joan Robinson to Pierro Sraffa and J. M. Keynes.Another interesting aspect of post-Keynesian economics is its emphasis on the \\"unevenness of the growth process.\\" The basic idea is that not all factors included in the growth process grow or expand at the same constant rate, and the recognition of this fact will reveal to one the causes of economic disruptions. Recessions, unemployment, and even inflation can all be explained by the unbalanced nature of economic growth.Two other important themes of post-Keynesian economics are the theory of pricing and the emphasis on \\"mark ups\\" and their belief in the endogeneity of the money supply.Post-Keynesian economics is a rich and controversial field of economic science. It is relentless in its criticism of mainstream theory, and it has succeeded in making very important positive contributions to economics in the form of a persuasive and seemingly complete alternative.Anyone interested in post-Keynesian economics should begin their study with this book."},{"Title":"Aphrodite (ancient manners)","review":"The prose is exquisite, the imagery sumptuous, an all around delightful reading experience.

Corey even goes so far as to explain how to farm and exploit people's email addresses, essentially giving a lesson in how to SPAM which is a definite no-no especially now adays. Since that time I've read many other Internet marketing books and many of them echo the themes and methods contained here. So for the beginning marketer this is a great entry into the world of ezines, newsletter marketing, autoresponders and how to build a mailing list. These are fundamental marketing tools and principles that are beyond doubt. But if you've been at it for any length of time you'll quickly find that much of this is now old hat. And the fact that it was written before the dot com bust, makes many of it's claims ring hollow."},{"Title":"The Insider Secrets to Marketing Your Business on the Internet","review":"This book is really full of common sense, but if you are new to web businesses, it may be of help but not worth the price tag.Mr. Rudl's website has several \\"ANNOYING\\" pop-ups that made me want to leave immediately.There are a lot of common sense themes in the book that can be found on any web-based business site, and a lot of the information is out-dated in my opinion.There is one good thing about the book though, and that's that it puts a lot of information together that would take a while to get on your own.In my opinion, Mr. Rudl is a good salesperson with good marketing skills. He makes his money by hawking his wares on his site, and it looks like he makes money by being an associate for other websites with \\"featured\\" products on his website.I don't recommend this \\"book\\"."},{"Title":"The Insider Secrets to Marketing Your Business on the Internet","review":"Corey Rudl provides an incredible amount of information for the newbie to Internet marketing in a &quot;down home&quot; casual sort of way. He admits up front that he doesn't have a PhD and he may not write 100% grammatically correct, but he will give you lots of useful information. True, he does market products his company either owns or partners with another organization, but he gives you so many ideas and strategies to market your business on the Internet that you feel as though you got your money's worth. However, even though the &quot;book&quot; is 650 pages, it is in two looseleaf binders, in a large easy to read font... if you were to print in a normal size font and print on both sides of each page, the book could easily fit in about a 150 - 200 page paperback that should reasonably sell for $20 - $40. But when you sell it on the Internet and can claim 650 pages in two volumes, it sounds like a lot more.

What you get are two looseleafs into which you insert several hundred typed pages that are replete with spelling and grammatical errors. And, while there is useable material here, you are paying $197 for a thinly veiled manual of huckstering numerous software programs which either pay Internet Market Center commissions or that they own outright. Much of this software is buggy, troublesome and poorly supported, and for the most part much better can be found elsewhere. Same for this so-called course. There is much better out there for much less. Among the numerous worthwhile sources of material are Webonomics, and Make Your Site Sell.

I also run/have run several of my own internet-based home businesses.I purchased the 2005 version of this book (shortly after Corey's unfortunate death) to see if there was anything that we could learn. Here's what I discovered:1. Most, if not all, of the information in the 2005 book was obtained as a result of testing for his own product, which is a manual on how to build an internet business. So, if you are in a similar business (hawking get-rich-on-the-internet-quick manuals), you would be the kind to get the most use out of this.2. The information is pretty standard stuff. There was virtually nothing in this manual that we didn't already know. BUT, our knowledge came as the result of having spent thousands and thousands of dollars sending people to SEO conferences and other general marketing conferences around the world, and spending millions in advertising with a/b testing. Granted, we know more as a result of actual experience than what is contained in Corey's book, but we certainly could have saved a lot of money by simply getting Corey's book first.That being said, I think that the information contained within is incredibly valuable, especially if you are new to business. And there is something about hearing it from somebody that knows (and paying a lot of money for it) that gets you up off your butt and doing something. My home businesses are improving because I finally decided to implement things that I know I should have done years ago. But until Corey told me to do it, I was just too lazy to.And even though much of the information is pretty basic stuff to someone like me, that doesn't make it worthless. But it becomes worthless if you get this book, decide it's no good and therefore don't implement any of the tactics. In that case, you will have bought yourself a pretty expensive space filler for your bookcase."},{"Title":"The Insider Secrets to Marketing Your Business on the Internet","review":"I thought this book was carelessly written...

In fact I'd go so far as to say that if you really follow all the advice in these manuals you'd have to try pretty hard not to make money as one of the first things they tell you is identify the market and then they get you to qualify your choice to make sure you really will find customers who want a product or service you will deliver.

It is accepted that Beaton's mysteries are somewhat short on \\"mystery\\" leaving her hopefully endearing characters to carry the interest in the narratives. As a result, it is harder to accept that after eleven installments, Agatha has not grown as a character nor as an amateur sleuth. In this latest novel, \\"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell,\\" Agatha has been stripped of whatever comedic touches she initially possessed. In the place of a gentle wryness about herself has mushroomed a seething hair-trigger temper that leads her to awkward outbursts, making her a very unsympathetic heroine. Perhaps the story is meant to illustrate that pursuit of an ill-fated love affair can distort or poison one's nature. I hope in the next installment that Agatha might revert to her former eccentric, more lovable, self. I hope so -- and in a mystery worthy of her."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"It seems like she just threw this book together; this plot does not live up to other books in the series and her characters are not as interesting as in other works in this series.

They are living in their own cottages and he seems to be having an affair with Melissa Shepherd - a glamorous newcomer to the village of Carsely. Then James disappears, having been attacked and Melissa is found dead. Agatha is immediately suspected as is the absent James.Sir Charles Fraith comes to Agatha's aid and together they try to find the murderer and track down the missing James. Both tasks prove difficult and dangerous. I enjoyed this story because it develops the relationship between Agatha and Charles as well as Bill Wong. There are plenty of suspects as no one seems to have liked Melissa very much even though on the surface she seemed quite charming.There are some dark undercurrents to the story though it can be read as light entertainment as well. I enjoyed it - even on second reading. Maybe not a good one to start with if you have not tried the Agatha Raisin series as you need to know a bit more about the main characters to understand all the nuances."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"I got hooked on this series when I was convalesing and then went on line to buy more of the series.

Agatha Raisin has pursued her next door neighbor throughout this series, and in the preceding volume, AGATHA RAISIN AND THE FAIRIES OF FRYFRAM had finally reached her goal. As always with Agatha's long held dreams reality does not live up to her fantasies. Far from the happily ever after that Agatha had envision she and James are still occupying their respective cottages, and despite her best efforts Agatha cannot become the domestic partner that James has apparently envisioned. Her housekeeping and cooking skills are sadly lacking but James is insistent that she return to the PR field where she excels. When Agatha finds James at the local pub with his former fling Melissa Agatha thinks that things cannot possibly get any worse but of course she is wrong. Things become decidedly worse when first James disappears under suspicious circumstances leading the police to regard Agatha as their chief suspect. When the second body appears Agatha finds her problems only increasing.Fans of this popular series of cozies will delight in reading about the marriage of the obviously ill suited pair but those unfamiliar with Agatha's on again off again romance will be able to make little sense of this one.

Usually when reading M.C.'s mysteries (I read the Hamish Macbeth series, as well) I don't really try to figure out who did it, like in an Agatha Christie novel. I am just along for the ride and visit to pages of old friends. This time I really did try to guess, but I never would have guessed right. I like that!And what's up with Sir Charles? How does he fit into the picture? Well, I'm still wondering about that one, but after this latest adventure I'm not so sure that he's the shallow snob I once took him for.Loyal fans will once again be delighted to return to Carsley, and even first-time readers should enjoy the visit.

Before Agatha can take that in, she finds that the police think she's responsible for his disappearance since her and James had had a huge fight in front of everyone in the Red Lion before James disappeared. Then a woman is found dead in her home, and the police think James is responsible for that. Determined to clear her name and James', Agatha sets out to find the real killer.

Beaton mystery. Maybe the author is burned out and no longer has the energy to set up a scene (description of how the character got to that scene, what was the weather like, the set up that makes the reader feel he's right there with that character). This lack of atmosphere/setting seems to be very similar to Lilian Jackson Braun's latest books. I can deal with sloppy proofreading (not too happily) but I'd sure like to have some help in mentally picturing the characters moving about instead of reading mostly dialogue. I agree with many of the other reviews in that it's also a shame that Agatha has not developed one bit and that a lot of the humor has been replaced with nastiness. My suggestion to anyone who has not read an M.C. Beaton book (either the Hamish or Agatha series) is to start at the beginning and enjoy her earlier works."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"I was given the first Agatha Raisin book \\"Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death\\" and despite the title opened it up and quickly finished it. I have now become addicted to this series of English based murder mystery books. This is the 11th book in the series, number 18 - \\"Kissing Christmas Goodbye\\" is out in October.Agatha Raisin is a modern day Miss Marple - wherever she is there is a murder or two. But unlike an Agatha Christie novel the books also detail the emotional aspects of Mrs Raisin's life as well as the murders: her concerns for her appearance, friendships, loves etc.In this book we learn that her great achievement - her marraige to her long time love James Lacey (we have followed the romance from book 1) is not what she had hoped for. Indeed a woman he has an affair with is later found murdered and he then disapears. Mrs Raisin must fight to save her own and his name and she hopes her marriage.Although this is 11th is the series it could be read alone but would be greater enjoyed if the previous books had been read first."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"In this eleventh book of this amusing contemporary cozy mystery series, the lovelorn Agatha Raisin has a dream come true, as she is finally married to the love of her life, her neighbor, James Lacey. Alas, domestic bliss seems to be eluding Agatha, as her dream turns to ashes. When James and Agatha each thinks the other is turning a roving eye elsewhere, and it seems the marriage could not get any worse, James does a disappearing act, leaving Agatha to think the unthinkable when he leaves traces of blood behind. Naturally, under the circumstances, Agatha is a bit cranky. After all, she is the chief suspect.Agatha, as enterprising as always, begins to investigate her husband's mysterious disappearance with the help of her friend, Sir Charles Fraith. When the dead body of James' suspected lover turns up, the search to find James takes on new portents, as he is now a person of interest in the murder case. What follows is typical Agatha Raisin. There are many twists and turns, as Agatha, our ever engaging heroine, bumbles along as she tries to discover just who is up to no good. Fans of our heroine will not be disappointed.As always, the dialogue is laced with humor and moves the plot along at a brisk pace, and the book is peppered with a host of quirky, recurring village characters that entertain the reader. Agatha herself is entertaining as always, as she engages in her investigative efforts. This is a highly addictive series that makes its fans race off to get the next volume."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"Agatha keeps pulling me back; I cannot say that each book is better than the last, because that is not always the case, but I find myself wanting to be Agatha's cheerleader.She constantly makes bad choices, but I am not sure that she does it intentionally. She seems to be that person who always fails at doing the right thing. For instance, the in ink is barely dry on her marriage certificate to James Lacey when already the marriage is over. Agatha is just too independent to be married to the demanding James, so when their small community witnesses a very public argument and then James turns up missing with blood on his front doorstep, Agatha is most assuredly the prime suspect. Nevertheless, there is more to this story since James himself seems to have a wandering eye and the town knows about that too.Now it is up to Agatha to find James, prove her innocence, prove that James did not murder the trollop that he was rumored to have been having a not so clandestine affair with and tie it all up in a neat bow so she can move on with her life.I know it sounds like just another day in Agatha's life, but somehow this book is just a little bit different. Agatha comes across as bit more human, a bit less assured and possibly a bit more likeable, even if she does have hard cruel bearlike eyes.As I have said before, you really do have to begin these books at the beginning to get the full Agatha affect. Some are better than others; some leave you wondering what goes on in Agatha's mind, but in the end, she is an endearing character that makes you wonder what she could get up to next."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"This is not a marriage made in heaven, in fact heaven tried time after time to stop it before it got started. Agatha just wouldn't be put off. To bad that even into her fifties Agatha hasn't learned that she is a good person deserving of being treated with respect and affection. All the good advice of real friends just won't stop her.Unfortunately Beaton's love-starved sleuth discovers that married, James is just as distrustful, cold and unforgiving a clod as he was single. The bodies add up again, the police slow in solving the crimes and the usual friends show up to sniff out the real lady killer.

Beaton is my favorite author - I have all of her books - I so enjoy Agatha and her exploits - please write more"},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"If read as a standalone, this book would be a two or three-star effort for most readers. But if read in sequence, Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell provides unusually satisfying mysteries to solve and excellent character development that will make you glad you are a fan.For almost the entire series, Agatha Raisin has been attracted to James Lacey and the idea of having romantic male companionship. It's never quite clear how much is the one attraction versus the other. Agatha's friend, co-detective, and sometime lover, Sir Charles Fraith, has been so concerned that he insisted that Agatha seek an analyst to secure a cure.In recent series books, James Lacey has become ever more inaccessible and irritating. That tendency reaches its acme in Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell after James and Agatha marry at the end of Agatha Raisin and the Fairies of Fryfam. James flies off the handle if Agatha shows her usually messy ways (such as by turning his laundry pink by not sorting the colors), her lack of skill in the kitchen (with her preference for cheap microwaved foods), or her smoking. He often storms out without further explanation.Agatha feels diminished by James's constant disapproval and carping. Beyond that, James is keeping a large secret away from Agatha. Naturally, Agatha is cut to the quick when she learns that others know.In a fit of pique, Agatha takes on a temporary PR assignment with a local company . . . and drives a deeper wedge into the marriage. James and Agatha are soon living separate lives in their respective cottages . . . and spending time with sympathetic members of the opposite sex, creating even more hurt.Something has to give and it does. Agatha is pulled away from her PR triumph to find that James's cottage is open with blood everywhere. But there's no James. Soon his bloody car is also located. As Agatha investigates, she finds out many unpleasant facts about James that make her doubt the wisdom of marriage even more.There are cameos of James after he leaves the cottage, but those cameos raise more questions than they answer until near the book's end.Soon, James's former lover, Melissa Sheppard is found dead by Agatha. Convinced that James being missing and this death are related, Agatha pushes her investigation in both directions with the help of Sir Charles Fraith. But progress is slow: She mainly discovers a lot of very undesirable people . . . many of whom seem to have good motives for killing Melissa, but none for James.The red herring clues point in all directions and create a satisfying mystery to solve for most of the book. You'll tumble onto the solution before Agatha will, but only because M. C. Beaton gives you lots of hints just before the solution is revealed.But the biggest mystery of all is what will happen to Agatha and her marriage. M. C. Beaton keeps you hanging until almost the end on that one.Those who enjoy the Agatha Raisin series for its humor, wit, and drollery will be disappointed in this book. It's a serious mystery that looks mostly at the dark side. But if you are open to more than one style of mystery, Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell will be one of your favorite Agatha Raisin books (along with Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death).As you read the book, think about how much or how little you know about the people in your life.

She has finally married the man of her dreams (or so she thinks), James Lacey, but marriage is not all that she thought it would be. It seems that Agatha is not the kind of housewife that James had been hoping for (she turns his laundry pink, serves him microwave meals, and smokes in the house) and she soon begins to feel lonely and depressed. Just when Agatha thinks she cannot tolerate him for another second, James disappears leaving only blood behind. Frantic, Agatha turns to friend, Sir Charles Fraith, to help her discover what has happened to her new husband. Her chief suspect is James' ex-lover, but when she turns up murdered, James becomes the prime suspect. Determined to not only find her man, but also to prove him innocent of murder, Agatha sets out on a suspenseful mission of murder and mayhem.Every book in this series just gets better and better! Even though I find the character of James Lacey despicable, I feel that he is one of those characters that we just love to hate. He is mean, selfish, and hard to please, but yet Agatha tries to win his affections and attention over and over again. This may shed an unkind light on Agatha for some, but I believe that this goes along with her inherit character flaw of having low self-esteem. To combat this, Agatha puts herself in many precarious situations and butts her nose in other people's business at every turn. She is so successful at her blundering that each time Agatha solves the mystery and catches a murderer! She picks up more depth of character with each book, and readers of this series quickly become fans of this high-spirited, yet warm-hearted soul.The first book in this series is \\"Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death\\". Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"I have thought that Agatha Raisin would be better off with Sir Charles than with James Lacey for the last three books in this series....well, she doesn't exactly wise up to this break through, but she does stop pining for James, and about time, too!!!

She finally succeeds, but after the honeymoon, James begins to criticize everything Agatha does, from her desire to work to her smoking to her clothing. The marriage disintegrates and Agatha moves back into her cottage next door to James.One day James turns up missing, and blood is found all over his car and house. At first the police suspect Agatha, but that changes when the woman James is dating turns up dead. Law enforcement now believe that James killed Melissa before vanishing. Agatha disagrees and, accompanied by Sir Charles, tries to find out who really murdered Melissa.AGATHA RAISIN AND THE LOVE FROM HELL is a fascinating tale of greed, insanity, and revenge. Agatha is a firebrand, not afraid to speak her mind even when it offends someone else. The mystery is solved using a slow, systematic sleuthing style supplemented with a touch of guesswork and luck. Readers will enjoy this tale especially due to its stunning climax.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"I've read every book in the series as well as the H. MacBeth series.I haven't finished this title yet but agree with other reviewers regarding the lack of proofreading. I was even stymied as to why this book would be listed under &quot;Women-detectives-England-NORFOLK and not Glous. or Warwickshire.&quot;A.R. and the Love From Hell is a bit darker than the others in the A.R. series and so far (up to p. 172) there is no humor at all."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"How in the world anyone can believe that M.C. Beaton is only one writer is beyond me. I have read all of the titles by Beaton (including the Hamish Macbeth series) and am thoroughly confused by &quot;Agatha Raisin And The Love From Hell.&quot; Did Roy Silver(Agatha's ad agency cohort) actually write this book (which obviously had no editor)? While Roy Silver wrote this book, was he suffering from a brain tumor? True Agatha Raisin fans will know what I am talking about here! I am a great fan of Beaton's, but this offering is so stereotyped and shallow that if I were the true author I would hang my head in shame. Agatha deserves better treatment at the hands of her creator than this. There is one up-note in all of this, James is gone, hopefully for good. Could the REAL M.C. Beaton please stand up?"},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"The title says it all--Agatha and James DO have a love from hell. Beaton foreshadowed their bad marriage in the previous book, but I still wasn't prepared for it.I didn't find this book funny; instead I found it consistently depressing. That Agatha and James would never take even the smallest attempts to communicate. That they both turned to the attentions of others IMMEDIATELY when their marriage was troubled. That James went into hiding without any consideration for the emotional, nor the legal, burden he put on his wife. And how quickly Agatha plunged into the self-recriminations of the emotionally battered.The only thing I respected about this plot was that, when you think about it, it is completely believable the two would have a good marriage. However, both characters were intelligent and plucky enough to have made an exciting and adventuresome pair of sleuths, on equal footing. I agree with a previous reviewer who wondered why Agatha hasn't grown more as a character. It would be nice to see her recover her charm in any future books, but it will still be somewhat disappointing that she's back to the same old lifestyle as 10 previous stories.What's so bad about a good marriage that writers can't seem to find it entertaining? You would think with the history of detective teams consisting of two MEN, that a writer could stretch the idea to fit a happy marriage--as in the Thin Man."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"The beloved Agatha Raisin has her hands full in this 11th installment of her cozy adventures. Two psychopaths, a wayward husband, and a battle with God Himself spice up Agatha's life as she runs the gamut of emotions from grief to anger.As a devoted fan of this rascally British matron since she made her first appearance in &quot;Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death,&quot; I felt for her as she suffered through an incredibly disastrous marriage to longtime love James Lacey, anguished over his disappearance, and didn't know if he were dead or alive.In order to solve the mystery surrounding James, Agatha teams up with friend Sir Charles Fraith who retains all the gentlemanly charm yet outright stinginess readers have come to expect. Old friends like Mrs. Bloxby, Bill Wong, and Ron Silver also appear as Agatha tries to come to terms with the mess James has made of her life.Be prepared for some laugh-out-loud moments as Agatha's rudeness and irritability lead to some comic moments with suspects as well as the parents of Bill Wong whom we met in earlier adventures.Longtime fans will stand up and cheer as a stronger, more secure Agatha emerges at book's closing. The only question I had while reading was the same one I have had in all the books so far....just what does she see in James Lacey?"},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"Whether or not you enjoy this latest Agatha Raisin mystery novel is going to depend on just how much affection you have for Agatha, and how much of a fan you are of this series and M. C. Beaton's style of writing. I'll admit to be a staunch Agatha Raisin fan, so my feelings about the latest Agatha Raisin mystery novel are probably a little biased. If you're curious about how Agatha and James' relationship will pan out, then this latest novel, &quot;Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell&quot; will probably entertain; however if you're looking for a really good 'cozy' murder mystery set in the country, this book may be a bit of a disappointment.Agatha and James are finally married. But it's turning out to be the marriage from hell, as James constant criticism wears away at Agatha's self assurance and leaves her miserable. Their fights are grist mill for the village, and matters go from bad to worse when James suddenly sets up a flirtation with one of his old flames, Melissa Shepherd. And then James disappears, his house is in a mess, and there is a blood stain at the doorstep. And Agatha finds herself to be the chief suspect in her husband's disappearance. Worried about James and determined to clear her name, Agatha sets out to find James, but stumbles across Melissa's dead body instead. And now Agatha has find James and prove that he had nothing whatsoever to do with Melissa's murder. Has James's disappearance anything to do with Melissa's murder? Where can James have got to? And is he still alive? Grimly, Agatha clings to the hope of finding James alive as she begins one of the most important investigations of her life.Mystery wise, this latest Agatha Raisin mystery novel is a little frustrating. The plot does not unfold smoothly, but in a rather circuitous manner instead, that almost mirrors Agatha's depressed and numb frame of mind. Agatha and her sleuthing friend, Sir Charles Fraith, move to and fro between suspects, uncovering bits of information that paint a rather alarming picture of Melissa, but which land them no closer to a solution to the problem at hand, until the last few chapters where Agatha makes an intuitive guess and hits the jackpot. Entertaining perhaps, but the solution blindsided me -- perhaps I should have read the book more carefully. On the other hand, I've been dying to see how the marriage between James and Agatha would pan out, and how long it would take before Agatha admitted to herself that James did not have what it took to make an ideal husband. Some fans have complained that Beaton had changed James from a charming and distinguished man to a short tempered fiend. However, James has never really treated Agatha well, even in the first few books. So that his descent into husband from hell did not really surprise me. I just kept waiting for Agatha to wake up before it was too late.What makes &quot;Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell&quot; so very, very readable, is of course its heroine. Fractious, yet endearing, one cannot help but hope that Agatha will find the happiness and companionship she so desperately craves. And Beaton's ironic prose style frames Agatha's quest for happiness brilliantly. And this is what will definitely propel me into reading the next Agatha Raisin mystery novel."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"Agatha has finally married James Lacy, the man of her dreams. But, all is not as rosy as she would like. James and Agatha have retained their separate cottages, and James complains about everything Agatha does, her makeup, clothes, hair, and cooking. Anyone who has read any of these books, knows Agatha can't cook and the other things are part of her. Rightfully, she is depressed and confused. Then, James starts to spend alot of time with a local divorcee, Melissa Sheppard, and she suspects him of having an affair. He thinks she has restarted her affair with Sir Charles. They have a couple of blowout fights in front of the whole village. Agatha takes her life back and takes a temporary public relations job. James is furious and they are barely speaking. Then one night, James is missing, there's blood on his doorstep, and Melissa is found dead in her house. James of course is the main suspect with Agatha a close second. Agatha knows that she did not do it, and of course James didn't, so naturally she and Charles have to find James and the killer.This was an incredibly fast read, and one of the best of the series, so far. I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"but drags when you're in misery, which Agatha seem to be. Agatha is a little bet testy in this fare. She's more apt to take offense at the least thing said. But who could blame her? Her marriage to James, a dream fulfulled, has turned into a nightmare. James nags at this, he nags at that. Agatha doesn't seem to be able to do anything right. All this nagging leads to public displays between James and Agatha. The final straw comes when Agatha finds that James has confided in ex-flame Melissa, a secret that will have a great impact on James' life. Agatha has had enough, but matters are taken out of her hands when James disappears and then his ex-flame is found murdered. Could these two events be connected? Agatha, with the help of Charles embark on a journey into Melissa's life to see who would have wanted her dead. Along the way, Agatha hopes to find clues to where James can be found.

This has a bittersweet ending which should prove satisfying to Agatha's many fans."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"Please don't over-analyze Agatha - the charm of Agatha Raisin lies in her utter lack of it. Pugnacious and relentless Agatha loves life as she sees it and changes what does not suit. Her ambition to marry her neighbor James Lacey has been realized but happily ever after has not. This reader has often thought a duplex or the house next door might be an excellent aid to domestic harmony, but Agatha manages to annoy and isolate herself and drive her new husband into the arms of another woman. Or, did she? When James turns up missing, the overly thrifty Sir Charles Firth joins Agatha to solve the mystery. As they chase about the lovely Cotswolds, Agatha and Charles come upon some amazing characters as she investigates and simultaneously handles a successful PR campaign, makes a new rock band famous and raises a bundle for the Carsley Church.Ms. Beaton delivers a light hearted anti-romance-mystery, sketches a wonderful sense of place, some totally odd ball characters, gets the dialogue just right and does it neatly and concisely - with humor and delight.

Moreover she's human -- vain, silly, romantic. She's also smart and sassy and independent. Love from Hell is another in a long series of Agatha mysteries, and reads are good as the first ones."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell","review":"This entry opens with our Agatha newly married at long last to her handsome neighbor James Lacey. Agatha's fans will not be suprised that James's explosive temper and fault-finding only increase after the marriage, and that Agatha's low self-esteem will only allow her to take so much verbal abuse before she explodes in defense and starts breaking dishes. Of course, some Carsely villagers overhear their rows, and see Agatha shriek at James when she finds him canoodling sexy new villager Melissa Sheppard in the pub. So Agatha is the natural suspect when James disappears suddenly and Melissa is found murdered shortly thereafter. Lightweight baronet Sir Charles Fraith returns here, and is unexpectedly attentive and thoughtful (could he actually be growing up?), and helps Agatha investigate. Greed and madness prevail in the solution. Of course, the main point is not the mystery (although it's a rattling good plot, and could stand alone without the added delight of Agatha's personal misadventures). Regular readers will want to know that James is NOT dead, but was suffering from a brain tumor (is this supposed to excuse his swinish behavior?), which is miraculously cured when he stumbles into a French monastery. Even the brain tumor isn't enough for me to develop any affection for the chilly James, who over the past books in the series has developed into just another sexy jerk. Personally, I'm delighted Agatha may get out of this disastrous marriage, and I'm eager to see if younger man Charles develops enough as a mensch to qualify as a legitimate future love interest for my favorite affection-starved heroine. As with each previous entry, I simply could not wait for the next installment in Agatha's adventures!

It is a very readable, well translated work with some colorful illustrations focusing on a 4 year portion of the major Chronicles written by the 13th century English monk Matthew Paris. It may look like light reading or a coffee table book, but it is for students and lovers of Medieval History who already possess a basic knowledge of the events Paris chronicles - the rebellion of Simon de Montfort, the crusade of Louis IX, the 4 sisters from Provence who became Queens (France, England, Queen of the Romans [Germany], and Sicily), etc. It is not for beginners, but a delight for the erudite !"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Chronicles of Matthew Paris: Observations of Thirteenth-Century Life (History/Prehistory and Medieval History)","review":"I have to wonder what the publisher's intentions were with this book. It does seem to have been aimed at a general audience: with its large format, glossy stock, and color photos, it's something of a coffee-table book. And the fact that the editor has only included what he reckons as one-sixth of Matthew Paris' chronicle makes it of limited use to specialists. Therefore, if judged on its intentions, I have to say that it fails, for two reasons.First, as a previous commenter has noted, it's dull. It's very, very boring. There is very little here of interest to the general reader. This is due to the author's interests, as well as the nature of the genre. Matthew Paris was a monk in an abbey, and as such he was greatly concerned with ecclesiastical business; consequently, a great deal of his chronicle is devoted to ecclesiastic abuses and machinations which are very difficult to follow if you aren't a specialist. Another big drawback is that medieval authors rarely went into the kind of detail that modern readers find interesting. It can be maddening. MP will often write something like \\"F. did something so outrageous that it's unfit to mention here\\". I've been reading this kind of literature for years in preparation for writing a novel, so I know that MP is not unique in this. All medieval literature is pretty dull. Chronicles in particular are usually dull; imagine the result if you watched the nightly news and then wrote your own brief summaries of the day's events. That's pretty much what MP's chronicle was.Finally, I was disappointed by the illustrations. They are not related to the text, so they can't really be called illustrations. Many of them are not reproduced at adequate size, or sufficient magnification, so you can't really see their details. These often seem fuzzy, as well. It seems that many of the images that are reproduced at adequate size are generic, almost abstract representations of cities which really provide no useful information about what the particular city looked like."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Chronicles of Matthew Paris: Observations of Thirteenth-Century Life (History/Prehistory and Medieval History)","review":"The journal of a monk, Matthew Perry, was preserved, translated,and chopped up. Some pieces were then placed in a book for publication.

Some of the authors of the short stories include Octavia Butler, Gwyneth Jones, Leslie Stone, Kate Wilhelm, Pamela Zoline, Lisa Tuttle, Pat Murphy, and James Tiptree Jr. Critical essayists include, not in order, Lisa Yaszek, Josh Lukin, Wendy Pearson, Joan Haran, Veronica Hollinger, Andrea Hairston, and L.

If you have ever read Octavia Butler \\"The Evening and the Morning and the Night,\\" you will relish the companion essay, 'Praise Song to a Prophetic Artist,' by Andrea Hairston. Paving the way for future feminist writers and thinkers, these authors represent a rich composite vein to be mined at will.

Fantastic!"},{"Title":"Eleven Blue Men","review":"Although these stories of medical detection date back to the forties and fifties, they are a fascinating introduction for juveniles interested in forensic medicine and the sciences."},{"Title":"Distant Voices: Uncovering a Forgotten Past for a Changing Church","review":"Before Leonard Allen's publication, I am not aware of a book on the Restoration Movement that is written with such clarity and simplicity. It is apparent that he researched the subject well and been able to provide concise quotes from the Restoration leaders to give the reader an accurate synopsis of these historical men and women.He has given a wonderful account of the Restoration Movement and the beginnings of the &quot;church of Christ&quot; heritage. His style is easy to read and understand.In the beginning of the book, he reminds us of our selective memory and uses examples to illustrate his point. He then applies this to how we have remembered, or have had stories handed down to us through the generations, only certain parts of the &quot;church of Christ&quot; heritage.The book is refreshing reading and has called me to look at the Scriptures with a clearer perspective. It has also convicted me that the Restoration Movement is still alive and there still parts of the church that are to be restored.I have also used the book as the basis for an adult class at church--it has been a rewarding study for me and the class members as well."},{"Title":"The Feverbird's Claw","review":"I cannot remember why I picked up The Feverbird's Claw, but am I ever glad I did! This was one of the best children's fantasy books that I have read in quite a while. The world is imaginative (as opposed to the highly derivative works that so many other authors tend to write; no elves/dwarves/werewolves/whatever in this world!), the characters compelling, and the protagonist's growing understanding of the complexity of her world and shades of right and wrong is wonderfully executed.The book centers around Moralin, a citizen of the city of Delagua, who one day sneaks outside the walls at the behest of her peers and has the bad luck to be abducted by the Arkera, a neighboring tribe. The Arkera spare her life because they admire her courage (against tradition, she was trained to fight by her grandfather Old Tamlin), and she finds herself forced to join their tribe, although she never gives up dreaming about escaping back to her home. At last she has the chance to escape, and the rest of the book follows her return to Delagua (and her dawning realization that the world is not quite as simple as she originally believed).I highly recommend this book; although violence and death are certainly a part of this world, they do not dominate the story the way they do in a lot of other fantasy. The world is fascinating, the characters interesting, and the ending highly satisfying. A great read for kids and adults alike."},{"Title":"The Feverbird's Claw","review":"I would recommend this book to 12-13 year olds. I liked this book because of the message it tells you about never giving up. I gave it 3 stars because it was boring and confusing at some parts, but I loved it all the same."},{"Title":"The Feverbird's Claw","review":"I am a great fan of Jane Kurtz.The Feverbirds Claw was a very good book.It tought you things like,You can make friends with someone who is different,don't judge them for how they look, to be a good friend no matter what,and that you can face you fears on matter how scarey,how hard they look and seem. This is a good book that I think a lot of young readers will really like"},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Design with UML and Java","review":"Great book, however we're using EclipseUML which seems to be more widely used now. It would be nice to be written with that program in mind. Also would be nice if it was converted to American English. Some analagies are hard to understand if you're not familiar with Brittish colloquialisms. Also, author uses Textio class to do outputs. Why not just use the System classes? Seems unnecessary to me and an extra level of confusion for beginners."},{"Title":"USSR: From an Original Idea by Karl Marx","review":"This is a story of the USSR which is no longer there (except for its people who remain unchanged since 10 or 20 years ago).Today, you don't have to pay a doorman to get into a restaurant, and floors at Moscow metro are no longer &quot;fit to eat off&quot;. However, old ladies in the street will still reproach you for wearing no hat in winter, and your new Russian friends will still make detailed inquiries about your salary and incomes of other &quot;typical&quot; people in the West.This informal guide to the USSR is very accurate and well-researched and the authors have remarkable attention to every breathtakingly ridiculous detail of life in the State of Workers and Peasants.If you have never been to the Soviet Union, you will think that some of the things described there are too grotesque to be true.If you know the Soviet Union well, you will be astonished by the depth of the authors' knowledge; then you will be laughing out loud as, page after page, you recognize one Soviet idiocy after another.In addition, the authors offer structured explanation of the things you knew only empirically: i.e., brotherly nations are those which embraced socialism; progressive nations are those which have not embraced socialism but are not capitalist either because they are still working their way through feudalism; hard currency is a currency of any nation which is neither brotherly or progressive.You will read this book in one evening, even if this means reading until 3 a.m. You will then regret that you got through it so quickly.This book is a rare combination of first-class writing talent, honesty, humour and a subject matter which ought to be handled only by a writer who is capable of not taking even the grimmest issues seriously."},{"Title":"USSR: From an Original Idea by Karl Marx","review":"This book is absolutely hilarious. If you have ever been to pre- or post-perestroika Russia, you simply must read it.Essentially, the book is a tour guide, but one designed to be read (at least to get the full impact of the humor) after you have been to Russia. I could not count the number of times I found myself saying, &quot;That's exactly right!&quot; or &quot;It happened to me to!&quot;.The humor lies totally in the fact that the authors write in an very subtle, straightforward way that makes the &quot;quirkyness&quot; of many Russian customs and traditions seem side-splittingly funny. For example, you are provided with the step-by-step process for bribing your way past the doorman at a restaurant. Or the description of borshch, the beet soup whose &quot;purple coloring will transfer itself readily to fingers, clothes and subsequent bowel movements.&quot; (Probably the only example of bathroom humor in the book). The authors are both British, and this is reflected in the understated style of humor in the book.Once again, do not miss this book!"},{"Title":"USSR: From an Original Idea by Karl Marx","review":"A really wonderful book filled with wry humor about the tourist experience in the Soviet Union circa 1980s. As someone who spent a few weeks traveling around the USSR in the early 1980s, I can verify that this book is right on the mark for capturing the true Felliniesque experience. While that time and place is entirely relegated to already dusty history books, this book (if you can find an old copy) will bring back the experience and a smile.Everything is here: from the matronly dezhurnayas at Moscow's now-razed Rossiya Hotel ... to the heavy-handed comments of the Intourist guides ... the nearly identical Museums of V.I. Lenin in every city and town we were dragged to (including some really shabby ones in provincial places) ... to wandering the city streets unguided on the days you snuck away from the group ... to buying food products or a consumer item in a regular (non-hard currency) shop around town ... to visits to small provincial cities and rural towns ... and so on.This book is a great time capsule of the experience of those days. Buy this book, if you can find it."},{"Title":"USSR: From an Original Idea by Karl Marx","review":"I read this book back in undergrad but had long ago forgotten the name of the title and authors. The content was completely unforgettable though, and for many years I wished I had my own copy. I found this on-line and took a chance that it was the one.I was delighted to find that yes, this is the book that features a flow-chart on how to stand in line to buy an item: Do you know what the item is for? -> no -> Get in line anyway; Do you have any practical use for the item? -> no -> Get in line anyway; Are you a veteran or a Hero of the Soviet Union? -> yes -> Remain stubbornly at the back of the line for ten minutes -> Abuse everyone else in line -> Go to the front of the line.This is the book that has such great lines as \\"superficial pleasantries are to be avoided, not so much because they are superficial as because they are pleasant\\" and \\"smoking is banned in public places, not for health reasons but for disciplinary reasons.\\"The brilliance of this book wd probably be lost on those who are too young to remember the USSR during the Cold War, when we were us and they were them, but for those who traveled there during that time, they will find that this book nails all the endearing and infuriating idiosyncracies of the USSR with a humor as only the British have.

Gonzalez, whom Sandra McPherson refers to as a &quot; poet of two nations,&quot; brings us deep into worlds within worlds in Mexico. These are beautiful and penetrating pieces--they will make any poetry lover feel that amid the current wave of uninspired and unchallenging poetry, a poet with a unique voice and perspective appears. The poet Ai has made the right decision in picking this collection for the National Poetry Series. Finally, finally, a poet that poets can love and follow.

Check out that man who distributes nightmares poem."},{"Title":"So Often the Pitcher Goes to Water Until It Breaks: POEMS (National Poetry Series)","review":"Throughout this stunning book of poems, the reader is fitted with a yoke of great psychological weight. &quot;So Often the Pitcher Goes to Water Until it Breaks&quot; is a recollection of violence and those who have lived and still live in a time of violence. The voices of the book are survivors in a landscape populated by so many silent bodies. Gonzalez gives voice to them. An act so necessary, so stunningly accomplished and crafted. Poems such as, &quot;Mortician's Secrets,&quot; tell the stories of those who are otherwise forgotten. These poems also serve as transformative agents. Violence, though still terrible, becomes a tool for a grandmother to teach her grandson to read Spanish in one of the poems. This book and its profound obligation to these survivors, their landscape, and their loves leave this reader with a feeling of grief and wonder. These are not sparse two-dimensional photographs of people and moments to be tucked away in a shoebox. . . these poems are a gaze through the lens of nostalgia itself."},{"Title":"So Often the Pitcher Goes to Water Until It Breaks: POEMS (National Poetry Series)","review":"I am amazed how this poet manages to find the beauty in his community; how he manges to shape the darkness, like clay, scattered throughtout the experiences of people often left out of American literature. Fieldworkers, widows, migrants all are given room to exist on the page. The lives of these people are explored and reconstructed in a manner that doesn't scream &quot;victim&quot;. Instead, the poet makes the reader aware of the almost casual beauty surrounding these characters. It is this insistence on protraying these characters in an &quot;honest&quot; light without injecting ethnocentric values into the poems that makes the poems resound, even after the pages rest on the shelf. These poems remind me of a line by Paul Monette--&quot;people who were always singing and we were the song&quot;. Other Chicano poets have, lately, failed to remember in a way that seems new. Gary Soto, Alberto Rios, and Lorna Dee Cervantes, to me, are the holy trinity of Chicano poetry because they posses the tools of the poet: craft, beauty and a community to write about. Rigoberto Gonazlez will join the ranks of these three."},{"Title":"So Often the Pitcher Goes to Water Until It Breaks: POEMS (National Poetry Series)","review":"In the poem &quot;Philandera...&quot; the poet writes of &quot;crocheted creations...extended only with the failure of crops: six doilies bought a week's nixtamal; a tablecloth kept even the chicken feet fat.&quot; This metaphor-izes how I felt about this marvelous collection. When one is feeling low for some reason, one can read these poems to still feel the beauty of the universe, in those details right under one's nose. A hint of sadness lingers throughout the book, only to heighten the redemption found in lucidity. If one sees as this poet does, one can never become nihilistic. Rigoberto Gonzalez's poems are &quot;crocheted creations&quot; which are like his Morelos: &quot;puckered and kissable.&quot;"},{"Title":"So Often the Pitcher Goes to Water Until It Breaks: POEMS (National Poetry Series)","review":"i'm surprised i haven't seen this writer in some of the country's top journals. this book is a great find. just take a look at poems like &quot;the slaughterhouse&quot; and &quot;day of the dead&quot;--this poet knows how to chill your bones with a fresh metaphor and an eye for the disconcerting image. these poems will shock you and please you in the same line."},{"Title":"So Often the Pitcher Goes to Water Until It Breaks: POEMS (National Poetry Series)","review":"This book is so mesmerizing!

In this book - for which he was awarded the Cervantes Prize, the most important prize of Spain - he combines the still virulent story of a returning exilee with the life of Joaqu&iacute;n Toesca, the Italian-turned-Chilean who constructed half Santiago's centre, including the Cathedral.This book tells us about the aftermaths of a dictatorship and the different paths people take afterwards. It is well written. But it also needs a certain understanding of Chilean history to be fully appreciated.Then again, this is simply good literature.

It provides information on how to form a group for the investigation of the paranormal, how to research haunted areas and much more. The advice is very practical and the author obviously has years of experience in this field. He provides details on the types of entities likely to be encountered, like ghosts, spirits or dangerous spirit creatures that are best left to an experienced exorcist. I found the sections on how to capture paranormal phenomena on film and how to record disembodied voices and sounds on tape particularly interesting, as these are easy to do with equipment that most people already have. What's more, it can be done anywhere as all walls and buildings contain some residue of recorded voices. Plenty of sources for material are provided, as well as contact details of organisations devoted to studying these phenomena. The book contains photographs, an appendix, a glossary, bibliography and index. It is a very thorough handbook for those who wish to pursue this rather unusual hobby."},{"Title":"How to be a Ghost Hunter (How To Series)","review":"I really hate so called 'experts' in the paranormal that believe their theories are truths and pass them off as such.

The author spends a great deal of time telling stories and actually very little on 'how' to hunt ghosts.Troy Taylor's Guidebook is much better.On the other hand, the forms in the back of the book are great starting points for creating your own tailored forms.

For someone who hasn't had years of experience in the paranormal, or criminal investigation some of the books available can be intimidating.

It would be interesting to know more about why certain pieces worked well in spirit investigations by explaining more of the scientific side. Also, I would have liked to have seen more equipment discussed (or dismissed and the reasons why) such as the EMF K2 meter and thermal imaging cameras.As a person that leans heavily to the side of scientific investigations and totally dismisses the physic \\"impression\\" aspect, I would be interested in hearing an actual physicist's take on what type of equipment might be utilized although I doubt that a physicist would place their name and reputation beside such an endeavor.Anyway, all in all, this is a good book written by a true believer.

This includes: reacting emotionally, avoiding risks, fighting under threat, spreading gossip, competing for status, dwelling on past successes, feeling more comfortable in small groups, drawing conclusions and fragmenting into small warring groups.In order to encourage cooperation, Robert suggests that appropriate behavior must be followed. This includes: establishing facts, taking risks, encouraging non-combative relationships, insisting on detailed analysis before judgment, practicing total open communication, recognizing achievement not status, learning from mistakes and choosing to work in cooperative groups.Robert Heller is a leading authority on management consulting.

This charming and entertaining tale for young readers is about a courageous little squeegy bug who doesn't know what type of insect he is or where he came from; he is looking for something special to distinguish himself from the other insects, until his quest leads him to wise spider, who gives the squeegy bug a starlight and gives him the name Firefly.

He wasn't an ant or a cricket or even a flea and he wanted to find his purpose in life. When he met Buzzer the Bumblebee, he decided he wanted to be special, just like him. But how could he find a pair of silver wings and a stinger? Buzzer tells Squeegy he'll have to touch the sky to get a beautiful pair of silver wings like his. So that's just what he tried to do. He spent three days climbing the tallest thing he knew of, a cattail, certain it must touch the sky. But on the third evening, he was caught in a terrible storm and saved from certain disaster by a very nice caterpillar, who took him in and gave him a place to sleep. The next morning, the two travel to the web at the very end of the cattail and consult with the all-knowing, Haunchy the Spider. Haunchy weaves Squeegy a beautiful pair of silver wings for his back. But there is no stinger. Instead, Haunchy reaches up and grabs the brightest star in the night sky, attaches it to Squeegy's bottom and names him Squeegy the Firefly, the Lamplighter of the Sky..... Originally published in 1946, Bill Martin Jr, Michael Sampson and Pat Corrigan have teamed up to create this new version of a timeless classic. Their gentle, magical, understated text is enhanced by their high-tech geometric illustrations and together they've authored an innovative and creative story that will mesmerize youngsters with its simple message and bright, bold, textured artwork.

I've kept them by my computer and occasionally dip into the deck, pull one out, and see if the colorful painting in some way inspires me in my writing. Now, with his new \\"A Little Every Day Decks,\\" creativity coach, writer, and psychologist Eric Maisel has given me an exciting new deck and a simple, easy-to-use program to spur creativity and inspiration. Each card contains a truth about creativity: \\"Grow creative by astonishing yourself\\" or \\"Grow creative by opening to serendipity,\\" for instance. The point of focus on each card is book-ended by ideas about the truth and then an exercise that can be done to enhance or change one's experience and accessing of creativity.In an introductory section, Maisel tells us, \\"You can read through the thirty cards in your deck, pick out the one that feels particularly resonant, and try the simple exercise the card suggests. You can use the cards as a thirty-day program, taking in one message a day....You can shuffle the cards, cut the deck and let a random (is it really random?) message speak directly to you.\\" All of these are good ideas, and once you've gone through the deck, I have a hunch it will pay off to go through it again. And again.I've been examining and pondering the meanings of the cards for a couple weeks now and have settled upon using one each day at random before I begin my writing. In just a little over two weeks, I find that each morning I am anticipating reading the next card. Often the idea contained within stays with me all day, firing me on to carry out my appointed tasks. The cards are not just for writers or artists but for anyone seeking to expand, explore, or open up channels of creativity. Highly recommended. ~Lori L.

They offer no mystery or excitement which, as a professional artist, is what impels me to work at all. I decided instead to make my own set of cards that resonate with my own personal style of getting inspired and getting down to work. I function better with abstract suggestions,so these cards were not useful. (But then, since they nudged me to create my own version, I can't really say they were a total bust!)

This forgotten book is a classic travel-adventure set in 1920 Peru. Hats off to Dixon-Price Publishing for resurrecting it. Pity that the copy-editing was not done a little more skillfully, as there are a number of typo's and mis-used homonyms in the book the product of unskilled use of computer spell checker.Still, this is a minor quibble. (A map would have been nice too). Harry Foster's casual employment in the mines, cities, and jungles of Peru are a classic of early 20th Century travel writing. Some might feel that his characterizations of Peruvian Indians, Peruvian &quot;Anglo's, and the Irish are a bit harsh. However, he presents a well-balanced narrative of the country, and its types. This lost world (the 1920's) is a rough and tumble time, gone forever. A great loss. Foster preserves those days for posterity through his colorful writing and astute observations of people and cultures.Many modern travel writers could learn from his unselfconscious writing style. The book never misses a beat. A combination of irony and genuine love of people, regardless of differing cultures, lifts this book out of the mundane. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The adventures of a tropical tramp","review":"The Adventures Of A Tropical Tramp is the travel narrative of Harry La Tourette Foster, who spent most of his life after the conclusion of World War I wandering the main roads and back roads of the world, from Mexico and South America, to Asia, the South Pacific, The Caribbean, and the Mediterranean.

Landing with no funds or resources, he took a series of odd jobs, eventually becoming a reporter for a Lima paper. He went on to join two missionaries trekking overland to the headwaters of the ..., then continued on adventure filled journeys down the ... tributaries.

This book asks the question - SHOULD everyone have the right to bear and raise children. After all, those who wish to adopt or foster children have to undergo very rigorous screening. Other people who wish to look after children, such as teachers for example, need to go through years of studying and training before they are able to take on the responsibility of educating children. But parents who bring children into this world - who are responsible for educating them, influencing them and generally affecting their futures - are not required to prove their ability at all. This book asks the basic question - should they be?This book has some provocative articles and asks some very uncomfortable questions. Examples are: should people with serious genetic defects be allowed to reproduce? Should contraception be made compulsory to prevent some people from reproducing? Why, or why not? What kind of legislation could or should be introduced? How effective would it be?As a mother I would would feel very uncomfortable and indignant even if anyone questioned my right and ability to be a parent. However, I am also aware of so many children being raised in institutions because their parents/family system cannot do so for a variety of reasons. Similarly there are so many children in society who are abused or neglected. Since many of these children will eventually be looked after by the public, via our taxes, institutions, teachers, nurses, social workers etc - shouldn't we be asking these uncomfortable questions?

The technique described works in my experience. The first half of the book is spent describing manga to an audience that doesn't not know it very well. I found myself skipping pages on Shojo, Sci-Fi and so on. To me, who has been reading and writing manga for years now, it was all review. When I got to the second half of the book which showed a few dozen techniques that I have been using in the past 6 months, I decided that it was a good book to have 6 months ago. If you haven't touched mouse to canvas, haven't scanned 20 pages of art into your computer, then this book will solve your problems before you have them. But if you're familiar with brush size, texture, layers, and opacity in the digital realm, you probably will only get a brief insight from this book. Tracing, filling with anti-aliasing, and so on are problems that digital developers face. The simple solutions that are obvious are the ones pointed to in this book.

A second reading modifies this somewhat. You get used to its odd twists and turns, its often unlyrical quality. Good things pop up here and there. If the narrative never gels, it does keep moving and winds up in an interesting place.The gooniness of \\"Cymbeline\\" is established early on. The title character, King of England just after a time of Roman rule, banishes from his reign Posthumus, husband of his only daughter, Imogen. Cymbeline is angered she did not choose her own stepbrother, the miserable Cloten. \\"Away!/Thou'rt poison to my blood,\\" Cymbeline demands. Exiled in Italy, Posthumus gambles rashly on Imogen's virtue and pays a steep price despite her faithfulness. While Imogen comes to grief, Cymbeline dispenses with Roman extortion and faces a massive invasion.\\"Cymbeline\\" has the feeling of a Shakespearean mash-up. You have the sundered young lovers from \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", a cruel assault on a good woman's virtue like \\"Othello\\", and a mad monarch a la \\"King Lear\\" who is twisted by a conniving queen who seems an even nastier variant on Lady MacBeth. There's also ghosts, a beheading, women disguised as men, and a left-field appearance by Jupiter to sort everything out.It's all too much, especially when presented by Shakespeare at a sometimes headlong, sometimes frustratingly talky pace. The story really goes off the rails when we meet a rustic man and his two young companions who turn out to be Cymbeline's lost sons. None of this feels grounded in reality, yet it doesn't really soar as fantasy, either. Many point out Jupiter's cameo as a low moment, though Cloten's transformation from comic butt to dead would-be rapist is more jarring.Cloten does have a couple of fun early moments, bragging about himself to two unctuous lords. One makes wisecracks as asides. \\"Would he have been one of my rank!\\" Cloten declares after a near-duel with Posthumus.\\"To have smelled like a fool\\" the sneering lord answers.A little later, Imogen takes heart at her sad situation: \\"Plenty and peace breed cowards; hardness ever/Of hardiness is mother.\\" Imogen and Posthumus are complex central characters, and in the old Pelican edition I have, Robert B. Heilman advances Imogen as one of Shakespeare's best-realized romantic heroines. Of the play itself, Heilman is understandably more guarded: \\"Nothing lags; nothing stands still\\".Nothing makes that much sense, either, but it's a ride worth taking if you are interested in Shakespeare making one-time use of a historical setting (Roman Britain) or the idea of him struggling circa 1609 to develop a new post-tragic dramatic form, the so-called tragicomedy, although it's more properly termed a romance and quite different from the later, more sophisticated works \\"The Winter's Tale\\" and \\"The Tempest\\".If you have the time, the patience, and the passion for Shakespeare, you may like \\"Cymbeline\\" more than me. But I doubt you will come away thinking it unfairly overlooked."},{"Title":"Cymbeline (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"Granville-Barker's prefaces to Shakespeare are highly regarded as the first such written from a theatrical (as opposed to literary) point of view. This approach pays particularly high dividends in dealing with this, one of WS's least appreciated plays. (I am currently appearing in a production of it in NYC -- in a small role.) Jan Kott, in describing &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; in the 60's, called it &quot;amazing and modern.&quot; Cymbeline, in the 90's, seems strikingly post-modern, and Granville Barker, writing in the 20's, accurately describes features of the play which speak strongly to our highly collage-like contemporary approach to art. Highly recommended (as is the Arden edition of the play itself, probably the most charming of all the Arden editions)."},{"Title":"Cymbeline (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"This book took almost two weeks to receive. Not to mention when I did finally get my copy in the mail, I was disappointed to see that the play skipped from Act II to Act V. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Cymbeline (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"\\"Cymbeline\\" is one of Shakespeare's last plays, and boasts more subplots than almost any other of the Bard's works. However, the resolution of this play brings all of the subplots together nicely in a satisfying (and convenient I admit) resolution that is one of the happiest endings in all of Shakespeare.By the way, I give \\"Cymbeline\\" a 4 star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.\\"Cymbeline\\" shares a lot in common with the play that Shakespeare wrote soon after it, \\"The Winter's Tale\\". Many readers don't like these late Shakespeare's but I love them as their themes of grace and redemption resonate mightily with me. The two male leads of both plays (Posthumus and Leontes) also share common traits, as both are quick to anger, rage, and willingness to believe the worst about their spouses. And both are the unworthy recipients of the redeeming power of forgiveness and grace.Act 2:4 is a highlight of this dizzying play as we get to see one of Shakespeare's lesser villains, Iachimo, toying with Posthumus, who believes he is a cuckold. Iachimo paints such vivid pictures in the jealous mind of this dupe that he backs Posthumus into a corner with sexual imagery. The cat enjoys toying with this mouse, and it makes for delightful reading!This play also boats the richly drawn character of Imogen, the daughter of the king of the title and wife to Posthumus. She is a great Shakespearean heroine, especially in Acts 3 and 4 of this play. In those two acts she is on par with \\"As You Like It's\\" Rosalind, who is in my opinion Shakespeare's greatest female creation. Imogen is almost too well drawn a character for this play, such is her vivacity and delight for the reader.Act 4:2 contains one of the more famous aspects of \\"Cymbeline\\", a very simple and touching elegy that is spoken over the grave of one of the characters. To my mind it is one of the best statements about death in all of literature. In fact, it is often quoted at funerals to this day. In context it is spoken by two brothers at the grave of their friend/adopted brother, and it is what every living soul hopes for the dead.This is a play that is not easy to read, and will require a commitment from you. With its large cast and many plotlines you cannot pick this text up at random. However, if you stick with it and focus on it you will experience a gem of the Shakespeare canon.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period. Well priced and well worth it."},{"Title":"Cymbeline (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"Cymbeline is one of the later Shakespeare plays that is rarely staged and probably even as rarely read. The plot has elements that are familiar from several of the earlier works and many of the characters borrow from more familiar characters in other plays as well. Nevertheless, Cymbeline is a rewarding play to either view or read. The Arden version that I recently read was useful but for the footnotes which focused on various usages and interpretations of the language over time which I found distracting and finally chose to just ignore. The play itself because of the familiar elements will appeal to those who have read the better known works. Cymbeline revolves around a layered plot that includes the devices of mistaken identity, evil and deception , unbridled ambition and political intrigue. It is a rather long play with 5 acts and 27 scenes. Having the benefit of seeing this well staged would enhance the reader's experience."},{"Title":"Cymbeline (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"My least favorite Shakespeare--long, tedious, boring and highly distasteful.

That's why I got it. Soon I shall read it. So there."},{"Title":"Cymbeline (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"Cymbeline was a British king in Roman times ( Augustus Caesar's time).Devices used in the Play:1) a woman plays a man/ boy role ( several of his plays : As You Like it,Twelfth Night))2) a deception by a villain to lie the virtue of a Lady ( Much Ado aboutNothing)3) Princes kidnapped and brought up as common men ( I don't know if heuses this in other plays)4) poison that causes a coma ( Romeo and Juliet)5) a Prince who is a vile fool ( used in his historical plays)6) a Queen who is a plotter and evil ( Macbeth)7) a Prince who kills another Prince and it redeemed by his hiddenidentity8) a Prince sentenced to hang by mistake9) a King who condemns his daughter wrongly ( King Lear)One wonders how much of this is historical fact and how much pure fiction.With all this scheming in the plot , it should be a very successfulplay.It is a total flop!What it comes out is seeming unreal and contrived.You get that happy ending feel that is so much in his comediesbut it has a very false feeling to it.That's probably why Cymbeline isn't performed much.If he hadn't gone for all these at once it might have worked, but theresult is that you see the playwright as ....If anyone wants to take the air out of a Shakespeare pedant,this is the play to do it with! He makes Shaw and Eugene O'neil llook good. He even make Rogers and Hammerstein and Gilbert andSullivan look better, ha, ha...This play is not Shakespeare's finest hour!"},{"Title":"Cymbeline (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"&quot;Cymbeline&quot; is my favourite Shakespeare play. It's also probably his loopiest. It has three plots, managing to drag in a banishment, a murder, a wicked queen, a moment of almost sheer pornography, a full-on battle between the Romans and the British, a spunky heroine, her jealous but not-really-all-that-bad husband, some fantastic poetry and Jupiter himself descending out of heaven on an eagle to tell the husband to pull his finger out and get looking for his wife. Finally, just when your head is spinning with all the cross-purposes and dangling resolutions, Shakespeare pulls it all together with shameless neatness and everybody lives happily ever after. Except for the wicked queen, and her son, who had his head cut off in Act 4.&quot;Cymbeline&quot; is, then, completely nuts, but it manages also to be very moving. Quentin Tarantino once described his method as &quot;placing genre characters in real-life situations&quot; - Shakespeare pulls off the far more rewarding trick of placing realistic characters in genre situations. Kicking off with one of the most brazen bits of expository dialogue he ever created, not even bothering to give the two lords who have to explain the back story an ounce of personality, Shakespeare quickly recovers full control and races through his long, complex and deeply implausible narrative at a headlong pace. The play is outrageously theatrical, and yet intensely observed. Imogen's reaction on reading her husband's false accusation of her infidelity is a riveting mixture of hurt and anger; she goes through as much tragedy as a Juliet, yet is less inclined to buckle and snap under the pressure. When she wakes up next to a headless body that she believes to be her husband, her aria of grief is one of the finest WS ever wrote. No less impressive is her plucky determination to get on with her life, rather than follow her hubby into the grave.Posthumus, the hubby in question, is made of less attractive stuff, but when he comes to believe that Imogen is dead, as he ordered (this play is full of people getting things wrong and suffering for it), he rejects his earlier jealousy and starts to redeem himself a tad. There's a vicious misogyny near the heart of this play, as Shakespeare biographer Park Honan observed, kept in balance by a hatred of violence against women. The oafish prince Cloten, who lusts after Imogen, is a truly repellent piece of work, without even the intelligence of Iago or the horrified panic of Macbeth; his plan to kill Posthumus and rape Imogen before her husband's body is just about as squalid and vindictive as we expect of this louse, and when a long-lost son of the king (don't even _ask_) lops Cloten's head off, there are cheers all round.Shakespeare sends himself up all through &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. I wonder if the almost ludicrously informative opening exposition scene isn't a bit of a gag on his part, but when a tired and angry Posthumus breaks into rhyming couplets, then catches himself and observes &quot;You have put me into rhyme&quot;, we know that Shakespeare is having us on a little. Likewise, the final scene, when all is resolved, goes totally over the top in its piling-on &quot;But-what-of-such-and-such?&quot; and &quot;My-Lord-I-forgot-to-mention&quot; moments.Yet the moments of terror and pity are deep enough to make the jokiness feel truly earned. When Imogen is laid to rest and her adoptive brothers recite &quot;Fear no more the heat o' the sun&quot; over her body, it's as affecting as any moment in the canon. That she isn't actually dead, we don't find out until a few moments later, but it's still a great moment.Playful, confusing, enigmatic, funny and shot through with a frightening darkness, this is another top job by the Stratford boy. Well done."},{"Title":"Cymbeline (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"This is probably one of the most outdated and misleading of the Arden editions. Nosworthy really doesn't like the play and dismisses it as an experiment leading up to _The Tempest_. Even his editing of the text is affected by his reading of the play. Only scholars who know something about Shakespeare should venture here."},{"Title":"Cymbeline (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"A combination of &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; &quot;Much Ado About Nothing,&quot; &quot;As You Like It,&quot; and &quot;King Lear?&quot; Well somehow, Shakespeare made it work. Like &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; we have a protagonist (Imogen) who falls under her father's rages because she will not marry who he wants her to. Like &quot;Much Ado About Nothing,&quot; we have a villain (Iachimo) who tries to convince a man (Posthumus) that the woman he loves is full of infidelity. Like &quot;As You Like It,&quot; we have exiled people who praise life in the wilderness and a woman who disguises herself as a man to search for her family in the wilderness. Like &quot;King Lear,&quot; we have a king who's rages and miscaculated judgement lead to disastorous consequences. What else is there? Only beautiful language, multiple plots, an evil queen who tries to undermind the king, an action filled war, suspense, a dream with visions of Pagan gods, and a beautiful scene of reconciliation at the end. While this is certainly one of Shakespeare's longer plays, it is well worth the time."},{"Title":"Cymbeline (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"Cymbeline is one of Shakespeare's least performed and least read plays. You do not stumble on it, you work your way through Shakespeare's opus and finally get there. The historical context is the war between Britain and the Roman Empire, and the action is hot and heavy, requiring five acts and twenty-seven scenes. Perhaps it is this complexity of plot that retarded Shakespeare's character development. Fewer lines have entered our lexicon from this play than most. Two exceptions are \\"the tongue is sharper than the sword,\\" and to have \\"a bellyful of fighting.\\" It is an excellent tragedy, however, combining elements of King Lear and elements of Othello. In its mystic elements it also resembles The Tempest.The core of the plot is the bet between Posthumous, the king's son, and Iachimo, who wagers ten thousand ducats that he can seduce Posthumous' wife, Imogen. Posthumous, in turn, wagers a ring that Imogen has given him that Iachimo will not succeed. Initially, we amused by the idea, but upon further reflection, it is clear that the gambit cannot have a happy ending. Either the seduction is successful, breaking up the marriage, or it isn't, in which case Iachimo will certainly claim that he has secuced Imogen, simply to win the ring. In the process he sets himself the Iago-like task of converting love to hate.The play is also full of classic Shakespearean gadgetry, including a potion that causes a trance resembling death, mystical soothsayers, the intervention of gods, women disguised as men, and a historical tableau which would have been familiar to Shakespeare's audience. It is a quintessential Shakespearean play, comprising nearly all of the classical elements of tragedy. If the plot could have been pruned, and the characters given more of the dimensionality that we expect from Shakespeare, Cymbeline would stand on a higher pedestal.The Folger Shakespeare Library's annotated edition is excellent. It provides just the right notation on the page facing the text, and can be studied or ignored to suit the reader's purpose."},{"Title":"Cymbeline (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"I think you're all missing the point (or a bunch of ringers from digireads.com).

They are proud, vain, and presumptuous. Cymbeline is merely stupid and he is allowed a happy old age.With Cymbeline, Shakespeare outdoes himself in his plots and subplots.The curtains lift on a conversation to bring the audience up to date on the situation. Cymbeline, King of the Britons, frowns. He is widowed, his sons are long dead, he remarried but his only living child and daughter Imogen refuses to marry the man he chose for her, Cloten, who is his stepson. Imogen loves Posthumus, a worthy man that he took in as a boy many years before. The lovers marry in secret and Cymbeline banishes Posthumus for it.Meanwhile, Cymbeline at the urging of his wife refuses to pay any further tribute to Rome. The Roman ambassador sadly has no choice: this means war.Then things get weird.In Rome, Posthumus boasts of his wife's virtue but is tricked into believing she betrayed him. Imogen disguises herself as a boy to avoid being killed by Posthumus who has sword revenge; then she meets an old man and his two sons, who are really Cymbeline's sons. That's right, they aren't dead.Cloten runs after Imogen wearing Posthumus's old clothes, but being a loudmouth and an idiot he also runs into the two sons, insults them, and is killed for his pains.The Romans finally arrive in force and lose, thanks to Cymbeline's sons and the old man, and Posthumus too. The queen dies, possibly of grief at losing her son, and reveals she never loved Cymbeline only his station and his power, which she was plotting to obtain for her son.Once all is revealed, Cymbeline in a genial mood forgives more or less everyone.He never realizes what a dunce he is. Cymbeline managed to lose not one but both his sons, then he falls for a woman who never loved him, he alienates his daughter, banishes the best soldier in his army, chooses an imbecile to marry his daughter and become his heir, declares war on Rome and wins through sheer luck. The man is completely clueless, and frankly Shakespeare never makes it obvious.Cymbeline contains some of Shakespeare's best standard bits: there is a lustful wife seeking power (like Lady Macbeth) a jealous husband (like Othello) long lost children (like in the Winter's Tale) ghosts (like in Hamlet) sleeping potions that mimic fatal poisons (like in Romeo and Juliet) heroic battles (like in so many plays) and attempts at adultery (like in Measure For Measure).It's too much. And yet, it is Shakespeare. He serves up spectacle rather than thought. If he can allow himself to create a popular comedy such as the Merry Wives of Windsor, why can't he create a plain drama full of complicated plots and elegant language all leading to a final battle, after which everyone surviving is forgiven? It's a play with a sad start, but with a happy ending.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Cymbeline (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"DO NOT GET THIS VERSION. It is a scam. Literally.

On my first visit to Milan, I was astounded to find a wide variety of foods that didn't include pasta and tomato sauce. And these new foods were wonderful.Only in the past twenty years or so have I started to notice that nearly every Italian restaurant has been branching out into the foods of other regions. First, there was just a choice of northern or southern Italian cooking. Now we are beginning to see foods from lesser known regions of Italy coming to the fore.A good summary of this book comes from the recipie for Sugo di Carne or Meat Sauce. The book says 'If your idea of 'meat sauce' is lots of tomatoes with a little meat, you're not thinking of the Piedmontese version. This sauce has tomato, but it's really about meat.'This is just one of the ninety five or so recipies included in this little book. They feature more beef, eggs, butter and cream than the more common (in America) Italian foods. This book brings a whole new range of Italian foods to your kitchen."},{"Title":"Cucina Piemontese: Cooking from Italy's Piedmont","review":"It's always been puzzling to me why the region I think produces Italy's best wines -- the Piedmont -- was so ordinary (at least by Italy's high standards) when it came to its food. The region does give the world the wonderful gift of delicate and precious white truffles, but aside from that it seemed to be an exercise in heavy beef and stew dishes, unexceptional pastas with butter-based sauces, loads of melted cheese, and a dependence on potatoes and other root vegetables.I picked up Cucina Piemontese on a recent trip to the Piedmont and while I doubt it will ever make me favor the ristoranti of Turin over the unforgettable osterie of Naples for eating well, it did give me a new appreciation for the cuisine of the Piedmont.The weak point of the book is that it is short on seductive images for the regions rolling landscape. It could also be cross referenced better, meaning it should be easier to find specific recipes in more different ways -- by the course, by the matching with wine, by the main ingredients, etc. Also, there appears to be a flaw in the binding of the edition I have, though this may be a one-off problem.In its favor, the recipes seem to be well thought out for preparation at home, and the translation from Italian is not flawless but it appears better than most. The book's real strong point is the context it gives to the region's maligned cuisine. It won't change the way the food tastes, but knowing that a recipe dates back to the royal House of Savoy, or that the cooks in Garibaldi's army favored it does create a new level of appreciation."},{"Title":"Schools Days Journal","review":"It just arrived today, so we haven't used it yet.

Written by three Cuban economists the book provides the insiders' view on the political economy of economic reform. It describes how the vision of a socialist-style market economy is far from realization and endangered by the rise of a dual economy in Cuba.The good thing about the book is that it gives a lot of practical feeling about the situation and stallmate of reforms in Cuba. A less positive thing is that it does not place itself within the context of economic analysis on transition economies. The book shows some of the radical sides to the Cuban way of transition, at the same time allowing us a glimpse of the vision of how Cuba in theory could converge on a modern welfare state - that is - if the prescribed reforms can be carried out in practice."},{"Title":"Hawks on Hawks","review":"Even if you have seen Hawks interviewed on &quot;The Men Who Made the Movies,&quot; or have read other interviews with him, HAWKS ON HAWKS is still quite interesting and enjoyable.

It started off so well - and descended into a murky mess where the narrative was following at least four men and two women, but a new section would start saying \\"He . . . blah blah blah\\" or \\"She . . . blah blah blah\\" and you'd have to look half or three quarters of the way down the page to which out which particular he or she was the focus this time, and I didn't personally think there was anything gained by not identifying the character more quickly. I wanted to know what was going to happen to the characters so I kept reading but at the end I thought maybe my instinct to throw it against the wall halfway through might have been more satisfying. This book does seem dated - it was published in 1984 although I would have thought it was published in the 70s, could have been written in the 70s of course. I guess overall I'm just so disappointed between what to me felt like so much promise at the start of the book to get to know or observe or comprehend a character I have nothing in common with and feeling at the end that none of the characters seemed believable at all, even though the two writer characters were both writing thinly disguised versions of their lives and of other characters in the book - making you wonder if the author hadn't used a similar practice. But then why would they feel so phony?"},{"Title":"OF PLYMOUTH PLANTATION, 1620-1647","review":"\\"In this precious volume...is told the noble, simple story 'of Plimoth Plantation.' In the midst of suffering and privation and anxiety the pious hand of William Bradford here set down in ample detail the history of the enterprise from its inception to the year 1647. From him we may learn 'that all great and honourable actions are accompanied with great difficulties, and must be both enterprised and overcome with answerable courages.'\\" (Roger Wolcott, Governor of Mass., 1897)What American isn't familiar with the story of the Pilgrims? Well, I think MANY Americans don't know the whole story, and some people nowadays talk as if it's nothing but a legend or exaggeration of what really happened. Of Plimoth Plantation is an account that should be required reading in every American high school, as well as one that every American Christian should be familiar with.There are only two primary sources which give firsthand accounts of the landing of the Pilgrims and the first Thanksgiving: Bradford's History (written in 1647) and Mourt's Relation, written by Edward Winslow (published in 1622). Mourt's Relation (named after the publisher) describes only the events of the first year, from the landing at Cape Cod in November 1620 until the following November. Compare the two accounts we have of the first Thanksgiving at Plymouth.William Bradford became the governor of Plymouth Colony after the first governor, John Carver, died during the first winter, and he was the governor for 30 of his remaining 37 years at Plymouth. Bradford's narrative is much more extensive than Winslow's, taking us back to when the band of Non-conformist English believers first decide to take the journey across the Atlantic (and no, it wasn't for a vacation - I hear that's actually what some people believe!). Bradford was about 17 years old when he moved to Holland with the group of Separatists in 1607. In his narrative, Bradford describes the persecution and loss they suffered for their beliefs in England, their decision and plans to leave England, the problems they encountered while trying to get to Holland. Since it was illegal to attend any church except the \\"king's church,\\" this small group of Separatists held secret worship meetings at different times and locations. They experienced loss of property and imprisonment because of their refusal to compromise their beliefs. On one occasion when they had arranged for transportation to Holland, they were betrayed and arrested. Another time, while preparing to leave England, the captain of the ship took off with the men on board who were loading their possessions, leaving their women and children behind on shore. Next Bradford tells of the challenges they faced for the 12 years that they lived in Holland, which led to their decision to come to America. He then describes the voyage to and arrival in Massachusetts, the establishment of their colony, their relationship with the local Wampanoag people and the peace treaty they formed, and their struggles to survive in the new land, covering the first 26 years of the Pilgrims in Plymouth.The key idea that comes through in the reading of Bradford's account is the Pilgrim's belief in the Providence of God - that is His \\"most holy, wise and powerful preserving and governing all of His creatures and all their actions\\" (from The Westminster Catechism). (I discovered the word providence is used almost 50 times.) Whenever things looked grim and discouraging for the Pilgrims, Bradford notes that their hope and trust was always in God. When they decided to move to Holland, they knew there were many difficulties they would face in a foreign land where they would need to learn a new language and lifestyle and find new occupations. Bradford comments,\\"Being thus constrained to leave their native soil and country, their lands and livings, and all their friends and familiar acquaintance, it was much, and thought marvelous by many... But these things did not dismay them (though they did sometimes trouble them) for their desires were set on the ways of God, and to enjoy His ordinances; but they rested on His providence, and knew whom they had believed.\\"Again, in the discussion about moving to America, many fears and objections were raised, but they truly believed they were doing what God was calling them to do and that His blessing would be with them.\\"It was granted the dangers were great, but not desperate; the difficulties were many, but not invincible. For though there were many of them likely, yet they were not certain; it might be sundry of the things feared might never befall; others by provident care and the use of good means, might in a great measure be prevented; and all of them, through the help of God, by fortitude and patience, might either be borne or overcome. True it was that such attempts were not to be made and undertaken without good ground and reason; not rashly or lightly as many have done for curiosity or hope of gain, etc. But their condition was not ordinary; their ends were good and honourable; their calling lawful and urgent; and therefore they might expect the blessing of God in their proceeding. Yea, though they should lose their lives in this action, yet might they have comfort in the same, and their endeavors would be honourable.\\"Towards the end of his narrative, Bradford writes some words of remembrance regarding the death of their pastor, William Brewster, in 1643. He then goes on to observe the amazing fact that many of the Pilgrims enjoyed a long life, in spite of all the trials, difficulties and hardships they endured.On many occasions, this group of believers could have abandoned their plans or given up hope of success. But God's hand of protection, provision and direction can be seen as they continued to trust Him. William Bradford believed that by telling their story, many would see the working of God and would trust Him to work in their life as well.If you've never read the original Pilgrim's story written by William Bradford, I recommend you at least read the first half which would get you to about the year 1625."},{"Title":"OF PLYMOUTH PLANTATION, 1620-1647","review":"I was pleased to find this book about a relative of mine. Hard to believe that it was actually in print"},{"Title":"OF PLYMOUTH PLANTATION, 1620-1647","review":"William Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation is perhaps the most boring and vexatious book I have ever read. The plain style employed by Bradford is, undoubtably, because of his Puritan backgroud, but that is still no excuse for the tedious and often archaic redition of events. I should think that a high-school text book would give a more lively presentation of life in the &quot;New Jerusalem&quot;, as Bradford calls it. The antidiluvian vocabulary and monotonous recording of events made this a very difficult book to get through. I would not recommend it to my peers"},{"Title":"OF PLYMOUTH PLANTATION, 1620-1647","review":"I was suprised at how gossipy William Bradford was. He told tales about his neighbors and friends and described how the pilgrims constantly bickered with traders and their benefactors over money. My whole fantasy about what I thought the Pilgrims were like has completely changed. Now I consider them petty, self-righteous gossip mongers. The book was good for general information about preparation for their trip and what they actually did when they got here, but as far as historical fact goes, I was unimpressed. Bradford discusses people who stray from the flock, &quot;outsiders&quot; who get girls pregnant, drunkards, and preachers who were not to his liking. It was more like a &quot;dish&quot; session n the Jenny Jones show than something I would be proud to uphold as historical fact to the rest of the nation."},{"Title":"OF PLYMOUTH PLANTATION, 1620-1647","review":"I came across this book quite by accident and didn't think it would be much of a read. Generally speaking I don't read histories and one from the early 1600's was a pretty daunting task - or so I thought. In fact, it was a great tale of adventure and faith and an extremely insightful and thought provoking book about how this country was started and what it must have looked like to those who arrived here some 350 years ago.I really did love this book.Bradford is an engaging writer whose prose isn't hard to understand. In places his understatement about the death and hardship faced almost constantly is even amusing. Nothing of the kind of challenges that the Leyden pilgrims faced in Massachusetts will seem familiar to a modern reader. Just the same, the fact that it all happened is fascinating. One can almost imagine being there, looking over the decks of the Mayflower and facing all that December gray and wilderness and wondering what you were doing coming here. Told in first person it reads like an adventure as much as a history.The pilgrims here are also quite human and not at all the diorama characters of a first graders Thanksgiving craft project. They face social challenges and the horrors of death and disease. Attacks by natives actually occured on occasion. The dream of a sort of providence is one that proves difficult in the real world. Bradford mourns the loss of these ideals and the people who imported them. There's something a little sad in his later passages, whether it be age or a truly lost paradise one never really knows. But what Bradford imagined as a sort of religious nirvana clearly doesn't pan out in the end. Nevertheless it is well worth the journey. I highly recommend a read of this American classic."},{"Title":"OF PLYMOUTH PLANTATION, 1620-1647","review":"William Bradford spends the entire first chapter of his book describing the Separatist religious movement--he was NOT a Puritan, contrary to the previous review.Bradford's writing style, while sometimes introspective and monotone, is in many instances the most eloquent of all early American authors, using very thoughtful and beautiful metaphors. To describe the success of the Plymouth Colony after about 20 years, he wrote &quot;Thus out of small beginnings greather things have been produced by His hand that made all things of nothing, and gives being to all things that are; and, as one small candle may light a thousand, so the light here kindled hath shone unto many, yea in some sort to our whole nation&quot;.Bradford describes those small beginnings in his book, from the Pilgrims troubles in England to their departure and life in Holland. After twelve years in Holland, the Pilgrims made a teary departure from their friends to come on the Mayflower to America. As they are about to board the ship that will take them to England and on to America, Bradford in a sentimental outpouring writes &quot;they went aboard and their friends with them, where truely doleful was the sight of that sad and mournful parting, to see what sighs and sobs and prayers did sound . . . But the tide, which stays for no man, calling them away that were thus loath to depart, their reverend pastor falling down on his knees with watery cheeks commended them . . . And then with mutual embrases and many tears they took their leave one of another, which proved to be the last leave to many of them.&quot;It was a &quot;last leave to many&quot;, because after Bradford writes the only existing first-hand account of the Mayflower's voyage, and describes briefly some of the explorations made by the Pilgrims, he then describes the horrible first winter which killed half the Pilgrims: &quot;it pleased God to visit us daily with death, and with so general a disease that the living were scarce able to bury the dead, and the well not in any measure suffiient to tend to the sick&quot;.Written in an English that is easier to read than Shakespeare, yet old enough to remind the reader of the books historical value and place in American history. It's plain style should remind us that Bradford was not an English elitist governor like those that would come later such as Winthrop, Sewell, Winslow, and Cotton, but was in fact a simple subsistence farmer by trade.If you want a fluffy, inaccurate, and childish portrayal of Pilgrim life, read a high school history book. If you want the real thing, read &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation&quot; by William Bradford. It's the first American classic"},{"Title":"OF PLYMOUTH PLANTATION, 1620-1647","review":"Contrary to a previous review, Bradford can in all accuracy be labelled a Puritan, though he himself would not have appreciated the title, it being a word used as a jibe by their opponents. Nowadays, the word has come to refer to a theological standpoint, independent of political positioning. Hence an Anglican might be a Puritan (see Master Alden who came over on the Mayflower), and a Separatist would be even more likely to be one. Puritans might also be called &quot;the hotter sort&quot; of Protestants, for their strictness in matters scriptural, and Puritan theology is entirely in keeping with Bradford's position and beliefs, both political and religious, as a Separatist.Previous reviewers seem to have approached the book with differring expectations. If you want to read about John and Priscilla, go to Longfellow, and if you want to read about Constance of the Mayflower, then you won't find her here (except in the records for the 1623 land division, maybe) - and indeed few of the myths of the Pilgrim Story can be found in Bradford's history. This might dissappoint some people who like to paint their history with honest toil and romance, Plymouth Rocks and Thanksgivings, but to a more attentive reader, Bradford has delights enough to keep anybody satisfied. His style is at times cumbersome, and the language of the 1640s(ish) can often obscure the already confusing legal language of some of the letters and contracts in the book. The language and style, though, are part of the book's character. Bradford's reticence in always referring to himself as either &quot;The Governor&quot; or &quot;Governor Bradford&quot; is not only quaint but also instructive, and to dismiss is as tedious is not to give it its due attention.Overall, Bradford still keeps a sense of adventure and dedication: adventure that the reader may share when confronted with sudden unfamiliar truths of the divisions which separated the Pilgrims, or the decidedly economic flavour to some of the reasons for their departure from Holland. Even to witness on a page before you the first time in any known source that the word &quot;Pilgrims&quot; was used to describe the settlers at Plymouth, is enough to make the reader feel privileged.Morison's notes now look somewhat dated - his anachrinistic mention of Communism sticking particularly in the throat, but the reader might share some of his admiration which obviously emerges for the governor and his people. The Pilgrims at Plymouth can in many ways be regarded as adventurers and even (rather more dubiously) pioneers. Maybe if more people were exposed to Bradford's work they would see that although they weren't quite what popular culture would have us think of them, they were all the same resolute and brave people in most untoward circumstances."},{"Title":"OF PLYMOUTH PLANTATION, 1620-1647","review":"Although this account of the pilgrams of Plymoth Plantation's first few years in the new world may not be entertaining to the student who is unfamiliar with first hand accounts from original source documents; for those of you who cherish these treasure troves, you have found a gold mine!I especially loved the carefull choice of words with which Bradford as well as other pilgrams from this era were known for. It would do our society well if we were to employ thier thoughtful and skillful use of words.I mention the above because it is so foreign to us, but it in no way eclipses the raw content of the book with respect to the first hand accounts of our fledgling country's history.This book will dispell many of the myths which in recent years have surfaced about the pilgrams motives for coming to America.This book is not only well worth the money, but it is also worth the time to read it!"},{"Title":"OF PLYMOUTH PLANTATION, 1620-1647","review":"Excellent book!

Its not very often that you have the opportunity to see events through someone elses eyes, and this does it."},{"Title":"OF PLYMOUTH PLANTATION, 1620-1647","review":"I recently taught this book to a group of five high school boys, and it was an amazing experience. We were able to move beyond our stereotyped ideas of the Pilgrims to see an account of them from the perspective of their leader. We were struck with the through-and-through integrity of these people who were willing to suffer so many ways for the cause of their Lord. So many times they gave the other guy the advantage and did not press their rights, while we moderns were becoming frustrated at their passivity. But in the end we saw the aggregate worth of their \\"long obedience in the same direction,\\" as mocking sailors and the Indians and many others saw that they truly lived out the faith they claimed.The detailed account of anyone's life, personal or corporate, will have tedium and unnecessary (to our thinking) minutiae, and Bradford's account does have a lot of material I might have edited out. But it is a real story, a journal, presented in its entirety, and there is value in that as well.We used discussion questions to guide us, fromOmnibus III: Reformation to the Present."},{"Title":"OF PLYMOUTH PLANTATION, 1620-1647","review":"This book is 1 of 2 firsthand accounts written about Plymouth Colony that I have read.Both are in the language of the 17th Century and Shakespeare, and therefore hard to read for comprehension, the first time.William Bradford wrote this book many years after the fact, but it covers the period of time the Separatists left England for Holland, Holland to America, and the settlement of Plymouth Colony through its first decades."},{"Title":"OF PLYMOUTH PLANTATION, 1620-1647","review":"I am very interested in the earliest days of our great country, but I found William Bradford's accounts tedious to read -- of course this is in part due to the way people wrote back then"},{"Title":"OF PLYMOUTH PLANTATION, 1620-1647","review":"You can't beat history that comes straight from those who lived it.

Well, I wish I could make the saturated fat disappear like the authors of this book! There aren't any entries at all for saturated fat. I had to go buy a different book.For misleading the public I deducted a full two stars. I think the least the publisher could do is print a sticker to cover up the offending book area with the correct information."},{"Title":"The NutriBase Complete Book of Food Counts","review":"Do NOT buy this book if you want to keep your sanity. I wish I could offer an alternative but have not found a reasonable one- yet. My main beef with the book is the units of measures - they are all over the place, and, in many cases, useless. For example: I wanted to find out the carb count on fresh blueberries. A simple request, I thought. But, nooo. Instead of a 1 cup measure, or an ounce measure, their measure is a choice of 1 pint or 50 blueberries! Well, I didn't have a pint of blueberries and um, like I'm going to count them! While I realize a cup of large blueberries would be different than a cup of small blueberries; the same rationale applies to the count of 50 blueberries. More infuriating is the fact that a 1 cup measure was good enough for the fresh blackberries on the opposite page.Unfortunately, this is just one example. I have thrown this book across the room numerous times for similiar offenses. So, for the sake of my blood pressure and sanity, the first chance I get I am replacing this annoying book with something that measures food the way I measure food: in slices, teaspoons, tablespoons, cups, ounces; consistently and for each food, if necessary.On the plus side they do cover almost all the values you could want and have a handy dandy guide to all sorts of fast food places. I'd like to tell the publishers of this book (and way too many others)to talk to real people and see how they measure foods; I guarantee that unless it's for a specific recipe, it isn't by pints or counts of individual berries. Consistency counts!"},{"Title":"The NutriBase Complete Book of Food Counts","review":"Comparing this food count book with those in stores -- it's helpful to see the format which is why I like Amazon where you can peek inside the books :) -- this book was the most comprehensive: a large number of foods reviewed in various forms and serving sizes. The categories (total calories, protein, carbs, sodium, fiber, fat and cholesterol) are what I needed to know. I didn't see the breakdown of saturated fat one of the reviewers mentioned (I just looked again, I have the 2d edition with the blue cover) but I don't need fat breakdown for my nutritional purposes. My only beef is with the formatting of the counts -- I wish it followed the order of the nutrition labels with fat first after total calories, followed by cholesterol, sodium, total carbs, fiber, and protein last. I don't need the breakdown of sugars for my purposes, so I'm okay with just listing total carbs and fiber, and leaving sugars out. Before I got used to using the book, I wanted to throw it across the room also. It helped me to mark in pencil the foods I frequently eat and later made up my own list which I keep a copy in the kitchen and a copy in the back of the book. The fast-food guide in the back section is very helpful. One day I was able to choose wisely at Jack in the Box and not blow my food counts for the day. I appreciate being able to count food pieces (50 blueberries) as I will count 25, halve all the food counts and add another piece of fruit for variety and nutrition. But I'm happy to use measuring cups, spoons and a scale at home. I found the book more comprehensive than Netzer's and many of the others out there, including various carb counters. It's not a book you can carry easily with you -- it's 704 pages! -- but it's a good reference book for home. I keep another smaller food count book in the car and approximate when I eat out, which outings I limit so I have more control over what I eat and my pocketbook."},{"Title":"The NutriBase Complete Book of Food Counts","review":"Having just recently started the Atkins program I've grown tired of reading labels.

For EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE ENTRIES there is a column that lists grams of saturated fat.

If you are a reader who enjoys novels of suspense, then surely you will find this one to be a rip-roaring good read. There are enough red herrings, enough twists and turns, to keep one guessing until the very end. So, hang on to your seat and enjoy the ride!The premise here is simple. Thirteen years ago, six teenage girls who had formed a secret club called the Six of Hearts, decide to let loose, drink, and dabble in a psuedo satanic ritual in a deserted farmhouse in Wheeling, West Virginia. Before the night is over, one of them ends up dead. The surviving five swear to a pact of secrecy to never reveal what really happened.Thirteen years later, one of them dies a violent death at the hand of an unknown person who leaves behind a clue that those who were members of the Six of Hearts club are at risk. Laurel Damron, a flower shop owner and one of the club members, begins to receive chilling mementos which can only mean one thing: that she, too, is marked for death. One by one, all the remaining club members claim to have received frightening mail which lead them all to the same conclusion as Laurel.Who will be next, and who is responsible for this? That is a question upon which the reader may well ponder, as the reader sifts through the byzantine twists in the plot. Gripping and absorbing, this novel is sure to hold the reader in suspense until the very end."},{"Title":"Grace And Power","review":"This was a great book, and I highly recommend it! However, beware, it is an easy read, and I wouldn't exactly describe it as a book you should get if you want an intense study. It did bring me a lot closer to God, though, and it opened up some wonderful truths to me! But after I read it once, I went back to read it all over again, and found myself wanting to know more about what he talks about, and wishing he would concentrate on certain subjects longer. So why did I give it five stars? Because this book is a must have---if you have in mind exactly what it is. If you're expecting an exposition of all the subjects, you won't find it here, but you will find simple meditations on passages of the Word of God and if you are anything like me, they will bring you much closer to Him. I still read chapters over again, and I still get things out of it. It's a terrific book, but each subject is only dwelt on a little bit, and it's not exactly a book intended to prove or disprove certain things or doctrines. But if you give it a chance, it will bring you closer to God! The book is divided into six sections: Grace God's Unmerited Favor, Power in the Blood, Being God's Friend, Joy in Christ's Presence, Holy Spirit Power, and The Second Coming of Christ. The section on grace and the section Joy in Christ's Presence, along with a few chapters out of Power in the Blood, are, in my opinion, the best of the book, but the others are great as well. The Second Coming of Christ doesn't go into an in depth explanation of all the verses that deal with it, or into an exposition of prophecy, but deals with a few verses, and deals with them well. Overall, it's not a book to read to study the subjects it has in it, but it's a book to read to remind you of simple but wonderful truths, and to bring you closer to God. It will leave you wanting to know more!!! It is in my opinion a must-have!"},{"Title":"Grace And Power","review":"Spurgeon's title on Grace and Power is actually a compilation of 6 sections or books:1. Grace: God's Unmerited Favor2.

If you haven't encountered Sue Spencer and her quirky sense of humor about her family's life in the African bush, you've missed a delight.

It is the longer version which I personally regularly use for my research - mostly in Renaissance literature - and I have found it an excellent source of reference.

Not so with this book!Although the authors are British, and there is a bit of bias towards names used in the U.K. it is well researched. They could have double-checked US sources a little more when commenting on its use as a US name. Yet, this only means that they wrote what they knew to be true rather than making wild uninformed guesses. For instance, they suspect that &quot;Oprah&quot; was a form of Orpah but without being completely sure they only list it as a supposition and attribute it's existance in the US to Oprah Winfrey. Their linguistically inspired guess was correct! Oprah has mentioned in an interview that her name was a typo of Orpah.

Just one short tale of her life, but it is enough to give you a sense of her home, school, friends and feelings. The rest of the book is primarily set in a new &quot;special economic zone&quot; in the south of china at the time when these zones were newly created. The book focuses on the experiences of young people during this transition period in China. Mian paints a picture of hope and desire stirring within the hearts of her young characters while caution and uncertainty ruled their actions. This is a story about music, self-expression, coming of age and falling in love.Best of all is Main's poetic style. It must be said that Lingenfelter did a wonderful job in the translation, as the prose is sultry and descriptive. Mian does not immediately detail who the speaker is in each section. The story moves from first to third person - from the south back to Shanghai and introduces characters without setting them up. I appreciated this style. To me it reflected the chaotic life of the main characters. If you enjoy detailed explanations of characters and character motivations in a story or prefer that dialogue to be neatly arranged in quotes identifying every speaker you will have a difficult time following this book. However, if you enjoy poetic prose with a few rock-n-roll lyrics thrown in and changing voices filled with description and emotion you will find Candy a memorable read.Mian hints that the book is semi-autobiographical. Readers will wonder which of her characters contain her experiences. Not to worry, she has already expressed her desire to write \\"nakedly\\" of her own life.

In it, Schaeffer shows that Christianity is not simply about right answers or intellectual belief, but about a deep, heart-felt love.

If you've never read Francis Schaeffer this is a great introduction. If you've already read Schaeffer, then this is a great addition. In either case, 'The Mark of the Christian' is must read material!"},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"What is it that sets the Christian apart from the unbeliever - it is faith, or devotion, or piety? Schaeffer explores this question in light of the fact that today it is nearly impossible to tell the difference between professing followers of Christ and anyone else. Schaeffer believes that this is a unique quality of the Christian life that should be present in their lives that would not only clearly demonstrate their relationship with the Lord, but would also transform those around them in the process - that quality is love.An incredibly short book, less than 40 pages long, The Mark of a Christian is a powerful and poignant book for every Christian today. In the era when denominational struggles reign and Christianity is presented to mainstream audiences highlighting the most extreme antics of gay-bashing and anti-abortion demonstrations where young women are labeled as murderers, it's not difficult to see why the world views all religious people as \\"fanatical\\" and \\"extremists.\\" Some radicals are \\"called by God\\" to fly planes into tall buildings, others cut the arms off their infant children. The world is left wondering what kind of God these people worship. Schaeffer agrees with them.True Christianity, Schaeffer argues, is marked by this one great principle - love. Love for God is demonstrated by a love for His greatest creation: man. Which means that one fundamental principle of the Christian walk is truly loving one another. While this may sound simple, Schaeffer explains that this is the greatest contradiction to the self-centered human nature of the unredeemed and when faced with the concept of a sacrificial love for another, the world will be turned upside down!We all know those self-professed followers of Christ who we definitely wouldn't describe as embodying the quality of love - this short and powerful book is for them; and for all Christians as a reminder that what the world needs more is love, sweet love...it truly is the only thing that's worth living (and dying) for."},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"Francis Schaeffer defends the simple notion that a Christian must be known by their love in this short and meaningful book. Astounding in its simplicity but deep in its implications."},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"This is an important little book by Schaeffer. Of course, we know that we should love our neighbor and love our brother but Schaeffer outlines the consequences of of failing to show that love, specifically love for the bretheren. He argues convincingly that the world is in scripture granted the right to doubt our salvation if we do not love fellow Christians. He further argues that it is this love that shows the unity of the Church to the world and if we fail to show that unity the world will not believe that the Father sent the Son. This Love is what Schaeffer calls the final apologetic. We must have the answers for peoples honest questions but without openly demonstrated love the world will not care.It should also be pointed out that Schaeffer does not argue for a Love which accomodates on issues of Holiness. We must both balace the Love of God and the Holiness of God. We must rely on the Spirit to empower us to maintain this balance. But, we need to realize that a failure to demonstrate either side shows the world a diminished God."},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"Spoiler alert = the mark of the Christian is love.This simple book is an argument for Christians to adorn themselves with love. Not just for outsiders; but for each other. Not just for each other, but for outsiders (those who don't know God) too. He claims that this balanced love-giving is not automatic; and takes discipline to maintain.Our love, as Christians, is supposed to show the world something about God. And our love should be according to, or similar to, the love Christ has for us. \\"According to the Scripture and the teaching of Christ, the love that is shown is to be exceedingly strong. It is not just something you mention in words once in a while.\\" (p.21)Visible love includes apologizing and giving forgiveness. Also, we must have a deep unity according to John 17 - not merely a shallow organizational unity.He gets into church discipline and true disagreement; but maintains that this is not unloving - quite the opposite! it is not true love to merely tolerate each other and watch as we each destroy ourselves.Schaeffer rebukes churches for acting snobby and rejecting toward fellow believing churches. He mentions that the non-Christian world doesn't understand all of the little theological differences, and that we would have a better witness to them if we could focus on the good things in other churches that can be agreed upon. As Believers, we don't need to rely on fakery or shallow love - we literally do have a unifying factor between ourselves and other Christians = God's Spirit. So, when we preserve the unity He gives us, we are allowing His Spirit to show something to the world about God.He concludes: \\"In short, we are to practice and exhibit the holiness of God and the love of God, for without this we grieve the Holy Spirit. Love - and the unity it attests to - is the mark Christ gave Christians to wear before the world. Only with this mark may the world know that Christians are indeed Christians (Jn.13:34-35) and that Jesus was sent by the Father (Jn.17).\\""},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"This book clearly and succinctly (the book's only 38 pages) spells out the duty that a Christian has. Both to other believers and to the world at large. Schaeffer always bases his theories heavily on Scripture and this book is no exception.This book is a must-read for Schaeffer enthusiasts and Believers who are searching for a way to reconcile their inward faith with the outward world."},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"More than a global condemnation or a decrying of denominational distinctives, the Mark of a Christian is an honest view of how Christ has given the world the \\"right to judge Christians,\\" by the merit of their love for each other. Schaeffer doesn't set up love for the brethren as penultimate, but he takes seriously the fact that Jesus stated that the second greatest commandment as, \\"Love your neighbor as yourself.\\"This was a very convicting work for me. It's too easy to live life in thinking that \\"love\\" is just as well as getting along with other people. Schaeffer gets to the point that loving our neighbors is more than we are capable of - something that only Christ can bring alive through the muck of our souls.Schaeffer was very aware of the human condition. He doesn't set up unrealistic expectations before us. He has taken truth and set it before us to say, \\"This is what the Lord has said, how do you measure?\\" This is a very stern work for such a grace-centered man. I would recommend reading True Spirituality in addition to Mark of a Christian in understanding that our lives in Christ are much less centered upon what we do and don't do and so much more imperative upon the object of our faith. Therein, He bears fruit through trees that should be tossed into eternal flame."},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"I believe I paid under a dollar for this book. It is only 35 pages long. Though cheap and short, it addresses the love we should have for one another in John 13 in the most comprehensive and intelligible way I have ever seen. Francis minces no words.He boldly addresses our need to weigh if those who claim to be in the faith truly are. One who is a false brother or a \\"Christian\\" by religious affiliation only cannot receive the Spirit love that we are endowed to give one another. The love between true Christians is a unique gift that we are only able to give and receive because the Spirit within us enables us to do so. If we are in Christ and refuse to give this love to a fellow believer, the world has every right to judge us as not being in Christ. To not love is to refuse His mark.John 17:21 tells us that we should be one as Christ and the Father are one. To refuse to be unified as one tells the world a deep message according to this verse. It tells the watching world that the Father did not send the Son. Schaeffer again addresses the ideas of false unity that are propagated throughout the church. Beware of being unified in anything but Christ.\\"It is not a mushy, gooey, romantic love, but one that is practical and that a watching (sinful) world can see.\\""},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"All men have value because they were created in the image of God. Not only are we to love God but to love our neighbor as we do ourselves. This is what sets the Christian apart from the rest of the world. Though this does not mean that we are all equal. And with our fellow Christians it is out of love that we must show where they have gone astray. Schaeffer expands upon these basic, foundational commands.How can we expect the world to listen if we don't show this love and have the honest answers.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"I first read this book as a young Christian and now am impressed with how many of the concepts I have adopted in my own creed. I detest pop Christian symbols and the urge to define a Christian by market forces. Schaeffer attempts to challenge the reader into not only glimpsing in the mirror, but to really make changes accordingly."},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"How can a person prove they are a Christian, that their faith is real? This is Schaeffer's question. He seeks Christ's answer and finds it: \\"They shall know that you are my followers by the love that you have for one another.\\" So the defining characteristic of a believer is that they exhibit love toward other believers. Sounds simple enough but it is, alas, terribly hard to live out in real life. In this brief tome, Schaeffer economically explores the mandatory nature of this quality (\\"As I have loved you, you must love one another\\" is pretty imperative), how its neglect dooms the church to skeptical reception at best, and examines how one can cultivate such love for fellow Christians. A very important read from one of the 20th century's most important Christian minds."},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"A great challenge to get back to timeless basics. A simple but profound reminder of what it takes to impact culture of any age."},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"This is a very short book.This is a very good book.Schaeffer's insight put a whole new perspective on things that I had never before considered. Namely: the world has the right to judge Christians based on whether or not they love. You will have to read the book to understand everything Schaeffer uses to reach that conclusion, but I doubt you will be able to argue once you do. Schaeffer explains how love is the not just an element which distinguishes Christians from nonChristians. You will be challenged to re-visit your own heart and determine the truth of John's words \\"If a man does not love his brother, the Truth [Christ] is not in him.\\"You can read this book in an hour or two, but its thoughts will travel with you for weeks and its impact for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"I had originally read Mark of a Christian in 1974.

I have found myself rereading this periodically over the past 30 years. For more info see [...] and use Schaeffer as the search phrase."},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"The Mark of the Christian was written almost 40 years ago and has less than 40 pages. Despite the thinness of his book, Pastor Schaeffer presents a critical message that many people who profess to be Christians need to hear. As stated in John 13:33-35, love must be the distinguishing mark of all Christians. He who fails to love has not been truly changed by the gospel message."},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"For the individual more interested in Christian living than philosophical arguments this is the Schaeffer book for you. This book is very short, I finished in two nights of easy reading. It is basically expanding his thoughts on John 13:34-35\\"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.\\"I think his main point is that God has given the world a litmus test for whether Christianity is the truth and whether we are truly followers of him. If the world can OBSERVE that we love one another they will know, if not, then they have the right to judge us accordingly. How we deal with conflict within ourselves is the true test. Loving each other through harmony is easy, loving each other when there are disagreements is much harder.This is an oversimplification of his work, and reading this short book is well worth the effort. Light and short reading with maximum impact."},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"Though may easily be overlooked as something Christians are and should be familiar with, I still take Dr. Schaeffer's encouragement seriously to love like Jesus loves according to what he commands his disciples at the Last Supper; both those \\"in the household of faith\\" and those who are outside, that the world may know that Christians are Christ's indeed. I can not agree more that cold, uncaring, indifferent, unloving, narcissistic Christianity; something that I'm liable to as well; is not only an oxymoron, but also ugly, as Dr. Schaeffer puts it. On a similar subject, pursuing Christian unity; what it is and what it is not; is something that he claims as the other mark of a Christian, and though intuitively is natural when there is a genuine love to one another, but is still worth studying in this little yet practical book."},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"Schaeffer writes a book here that is challenging and very needed. He simply takes two statements of Jesus on how we should love one another and strive for peace and unity instead of discord and pride, and demonstrates the crucial need to follow these verses. A Christian is supposed to be a bearer of love and peace to every other human being (Christian or not; you can promote peace and show love without sacrificing truth). This book along with his \\"True Spirituality\\" are both on the top of my list of messages that have made the most impact on me. All of Schaeffer's work is good but this book is one of my favorites. I second the motion that this is a must read for any Christian."},{"Title":"The Mark of The Christian","review":"As with most of Francis Schaffer's books... though written in the 1970's it seems like it was written yesterday. A short but powerful book looking at John 13 & 17 and what he calls is the \\"Final Apologetic\\". He basically asks \\"How will they know we are Christians?\\" And expounds on that. A highly reflective book. A book we need today. A Must Read."},{"Title":"Beyond By Reason of Childhood","review":"Most new writers usually suffer a sophomore slump: somehow their sequels never hold up to the success of the first book. This is not the case with Francis Connelly's \\"Beyond By Reason of Childhood\\". This continuation of his autobiography takes us from Mr. Connelly's boyhood in Brooklyn to his manhood.Like the original, this follow-up is filled with the colorful characters that one can only find on the streets of New York City. More precisely, the people Mr. Connelly came in contact with during his many years in the New York Police Department border incredibility. (Then again, only policemen come across the most bizarre of human beings.) As a balance to this, however, are his intimate relations with his friends, and, especially his wife and five children. Special candor is displayed by Mr. Connelly when he describes his bouts with nicotine and alcohol dependencies, and his health problems--specifically, hypoglycemia.The book also covers a wide-range of subjects: know-nothing \\"connect the dots\\" judges, army life, 9/11, etc. And Mr. Connelly's opinions are never disguised. His views on life are often poignant, but the way expresses them are so perfect. My favorite appears near the end of the book:\\"I never forget a kindness, but sometimes it takes me a long time to remember it. Come to think of it though, in a lifetime, how many do we receive, and more importantly, how many do we render?\\"Good question.But, as in the first book, there is a load of irony and humor throughout \\"Beyond By Reason of Childhood\\" to temper the seriousness. This is Mr. Connelly's unique gift: to draw out the humor from a seemingly humorless world."},{"Title":"The Third Man","review":"Written originally as the outline for the screenplay of the famous 1949 film of the same name, Greene sets the story in Vienna just after World War II, employing the sectors established by the conquering British, Americans, French, and Russians to provide tension, mystery, and an almost palpable aura of menace as residents and visitors alike must deal with four different governments, four sets of officials, and four collections of laws as they move throughout the city. With massive bomb damage, the city is still emerging from devastation, with black markets selling everything from food to penicillin abound.Rollo Martins, the author of cowboy novels written under the name of Buck Dexter, arrives in Vienna to visit an old school friend, Harry Lime, only to find that is the day of Lime's funeral. Investigating Lime's death, Martins learns that a neighbor saw the traffic accident that killed Lime and observed three men carrying Lime's body from the scene. Only two of those men have been identified-the third man has vanished. As Martins investigates, he must deal with the city's several different governments, each of which has carved out a sector. The initial co-operation among sectors has vanished, and co-operation with the Russian sector is almost non-existent. Wanted men use the city's sewers to escape from one sector to another, where they cannot be followed. The investigation of Lime's death becomes more complex when an inebriated Martins is sure that he has seen Harry Lime on the street.By turns exciting and darkly humorous, the novel is a curiosity among Greene's entertainments, since this story was never written to be a novel at all. Intensely visual in its descriptions and action, it lacks the characterization and thematic focus which one associates with most of Greene's work. The novel's dialogue, rather than narrative, conveys the story, as it does in the film, and the setting in a war-torn city adds to the sense of danger and drama. Certainly not one of Greene's \\"finished\\" novels, it is still fun to read, especially when one is familiar with the even better film of it, directed by Carol Reed and starring Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton, and Trevor Howard. Of particular interest to those studying writing and film-making, Greene's novella is full of wit and dark theatrics, and includes everything from a chase through the sewers to a love story.

It is organized in a kind of encyclopedia style and discusses an amazing number of problems that people may have at work. The book takes the EMPLOYER'S POINT OF VIEW as well as discussing ways that job hunters or employees can respond to objections. The author also suggests specific ways that employers should approach employees about issues that are problematic.In addition to disabilities, the authors also discuss having been on welfare, having a criminal background, issues with chronic lateness, having been fired, memory problems, and former drug or alcohol addiction. The discussion of offensive body odor is a great example.Most job-hunting-for-people-with-disabilities books focus primarily on people with visible, physical disabilities that do not affect their job performance if they have technological accomodations in place. Hidden disabilities need different solutions and even the ADA keeps changing.Unfortunately, the ADA does not protect against prejudice and that is what this book focuses upon. The book pays a lot of attention to issues dealing with co-workers. While a boss may be accomodating, co-workers often are not.The authors show you how you can be the best possible employee with the right job. But it just isn't possible to explain why you would be the best possible hire if you don't know what the employer is, and isn't, looking for. For example, the authors give specific advice for ex-con's and recovering alcoholics to explain why they would be the BEST possible employees for certain jobs, not just \\"ok\\" employees. Just about every situation can be an advantage, depending on how you look at it. And some \\"problems\\" aren't really problems if you know how to deal with them.If you have a disability or know someone who has any kind of barrier to employment, beg or borrow a copy of this book.

I say overly biased because all author have an opinion that is expressed overtly or covertly in their writing.Richard A. Gabriel, a well-respected professor of politics at St. Anselm College, former US Army intelligence officer, and consultant to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees as well as the Pentagon, has written what is probable the most objective and well-written account of the 1982 War in Lebanon between Israeli, Syrian, Lebanese, PLO, and other forces. He has written numerous books about military actions including several books that constructively criticized the American actions in Vietnam. Several of his books have since become requred reading for courses at military academies.Prof. Gabriel went out of his way to write an objective analysis of the combat, going so far as to interview PLO officials, IDF soldiers, and others. He also toured the battefields as they occurred as a guest of the IDF. Even more to his credit, he made a stipulation of his touring the front with the IDF that IDF miltary censors not be able to review his transcripts at all until after publishing. This means that he was able to effectively write whatever he wanted.The book itself is brilliant. Within its' 242 pages are numerous analyses of various tactical and strategic conflicts of the 1982 War. He lists grievances and events of all sides into the war and yet hesitates to make value judgements about any of them short of miltary stance. While avoidings making the book a massive judgement of the political stance of any of the fighters, he doesn't hesitate to list political factors that the combatants considered at the time of the war.One of the greatest treasures of having toured Lebanon and the conditions there is that he was able to disprove many of the false accounts that the media of the time forwarded to the public. Being a meticulous researcher also means that he always quotes sources and provides appropriate background. For instance, the PLO (through the Lebanese newspaper \\"An Nahar\\")claimed that Israeli forces killed 17,825 civilian noncombatants killed and wounded 30,103 civilians. Mr. Gabriel analyzed all of the data available from various sources (including interviews with village mayors and other on-the-site witnesses) and came up with a more likely figure of 4,000 to 5,000 killed and 12,000 to 14,000 wounded.If you are looking for an account of the 1982 war that objectively evaluates military actions of the combatants then Prof. Richard A. Gabriel's \\"Operation Peace for Galilee - The Israeli-PLO War in Lebanon\\" is unparallelled. I highly recommend reading this book whether you are looking for more background on the Arab-Israeli conflict, are a military historian, a wargamer, or just someone interested in knowing more about the Middle-East.Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan"},{"Title":"Operation Peace for Galilee -","review":"In my opinion Israel's short but extremely violent campaign in Lebanon in 1982 is a subject that must be studied with great attention since it can teach us many political and operational lessons in order to evaluate the current situation in the Middle East and the way that Israel responds to periodic violence from Hezbollah. Mr Gabriel gives the background of that conflict and the subsquent military operations in great detail, accompanied by numerous black and white maps which show the situation on the ground every day.Once Egypt signed a treaty with Israel in 1979 and Sinai became a buffer zone, Israel became safe from a full peripheral war. Jordan was not going to launch an attack and Syria by itself could not strike. The danger to Israel became Palestinian operations inside Israel and the occupied territories and the threat posed from Lebanon by the Syrian-sponsored group Hezbollah. In 1982, Israel responded to this threat by invading Lebanon, It moved as far north as Beirut and the mountains east and northeast of it, cutting in the process the Beirut - Damascus highway. Israel did not invade Beirut proper, since Israeli forces traditionaly do not like urban warfare as it imposes too high a rate of attrition. But what the Israelis found was low-rate attrition. Throughout their occupation of Lebanon, they were constantly experiencing guerilla attacks, particularly from Hezbollah, until the were forced to withdraw their troops from Lebanon in 2000.Although the overall analysis is good, my complain is that the author does not devote enough pages to the terrific air battle of Bekaa Valley or the slaughter of the Syrian Air Force (the Israeli pilots achieved a score in the region of 81:0) and he makes some mistakes regarding the total number of weapons available to the IDF, like number of tanks, self propelled artillery etc. Despite this, the book is a very good introduction to the Lebanon War and the author does not avoid the hot issue of the Sabra / Shatila massacre, even though he does not blame Sharon openly. The book can be read together with Zeev Schiff's excellent \\"Israel's Lebanon War\\" and Martin van Creveld's \\"The Sword and the Olive\\" which is very critical of the Israeli choices but expertly written."},{"Title":"Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform","review":"Jean Anyon's book, Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform paints a harrowing portrait of the struggles of those who have a role in inner-city schools. It is written in three parts that address the present situation, reflect upon the past, and look to the future, respectively. The book took several years to write due to the level of research involved for the historical content, but the personal account was based on four years of the author's participation in the reform effort in Newark, New Jersey, beginning in 1992. The reform efforts targeted eight schools in the central section of the city. (On a broader note, the historical text of the book points out that the decline of the schools really began in the 1930s.) The book begins by showing the present state of education within the reform district, but then postulates the reasons for this status by looking at the historical foundations of the problems. In the first chapter of part two, Anyon begins the historical breakdown by looking at early situation with educating the children of the many immigrants who came to Newark beginning in the 1860s. Despite early attempts at reform, the seeds had already been planted for the disenfranchisement seen today. The historical context of Anyon's research design shows decade by decade the continual decay of the Newark schools. Reform efforts were suggested, but never truly implemented. After the period of organized crime and municipal scandals had arrived, Anyon notes that:&quot;Because there was no rescue of the Newark educational system in 1968, it would continue to limp along, and further generations of Newark children-the grandchildren, the grandchildren, the great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren of the southern rural immigrants-wouldjoin their parents in the ranks of the uneducated and the undereducated. Many would therefore be unable to participate in the economic and political institutions of U.S. society&quot; (p. 127).This generational cycle of poverty and hopelessness is at the heart of Anyon's determination that changes can only be effective if they consider the sociocultural status and economic plight of those involved. I found the accounts in the book to be a revelation to say the least. I think people like myself who are born and raised outside urban areas live in blissful ignorance as to the true state of education for the thousands trapped in a cycle of poverty and despair. I like that Anyon takes such an honest approach to her research, realizing that to be effective she must be disclose everything she witnessed. The only change I would like to see is the statistical information presented in some type of graph form so that it would be easier to read and interpret. Otherwise, I found the book to be an invaluable read as a future educator. In fact, it has made me think beyond the world of education and to ponder my place among the human race and the responsibility I must take for needs of my fellow man and the generations to come."},{"Title":"Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform","review":"Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Education Reform, is an interesting explanation of the case study done by the author, Jean Anyon. Anyon was a part of the attempted educational reform of the Newark, New Jersey schools in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Although most of her personal contact was with the faculty, staff, administration, parents, and children of the Marcy school, she gives the historical background for the Newark schools system starting in 1860. This history ventures all of the way to the present, which includes her personal experience in the reform process. Although the reform process in which she participated in failed, she did learn a great deal and shared a lot of insight about school reform. Her main point was that reform would not happen until the economic and political systems that surround the schools are transformed, neither would the schools be transformed. (Anyon 13) I found this book to be informative and insightful. Through this reading I have a better understanding of the inner city school setting, and how much help is needed there. Unfortunately, as Anyon point out, money is not the answer. The answer is reform on the larger scale. This book helped me to see this. Additionally, because of my current quest to become a teacher this booked helped me to prepare for some of the obstacles I may face. Although I will probably never teach at a school like those in the Newark district, it is very beneficial to my learning process to see the problem that plague the educational community. I am glad this book was part of my college curriculum."},{"Title":"Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform","review":"It is easy in this day of age to forget about the troubling aspects that are still facing public schools in our large cities. With this book, Jean Anyon does not let us forget the problems that are still facing these schools today. This book provides a different and important perspective on public school reform in this nation. Anyon does not jump to blame the schools, teachers and students like is done so often when schools fail, but rather she portrays how cummulative effects of school and public officials decisions have tied the hands of the public education reformers in those cities. Anyon's ideas are more comprehensive, and she does not want to just change the schools, but the city itself. This book is very compelling and insightful and offers a great look inside the doors of the public school system in our urban environment."},{"Title":"Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform","review":"Anyon wrote a provocative article a number of years ago which I still use in my teacher education classes. But this new book is troubling to me. She fails to look at the national systemic causes of institutional racism and seems to blame those in the local schools. I don't know New Jersey - maybe she is right about that city. But I do know other urban districts, and it is natioanl systems of testing, curriculum, funding, bureaucracy, and irrelevant teacher credentialing which oppress both those who attempt to educate and those who attempt to be educated. The African-American teachers in New Jersey tried to tell Anyon that, but she didn't listen."},{"Title":"Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform","review":"Jean Anyon is currently a Professor of Urban Education in the graduate program, City University of New York. She wrote Ghetto Schooling after participating in an unsuccessful four-year attempt to restructure eight schools in inner city Newark, NJ. She says, \\"To discover why inner city schools have not improved, it is not enough to only examine present reform or educational practice. We need, in addition, to understand how inner city schools have come to be what they are\\" (xv). The book traces the historical political economy of old industrial cities in the U.S., with Newark as the focus. She shows how the factors that mitigated against reform in the 1990's developed, and how they represent the \\"concentration effects of the gradual ghettoization and stigmatization over time of the city's minority poor\\" (xv).The assertions Anyon makes are diligently researched and extensively documented. Unfortunately, the way the findings are reported makes it extremely difficult to follow the argument. Anyon herself contributes to this difficulty with a tangled and complex prose style. The demographic trends, comparisons of funding levels, changes in racial composition of students, faculty and administrators, trends in qualifications of teachers and in student/teacher ratio, number of substitute teachers, proportions of the budgets spent on classroom instruction vs. non-instructional personnel, and so on, should have been put into charts, graphs, maps and tables. Burying them in paragraph after paragraph of narrative studded with numbers, percentages, and in-text citations makes them nearly useless. For example, it is unclear to me whether Newark is considered a \\"large city\\" or not, and I couldn't figure out which county it is in. That made it impossible to evaluate some of the things she said about other cities and counties.The book shows that the Newark public school system, which was once considered a model, never did a good job with working class, poor, and immigrant children. Their graduation rates were abysmal, their schools and teachers were always substandard, and they were always marginalized, despised and abused. As long as there were plenty of jobs in the city that did not require an education, the second class status of the poor children in the system was hidden from view. Anyon also shows how federal and state policies regarding mortgage lending, urban renewal, highway construction, and tax incentives for investment led to the destruction of inner city neighborhoods and isolation and impoverishment of the people. It shows how the political isolation of both the city government and the school board in Newark contributed to the ascendancy of organized crime and machine politics, which diverted enormous amounts of revenue intended for schools into the pockets of criminals and their accomplices. Then it shows how the schools went into a freefall caused by loss of tax base, unjust education funding policies, and grossly incompetent and unsuitable teachers and administrators. Anyon traces the history of attempts at reform, including numerous lawsuits aimed at enforcing the requirement of the New Jersey Constitution that all school children in the state be provided a \\"thorough and efficient\\" free public education. This social, political and economic analysis makes it clear that it was not primarily teachers' unions, or liberals, or starry-eyed idealists who \\"ruined\\" the system, but business interests, organized crime and wealthy conservatives.Anyon concludes that it will not be possible to fix urban education without addressing poverty and racism. Urban school systems comprise parents, administrators, teachers and students who are, themselves, products of a socially, culturally, linguistically, and economically isolated, marginalized and powerless society that has no viable connection with the centers of power, money and influence in the city of Newark, the state of New Jersey or the federal government. The low expectations, dysfunctional organization, and culture of resignation, abuse, incompetence and failure that Anyon observed in the schools, and that have been rightly cited as contributory factors in school failure, are symptoms, not causes. Although Anyon goes acknowledges that many individuals and groups work diligently to make things better in the Newark schools, the book shows that no program, no restructuring, no analysis of the education system that fails to address the cultural, political, and economic structures of the inner city itself can succeed. Unless the ghettos are transformed into economically viable, functional communities, it will be impossible to make any meaningful improvement in ghetto schooling.I agree wholeheartedly with that conclusion, but the book is short on policy prescriptions. One of the most useful suggestions is that all grassroots efforts to transform inner city environments include programs to improve education. That is about as specific as Anyon's proposed solutions get. She says, for example, that it ought to be possible to raise the money to fix the system, pointing out that the U.S. has one of the lowest tax rates in the world. Yes, but fiscal policy in this country is controlled by people who are determined to keep it that way, and who are getting more and more successful at doing just that.The book predates \\"gentrification,\\" but that, of course, is not the kind of transformation that Anyon had in mind. Razing slums to build gated upper class communities, and demolishing old schools to create charter schools that rich people want for their kids, further displacing and marginalizing the poor, is merely a new chapter in the old story of \\"urban renewal\\" as disaster capitalism. The most striking thing about \\"new urbanism\\" and the shiny new \\"mixed use\\" communities that are being built is their whiteness. Except for servants, you won't see any people of color in these theme parks, where the social classes of the residents and customers run the gamut from A to B.We need a different paradigm for thinking about education itself, one that liberates the victims of oppression instead of blaming them. At first I was frustrated by Anyon's failure to propose a different paradigm in this book, but then I realized that she didn't promise that. She succeeded in her goal of showing what must be done. She did not undertake to describe how to do it."},{"Title":"Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform","review":"Anyon has used ethnographic and historical material to make a case that's been made before, though I don't think it's been made this well: Schooling is a contextually determined institution. If the context -- in this case the urban U.S. -- is declining economically and socially, schooling will decline as well. If the cities in which schools are located are impoverished, crime-ridden, and devoid of opportunity, schools and their students will be faced with the same vastly diminished prospects. Anyone who has read Bowles and Gintis' Schooling in Capitalist America, Willis' Learning got Labor, or Devine's Maximum Security already knows that schools can't be fixed from the inside out.It's convenient to blame teachers and administrators for the damaging conditions which prevail in places like Newark's Marcy school, but what are teachers to do? Imagine a teacher who has just spent four or five years in a college or university acquiring the behavioral repertoires and theoretical perspectives which qualify them to be called education professionals. They get their first job at Marcy school. None of what they learned seems applicable -- the students are too poor and routinely brutalized, their colleagues are too demoralized, the principal is too cynical, parents are victimized by an unforgiving set of circumstances which constitutes their daily lives. Putative experts who bring the most recent reforms presented in the guise of staff development are clueless. It's easy to see that teachers would become alienated from and hostile to an environment that prevents them from doing the professional job that they were trained to do.Anyon's claim that there's nothing special about Newark, that the same destructive processes are destroying education throughout the urban U.S., is indisputable. Furthermore, much the same applies to schooling in rural America. I've seen it in the West Virginia Coal Fields and in the poorest, most rural parts of central Kentucky.It's a cruel oddity that in all these places, whether urban and poor or rural and poor, the same sort of educational reforms were being sold to the same sort of disaffected teachers and administrators by state officials who haven't set foot in a classroom for 30 years.Until the context of education is massively reformed, bad educational jokes like No Child Left Behind will continue to be an intrusive nuisance for teachers and an embarrassment for the rest of us."},{"Title":"Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform","review":"Anyon writes a provocative study of the school system in Newark and how the children of the area have been affected by local and state trends in funding, politics and economics. Her conclusions are specific to the Newark situation, but they lend themselves to a large study. Namely, that the problems that exist in our urban schools are not to be fixed with overnight reform.Instead, the years of systematic abandonment and neglect by political officials and businesses have left the inner city, and those that reside in it, struggling to survive. Anyon paints this picture painfully well, and the book is a good read for those looking to understand why we can't educate poor and minority children."},{"Title":"Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform","review":"Jean Anyon studies school reform in the failing Newark School system, focusing on her case study of Marcy School. It is an insightful case stdy that educators can apply to help us understand and ssist other failing urban school systems in our country. This took place during a four year refom effort by the Newark district from 1989 through 1993. As a dedicated researcher, she continued her study for another year in other district schools after the reforms ended. Anyon spent time with both students and teachers to get to know them and their opinions, diving her great insight into their educational plight. She held workshops for the teachers and faculty, as a staff developer for cooperative teaching. She combined this with spending one day per week, for ten months in the classrooms, assisting the teachers in implementing her programs. She combines municipal and educational, historical research of Newark, using archived materials to help support her theories and findings. She used archieved materials dating back 100 hundred years. I feel she incorporated her extensive use of historical documents and background articles to prevent criticism or disregard of her conclusions for the current status of the Newark school systems. This research provides realistic insight into the cause of their situation, resulting in meaningful solutions. Newark is identified as a &quot;ghetto,&quot; wtih few businesses, dilapidated housing, and schools. She explains how their segregation and &quot;ghetto&quot; formation evolved wtih her research presented in chapter four. Anyon also makes us aware of the political problems that have been a critical part in the circle of poverty. The black areas have less political power to get their situation changed. She gives a historical account of how organized crime rule during the sixties, kept their unqulified friends employed, while letting the schools deteriorate under their rule. She also reveals mismangement of educational funds they received, by having to return the money when not spent in a timely fashion. Anyon reveals a circle of poverty and poor health in this community. It has been created over time and has become accepted as the norm by the residents of the community. The book does present a few weak pionts in Anyon's theories. One being that the only way to help change the city's educational dilemma is by changing the city's economic and political status. I think she misses suggesting methods to incorporate the city's students into the suburban schools. In summation fo her fingdings of this failing school system, she leads us to hypothesize as to what effects historical politics and economics have on modern day education systems. She presents us with research to suport her finding that society, over decades, has produced their current failing state of education, poverty, and racial isolation of this community. Her method to change this community's circle of poverty in these aspects is through a &quot;grassroots movement between educators and those that can ssist them to create better social conditions&quot; (p.168). She suggests that it is up to all of us, educators, healthcare workers, politicians, administrators, and parents; functioning as community members and concerned citizens; to become enraged enough to change this dire situation. &quot;Through a concerted social action-to work together to provide cities, city families, children, and their schools with a modicum of hope and a chance to excel&quot; (p.xvi). A vicious circle of poverty has crippled this community. Most likely, until suburban and urban residents pull their efforts together, the circle will continue to grow and spread their political, economic, and educational inequities."},{"Title":"Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform","review":"The book, Ghetto Schooling A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform, written by Jean Anyon, is an informative book concerning the issues surrounding urban education, funding, and racism among many groups. Ghetto School is divided into three sections, with 8 chapters, providing background of the Newark, New Jersey school system and plight of inner-city schools beginning in 1860 and following through to present day. The results of Anyon's research should be a wake up call for all involved in education, from educators to politicians, and parents. In my opinion, the question is now more relevant than ever. Which factors led to the inadequacy of educational opportunities for urban school districts? Anyon defines her research by &quot;describing the social milieu of isolation and poverty, then illustrate how these conditions affect urban schools. (Anyon 3) When looking back, Anyon has shown the implications for the future, central cities now hold only 29% of the nations population and comprise less than 12% of the national electorate (Judd and Swanstrom 1994, Anyon 1997). As mentioned through her research, the majority of the middle class tax base and industry in which supports both the middle class and school system have relocated to the suburbs. Within these events a deeper problem was created; inequalities within the school system of Newark itself. According to the Council of Great City Schools, large city districts (79%) are funded at a lower rate than are suburban schools; nationally advantaged suburban schools spend as much as ten times that spent by urban poor schools. (Anyon 7) With inner cities holding less than one-third of the total population, convincing voters that change is necessary and needed is a daunting task. To change the past, present, and future, reform of the inner city school is needed. According to Anyon, reform of the Newark inner city school districts will not happen until the economic and political systems in which the cities are enmeshed are themselves transformed so they may be more democratic and productive for urban residents. (Anyon 13) I found &quot;Ghetto Schooling&quot; to be a provocative and educational source of historical information. As a teacher, and future administrator, the need for understanding the vast array of social, political and legal mandates truly dictates not only education, but also the city and state in which they reside. Anyon creates a very realistic in description of past events, many of which are still seen today. The material presented not only punctuates, but makes a very colorful statement of the current economic situation facing many states, including Illinois. After reading this text, I have a better appreciation for the sheer complexity of school funding. Illinois uses three very complicated formulas for determining funding of public schools alone. Anyon's explanation of public education is complete, complicated, and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform","review":"I stumbled across this book while working on my thesis. This book really didn't relate to my area of inquiry but I felt compelled to pull it off the shelf. Four days later, and very little done on my thesis, I was shocked by the amount of graft and corruption within the historical account of New Jersey's Public School system.

She takes a look at the expansive school system from the years 1860- 1997. Her book looks at the failure of school reform but better yet the failure of the city and how it has failed to educate it's minority students through mismangement of money to political partronage that promotes unskilled teachers and adminstrators. She traces the school system as a product of the development of the city. To Jean Anyon, the city has a direct effect on the progress of the school. As she states, \\"The contours and fortunes of schools in the twentieth centruy have also been intimately linked to the economic transformations of the city--and to federal and state policy as well as to local and national corporate decision making\\" (156). In stating what she feels is an obvious, Anyon describes the rise and fall of Newark and how fiscal prosperiety directly affected the quality of schooling. She states that through several discriminatory practices by federal and state governments such as redlining, housing segregation, financial disparity between districts and even efforts by corporations to restrict municipal spending and borrowing, education in Newark took a turn for the worst. She also says that the decline in quality of education is aligned with the increase of minorities into the city and the exodus of middle class residents to the suburbs. Anyon does a good job of presenting the historical factors that have influenced education in the city. She also shows how this has occured in other major cities. Another selling pointo f the argurment is that she presents a reform agenda that although expensive does to the root of the \\"underclass\\" urban education problem. While in no way belittling the residents of the inner cities she calls for action from these individuals and how their participation in the process strenthens the ties of the community to education. Anyon's book is only the beginning in a long line of cities that are afflicted by the same ailments as Newark, NJ."},{"Title":"Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform","review":"Since as far back as formal education existed, Newark NJ school district has suffered from numerous problems. In the book Ghetto Schooling - A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform, Jean Anyon deals with the topic of the Newark school district and what has been done and what should be done in the future. The book begins with her experience of being in the Newark School system (Marcy School) as a member of a group trying to restructure eight schools in this school district. Then she follows up with a chronological break down by era of what went on in the Newark district and around the country. The book begins in the present, goes to the past, and finishes up with how we are supposed to learn from our past.In the present time, we see schools that are ill equipped, dirty, having unqualified staff, and chaos. These children come from poor homes (if they have a home), with chaotic lives, neglect, abuse, histories of poor helth and chronic health problems, emotional stress, anxiety and anger (Anyon, 1997). If the children are coming from home environments like this, it does not seem that it would take much to make them want to come to school. However, quite a few students that were interviewed did not want to be there. Why? They did not respect the teachers. They thought the teachers were only there for the money or could not find a job anywhere else. One student did not like the abuse inflicted upon the students by the teachers. This section of the book is the one that stands out above all else. The reason being, I cannot believe how these students are handled. What these teachers say and do is uncalled for. This stems from the fact that these teachers do not have the proper training to be a teacher. We are not going to stop this vicious cycle if we do not train these teachers. We learn how to parent from our parents, and how to teach from past teachers, unless otherwise trained. If I did not get anything else out of this book, I do know how not to teach.I am sure the information presented in this book is all true. It is just hard for me to fathom that a school district was ran this way without little interference from the outside. I know if this were the education my children were getting, I would definitely have something to say about it. I would be at every board meeting, every PTO and PTA meeting, be up at the school during class time, and hold these people accountable as well as my child. I have never been to or worked in a school of this nature. I also hope I never will. If I did though, I would pray that I would be a better, more caring, understanding teacher than the ones presented.I found this book to be a hard read. It included entirely too many statistics. If I had to come up with my favorite part of the book, it would be part 1. It was real and easier to read. My least favorite part was Chapter 7 - Class, Race, Taxes, and State Educational Reform: 1970-1997. It was cumbersome to say the least. It seemed to have more statistics than any other chapter. If I could change one thing about this book it would be to reduce the amount of numbers included and include more real life situations.Revisiting Marcy School got my attention again. It almost felt like I was there. I am not sure it is a place I would want to be. I know I would not go at this time in my life. I am not equipped to teach these kids. I sub in a small school district in Illinois and experience none of this. I probably would do more harm to these children than good. On the other hand, it sounds like they just need someone to care for them and let them know they are cared for. It broke my heart to hear what the white teacher had to say. She said,\\" These kids have major problems! Incest, drugs, the girls to from boyfriend to boyfriend. You look at them and say \`what's the matter,' and they cannot tell you. I have a little boy [in first grade] who's wondering where his mother went. No one knows. No wonder things go in one ear and out the other [when you're trying to teach them].\\"Another teacher said,\\"We think, \`they're only going to sweep floors' - why teach them science?\\"And another added,\\"When you realize who they [the students] are, you laugh, and you can't take it [teaching] seriously.\\"(Anyon, 1997)These statements made me want to help these boys and girls. Saying they were only going to sweep floors is such a self-fulfilling prophecy. Even if that is what they are going to do, science may help them someday. If these teachers cannot take teaching seriously, who could? These students need more teaching and caring than the average student does.Jean Anyon appears to have all the qualifications needed to write a book of this nature. As the books states she has her Ph.D., and is an Associate Professor at Rutgers University. She taught elementary grades in inner city schools in Bedford-Stuyvesant, NY; Philadelphia; and Washington D.C. She is Director of the Institute for Research in Urban Education on the Rutgers-Newark Campus. She has published widely on the relation of social class and race to issues of curriculum, equity, classroom practice, and school reform. This is her first book (Anyon, 1997).If I were asked if I would recommend this book to someone else, I would definitely respond with a hearty NO! If you are interested in research for this subject, you might find some useful information, with some careful reading. This just was not a book I could not put down. Usually I want to read a book from cover to cover in one sitting. This book seemed to be never ending."},{"Title":"Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform","review":"Anyon gives us a glimpse into the world of inner city schooling and everything that goes with it. This is an eye opening journey for educators that do not teach in the inner city schools. I do feel that she is way off and don't believe that some of her suggestions would actually work to improve the schools. She has not herself worked as an educator in the inner city schools. So how does she know that what she is reccommending will work?She does make a good point and that new funding is needed in the schools. It is just a matter of where to get those funds. I do believe that educationing our young children is a responsiblity for all of America, therefore everyone should help in the funding process. I do not think that one soul contributor should be used."},{"Title":"Jesse","review":"Reading Jesse was a good experience it helped me understand a little more on how my ethnicity group had to work to survive. It also helped me get my thoughts cleared about being a successful person. It not only showed what daily struggle Jesse faced but the lack of support from his mother. What I like about the book Jesse was how it showed Mexican children or teenagers working to make a living and to become something other than a field worker. There's nothing wrong with becoming a field it just should be for Mexicans. Mexicans should think about moving up.What I didn't like about the book was that it really didn't go into detail for me. It need a little more action or adventure to it. It was just tell story after story or situation after situation. A little more action would have made it a great book and not just an ok book.The reason I would recommend this book to other is because it came from a local and Hispanic writer. Gary Soto writes from out point of view what we go through what we suffer and what we have to detail. Its great to know that Gary Soto is a Hispanic provide. Recommending it only lets Hispanic know that have someone to be proud of."},{"Title":"Jesse","review":"I definitely enjoyed reading this book. I kept turning the pages of Jesse by Gary Soto. This book tells the story of a boy who drops out of high school during his senior year, and joins his brother at City College. The brothers meet new people, try to earn more money to add to the little they have, and get through the tough times of Richard Nixon and the Vietnam War. This book was very enjoyable to read because of the first person writing style and because Jesse, the main character, has a very different lifestyle than mine. The first person writing style helped me get a direct point of view from the main character. I also thought it was very different and fascinating to read about a different heritage (Mexican), and life, such as going to City College and having little money to live on. There were many aspects of this book that I enjoyed. As fine as this book is, there are some reasons why readers may not enjoy it. Some people may get restless with the slow-moving pace of the book. It was not a very suspenseful book. It is also a little repetitive. Some events happened more than once, such as Jesse thinking some event or item over and over again. Some readers may think the book is boring in the beginning, but if you keep reading, you will get to know the writing style and really enjoy the book.

This a completey believable book. It has real life situations that would really happen to mostly Mexican families. They have an abusive stepdad who just drinks and thinks less of his kids, Jesse and Abel. They are trying to get to college and when they do it seem like the whole world is against Jesse, in love,work and college. In fact he notices that society is against the Mexicans in general for work and education. And during these hardships he has to get through somehow.This book relates to me because of the hardships Mexicans and all immigrants are going through now because of prop HR4437.In general the prop represents the people in the book Jesse.just like the prop the people are against Mexicans. Somehow he will get through and so will we against prop HR4437."},{"Title":"Jesse","review":"This was a school assignment for my son. I read the book first so I could quiz him on it.

I found love on the Internet with help from The Ultimate Man's Guide To Internet Dating.Now I hear them last month talking about divorce!! My best friend was about to divorce his wife of 3 years and to be honest with you he wasn't the same guy he used to be. I figured that if they helped me find love they could help him with his divorce. I bought this book for my buddy and he has done a 360. I never liked his wife and my girlfriend didn't like her either. She always nagged him and was not a nice person. He was like a zombie because of her!!!

Not much new information, but does seem to do a good job of comparing the 2 kings to the rise of absolutism in France. It would be better if the author seperated the two kings into two different biographies."},{"Title":"Yo, Vikings!","review":"Emma lives in a world of wonder that the cynics and realists have not destroyed. Wonder is a marvelous land of believing where even the adults are wizards and mages. Like Joseph Campbell's hero, Emma is on a mythic adventure. Her quest wins her knowledge, friends, and a gift of epic proportions.A school assignment on world discoverers expands Emma's universe. She plunders the library, gathers knowledge and soon she becomes Emma the Red, Viking explorer. Yo, Vikings! is a celebration of story telling both oral and written. Emma hears stories from Mr. Sigurd, the children's librarian, and he directs her to the old tales of Norse history and mythology. She reads stacks of books, then takes notes and draws pictures illustrating what she is learning. She then enthralls her younger brother with stories of dragons, Viking longships , and sword fights.Judith Byron Schachner's tale introduces some major heroes and gods of Norse history and mythology. For her school report, Emma learns about Erik the Red's journey to Greenland and about his son, Leif Eriksson. Emma is proud to report that Leif came to North America 500 years before Christopher Columbus. In story time, Mr. Sigurd, Emma's helper figure, tells the children of Sigurd, the strong and courageous Norse warrior, and his heroic fight against the dragon Fafnir. Mr. Sigurd does not mention the name of the hero. By looking carefully at Mr. Sigurd's book in the illustration, the reader will see that the dragon slaying hero's name is Sigurd. In her journal, Emma shows Sigurd holding a shield that says \\"librarian\\" as he fights the dragon Fafnir. The god Odin is introduced as a giver of gifts and riding his eight legged horse, though no mention is made of his grimmer, darker qualities.Yo, Vikings! explores the childhood experiences of awe and wonder and is appropriate for ages about five to ten. The reader is invited to come along on an adventure with a young, female hero. Emma might hearten children, especially young girls, to learn and read for the joy of the adventure, just when girls need the encouragement. Interestingly, Judith Byron Schachner's fantastic story is a retelling of a family story; her daughter Emma actually did have a Viking ship in the back yard for a number of years. The truth in this story may lead other girls and boys to try new things, to learn for fun, and to believe in their dreams. Yo, Vikings! will inspire readers to do some exploring of Viking lore of their own at the library.Karen Woodworth Roman"},{"Title":"Yo, Vikings!","review":"I just bought this book today for my children.

Well, I know that I can always rely on Robin Robertson and I was looking forward to the release of this book. I have had wonderful results with her other vegetarian cookbooks including Vegan Planet, The Vegetarian Meat and Potatoes Cookbook, Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker and others. I actually own all of her cookbooks. It is amazing how she never fails to provide delicious, simple to prepare, reliable and flavorful vegetarian recipes and this newest cookbook doesn't disappoint!I highly recommend Carb Conscious Vegetarian for all vegetarian and vegan households. Actually, anyone who is interested in eating more healthfully can benefit from this collection of recipes. Plus, they are all creative and delicious. This book is different from some other vegetarian cookbooks because it doesn't rely heavily on dairy products or refined carbohydrates to add the bulk of meals. Every recipe is vegan and combines fresh vegetables, fruits, beans, soy, whole grains and spices to achieve great results.The Ginger Sherry Tofu with Green Beans and Water Chestnuts was so awesome that we made it two nights in a row and devoured it entirely. It is easy to prepare and the fresh taste was awesome. We also tried the Sultry Summer Salsa and that was one of the prettiest and best tasting salsas we have ever had. It is perfectly tangy thanks to the tomatillos (which I had never tried before) and the colors are beautifully vibrant with yellow, green and red. It was perfect and my hubby is a salsa connoisseur. We also tried yummy Spice-Rubbed Vegetable Kebobs, Many-Vegetable Bulgur Pilaf and White Bean Hummus with Green Chiles and Black Olives, again yummy! What impresses me the most about Robin Robertson's cookbooks is how she is able to keep things so simple and still pack a flavor punch. The results are consistently outstanding.Basically it boils down to a few key aspects for any good cookbook:Delicious food - Everything we have tried so far has been easy and very tasty.Reusability - We will make all of the recipes we tried again and are looking forward to making so many more recipes. This is the kind of cookbook that inspires you to get into the kitchen and actually cook and there are 150 recipes to choose from.Nicely laid out design - Carb Conscious Vegetarian has nice easy on the eyes green colored text with clean font and design.Must have a good index - This book has two very good indexes, one recipe index and one general index.Extras - She does a very good job explaining carbohydrates and includes several useful appendixes so that we can understand our carbohydrate consumption. Also every recipe has detailed nutrition information.To get all of the above from a tried and true vegetarian cookbook author at a low price is even better. I read lots of book reviews and would never want to steer anyone wrong. Do yourself a favor and pick Carb Conscious Vegetarian. My husband and I are very pleased with the results and I am sure that you will be too.Bottom line - This book makes it a pleasure to eat sensibly and eat well!"},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"When my husband developed acid reflux, it was recommended that he lower his carb intake. As long time lacto vegetarians (no fish, meat or eggs, yes to dairy), this sounded particularly challenging.I bought 3 different low carb cookbooks from Amazon a month ago: \\"Low-carb Vegetarian\\" by Celia Brooks Brown, \\"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes For Healthy Lifestyle\\" by Robin Robertson and \\"The New Glucose Revolution Low GI Vegetarian Cookbook: 80 Delicious Vegetarian and Vegan Recipes Made Easy with the Glycemic Index\\" by Dr. Jennie Brand-MillerAfter a month of consistent cooking I have rarely used Brown's \\"Low-carb Vegetarian\\" which is laden with ~50% recipes that use eggs. There are some great recipes in there if you eat eggs though.On the other hand, my copy of \\"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes For Healthy Lifestyle\\" by Robin Robertson is a bit dog-eared already. Delicious, innovative recipes with new ways to use foods common to the vegetarian and wonderful exploring of unusual but easily available new veggies and protein options.\\"The New Glucose Revolution Low GI Vegetarian Cookbook\\" by Dr. Jennie Brand-Miller was rich with information and great recipes. It taught me a lot.But by far Robertson's \\"Carb Conscious Vegetarian\\" is the best.I will say that I don't know these authors and am doing this to help a buyer who may be wondering which one to get...By the way, a low carb/lower acid diet has really eased the acid reflux my husband suffers from. We eat a main meal during the day and a protein drink at night, even if working: switched when consuming. And I am starting to lose weight...Hope this helps!"},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"My wife and I are vegan. She is always trying new recipes, and RobinRobertson's new cookbook, Carb Conscious Vegetarian is perfect for usboth. I love a hearty meal, my wife likes a lighter meal. Most of theserecipes can be made with a serving of pasta, rice, or potatoes on theside, or mixed in, so that both of us can enjoy a healthy, and myself abit heartier, meal. For example, the appetizers are great, because mywife will make several of them at one time, and make a side of roastedpotatoes along with them (for me) and that makes a fun meal. Many ofthe salads involve a combination of vegetables, tofu, tempeh, etc. to betopped on lettuce leaves. Instead of putting the \\"topping\\" on lettuce asmy wife does, I put it over brown rice. The soups and stews are reallydelicious, but if I need a little more food that night, I will throw insome pasta or tofu cubes or have some bread on the side. The side dishescan be served with roasted potatoes, rice, or pasta. The entrees aresatisfying enough on their own, but sometimes I will still make somegarlic bread or pasta on the side, and I'm plenty full. The BreakfastBites are fine as they are, filling enough for me in the morning. And theDivine Desserts are unbelievably satisfying. This cookbook is reallyversatile, and works great for that vegetarian or vegan couple or familywho enjoy great food, a healthy diet, and love to eat together, eventhough they are on different diet plans."},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian is full of fabulous recipes. You won't miss those high-carb foods when you start cooking from Robin Robertson's new cookbook. I have made several of the recipes and they are all delish! The Tempeh-Walnut Salad with Lime and Cilantro is filling and flavorful and makes a lovely lunch or dinner. The Black Bean and Sesame-Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms are really unique and fun. The Fennel and Artichoke Gratin with Three-Herb White Bean Pesto is great to serve company, it's so beautiful, and so easy to make. There are also lots of great stir-fry's, one of my personal favorite ways to cook my meals.And Robin really knows her sauces. Just that chapter alone is full of great recipes. My favorite is the Rich Man's Pesto, no wait, it's the Spicy Peanut Sauce, no wait, it's the Charmoula Sauce, I just can't make up my mind!Carb Conscious Vegetarian proves that you can eat healthy low-carb vegetarian meals, without sacrificing any flavor. In fact these recipes are so flavorful, you will want to keep cooking from this cookbook even after you lose all that weight! It is a lifestyle cookbook, one you can use every day, for many years to come."},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"This is an excellent cookbook, first off it is all vegan so no dairy or eggs are used although she does mention that milk could be substituted for some recipies. I appreciate its vegan content since I am one, but I know that vegetarian meals can be heavy on dairy as well as typical low carb meals. I loved the tofu benedict and made three of the soups (amazing!) there are great side dishes and new ways to try different veggies. I think the sauces and condiments section are a real bonus in this book. If you are looking for more vegan low carb, I also recommend \\"low carb vegetarian\\" by Margo DeMello, a little less fancy meals, but we use more of them regularly (especially the *chicken* caesar salad).i also appreciate the thoughtful intro about good and smart carbs, since its pretty much impossible to sustiain healthy balance being vegan and truly low carb."},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"If you are just looking for ways to make healthier meals for your family this is a winner whether you are a vegetarian or not. The premise of the book is to increase the whole grains, and decrease sweeteners and refined products. These suggestions are good for everyone.Being a numbers geek I appreciate that the book gives all the relevant nutritional information for each recipe. No matter what numbers you are monitoring the data is here for each dish.I particularly enjoyed the recipe for Chipotle Mashed Cauliflower. The Creamy Cucumber Dijon Dressing is also a very nice recipe. If you are looking for another way to get flax into your family I suggest the Apple and Oats Flaxjacks.Overall I got a lot of ideas from this book regarding how to increase the \\"health factor\\" in many of my family favorites. If you are interested in better health, this is a nice book to add to the cooking library."},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"I am not a vegan/vegetarian, but wanted to add more low carb vegan meals to reduce the amount of animal products we eat and to reduce carb intake as we are both pre-diabetic. Well, I am thrilled with this cookbook! I bought 7 vegan cookbooks recently, but I've cooked almost exclusively out of this book alone, and so far, all of the recipes have been GREAT! The 'Portobello Patties with Charmoula Sauce' recipe is out of this world! And the Cashew Creme is decadent. I loved the 'Edamame, snow peas, and bean sprouts with Ginger-lime Vinaigrette' salad. And the 'Victory Garden Stew' was excellent, although I added garlic, since I'm a definite garlic lover. Finally, I've tried every burger/cake recipe in the book with various sauces and have loved them all.You can't go wrong with this cookbook, although some of the ingredients may be hard to find, such as artichoke hearts - but I haven't given up, there's got to be some gourmet shops out there that carry them!If you want a cook book that contains a variety of TASTY vegan recipes, then this is the book you should buy!Sherry"},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"I have tried multiple recipes in this book and I have liked each one thus far.

There's no greater pleasure than trying new foods and learning the best way to prepare things, yet still be able to eat healthy.

I have been a long time vegetarian and recently went vegan. I had been lamenting to a friend that I was wanting to drop but a few pounds and seemed to be doing everything right with regards to diet and exercise. She recommended Robin's \\"Carb-Conscious Vegetarian\\" to me as a way of losing those last couple of pounds without deprivation. I immediately purchased the book and have loved every single recipe tried thus far.Anyone who wants to eat a healthier diet will love this book. It's well organized and Robin has even taken the time to provide the caloric breakdown for each recipe included in the book for those analytic-types out there who want to know precisely the fat grams, etc.If you're wanting to maintain or transition to a healthier diet and recognize that eating bowls of pasta or rice just isn't getting you there--I'd try this book. You will be satisfied and healthier for it!"},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"I've been a vegetarian since I was 17 (am 24 now) and always found it hard to avoid eating way too much pasta, bread, and other starches. This cookbook has opened up a whole new world for my boyfriend and I, as we are trying to South Beach Diet. He loves this cookbook, and he's not even a vegetarian! I recommend the chili that uses red lentils (there are two chili recipes), and the Paglio e Fieno w/ Cashew Sauce recipe that uses thinly sliced and steamed zucchini and squash instead of pasta.

I went through it and made a tentative meal plan so I could know fit together the nutrients the way that I wanted to.

Sadly, this book is now sitting in a kitchen drawer and I am looking for a different lifestyle (not diet) cookbook."},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"Each soup alone has over 20g of carbs! And that's just for soup not a meal! To lose weight (not just maintain your current weight) you can only eat 20-30grams of carbs per day, not per meal.Most of these veggie cookbooks are for the rich anyway, a lot of the ingredients are only available at fancy-pants stores like whole foods. I hate to say it but diets like Atkins are within reach for low-income folks. Who has time (or money) to find something called 'mirin' whatever that is"},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"I love this book! So far I've made the Spinach Pie with Walnut Crust, Braised Bok Choy with Walnuts & Ginger, and the Roasted Eggplant Lasagne with Wintertime Spinach Pesto...all have been phenomenally delicious! And I'm not even a full-time vegetarian, just someone who wanted to decrease my consumption of animal products for health and environmental reasons. In fact, I found this book after a traditional low-carb diet raised my cholesterol almost 25 points in 6 months (Carbohydrate Addict's Healthy Heart Program - CAHHP - by Drs. Heller & Vagnini). The low carbs had decreased my weight like a charm, but for some reason my particular metabolism also reacted atypically with increased cholesterol. I realized low-carb eating had almost doubled my consumption of animal products, and I knew I had to turn things around without going back to a high-carb diet and inevitable weight gain.Enter \\"Carb-Conscious Vegetarian\\"! It not only contains delicious all-vegan *lower*-carb recipes, but most of them are easy to make (don't be fooled by the fancy gourmet-sounding titles) and have large, satisfying portions. They aren't as low in carbs as traditional Atkins-type recipes, but don't forget to subtract the 'unusable' fiber content (which strangely is occasionally missing in some of the nutritional analyses!) - and read up on glycemic index/load. Low-carb is really based on the BLOOD SUGAR EFFECTS of different foods, not just carb grams!I usually make one of the recipes on a Sunday (when I have more time to cook) and have convenient leftovers for breakfast and/or lunch all week, then eat a regular meat/bad-carbs/veggies \\"Reward Meal\\" each day for dinner as directed in CAHHP. After a month of this, my cholesterol has gone back down to normal levels and my weight has stayed at goal...it's all about \\"good carbs\\" and the glycemic index/load, which Carb-Conscious Vegetarian touches on (you can do lots more research on your own about this). Once CCV teaches you which foods contain \\"good carbs\\", you have the freedom and discernment to find recipes that are both vegetarian & lower-carb from other sources like internet websites or in other cookbooks.I do agree with the review that complains about hard-to-find \\"gourmet ingredients\\", but I would estimate at least half of the recipes have ingredients that I can find even in my tiny one-grocery-store town. The rest I get on monthly shopping trips to the big city...after all, if you're serious about eating vegetarian, you're going to have to get used to buying some \\"unique\\" items! I like the fact that MSG-containing processed meat subsitutes (gardenburger, etc) are used sparingly and that the focus is on natural, whole foods. I love the international flavors in many of the recipes, and I'm so relieved to find that I can safely eat sensible portions of \\"good carbs\\" like beans and brown rice that are forbidden on traditional low-carb plans. Try it! Unless you're a really picky narrow-minded eater, you'll love it and so will your body!"},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"Having owned and enjoyed the authors other cookbooks, getting this one was an easy decision. The good reviews helped as well.After trying a few of the recipes, I call foul.Sauces with no thickening agent were runny, dressings were bland, and main entries that were just not palatable.I'll just tweak recipes from current cookbooks to make them low carb.Oh, and on a side note, it was interesting to note that on the authors web site, this title is not even mentioned among her many other, and delightful, books."},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"We bought this book because we were searching for a vegan cookbook that was focused on fresh, unprocessed ingredients and didn't rely on processed, faux meat products. We were not disappointed! Ms. Robertson has created a collection of recipes that anyone (vegan or otherwise) will enjoy. The ingredients are easy to find, and most of the recipes are quick to prepare. The nutrition information for each dish is also helpful in planning a satisfying meal.Some of our favorite dishes include the Guacamame (I will never eat plain guacamole again); Sesame Coleslaw with Daikon, Snow Peas, and Ginger (a huge hit at potlucks); Szechuan Portobello Mushrooms and String Beans (a little tofu and chopped cashews turn this delicious side into a main course); Fennel & Artichoke Gratin with White Bean Pesto (pureed white beans replace the heavy cream...so delicious!); Crispy Tarragon Tofu Strips with Mushrooms, Lemon, and Capers (like chicken picatta only waaay better); Black Bean & Sesame Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms (this will convert non-vegans it's so good); and Apples & Oats Flaxjacks (my husband asks for these every week).Bon appetit!"},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"This is an excellent \\"smart carbs\\" cookbook for experienced cooks. What I mean by that: most of the recipes are not perfect or always tasty if made per the instructions. However, the recipes give an experienced cook great ideas for recipes that with a few changes are delicious. Sometimes you have to add an extra seasoning or two, and sometimes you have to swap out vegan ingredients for vegetarian ingredients.I use the recipes mostly as they are, with just a few tweaks. For instance I made one of the asian tempeh and cabbage salads with canola mayo instead of canola oil. It added great depth and body to the salad.Since it is summer and hot, I'm very much into the salad section. There are some great ideas for salad ingredients in there that you can just spruce up with some extra seasonings or ingredient swaps.All in all, this book has given me great ideas for recipes. And since I usually alter recipes to my tastes, this is not a problem for more. I would not recommend it for a new cook who follows recipes to the letter."},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"I just received this recipe book and have already identified a number of recipes for meals this week. The recipes contain ingredients that are easy to obtain in my somewhat rural area. I really like that the author provides the nutritional information for each recipe (including calories, fat, protein, carbs, fiber, cholesterol and sodium). Although I was looking for a low-carb vegetarian recipe book, I am also concerned with fat and cholesterol content and the recipes in this book also appear to be conscious of those as well. Lacto-ovo vegetarians could easily substitute regular cheese for soy cheese and add eggs to some of the recipes."},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"Not only does this book have great recipes, but it will add ideas to your meal planning for those who are low carb eaters!I'm still impressed with all the great recipes.

This book offers a HUGE variety of creative recipes, with easy to find ingredients. The directions are complete and come with helpful hints - while at the same time stay low carb.This is one of my favorite cookbooks - filled with great tasting healthy meals! The recipes are uncomplicated and you will experience flavor, freshness, and seasonality of each vegetable in the dish. For vegetarians and meat-eaters - this book is a must read to cut your carbs.This book is truly useful for those that are interested in becoming vegetarians, or even vegans.

If that had been clear from the title I wouldn't have bothered with it, and unless you're looking for vegan recipes primarily it's probably not worth the money. There are a few places where she suggests you could add cheese, but nothing that takes advantage of the variety of possibilities for a real vegetarian which of course include eggs and cheese. I think it's pretty manipulative to call it a vegetarian cook-book when it is not.Also, most of the recipes are based on tomatoes, mushrooms and eggplant - the pretty standard and boring vegetarian go-to veggies. I was hoping that someone who takes vegetarian living seriously might have a bit more inventiveness - there are only three kinds of squash used in the recipes for example, and not a single turnip or beet recipe in the index. The variety is really poor. And in the 'main dish' section most of the recipes are just larger portions of side-dishes (three-rice pilaf or roasted vegetables).Worst of all, most of the recipes aren't really any lower-carb than we usually have. She eliminates processed and refined carbs and sugars like white rice and pasta, but we figured that out for ourselves years ago. This book is more or less a waste for anyone who is interested in expanding their repertoire of recipes."},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"I wish they called this book \\"Carb Conscious Vegan\\". This is my personal preference, but I miss the eggs and cheese."},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"I've had this recipe book for a few months now and have been able to try out a lot of recipes. They have all turned out very well! They do a good job making sure things aren't bland. That does mean you have to watch you follow the ingredients or make sure you compensate if you leave out some flavorful ingredients. The salad recipes give a good mix-up of the usual if you are all salad-ed out. The breakfast options are great too because it can be hard to get away from bad carbs at breakfast time.I have noticed though that they do a good job including a lot of different ethnic cuisine and represent a lot of different kinds. That is good for variety, but bad for buying ingredients. Some ingredients overlap recipes but some don't. They have a miso soup recipe but if you don't make anything else you'll have to make a lot miso soup to use up all the miso. (Which is what I have done).A lot of these recipes can be modified for the Esselstyn style of recipes as well.This was well worth it for me!"},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"I loved this cookbook. My daughter is a vegan and I was concerned that she wasn't getting a balance of proteins in her diet. This cookbook really gives some great recipes from an author who has researched the foods and combinations that give a healthy diet without resorting to high starchy carbs. I will order it for myself as well even though I eat meat. It's always a good idea to include more vegie entres and go without meat as much as possible. I have cancer and am really looking into how diet influences health."},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"I'm not sure what other people are looking for in a cookbook but for a busy mom like me this cookbook wasn't ideal, most of the recipes required 10+ ingredients many of which are not commonly found in the kitchen or grocery store. If you are the type of person who has unlimited amount of time to prep and cook your meals then this book would most likely be a great addition to your library but if you're like me and have only 20 minutes TOPS to get something in the oven or on the table then I'd suggest you look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"I just got this cook book. Many of the dishes look very good. So far my husband and I have prepared two recipes; both were decent and we would make them again. The ingredients are very easy to find and are not too expensive.The recipes seem to pack a lot of nutrients, and more protein than I usually get, but they also seem like they do not have enough calories to keep a person alive... after each meal my husband is craving more food. Most \\"main events\\" have less than 200 calories per serving.Our main complaint is that these dishes are not \\"quick and easy.\\" (Though the cook book didn't claim to be.) Usually we prefer dishes that can be cooked in under 30 minutes. A lot of these require 15-30 minutes of prep, and then 30-60 minutes baking/simmering. After a long day of work, we usually go for something faster, otherwise we're eating at 10pm. I've come across a couple that are faster, so they may be our repeat dishes.Overall, I like it."},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"Just what I was looking for.

I was in for a big surprise. A lot of vegetarian recipes are full of cheese and pasta. And a lot of vegan cookbooks were all seiten and sauces. I wanted tasty, savory, healthy, not too processed, recipes. If I wanted to bring plants to the table I knew they had better taste great. And I don't want a bunch of gluten seiten slathered in BBQ sauce. Why is that healthy? Then I came across this book by Robin Robertson. I have made several recipes and they have all been fantastic! I like that most of them use vegtables and grains without a lot of vegan junk. Robin really delivers. I have since purchased more of her books and they are just great. Wonderful meals, easy to prepare. You can't go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle","review":"I have several go-to vegetarian cookbooks which have similar recipes.

(Minirth-Meier Clinic Series)","review":"I'm good at being angry. I make people laugh with my cutting sarcastic humor - unless of course, they are the target. I have the power in my tongue to both raise people up from the pits and turn someone inside out or become a flame-thrower and torch an entire room to a crisp. I also use anger in the gym and have built a strong body. But what this workbook is making me realize is that I could have humor, quick-wittedness, strength and muscles, etc. without the anger, especially the unbridled anger. It is teaching me where my anger really comes from and why it comes, what situations. I have already got 3 other friends who want the workbook - and I have to send one of them to Hawaii sometime this week. That's another thing I've noticed. I attract angry, sarcastic friends too. But I'm confident that after this workbook, I'll be able to help them to help themselves. I mean, as much as I like my anger sometimes, I've seen it nearly destroy me and my close relationships too. It's not a good friend to have. It can't be trusted and will let you down. It may be hard, but I'm learning how to say good-bye to my old friend anger. I know I'll still get angry, and I should at times because God gave us sense of right and wrong. But how I handle it will be different, and healthy. That's the key and that's what this workbook is all about."},{"Title":"The Anger Workbook: A 13-Step Interactive Plan to Help You...

(Minirth-Meier Clinic Series)","review":"I was very surprised at how HELPFUL the book was. Someone bought me the book and it sat on my shelf for years. I was very skeptical. Yet when I opened the book it engaged me right away. My husband has extreme anger issues, so I will loose my temper dealing with him.This booked helped me by explaining to me that my anger was legitimate but I had a responsibility to remain calm and steadfast and not be moved by my circumstances. I too did not know the book was a Christian book. I was pleasantly surprised because the book was NOT judgemental turn or burn, rather it gently explained how the Bible encourages us to think different about being angry. Be angry but do not sin...The authors gave great examples about new ways to act in the situation. I am most pleased with the fact that it also taught me how to relate to my kids better. It mentions how when we say \\"Wow you got a B I am so proud\\" we are really limiting interaction with our child a better way would be \\"WOW you got a B I bet you feel good about that, did you study hard?\\" Now this new way I am engaged in a conversation with my child and connecting with them on how they feel. I recommend this book ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO CHANGE Christian or NON CHRISTIAN.The negative reviews are just angry people who DO NOT WANT TO CHANGE and find any excuse NOT TO CHANGE. So if you are not a Christian yet you see the destruction anger has caused I know this book will make you feel as excited as I am and it will help you change...

I figured the 13 step was like the 12 step for Alcoholics and included a spiritual view.

Next time I'll read the \\"about the author\\" section, which revealed it's written by a christian counselor....whoops.Just thought I'd give others a heads up on what they're buying, in case you flip through in a hurry like I did, and discover reading bible versus just makes you MORE angry, because that would just be counter-intuitive :)"},{"Title":"The Anger Workbook: A 13-Step Interactive Plan to Help You...

I have found it to be an invaluable tool for identifying core sources of anger and the symptoms of anger as an illness. It uses a simple, direct approach involving both spiritual axioms (mainly Biblical) and actual case histories of patients of one of the authors (Dr. Frank Minirth) to show how anger can manifest in our lives and the appropriate responses and spiritual solutions to angry feelings and behavior.

Nor did I grow up going to church a lot. I feel like the writer switches to his opinions, and the bible too much. If the writer, talks about certain versus in the bible.

I picked it up because there is a chapter about dealing with children's anger issues, and I hoped it would help me with my frequently-angry 9 year old.The book's easy-to-scan layout made this chapter a quick read. The heading are insightful, for instance, \\"Don't Be Threatened by Your Child's Anger,\\" or \\"Let Choices and Consequences Shape the Child.\\" However, I feel that the discussion in the text did not help with my particular situation.

Despite the reviews about religion and Christianity I picked it up with an open, objective mind.As a person who has suffered with anger issues for more than 25 years I can say that I've had so much help from this book, even more help than my therapist. The impact of writing out personal things inside the book is very helpful to get a better understanding of the material and make it more personal. I've always felt it important to write my thoughts down to get a better understanding of myself, rather than just speaking them out loud to a stranger, and this book does that.I'll admit that there was alot of references to Christianity, but I was able to take the core beliefs (I DO believe in God, and love for all man) and put the book to that use. It has given me a greater understanding of myself and why I used to get so pissed off.Just understand that in order for Anger Management to really work, it will take time. The foundation may be laid out in a matter of minutes (depending on how quick you read), but the real work (changing your ways and outlook) takes time.

First, it's pervasive Biblical answers without presenting them in ways palatable for non-Christians makes it a poor tool to use with anyone other than Christians. Secondly, the book's vocabulary is written at the college level. I have a Ph.D. myself and can easily read and understand it, but good communication uses the most commonly used and clearly understood words; why fill a book with long words and jargon when you're trying to communicate to a broad audience? Third, I thought the emphasis of the book was strongly tilted to subconscious or preconscious emotionally driven ideas, with relatively little presented on basic and practical anger managment tools and how to apply them in different situations. I applaud the authors' attempts to communicate anger management principles in light of Scripture, but am disappointed in how they put it together."},{"Title":"The Anger Workbook: A 13-Step Interactive Plan to Help You...

The reasons for anger are in-depth and can easily relate to anyone's life, however, the solutions are not for everyone.

(Minirth-Meier Clinic Series)","review":"I purchased this book a case at a time to be used in an anger recovery program I started at my church. We were doing some lay/counseling when I realized that this area had a desperate need that wasn't being fulfilled. What I did was used the chapters like a 12 stage program, using two chapters a night, and going through the material in small groups. It worked really well. I repeated the process as a 13 week program, and as a four week program. I did find even though the material is quick and easy reading some of the participants in the program didn't read the material ahead of time like they were instructed. I found I had to summarize the chapters in two to three page handouts, and take some of the self analysis tests and have them work those during the weekly group counseling. That worked well. I find if the material is read, then talked about together in a small group, say an existing bible study, it really helps. Just using the book on your own may not be as helpful, but it is better then not doing anything. The chapters help you to get to the root of the cause of your particular anger issues. The self tests are a insightful tool. Not all chapters fit everybody.

I tried to get through it anyway, but after two valiant attempts (if I do say so myself) I decided I couldn't do it. I wish I could get my money back but unfortunately I wrote it in (as the book instructs) before I saw the religious stuff. Also, nowhere on the front does it say anything about religion, and only in tiny, tiny text above the barcode does it say it should be categorized as \\"religious\\" and the category \\"psychology\\" is absent."},{"Title":"The Anger Workbook: A 13-Step Interactive Plan to Help You...

My treatment team ordered this book thinking it would have good information to give to the men we work with. We were completely SHOCKED to find out that this book is Christian based! It says NOTHING about being religious based on the front, the back, or in any description. Yet, the book quotes the Bible and expresses explicitly Christian ideas. Because we work in a state facility, we can not use this book. The authors need to state clearly on the front of the book and in the description that the book expresses Christian ideas and is designed for Christian readers. We were very very disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Anger Workbook: A 13-Step Interactive Plan to Help You...

I read this book some time ago and recognized I had a problem with anger, though I didn't rant and rave. This book helped me let go of frustrations and relax control. The authors make the point that anger can be subtle or violent. Frustration, criticism, irritation and depression can be traced to anger. The Anger Workbook gives clear, psychiatrically and biblically sound information about anger and how to over come it. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Anger Workbook: A 13-Step Interactive Plan to Help You... (Minirth-Meier Clinic Series)","review":"The subtitle says it all: \\"an interactive guide to anger management\\". This workbook is based on Christin principles and Biblical verses. It is very thorough and I highly recommend it. This workbook gets down to business by completely focusing on the most important concept: how to identify anger. This actually surprised me a bit as I hadn't thought about other emotions being connected to, or resulting from anger. For example, irritablility, annoyance, frustration, etc. Although, these emotions may not be associated to all anger, it certainly gets you thinking about the source - or why - why do you feel so frustrated?The workbook also has checklists to help guide you through the processes of identifying and managing anger. It also has very helpful examples that explain just what an item on a checklist is referring to. I found that extremely helpful in fully completing the process, rather than glossing over it. You were most likely have many, \\"Uh Huh\\" moments. I know I did; and I had read other books on anger.The workbook is divided into four parts: Identifying Your Anger; Anger Thrivies on Unmet Needs; How Other Emotions Create Anger; and, Applying New Insights about Anger. This is a very thourough workbook and I highly recommend it. Even if you don't feel anger is a problem for you, if you are struggling emotionally, I am certain you will get much out of this book. You may not realize you have hidden anger and this workbook will help you identify hidden anger and manage it.

(Minirth-Meier Clinic Series)","review":"I read the Anger Workbook, in exchange for review from Booksneeze.com. The book was wrote by Les Carter and Frank Minirth. The book was also published by Thomas Nelson.I chose this book because I have anger issues. I have a strong desire to knock people upside the head on a daily basis, not to mention my anger on some unresolved issues, I am working on. Part one of the book talks about identifying your anger. Anger do not always have to be overt or even aggressive. I can be passive aggressive on a lot of issues, irritable, or annoyed. I also will withdraw from people. I am definitely impatient when things do not go as planned. For example, If I need to clean, but have to deal with Brad's meltdowns all day. I am angry because I still have a room/house to clean, but it has to wait until I calm the boy down.I definitely want to buy the book because I want to write in the exercises provided, such as the anger inventory. A lot of those statements applied to me. The book provides many exercises for people to define their anger, inventory anger, and resolve anger issues.For example, Minirth and Carter discussed how anger may be prevalent when a person is rejected or invalidated or feels a lack of respect. I also got angry when my needs and wants was not met. I have experienced this type of anger before. The book also has a Christian focus. When I am angry, I need to turn to God, instead of liquor or violence or sex (glad I am celibate now). I also need to admit that I am angry. If I do not resolve my anger, then the cycle of anger continues (diagram in the book. Love it). I am one of those folks, who suppress anger. I need to communicate feelings more often, but I have a distrust in people, in general. The book also says I need to take responsibility for my anger, and not rationalize it. I also need to learn how to forgive others.I love this book."},{"Title":"The Anger Workbook: A 13-Step Interactive Plan to Help You...

Many of the problems leading to addiction and marital friction can be traced to internalize anger. The Anger Workbook has helped many over the years.I usually assign a chapter and then we talk about it in the next session. It often takes six months to get through Anger. But then the goal is not to get through the book, but to get over anger and its consequences.

This requires you to spend time and effort toward learning about your own anger issues (and note, as in the description above, it's not just violent anger) and coming out a better person, better in touch with yourself and your feelings. The biggest thing you will learn is to discern what is actually causing your anger.I've taught my sons that it's okay to be angry, it's not okay to act angry. This book will help you work through your anger issues in a methodical manner. It does rely on Biblical principles, but not to the point of it being \\"preachy\\".The format of the book is easy to follow. It has 13 steps, each with its own chapter. The chapters are long. I think a week in each chapter is adequate and really allows you to work through each step. I like that there is a chapter regarding anger in children.

I can understand how a christian viewpoint can be considered helpful, but was disappointed that the book makes no reference to the christian viewpoint on the back of the book.

(Minirth-Meier Clinic Series)","review":"\\"Will my quality of life be greater if I choose to hold on to my anger rather than releasing it?\\"There is no lack of anger in our world today. There is anger, especially this year, with elected officials, and on a daily basis with family, bosses, teachers, and even the family pet. But the question asked by the authors of The Anger Workbook: An Interactive Guide to Anger Management, Drs. Les Carter and Frank Minirth, is a question that many people are asking and seeking answers to. I believe that this helpful and comprehensive guide to anger management provides those who are working to manage their anger as well as those who trying to cope with angry people with a helpful and hopeful process and practical information.The core of the book is built around what the authors call the \\"Thirteen Steps Toward Anger Management\\" These steps are also grouped into four parts: Identifying Anger, addressing steps one and two that present the idea angry people express anger in different ways; Anger Thrives on Unmet Needs that arise out of excessive dependencies, feeling controlled, believing myths such as \\"letting go of my anger means I am conceding defeat,\\" and \\"self-inflicted anger;\\" How Other Emotions Create Anger - such as pride, fear, loneliness, and inferiority; and Applying New Insights about Anger Reduction which address the issues of child anger, why anger lingers, and learning to be accountable as you deal with anger. Each chapter includes several checklists and exercises designed to help the reader process each of the steps in a practical way.And in each of the chapters there are many, many insights that are practical and hopeful no matter what your stage of life is and whether you are married or single. For example in the chapter that addresses Step 11 Manage A Child's Anger the authors say \\"perhaps the greatest error parents make is letting the child set the agenda for how emotions are managed in the family.\\" And they go on to offer six ideas they believe are \`effective\\" in responding to children's anger. 1. Don't be threatened by your child's anger. 2. Let choices and consequences shape the child. 3. Don't preach. 4. Don't major on the minors (meaning don't let minor problems deplete your parenting energy supply). 5. Share your own experiences. 6. Incorporate spiritual insights delicately.I used the first edition of this book several years ago with a group of teens and found it to be helpful then. I find this revised edition, published by Thomas Nelson, to be just as helpful. And as I read it, I found myself nodding in agreement to some of the suggestions and insights offered. And while this is a faith-based book, do not let the evident Christian tone keep you from learning some helpful practices and insights in gaining control of your anger, or helping someone else with theirs. And while this book is great to read individually, it is a workbook, and I suggest that it is best used in a group setting.I give this a book a \`great' read.Note: I was given an eCopy of this book (Kindle format) by Booksneeze, the Thomas Nelson blogger review program, in exchange for a review.

It starts off with how to identify one's anger. It continues in saying how anger thrives on unmet needs and it is also created by other emotions. It includes methods in reducing your anger. What I really liked about the book came in the first few pages. It had a list of the 13 steps toward anger management which breaks it down in layman terms.Let's face it we as humans get angry. Some of us more so than others. Even if we don't consider ourselves as angry people this is a good book to check yourself on this topic.After each chapter is a check list and questions for the reader to do and see where they stand. If we are truly honest with ourselves this check and balance can be very useful to us. Another thing I really liked about this book were the quotes that were motivating and uplifting for me. Some of the quotes are from the Bible. While that might turn some people away, it didn't me.

This bomb destroyed all human, and most animal life, on the planet. The only reason that Denis Grafton and his friends survived was that they were abducted by the alien Vulcanoids prior to the accidental extermination. They were returned to the Earth to serve as test animals to see if the atmosphere was still capable of supporting life. The Earthmen, and their friends the Virians and Nagani, after establishing themselves on the empty planet then struggle to overthrow their Vulcanoid captors.The style of the book is that of a journal kept by the chief character- somewhat along the lines of Robinson Crusoe. There must something to the tale, for I actually remembered the storyline after over four decades. That's much more than I can say for most the modern stuff that gets published these days...If you enjoy it, then try the sequel- CHILDREN OF THE VOID."},{"Title":"Without Estrogen: Natural Remedies for Menopause and Beyond","review":"I liked Ito's book.

Unlike most Lessing books, I found this 1 unremarkable. Overall, it reminded me of an angst-free 'The Four Gated City' (my favourite Lessing read). Compared with the 'The Four Gated City', instead of an island off the west(?) coast of Britain, we get impoverished AIDS-ravaged Africa. The African setting and characters are a stark contrast to the well-nourished middle class London characters - affecting."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"Structured in two sections set in London and Africa, The Sweetest Dream is an interesting chronicle of the turmoil of western ideology in the post-World War era. Lessing bitterly attacks the dogmatic views on communism and justice held by leaderships which were soon forgotten when they rose to power. Instead, her heroines are women (Julia, Frances, Silvia) whose political positions are not so defined but who rise above their circumstances to provide care and support to those around them. The section set in Africa is particularly intense and vivid. On the other hand, plotwise the story meanders too much and often loses focus, specially in the 60's part. I got the feeling that the novel would have improved with better editing."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"but I wanted to finish it- I liked the characters - the comings and goings that politicals tend to attract.

The era is evoked by Lessing in her typically intelligent prose, with characters who are well-defined and a plot that, although very loose, is always interesting. Halfway through the book, however, the young Sylvia leaves to become a doctor in ravaged Africa, and when she arrives there the book loses all its focus. It's a steep decline from the book's enjoyable first part, and is emblematic of Lessing's tendency to (in her later works) go off the deep end and never really find her way back. Lessing is interesting throughout the book for her powers of observation, as well as how she defines the character's desires and the way they intersect, but the book nevertheless quickly becomes a tedious chore to finish as the plot offers a dwindling amount of storytelling for the reader to hold onto (or even be interested in). The end result is a mess, a beautiful one that is written in earnest with genuine compassion at its center, but a mess nonetheless. Tepidly recommended for Lessing completists only."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"I was attracted to this book by the title and by the fact that Doris Lessing has won the Nobel Prize in literature in 2007 (highlighted in the cover). The book starts by narrating the life of Frances in London in the 1960s in a big house with several residents. It dwells on the popularity of communism at that time, and its failed promises, often reminding me of 'Animal Farm'. Overall, as a book and as a novel, I found it uninteresting and difficult to read. There are too many irrelevant characters such as Jill and Geoffrey; the timeline is sometime very slow, sometimes very fast, sometimes skipping several years at once; some major events take only some paragraphs, while other more trivial ones take several pages; and the focus of the book shifts from one character to another, to Sylvia. It definitely lacks a storyline that gives cohesion and life to the book, it lacks drama, suspense, romance... and it left me wondering what was the book title all about."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"A good plot diluted with far too many sub-plots, some of which were rather contorted.With remarkably few words this author can conjure up a vivid scene e.g.(pg.14)\\"she would go slowly upstairs, leaving behind her on the stale air the odours of flowers and expensive face powder.\\" However, at other times the story is bogged down with far too much detail.I liked some of the social and half-humorous statements that popped up from time to time. e.g the author's take on international conferences where \\"they get paid to travel to some beauty spot and talk nonsence....they take off every day to see the lions and the giraffes and the dear little monkeys and I don't think they notice the land is perishing from the drought.\\" (437).There were a vast number of characters in this book, making it difficult to keep track of everyone. What became of Clever and Zeberdee? We don't know. What became of Rose, the journalist,who came to Zimlia and tried to undermine and wreek havoc for Sylvia? That thread was dropped unceremoniously. Why so much attention to Colin's daughter, Celia, at the very end? Above all how does the name of the book fit this story?"},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"After mentioning this book several times, and keeping us waiting, that she would fictionalize the whole theme and characters... came as a surprise.

But then the book took a \\"left\\" turn into Africa and the predictable story of corrupt rulers, starving villagers and AIDS.The novel had no forward motion. Events happened. People grew older and did whatever they did. But there was no real plot. I had the feeling Lessing, who must be in her eighties, simply wanted to get all of this down on paper before she died."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"I found this novel to be cumbersome and uninspiring. There was not one likable character. I wanted to take Frances by the shoulders and shake some sense into her."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"Doris Lessings's 24th novel, \\"The Sweetest Dream\\" concerns itself with people from whom we never seem to find escape, even if we want to...family members.This is a book that many people may not like. It's fairly long, not divided into chapters and, for the most part, lacks a plot. Rather than plot, Lessing chooses to concentrate of the needs of family members instead...immediate family members and extended family members. This is a book filled with \\"issues\\" and each character seems to have his or her opinion on each and every one of them. If the book seems too long, consider this: the pages are filled with so much dialogue during the discussion of these \\"issues\\" that they (the pages) simply fly by. It really doesn't take long to read \\"The Sweetest Dream.\\"I wouldn't say that this book is \\"about\\" anyone in particular, although its heart and soul is Frances Lennox a British actress and writer, who, at a very young age, made the mistake of marrying Johnny, a devout communist. Although she attempted to correct that mistake, she seems to only become mired even more deeply in Johnny's troubled life and times.Frances and her two teenaged boys are at home much of the time while Johnny cavorts in various parts of the world. He only seems to light long enough to deposit yet another person on Frances' doorstep for her to take care of. (The latest being Johnny's current wife.) Frances finally finds a little peace and solace in the home of Johnny's widowed mother, Julia. This is a house filled with misfits: Frances' and Johnny's sons' friends and Sylvia, the troubled, anorxic daughter of Johnny's current wife. Although Frances dreams of the theatre, the need for cash seems to trap her in the world of journalism instead. Meantime, she's become the \\"family\\" caretaker and caregiver, much to Julia's distress.Why doesn't Frances tell the selfish and self-centered Johnny when to quit? After all, his own mother thinks he's a cad, a brute, a loser. Frances, though, just keeps on lavishing love while her dreams of the theatre and a real man by her side seem to be slipping away. To find out whether they really do or not, you'll have to read the book.While \\"The Sweetest Dream\\" is a very well-written novel with a premise that seems to have all the requirements, as I read, I realized that something was missing from the narrative. It is passion, fire. The characters seem almost defeated from the start. While believable, they are somewhat flat. I think Lessing needed to delve more deeply into their hearts and souls. It is only in the book's final development that Lessing really lets us care. And no, it isn't too late.In the final analysis, however, \\"The Sweetest Dream,\\" though a little flat, is still a wonderful book and one any fan of Doris Lessing absolutely should not miss."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"While there are many critiques of the radical left written by conservatives (often as dogmatic and out of touch with reality as their targets), this is a critique from a liberal/moderate left viewpoint that should touch a chord to people who are concerned about the injustices in the world while knowing that there are no simple solutions. The title of the book refers to the dream world that will come after the \\"glorious revolution.\\"This book is in the form of a narrative about a group of people from the sixties until our time. The plot is rather weak and several of the characters are extreme stereotypes but they and the story serve as a vehicle to chronicle the social evolutions of the last 40 years and it is there where Lessing is at her best giving wonderful snapshots of the times while providing her sharp social commentary. The story takes place in London and a fictional African country that seems to stand for Zimbabwe. There are strong sketches of the suffering of the African people, emphasizing the role of the local corrupt despots in contributing to their misery. Lessing does not use the term, but I have heard Africans describing their new elite as the \\"black British\\". Her descriptions do justice to the term. She provides devastating pictures of the radical left, both of the old time Communists and of the \\"new\\" left. Comrade Johnny is as irresponsible a husband and father as one can possibly imagine and at the same time an unrepentant Stalinist who completely disregards reality. His dogmatism may seem unreal but I had the misfortune of knowing such people when I was growing up (outside the U.S.) and they are indeed as dogmatic as Lessing describes them (and often almost as irresponsible as comrade Johnny). The main sympathetic characters are three women, unselfish in the extreme. Johnny's mother Julia, his first wife Frances, and his stepdaughter Sylvia provide the models for women who keep families and societies together in each of three generations. There is also an African woman, Rebecca, who plays a similar role in a mission and eventually she dies from AIDs transmitted to her by her husband. Sylvia works as a doctor in an African mission hospital and she provides the main link between the two geographical locales. Most of the male characters are unsympathetic, from the corrupt African officials to the globe trotting agents of \\"philanthropic\\" organizations that tend to do more harm than good. However, there are several female villains as well. One of them, Rose, is a vitriolic yellow journalist as self-centered and irresponsible as the male villains. Lessing provides devastating and funny sketches of her and other extreme feminists. With all her feminism Rose complains that \\"political correctness\\" is plot of the American imperialists to take over the world. Another ultra-feminist comes across the statement that the \\"female mosquito transmits malaria\\" and rails against the \\"fascist\\" establishment that she thinks is responsible for the statement.Because political and social commentary is a big (and the strongest) component of this book the reader's own political orientation will affect the enjoyment of the book. If you think that Stalin has been misunderstood, or if you think that social problems will be solved by posting the ten commandments in schools, this is not a book for you."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"This is a wonderful novel about an extended, 60s-style household: for one reason or another - damaged families, poverty, even laziness - people congregate to heal and party. There are two strong women at the center of it: a German immigrant and her daughter-in-law, whom the former's do-nothing, Marxist son abandoned with two young grandchildren. The reader follows all of their fates over a period of about 40 years, from war-torn London to a fictional developing country near S Africa. It is vivid and moves very swiftly.The characters are extremely well developed and exist in a kind of static balance even as they change and grow: there is always at least one angry and presumptuous taker, one giving and loving soul who is saving someone, one person healing and ready to move into a do-gooder role themselves. Etc. When one leaves the nest, another seems to take her place in rapid succession, and most of them tend to return as if to their own families. The balance of personalities is well thought out and realistic.What distinguishes this novel from those that are similar is that, rather than romanticizing the characters in some two-dimensional way, Lessing is simply relentless in showing their shortcomings and limitations. Fate does not deal kindly with any of the characters, though some (not necessarily the nice ones) do better than others; the evil ones rarely get theirs, though they lead rather sad lives, and the good ones must struggle very hard just to tread water.Lessing is also very hard on all the ideologies that are floating through the plot: she goes after communists, hippies, feminists, the internationalist development elite, journalists, and even Third World leaders. In other words, there are no simple answers; instead, the questions just get tougher. While there is a lot of humor in this, it is very dense, a kind of reverse history of idealism, showcasing the self-serving egotism that underlies the motives of virtually all the characters. What is amazing is how well it succeeds in bringing these ideas to life through the characters, though I found the second half of the book, much of which takes place in Africa, less strong than the first half.Finally, the people are all extremely English. This means that there are many levels to read the book on, with subtexts implied rather than stated outright. Far more tedious than that is the patience of those suffering or being taken advantage of: I wondered what martyr complex led them to tolerate real jerks who turned around and betrayed them in horrendously destructive, cruel, and selfish ways. (I would have kicked them out without a thought, but then I am only married to a Brit and far less tolerant than she.) That is the only tedious bit in this truly fine novel.Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"This story centers around three women, Julia, Frances and Sylvia, each one a very strong central character interweaving with each other throughout the book..I enjoyed the book and found it exceptional..in some instances the plot did fall a bit, but the tempo picked up again quickly..I feel it brought home the real situation of the poor in a third world country that very few of us in the affluent west realize ..the tragedy of a complete family being stricken by AIDS which at that time period was not recognized as a disease, but a evil spell..cast by shamans of local tribes..Lessing the fine writer that she is proves with age one gets better!!"},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"IN THE SWEETEST DREAM the author creates an irresistible force. She objectively explores the confusion of swinging London\`s post-WWII children as they boogie through the night in the 1960s and, exhausted, drift into pot-sweetened dreams before awakening a decade later to clean up the social mess left behind. She demonstrates how this decade was a different experience for men than for women. Lessing\`s grasp of the issues and her political thrust prove remarkable. Lessing is 82.Her protoganist Frances Lennox cannot say no. An Earth Mother, she supports an extended family that includes drop-ins and drop-outs, while her loquacious, intellectual ex-husband, a speech leech, avoids family responsibility as he steals their food and lectures them on how to save the world. A journalist, Frances tolerates too much. Through her and Lessing\`s other well-crafted characters we see the themes that disturb the author. Action sweeps forward to Africa, and back to the life of Frances\`s mother-in-law in the 1930s.All the above is opposite to The American Dream. Doris Lessing unearths the vacuity of dreams that, sad to say, end up mocking us. This provocative novel probes passionately into its subject. Yet, its readability maintains around-the-kitchen-table accessibility."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"\\"The sweetest dream\\" of the title is a world of equality -- a world in which no one is poor, no one is oppressed, and no one is inferior. It is a dream that has beguiled many, including, in her youth, Doris Lessing. The particular variant that captivated her was British Communism of the Thirties and Forties. She became disillusioned with communism in the Fifties, and in this novel she excoriates it as well as other forms of political thought (mostly liberal or leftist in nature) that ignore the sanctity and dignity of the individual life and, as this review is entitled (borrowing a phrase from the novel), \\"the infinite incongruity that life [is] capable of.\\" Life is messy, some people are evil, and others are weak, while political doctrines are far too neat and tidy . . . and, in their oversimplification, ultimately hypocritical.The story of THE SWEETEST DREAM is almost epic in scope. It is told through the lives of three generations of ordinary but extraordinarily strong women: (i) Julia Lennox (nee von Arne), who was born into a solidly bourgeois German family and escaped that country as it turned to Nazism via her marriage to Englishman Philip Lennox; (ii) her daughter-in-law Frances Lennox, who married Julia's son Johnny, but then was left to fend for herself and their two sons, with considerable help from Julia, as Johnny (shamelessly self-centered and all the while going by the sobriquet \\"Comrade Johnny\\") pursued his lifelong worship and support of Stalinist communism; and (iii) Sylvia Lennox, who as the daughter of Johnny's second wife became his step-daughter but whom he also foisted off on Frances and Julia to provide meaningful and loving parenting. For the most part, the action of the book is divided between the mid-1960s in London, where Frances and Julia open their home to a motley assortment of alienated and/or rebellious youth, and the 1980s in Africa -- specifically, \\"Zimlia\\", which is Lessing's name for (I believe) Zimbabwe -- where Sylvia heroicly tries to carry on as a doctor in a rural mission midst AIDS and wretched poverty while the post-colonial African rulers and the self-righteous international aid community flatter and enrich one another in air-conditioned resorts and hotels.While epic in scope, the novel is not quite as grand in execution. Like life, it too is messy, but on this score art need not mirror life. It is not just that the narrative could be more refined. (In some places, it bears the all the indicia of first-draft status.) It is also that the political commentary could be somewhat more subtle. Lessing is scathing in her portrayals and denunciations of various breeds of ideologues, so much so that at times THE SWEETEST DREAM itself verges on becoming a screed. For example:* On feminism: \\"The beginning of the new feminism in the Sixties resembled nothing so much as a little girl at a party, mad with excitement, her cheeks scarlet, her eyes glazed, dancing about shrieking, 'I haven't got any knickers on, can you see my bum?'\\"* On leftists: \\"The most immediately visible likeness was the hostility to people not in agreement. The left-wing or liberal children * * * maintained intact inherited habits of mind. 'If you are not with us, you are against us.' The habit of polarisation, 'If you don't think like us, then you are a fascist.'\\" * * * \\"They all used words like fascist all the time, anyone they might be having a tiff with was a fascist. They were so ignorant they did not know there had been real fascists * * *. They did not seem to know that fascist, Nazi, were words that meant people had been imprisoned, been tortured, had died in millions in that war.\\"* The most bitter and derisive portrayals are reserved for communism. For example: At the end of the novel, an aged Comrade Johnny gathers around himself disciples and comrades of yore, who \\"reminisce as if the great failure of the Soviet Union had never happened\\" and \\"with tender admiration * * * drank to possibly the cruellest murderer who has ever lived.\\"Even more than communism or other ideologies, what Doris Lessing really detests are hypocrisy and people who do not think for themselves. No doubt many readers will experience a blush of discomfort. Still and all, despite the polemics and occasional ham-handedness, THE SWEETEST DREAM is worth reading, even if just for the sprawling story."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"Doris Lessing - The Sweetest Dream.In the first half of this splendid book we are back more or less in the territory of the author's The Good Terrorist. Frances Lennox, a middle -aged woman living in a large Hampstead house, presides unassertively over a large dinner table frequented by a group of 1960s youngsters brought home by her sons and who mostly belong to the radical left. Her Stalinist (later Maoist) ex-husband (irresponsibly abandoning wives and children seriatim) also drops in from time to time when he is not being a delegate in plushy hotels abroad, and plays the guru to the youngsters. Some rooms in the house become almost permanent squats for the young people who have often fallen out with their middle class families. Frances herself is a middle class left-wing Liberal; but she is unwilling to assert herself even when some of those who avail herself of her hospitality abuse her for being bourgeois and for belonging to an exploiting class. The politics of these youngsters are depicted as crude, their rhetoric based on clich s and slogans, their behaviour as selfish and self-indulgent. For instance, they defend their shop-lifting as an anti-capitalist activity. Clearly this novel is in part a scathing political tract against the radical left. But it is much more than that, as the psychology of Frances, of her sons, her mother-in-law, and each of the other young people is displayed with an insight which makes this a great novel and a captivating read.In the second half of the book, in the 1980s, we move to \\"Zimlia\\", a newly liberated African country. Sylvia, Frances' step-daughter, has trained as a doctor and has then gone to work in a desperately poverty- and AIDS-stricken village in that country. In Zimlia we meet again some of the other youngsters who had sat around Frances' hospitable table: two of them, Africans who had been exiles from the country before its independence, are now in with the corrupt and incompetent government; three others have become leading figures in wealthy NGOs, moving importantly from one international gathering to another, and distributing largesse to the corrupt government without troubling to make sure that the money reaches the people who most need it. Again any possible resentment a reader might feel about being exposed to another political tract is likely to be overcome by the sheer brilliance with which the setting, the circumstances and the characters are described. Here, too, one knows that Doris Lessing is burning with rage about intellectual and political corruption, but, though there is nothing subtle about the political level of the book, her craft is such that one becomes deeply involved with and interested in the many people she so vividly portrays. The Sweetest Dream of a better world that black and white radicals had hoped for is cruelly dispelled in the shadow of Stalin, Mao, and tin-pot dictators in Africa, and Doris Lessing seems to say that it is an illusion to think we can transform the world by politics, but that individual acts of goodness and unselfishness can create pools of light in the surrounding darkness."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"This is one of her best books. It's like The Golden Notebook meets The Good Terorrist. Her right-on observations of how people behave has never been more true. Some of the characters are really evil, just like real life. Some of her characters are good, no matter what; like real life. She is one of the best writers ever and this is her best book in years.People who think this is not a good Lessing book simply haven't been paying attention. She is still an astonishing writer."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"In this testament to a time long ago,The Sweetest Dream: A Novelreminds us of a colorful era when the boundaries were blurred, the issues were paramount, and many young people (and some older ones) were celebrating the revolution.Frances Lennox is trying to make it on her own, raise her two sons, and manage to maintain a household for the seemingly ever-growing group of hangers-on that shows up regularly at the house owned by her former mother-in-law Julia, whose generosity she depends upon. Neither of them are very happy when ex-husband Johnny (and black sheep son) shows up frequently, expecting the king's treatment.During one of these moments, Frances gives in to the feelings she often hides. Her ex has just savagely put down his son Colin, whose first novel is being published; in his rant, Johnny reams his son out for his bourgeois beliefs and attitudes. Frances calls him to task for his behavior, which goes against the grain for her and wrings her out emotionally.Following this dramatic scene, Frances gives in to her feelings, showing them freely, for the first time ever: \\"And then, a surprise to herself, Frances laid her head down on her arms, on the table, among all the dishes. She sobbed. Andrew waited, noting the freshets of tears that renewed themselves every time he thought she had recovered. He was white too now, shaken. He had never seen his mother cry, never heard her criticize his father in this way.\\"But despite the emotional moments Frances suffers, from time to time, she continues the task of cleaning up other people's messes.Throughout this tale, I wanted to shake this woman; but I also knew that she was, in a way, a victim of her times.The book was long, with relentless moments such as these, which I found tedious, despite being able to relate to the story. Nevertheless, the most I can offer is four stars at this time."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Dream","review":"Doris Lessing is a writer of many locales and many genres. Of British parentage, she was born in Iran when it was called Persia. At age six she moved to Zimbabwe when it was called Rhodesia, and in 1949 she moved to London where she has remained ever since. In her 83 years, she's written over thirty books: realistic novels, science fiction novels, and some that she calls \\"inner-space novels.\\" She's written plays, an opera libretto for Phillip Glass, and an autobiography.Her latest realistic novel, The Sweetest Dream, begins in the early 1960s, and concerns Frances Lennox, a forth-something actress who has turned to journalism out of financial need. She has two adolescent sons. Their London house serves as a crash pad for teenagers with family troubles, so prevalent in the \`60s. Frances' husband, Johnny, has abandoned her and the boys in order to pursue his own ambitions within the Communist Party. The story traces the gradual growth of all of the characters, youth and adult, into the late 1980s. Some remain in London, others go to the States, and still others wind up in Africa. Halfway through, the novel shifts direction and concerns itself with Sylvia, one of the flophouse kids, a once-anorexic waif who, having become a doctor, devotes her life to helping poor people with AIDS in Africa.But the novel's first half deals mainly with London's Swinging Sixties. Lessing, herself once a \`60s communist radical, is now deeply critical of the movement. In an interview with Salon, she has said, \\"We were going to have justice, equality, fair pay for women, cripples, blacks -- everything, in a very short time. This nonsense was believed by extremely intelligent people.\\" She's still incredulous at the current political correctness that has survived since the \`60s. The Sweetest Dream seems to ask: did we really want our society torn down and rebuilt again by twenty-one year olds?The sweetest dream that Lessing writes about is the dream of altruism, our dream of helping people, of serving others, of actively doing our parts to create a better, even a perfect world. What Lessing adds to the pot is that the character of altruism leans greatly upon the all-too-human personalities that practice it. Differing temperaments create different brands of social idealists.Frances, for example, is the Good Mother whose instinct is to help wayward youth, to clothe, shelter and feed them. Her altruism falls naturally like rain, she cannot help but help. Her weakness is that she cannot say no. She is often taken advantage of and occasionally trounced all over. She has altruism with all heart and no head.Her husband, Johnny, is altruism with all head and no heart. He is a young, charismatic Communist Party idealist whose dream is to unite the workers into an ideal society in which no one will suffer anymore. If it means sacrificing some individuals who get in the way, then so be it. Like many western European and American communists of his time, he remains in denial of Stalin's wholesale atrocities. Not to mention that, while he's out fighting to tear down the bourgeoisie, his sons remain fatherless at home.Perhaps the novel's deepest flaw is that tends to meander. Anecdote gradually follows anecdote, and sometimes the reader is left wondering which was important and which wasn't. It reads like memories piled upon memories with very little rising drama, except for the question you might ask about any actual, living person: what will become of them in thirty years?And this is what's compelling in The Sweetest Dream. The characters themselves are lively and varied. We watch them grow, or refuse to grow. Interestingly, the old adage that character is destiny only seems to apply to the novel's purely villainous characters. Communist Johnny remains a helpless, charming, deceitful dreamer until the end. Rose, the snot-nosed, vindictive teenager has become, appropriately, a tattletale journalist for a British tabloid. Lessing's villainous characters, lacking dimension, are unable to change into anything except self-caricatures. And it seems likely that the author intends it so.But the more sympathetic characters such as Frances and her sons evolve in the most surprising and yet plausible ways. And even poor Sylvia, whose brand of altruism in Africa is rooted, like her anorexia, in a martyr's self-denial, changes in a most satisfying way. She grows from being helpless to being undeniably strong.In showing the long-term evolution of her characters, Lessing has created a rich novel about personality and politics. In The Sweetest Dream, as in most of her work, there's a constant awareness that what at first seems only personal balloons into the political, and what's political affects us all in the most deeply personal ways.For more writings of a literary nature, see www.maninquotes@blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Morris is part of a wave of so-called \\"new historians\\" of Israel, including Avi Shlaim, Tom Segev, and Ilan Pappe, who have used the declassified Israeli archives to rewrite the history of modern Israel and the Arab Israeli conflict from a more even-handed (or, in the case of Pappe and Shlaim, pro-Arab) perspective. People who were brought up believing that Leon Uris' Exodus neatly captured the circumstances surrounding the emergence of Zionism and birth of Israel will be disappointed to learn from this book of some of the conduct by the early Zionists and the Israeli government. Even so, the Arabs do not come out smelling like roses, either, and Morris' book is essential to understanding the actual events (including unsavory conduct by all of the parties) that led us to the current state of affairs in Israel/Palestine. Of course, Morris' conclusions - and those of all of the \\"new historians\\" - may have to be revisited if and when Israel's Arab neighbors ever do the right thing and open up their own state archives to inspection. Whatever one might say about Israel, it at least permits historians to inspect its records and do their jobs."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"A first class eye opener.

After reading this book of 700 pages, I have compared it to Dershowitz, Finkelstein, Neumann and others, and have perceived this detailed account to be rather objective in this revisionist history in both sides of the issues where the conflict exists today. I found this book very helpful in understanding the early pre-state intentions and the 1948, 1967, attrition and 1973 wars. It would be hard to simply follow the status quo and deny the deplorable conditions of the Palestinians and Israeli treatment in human rights, economic, social and cultural controls, which includes the occupied territories, new settlements, appropriations of water and resources with its determined discriminations."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"In the opening pages of Benny Morris' Righteous Victims, one notices two unique aspects of this author's history, the short poem by W. H. Auden, \\"I and the public know/what all schoolchildren learn, those to whom evil is done/do evil in return\\" and the subtitle of the book as \\"Zionist-Arab Conflict\\" rather than the more widely used \\"Arab-Israeli Conflict.\\" As an Israeli Jew one would assume Morris to have an Israeli slant and point the finger at Arab terrorism and hostility as the source of the conflict. However, Morris, a \\"new historian,\\" is part of the cultural civil war within Israel between the post-Zionists or \\"new-historians\\" and the more traditional Zionist Israelis (Wurmser). Limor Livnat, a member of Israeli Knesset, describes post-Zionism as those left-wing Israelis who \\"do not oppose the idea of the state of Israel, but rather (believe) that the task has been completed; they suggest that the idea of a Jewish state is inherently racist, and that Israel should be a state for all its citizens\\" (Livnat). These individuals are tired of war and violence and are critical of Israel's Zionist past and present policies.In Righteous Victims Morris writes an objective history of what he sees as the \\"Zionist-Arab Conflict.\\" He succeeds in constructing a comprehensive account of the conflict, one that is critical of Zionism and Israel as well as the Palestinians and Arab states. He provides a timely analysis of the causes of the Palestinian refugee crisis and an in-depth look at the present Intifada and its historical context.In his opening discussion of beginnings of the Israeli state and the formation of the Yishuv, or Jewish community, Morris exposes the inevitability of the conflict through diary entries and memoirs of the important players such as Herzl and Churchill and their opinions regarding Zionism and the native Arab population. It is in this section of Righteous Victims where Morris is most critical of Zionism. In 1903 Herzl argued that \\"poor Arab [tenant] farmers should not be driven off their land,\\" however in his diary in 1895 Morris finds the quote:Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly (21).Morris explains the Zionist motives behind these transfers citing several reasons. In many ways Arabs were seen as Russians in the Jews eyes; any form of hostility or protest that could be deemed anti-Semitic were associated as \\"pogroms.\\" In Morris' view this simplified the problem, demonized the Arabs, and \\"comforted the Jews by obviating the need to admit that what they faced was a rival national movement, rather than Arabic-speaking Cossacks and street ruffians\\" (136). Also Morris holds that there was a refusal among many Zionists to agree to the complexity of Arab antagonism (61). Incoming Jews were seen as Europeans and the rightful owners of Palestine, while Arabs were merely \\"insignificant natives and usurpers\\" (76). Morris' explanation of the psyches of both sides proves his argument of inevitability, best illustrated by the HaShomer guard \\"In blood and fire Judea fell; in blood and fire shall Judea rise\\" (53).Later in the history Morris turns to Palestinian refugee crisis, the issue that brought him fame. Again Morris is critical of Zionist policy especially during the war in 1949 and the 1967 War. Morris negates both views that Arabs voluntarily fled Israeli occupied territory and that Israel systematically expelled the refugees. Morris holds the refugee problem as an inevitability given the history of antagonism and the geographic intermixing (253). After the Deir Yassin massacre, Israeli documents emphasize \\"a psychosis of flight\\" and an \\"atrocity factor\\" as means to displace Arabs. Despite theses findings, Morris shows that there was no systematic expulsion policy, and the Arabs left as a result of a cumulative process. Clearly in this analysis, Morris is critical of the IDF and Zionist leaders while maintaining his consistent level of objectivity.Amongst the remaining narrative perhaps the most relevant discussion is Morris' explanation of the Palestinian Intifada that continues today. Morris' analysis is one of political and economic factors. He views the Intifada or \\"war for independence from Israel\\" as a \\"political struggle, started as a mass protest against unbearable economic conditions, which in turn were largely a result of political realities\\" (561). Palestinians often cite the brutality and oppressiveness of the Israeli occupation, but Morris holds that it is not as restrictive as the Palestinians propound. The Israelis allowed establishment of sectors of self-rule and political resistance and also new universities. In the early 1980s annual per capita income in the Gaza Strip and West Bank almost tripled. Roads were vastly improved, most homes were linked to Israel's electricity grid, and health care was vastly improved. However this prosperity led to overcrowding, especially in the Gaza Strip, where the changes failed to erase the political frustration of the Arabs. They were still perceived as second-class citizens, unequal to their Jewish neighbors. Despite the increase in standard of living, \\"large pockets of abject poverty continued to exist and grow\\" (565).The Iran-Iraq War precipitated discontent as well. Many Arab's depended on their income from work abroad and in the Persian Gulf. Once the war broke out, they were unable to earn the much-needed \\"petrodollars\\" for their families. During the same period, the fall of the Soviet Union saw an influx of hundreds of thousands of Russian Jews further complicating the overcrowding and unemployment. Arabs found it difficult to survive in an economy with policies they felt \\"intent to dispossess and drive them out and to replace them with Jews\\" (567).Morris' \\"new historian/post-Zionism\\" account of the Arab-Israeli conflict successfully achieves his objectives, by creating a fair account critical of Zionist policies and showing the inevitability of the struggle in the face of the historical mindsets. His analysis of the refugee problem and the Intifada has and will undoubtedly awaken Israelis, students, and other historians to a critical approach to Zionist policy."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"This a highly acclaimed book which has been based on declassified Israeli, Haganah, and Zionists documents written by the famous Israeli historian Benny Morris.

If you want to get some reasonable sense of history, then this is your book. Caution: This book is not an easy read. There are so many dates, times, names, places, etc., etc., that it's easy to get bogged down while reading this book."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"For me, Righteous Victims was an introduction to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I had relatively little background to the conflict, and so I feel like I am able to evaluate the book somewhat objectively without reading through the lens of a prior bias in favor of either side. That said, I think Morris does a superb job in objectively recording the roots of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to gain extensive knowledge about the roots of this tragic situation.Naturally, one can find instances in this book that suggest either an Arab or an Israeli bias... There are rare instances within the text suggest a hint of bias one way or the other. But on the whole Morris gives a balanced history that is not tainted with extreme and devaluing bias. Unbiased writing on this subject seems to be a rarity, and Morris succeeds in that respect.My main objection to Righteous Victims is that Morris relies primarily on sources from the Zionist perspective. As a result, Righteous Victims goes into much clearer detail about the Zionist side of the struggle, while leaving some parts of the Arab point of view somewhat vague. While predominantly using sources written by Zionists, about Zionists, from the Zionist perspective runs the risk of creating an unfair and unbalanced work, I don't blame Morris. In the introduction, he explains (rightly so) that there simply is not many sources from the Arab point of view open to researchers. Morris did as well as anyone could with the available resources, and one should not be highly critical of his sources, because it is unavoidable to use mostly Zionist sources.I will not... make arguments for either the Israelis or the Palestinians. That is not the point of a book review. But I will say that this book gives a very good reference from which you can formulate your own opinions on the matter. Sure, there are probably other \\"comprehensive\\" histories out there that are clearly slanted one way or another. But they do a lousy job of allowing the reader to develop their thoughts and ideas. Righteous Victims was a comprehensive, complete, fair, and meticulously detailed account of the conflict which helped me develop my own opinions.The reading is quite dense and slow-going, but please don't let that deter you. This is a valuable work that I highly recommend for anyone with an interest in the subject."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"I read Avi Shlaim's _Iron Wall_ shortly after finishing this comprehensive history and Morris seems ponderous by comparison. I had to renew his book from the library six times to finish it. Morris upfront about telling readers that he writes from an Israeli perspective, because he has more access to Israeli sources. An interesting review of the book in the March 13, 2000 issue of _The Jerusalem Report_ says this is no excuse. Morris could have sought the help of Arabic speakers to read Arab sources.I was a little taken aback by his casual references to the Israeli attacks on the U.S.S. Liberty in 1967 and on the U.N. headquarters at Kafr Kana in 1995 as regrettable accidents, without mentioning there is considerable interational controversy over whether these attacks were accidental. Still, the book covers a large swathe of history and helps the reader to put the Israeli-Palestinian conflict within a largely demythologized framework."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Benny Morris represents a new, modern strand of Israeli historians who do not shrink from presenting their nation's history as it occured. His prose is lucid, flowing and fascinating as he brings the reader from the Zionist colonization process in the 19th and early 20th centuries all the way into the present. The depth and breadth of his research are simply unassailable - which, I suspect, is one of the greatest irritants to his critics, of which there are many.History is inseparable from political implication, and for that reason, almost any honest historical work will be labelled \\"unfair\\" or \\"biased\\" by someone - just ask Howard Zinn. But do not shrink from this book because some criticize it. In fact, a good sign that you've found a solid piece of research is that it has been reviled by those who criticize historians for not being \\"patriotic\\" enough.Personally, I disagree with some of Morris's conclusions (I think he's far too easy on the Zionist project), but I must agree that he's written a solid book here. If you're looking for a good primer or refresher piece on Israeli history, you've found it."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Regardless of your political leanings you will find this book the definitive source of historical detail which must inform the actions and opinions of all who are active in seeking peace with justice in the region. Quoting from authoritative source material, including previously classified material and such sources as ben Gurion's diary, Morris provides an irrefutable account of the history of Palestine/Israel from the beginnings of the Zionist movement right up to the eve of Sharon's election (the actual subtitle of this edition lists 2001 as the ending date). Even though Morris's politics are (to me) relatively conservative--he seems to support the occupation and the actions of the Israeli government--he provides irrefutable evidence to oppose some classic Zionist myths, such as the idea that there was nobody living in Palestine until the Zionists colonized it, or that the Arab inhabitants all left of their own accord.Morris's lucid and readable style makes this book hard to put down, despite its incredible depth of detail and its nearly 700-page length. The events are so fascinating that it reads like a novel, and each chapter brings fresh revelations and exciting pieces of evidence, which activists will find useful and novices will find informative. This book will probably not change your mind, whatever your political leaning (there's so much data that there's plenty of \\"ammunition\\" for any viewpoint), but it will leave readers much better informed and, I dare to hope, more likely to contribute to a just solution to the problems of the region."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"When I first read in the beginning of the book that almost all sources used were from Israeli documents--the reason was explained and seemed plausible, there are virtually no records available from other sources-- I almost put it away anticipating it would be biased. But I decided to give it a chance and I'm glad I did. It is a well documented history of Zionism, the conflict in general and was not biased at all. I disagreed with some of Morris' points. For example after recording many statements of the early Zionist's which definately showed their intent from the very beginning to transport and remove the Palestinians altogether, and claim all of Palestine as Israel based on their biblical right, he noted that there was not, as some claimed, a systematic effort to remove them. But that is what makes his work objective. After reading the book and the history given, it is up to the reader to decide for themselves what took place... I definately recommend this book for an understanding of this very complicated issue. I think Morris did a great job."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"This well written and organized book is an effort to provide a fair narrative history of the Zionist/Israeli-Arab/Palestinian conflicts. It is based largely on secondary sources and published documents and not on any extensive archival research. As pointed out by the author, the Israeli historian Benny Morris, there is considerably more documentation available for the Zionists/Israelis. Indeed, much of what Morris can tell us about the Arab/Palestinian side comes from Zionist/Israeli sources. Morris, however, interprets material carefully and this is generally an evenhanded book.As can be seen from prior reviews, individual reviewer reactions are influenced by prior conceptions of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. I am impressed that much of the book is devoted to debunking Zionist mythology. Some examples. Many, if not all Zionist leaders, including most of the founders of the state of Israel, were aware that construction of a Zionist state would require dispossesion of the native Arab populations. The British Mandate was largely beneficial for the Zionists. In the wars of 1947-1948, the Zionists enjoyed significant advantages. While there is less written about the Arabs/Palestinians, several important themes emerge. Palestinian national consciousness is largely a result of the confrontation with Zionism. The Palestinians suffered from incredibly poor leadership. Some of the Palestinian problems, particularly their poor leadership, is a product of the fact that Palestinian society was essentially pre-modern in social and political organization. The Palestinians have been treated poorly by Arab states.This book is particularly useful for episodes that Americans are unlikely to be familiar with. The 1973 war is described well, including the near victory of the Syrians in the north of Israel. The invasion and occupation of Lebanon, ultimately the only real defeat ever suffered by the Israeli armed forces, is very well described and analyzed.While I think Morris is correct on broad outlines and is generally fair to both sides, I think he is wrong on some specific points. He suggests that Israeli decision makers misinterpreted Arab nation intentions prior to the 1967 war and that it was avoidable. Michael Oren's recent and very good book on this subject, published after the publication of Morris's book, emphasizes the aggressive intentions of the Arab states and the difficult but probably correct decision made by the Eshkol cabinet to initiate hostitilies. Similarly, Morris states that the US become unswervingly committed to Israel during the Kennedy administration. It is probably closer to the truth to see considerable deepening of the US commitment to Israel as a consequence of the great success in the 1967 war.Overall, this is the best historical introduction to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and really useful for understanding the genesis of the present and very complex state of affairs."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Much of what Americans read and hear about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is polemical in nature, designed not to enlighten us but to covince us of the utter rightness of one side and the absolute depravity of the other. For the most part, American commentatators woleheartedly side with Israel. Ocasionally, we encounter a pro-Palestinian voice. What we lack is dispassionate historical analysis that attempts to explain the origins of the conflict rather than manipulate the reader. Benny Morris's \\"Righteous Victims\\" fills this void exceptionally well.Unfortunately and inaccurately, Morris is often portrayed pro-Palestinian propagandist. Morris simply refuses to view this long complex conflict as a cartoon of good vs. evil, as Israel's apologists have always insisted it is. For Morris, the struggle over Palestine is a fairly normal historical event. From reading \\"Righteous Victims\\" one gets the impression of two entitities muddling their way through history as nations often do, often missing opportunities to ease tensions and create a lasting peace. Morris's world consists not of heroic peace-loving Israelis confronting Palestinian genocidal maniacs (the standard portrayal in the American media) but of relatively normal human beings in a difficult situation.Morris also offends Israel's apologists by emphasizing the fact that this conflict has always been marked by extreme inequality. From the beginning of the Zionist project, the Jewish emigres have commanded superior political and economic resources. By 1948, they also possessed superior military resources. His work contradicts the image of plucky little Israel bravely overcoming the amassed forces of the Arab world. Morris correctly emphasizes the pitiful political, social and military organization of both the Arab states and the Palestinian nation.Having stripped away these comorting fantasies, Morris honestly confronts the essence of the current situation and appears to come away a pessimist. The Palestinians are defeated people, impoverished, humiliated and alienated. Some of the wounds are self-inflicted while others are the product of Israeli policy. Without a vast improvement in their daily conditions, political negotiations are doomed to failure."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Thousands of books have been written on the Israeli-Arab conflict. Virtually all of these have been partisan. Here we have the first objective history covering the conflict from its 19th century inception right up to the 21st century. &quot;Righteous Victims&quot; is not a history of Israel nor a history of Palestine. It is a history of the conflict and it covers the subject comprehensively, objectively and with acute insight. No serious student of the Middle East can afford to ignore this book."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"The Israeli right has attacked this book but the truth is that it is a reasonably middle of the road account of Israeli history compared to more extreme pro-Palestinian works by others such as Finkelstein (Image and reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict). Morris would seem politically attuned to the outlook of Rabin and Barak but in recent years he has become more pessimistic about the possibility of peace settlement with the inhabitants of the disputed territories although he is not alone in that outlook.Morris has been characterised as a revisionist historian. This reputation was gained with his earlier work The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee problem 1947-49 in which using recently released archival material he suggested that earlier Israeli accounts of the problem were not correct. Prior to Morris and others the official Israeli version of the refugee problem had been that the Arab inhabitants of Palestine had fled in response to calls by the invading Arab states in 1948. Morris was able to show this was a propaganda myth to justify the refusal of Israels policy in regard to the refugees.This book is not so much a new study based on original work by Morris but it is a general history of Israel based on secondary sources. Naturally there is more material available now than when the first histories of Israel were written.The book explodes a large number of myths that have been part of the propaganda war between Israel and its enemies. What he suggests that is new is as follows:1. That the leaders of Israel aimed to set up a racially exclusive state. Prior to 1948 there were discussions about the need to transfer those Arabs who were to live in the new state.2. That some of the groups who were involved in the creation of Israel such as the Irgun used terrorism to achieve their ends and introduced methods such as placing bombs in civilian areas.3. That there were two wars of independence. The first war was a civil war fought against the Palesinian Arabs in 1947. This was crushed the Palestinians and was then followed by the 1948 war.4. That the suggestion that Israel was embattled and won a war against great odds in 1948 was not accurate. Rather Israels forces outnumbered its opponents and they were supplied with equivalent weapons and thanks to an agreement with Czechoslovakia had a plentiful supply of ammunition. The Arab states by comparison were short of ammunition because of the arms embargo and their troops were poorly trained and poorly led.5. The unprovoked attack by Israel on Egypt in 1956 had an effect in hardening the views of Arab states and contributed to the development of those states hard line to Israel.6. The 1967 war was probably not a defensive war as Egypt did not intend to attack Israel. (As shown by captured documents)7. That since 1973 Israel has had a military superiority over all the Arab states. In addition it has had nuclear weapons. Arab states were only able to attack Israel when the Soviet Union was able to continually re-supply them with weapons. The demise of the Soviet Union means that the Arabs are not able to mount an effective offensive war against Israel.8. The first Intifada was a popular revolt, which has occurred in response to the brutal Israeli occupation.9. That the rise of extreme Islamic movements those which are now supporting the second Intifadas suicide bombing campaigns have arisen as a response firstly to the invasion of Lebanon and secondly from the fist Intifada.Whilst critical of some of Israels policy?s Morris is not blind to the short comings of the Arab governments and the nature of their regimes. He is also keenly aware of the fanaticism of the various terrorist groups now operating out of the West Bank and Gaza.In fact Morris and Barak have been involved in a recent interchange with some of Clintons aids of articles in the New York Review of Books talking about the failure of the PLO to accept what would seem generous peace terms in 2000. He has indicated that peace will probably only be acceptable with a generational change in the PLO leadership."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Honest, painful, raw...this author has incredible integrity.highly highly recommended reading about this complicated conflictI am a Palestinian. I am alive today and remember what happened.The author documents everything perfectly."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Benny Morris is part of a group of Israeli academics often called the \\"new\\" historians, but what Morris examines in \\"Righteous Victims\\" is not new. Prof. Morris delves into the Zionist movement from its earliest inception in Europe down to present-day. He chides the Arab world for treating Jews as 2nd class citizens (and over time converting untold multitudes to Islam) who had to give up their religion to change their status. Such a choice is, of course, not an option for the Palestinians of today. Morris is a realist though. He eloquently expresses the suffering of the Jewish people over the centuries, but makes it clear that the Zionist movement was not a peaceful remedy. For the Jews to have their traditional homeland the Palestinians had to go. He discusses the efforts of Zionists to persuade the Ottoman Empire to give them a homeland and the beginnings of Jewish settlement. However, it was not until the British came that the Zionist movement gained momentum. Morris points to two types of Jews in Palestine: native Jews who spoke Arabic and were part of the landscape, and Zionist Jews from Europe who came as conquerors. The Jewish Arabs as a religious minority avoided confrontations with their fellow Muslim and Christian Arabs, but the Zionists displayed no fear of the Arabs and a great deal of arrogance and this vivid picture speaks volumes. Morris discusses the importance of the Balfour Declaration and later British moves that gave the Zionists a promise of a homeland and the right to arm themselves while the Arab majority was kept unarmed. Next, we are given an explanation of the events leading up to the birth of Israel. The UN granted a minority-run state for the Jews, while the Arabs continued to own most of the land and were still a slight majority, but had few political rights in the new order. Morris discusses what few Americans know, the violent aggression of Zionist terrorists such as the Irgun and Stern Gang who targeted civilians. We learn that most Arabs didn't leave of their own free will, but were driven out of Israel after hearing about massacres such as Deir Yassin perpetrated by the Irgun (led by none other than a young terrorist named Menachem Begin). Morris then continues to discuss how the war in 1956 happened and the opportunity it presented to the young Israeli state to weaken its most formidable foe, Egypt, with the help of resurgent imperialists Britain and France until the Americans and Soviets intervened. The most interesting section is about the 1967 war. Were the Israelis really under some threat of attack from the Arab states as they claimed (the 2nd time they attacked their neighbors)? According to Morris the Egyptians, Syrians, and Jordanians didn't plan an attack upon Israel for various reasons. They had remained wary of Israel's military might and Israel's attack came due to hysteria whipped up by expansionists and bad information from Israeli intelligence. Morris also discusses the refugee crisis that Israel created and refused to address. The Israeli official line was to act as if the refugees did not exist and this group of Palestinians in Diaspora (eerily similar to the fate suffered by Jews), in turn, felt that Israel had no right to exist. From this mutual animosity came the PLO and Fatah (the two groups would merge later and Arafat would become its head). Morris discusses the reasons for Palestinian unrest and we get an intriguing behind the scenes negotiation before the 1973 war between Moshe Dayan of Israel and Sadat of Egypt along with Yitzhak Rabin. We learn that Golda Meir was far more of a hawk than the American media ever reported her to be. She wanted to keep the option of reoccupying the Sinai open to Israel and she wanted to keep Gaza. Sadat rejected this outright as the Egyptians prepared for a war to take back the Sinai. We also get some interesting information about how Sadat favored military yes men, rather than people like Egyptian war minister Gen. Ahmad Sadek who wanted to wait until Egypt had a stronger air force to match the Israelis. We learn that the 1973 war very nearly ended in a disastrous defeat for Israel and only an American airlift saved them, but still left them in a precarious position as their forces had crossed the Suez, but Egyptian forces had also made it into the Sinai. The later peace deal came because both countries could deal on some equal footing. Morris continues with a discussion of the invasion of Lebanon, which Israel conducted by breaking int'l law and in order to pursue terrorists stemming from refugee camps that they claimed didn't exist. With the invasion, the civil war heated up and the Israelis added to the bloodshed by killing thousands of civilians while pursuing armed militants. Lastly, we get a rundown of the peace process and how the settlements remained a sore point. Morris also discusses Rabin's efforts and early skepticism at prospects for peace during the 1st Intifada. Morris discusses how the PLO came to be the head of the Palestinian people as it was favored by the masses. He also makes it clear as part of his conclusion that many of the things the Zionists did they had to do to create Israel. He doesn't pass judgment upon them, but merely explains what Israel's supporters don't want to hear. The Zionist movement was the vanguard of an invasion force, which disenfranchised the Palestinian people and drove them to the heights of despair, desperation, and terrorism by some extremist groups. We get a real sense of what was going on through the minds of the major players and what Morris has written is a definitive and thorough history which his detractors can only nit-pick at, but cannot deny his analysis, facts, and conclusions. Highly recommended for those willing to look at the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with an open mind."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Commencing from the roots of zionism and continuing through the downward spiral of peaceful relations between the settlers (Jews) and the occupants (Palestinians), &quot;Righteous Victims&quot; attempts to clarify the historical realities of the Middle East. In just under 700 pages its author, Benny Morris, accurately details a large portion of the history of one of the most conflicted lands in the world.As a professor at Ben-Gurion University, Morris, puts his occupational status on the line with his depictions of traditionally well-acclaimed Israeli leaders and events of the past. Although unnecessarily wordy at times, the work accomplishes its goal of giving a two-sided evaluation of the conflicts. With this in mind, it is imperative to impress the point that no work is commpletely unbiased. This is quite obvious through portions of the text in which Morris overtly focuses on unnecessary IDF (Israeli) aggression.The most conclusive portion of the text, appropriately, gives a final &quot;so what&quot; evaluation of the complexities at hand. With most of the text focusing on wars and conflicts, Morris leaves his audience with emphasis on the need for peace in the region. Along with receiving a comprehensive historical text, the reader of &quot;Righteous Victims&quot; will gain an appreciation for communication, tolerance and respect among all people with the ultimate goal of preventing more violence in the name of vengeance."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"If anything, Morris' book, far from supporting a negative evaluation of Israel and Zionism, strengthens the position of those who support Israel far more than any Zionist tract. Morris does not pretend Zionism or Zionists were perfect, but overall his work supports a positive evaluation of Israel and its policies. For if, as Morris shows, the pre-state Palestinian Jewish community (the Yishuv), the post-state Israeli public, and any number of Jewish politicans held less than politically correct positions and/or took bad decisions, the faults of the Israelis pale in comparison to the consistent hatred, bad faith, and incoherent organization he shows among the Palestinian population and wider Arab leadership.For instance, one of his most controversial arguments is that early Zionists, including Ben-Gurion and Dayan, wanted to &quot;transfer&quot; the Arab population out of Palestine. Modern defenders of Zionism, aware that such ideas look a lot like &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; are keen to deny that the creators of Israel ever held such views. I am not entirely convinced by his arguments: the documents he cites could support the interpretation that such views represented idle fancies rather than a coherent policy, but Morris position *is* supportable. Either way, it is clear that the violent racialist language and fantasies of the Arab leadership and population towards Jews were much more explicit, vulgar, and widespread.After reading Morris book, I think any previously neutral reader would conclude that neither side was or is perfect, but that at almost any given moment pre-state Zionists and later Israel itself have consistently had the moral advantage over an overwhelmingly corrupt and hate-filled Palestinian opposition.In the long run, this kind of honest history does Israel more good than one-sided ideological constructions.One final point. Morris as an Israeli can see problems with his own society, and freely criticize it. As he himself points out, Arab intellectuals, whether due to political pressure or simple inability, have been completely unable to break out of ideologically driven analyses. Honestly, which type of society would you rather live in?"},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"The largest single refugee population in the world today is still that of the Palestinians -- over half a century after Israel's creation. The Arab-Israeli disupute, meanwhile, stubbornly resists solution. Yet much that has been written -- not least, but not excluseively, in the US media -- remains strikingly ill-informed and/or partisan. This scholarly, cautious, throughly corroborated and balanced examination by one of Israel's 'new historians' will without a doubt become a classic in its field. No one seriously involved in the study of, or commentary on, developments between Israel and the Palestinians, can afford ignoring this new work."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Morris manages to synthesize a vast quantity of information in this evenhanded and very readable history. He concentrates on military and diplomatic events, making the book a bit repetitive and depressing. He treats the founders of the Jewish State as humans and not the supermen they have been portayed as in many Israeli histories to date. He makes the very important point that the Jews, although technically outnumbered in the War for Independence, were better organized, trained and motivated (and later on, even better armed) than their Arab adversaries. On the whole though, it's a fast read considering it's almost 700 pages long. I would recommend this book for those with an interest in the Israeli-Palestinian struggle."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"I have read several works on the historical roots of the conflict, but this book is probably the best overall history in one work. Morris does pretty well at taking an even hand with his writing; although he probably could have shortened it by a couple hundred pages by leaving out some of the \\"breathless\\" play-by-play commentary of battle tactics in the various wars. Overall, it is well worth the time invested if you want a better understanding of the subject."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Do not believe the charges of anti-semitism.This book is critical of both sides but based on exhaustive research into primary sources: the files of the Israeli government and army. If you only want to hear the propaganda from one side or another, avoid this book.I would criticize the maps as inadequate, a detailed map of the region in the endpaper would have been just the thing. Also, the author assumes a familiarity with people and events in the areawhich went well beyond my knowledge, until I read the book.Update: 10 December 2002Wow.

The copy that was sent to me was sub-titled \\"1881 - 2001\\" (rather than 1999), and, although it is usually difficult to manage much interest in events that happened in the 1800s, they are important and the book gets more engrossing as it goes along until eventually I couldn't put it down.Nearly every preconception that I had about the Arab-Israeli conflict was challenged. Since I'm not old enough to remember most of the events covered in the first 300 to 400 pages as they happened, my opinions had been formed by simplistic aphorisms. For example I believed that Israel was the victim in every regional conflict and that its occupation of the \\"territories\\" occurred extemporaneously. This was not actually the case, as Morris points out.Overall, the book helped me to better understand current events in the Middle East. My impression is that the present-day conflict is fed by the unwillingness of the Arabs to accept an Israeli State. Some have said that granting Palestinians statehood will resolve the problem - and I do think that this is necessary - but it will not end the Islamic violence. It may, however, provide an incentive for the Palestinian Authority to end its tacit support for terrorism and work instead to combatting the suicidal campaign that has done little more than erode international sympathy and destroy the local economy."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"An excellent history, from the late 19th through the 20th centuries, of the battle for a land two people claim as theirs. A \\"must read\\" for anyone who wants to understand what's behind the ongoing battle in the Israel/Palestine region."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Don't be fooled by the deceptive calm of the apparent \\"even-handed\\" tone of this book. Although it is aimed at being the comprehensive history of the land that has become Israel/Palestine from 1881-2001, and is certainly long enough, I was impressed with what it left out rather than what it added to the existing histories, and what it leaves out is telling as to where the author's sympathies lie. He admits he's a Zionist and this book is really an apologia for what Zionists have done since 1881 - I believe that is the reason this book exists. He also reveals his political affiliations and shows more of his colours towards the end of the book - I really don't think a historian needs to lead readers to fabricated conclusions based on his opinions - we should be clever enough to do that if he just shows us the facts. Although he is a lot more honest than most historians of the ongoing conflict, and includes much detail that casts both Zionists and Arabs in a morally reprehensible light, the author doesn't tell the half of it.For example, he doesn't document from when, how, and how much Zionists obtained their massive support from America during this period - America's relationship with Israel is only glancingly mentioned and only becomes prominent during the excitement of the first Camp David. The deal made with the Hashemites and the Arab Legion to limit themselves largely to Jerusalem in 1948 is not sufficiently covered, making their relative docility seem part of the \\"miracle\\" of 1948. There's hardly any analysis regarding the refugee question \\"did they run or were they forced to leave?\\" We are just left with \\"fled or were expelled\\" - note which word was used first. The Occupation material didn't cover exactly why the Palestinians were so angry at the multifarious ways in which their basic living conditions were continually eroded in Gaza and the West Bank (which the author refers to, tellingly, as Judea and Samaria) from 1967 onwards. Indeed, the second Intifada seems to be a complete mystery to the author as to why it happened at all - as if things had got any better for them since the first - though the author is never short of reasons why they might be themselves to blame for their own frustration. At one point, on p565, he suggests that the Occupation brought good things to the West Bank and Gaza, including access to Israeli hospitals \\"which lead to a dramatic expansion of the population and overcrowding, especially in Gaza\\" - you sense the author rues the fact that they didn't just die off naturally...\\"but none of this sufficed to erase...the inhabitant's political frustration or anger\\". Some people are hard to please.The author continues by glossing over the reasons why Arafat could not come to an agreement with Barak at Camp David II, Sharm El-Sheikh, or Taba - far from the 27 pages devoted to who said what to whom at the first Camp David talks in 1979, the second Camp David in 2000 got 1 page (in a 700 page work), Sharm El-Shiekh talks got one paragraph and Taba was not even mentioned at all - I got the distinct sense that the author was furious with Arafat for rejecting \\"the best deal he was ever going to be offered\\" - and refusing to explore why he might have done so.Structurally, once the author finishes with the interesting early history of the region, he basically lurches from one war to the next as a way of relating \\"history\\". This is clever, because since the Jews and then Israel \\"won all its wars\\" (and far too much of the book is devoted to admittedly exciting, blow-by-blow accounts of those winning wars), whether they deliberately provoked them or not, it presents one side in a glowing, winning light - which is disappointing because there's a lot more to history than the number of planes one can shoot out of the sky in an exhilirating afternoon - it is more about under the table alliances and vote buying support for resulting political and material gain, and covert subversion of opposing state apparatus. It's about media manipulation so the public only hear one side of the story. It's about sucking the water out from under Palestianians' feet in Gaza and elsewhere - it's all the interwar plotting and planning that goes on that results in wars. It's about straitjacketing their land and livelihoods and then wondering why there are suicide bombers and intifadas.In his conclusions, the author decides to tell it straight as to why the Palestinians lost to Israel because (p680) \\"It was Europeans versus Third World people\\". I've lost count of the number of times he basically blames the Palestinians for losing because their own culture was backward and primitive and it basically got what it deserved. In the final analysis, Morris concludes that Israel is in the position it is in right now (in terms of holding all the cards, winning wars against Palestinians and Arabs in general - \\"So the Zionists have been winners in this conflict\\" he writes in his final page) because it has and has had a superior culture and social structure - as if successful US lobbying and massive financial and materialsupport had nothing to do with it. The Arabs only have themselves to blame for their current situation. The book's thrust is a detailed retelling of Palestinian aggression, for the most part, and, with only rare though honest exceptions, the Jewish response to those aggressions (paraphrasing the book's final sentence). Small wonder the book is called \\"Righteous Victims\\". We are left in no doubt as to who the righteous victims are.This is an apologia."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Anita Shapira's New Republic essay, \\"The Past is Not a Foreign Country,\\" (online) decimates this book. Adding to Efraim Karsh's 1996 study (Fabricating Israeli History), she reminds readers that Morris failed to reply. He ignored 50 Karsh references to his own work, Avi Shlaim, primary sources and major historical and journalistic studies.In this work, Morris ironically refers to many of Karsh's sources, but nevertheless arrives at incorrect conclusions. The book is thus a politically charged revision of the Israeli-Arab conflict covering the pre-1948 through the history of Arab wars on Israel. The book shows culprits and casualties, and blames Arab regimes for violent incursions into Israel in the 1950s, for the secret war between Israel and terrorist groups, for Naser's threat to Israel before the Sinai and Six-Day wars, and for many Arab calls for Israel's destruction. Moreover, while Morris notes that Israel's West Bank and Gaza rule \\"was never as restrictive or repressive as the Palestinians made out,\\"--which is certainly true--in this book, he nevertheless misconstrues the greater part of fact and history.One big problem is Morris' large reliance on Israeli and secondary sources. He consults only a few primary Arab documents (and those, only in English translation), thus all but ignoring available Arab memoirs and state files. Oddly, Morris exploits every Israeli contingency plan and idea as conclusive evidence of Zionist expansionism, but ignores Arab plans for a \\"Greater Syria\\" as well as King Hussein's designs.Another is Morris' exclusion of regional effects of the cold war, and Soviet arms that poured into Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and other Arab states, worsening Arab-Israeli relations from the 1950s on. In short, Morris ignores the fact that the opportunity for Arab-Israeli peace opened up only following the collapse of the Soviet Union, which left Arab hard-liners without support for their traditional rejections.Worse, Morris misconstrues the notorious topic of \\" transfer,\\" a term commonly used between the two world wars to describe population exchanges like that between Turkey and Greece in the 1920s. In his first work on that topic, Morris rightly concluded that the \\"Palestinian refugee problem was born of war, not by design, Jewish or Arab,\\" but was (rather) a by-product of both people's fears and the protracted, bitter fighting of the first Arab-Israeli war. But that conclusion provoked attacks from Arab historians and Israeli revisionists.Whatever the reason, Morris in this book reverses his earlier conclusion, standing history on its head. He makes effect into cause, and falsely translates the results of war into a paradigm for Arab-Jewish relations. He writes, \\"fear of territorial displacement and dispossession was to be the chief motor of Arab antagonism to Zionism down to 1948 (and indeed after 1967 as well).\\"This reading libels Zionism and its foundations.Actually, the Peel Commission first proposed in 1937, to transfer the Arab minority from territory designated for the tiny Jewish state as part of a planned partition of western Palestine into Jewish and Arab states (as noted inIsrael's WarsandThe Closed Circleamong other volumes). Morris presumes that Zionist leaders \\"played a role in persuading the Peel Commission to adopt the transfer solution.\\" But he provides zero proof.In fact, Ben-Gurion welcomed the British idea only to persuade Zionists to accept a tiny Jewish state (and the proposed partition)--but also warned of its inherent dangers. Furthermore, Zionist leaders believed that a Jewish majority would come from massive immigration, and that Western Palestine could accommodate millions of Jews and Arabs. History proved them right on that score, although the peace they expected remains ever-elusive.The Arabs initiated war in 1948 in preference to accepting a Jewish state--and thought they could win. And everywhere they prevailed, Arabs expelled every last Jew. Benny Morris should get real.--Alyssa A.

I found this book very informative, balanced, and nuanced--a very well written analytic and descriptive history. As the NY Times reviewer said, the book's tone is \\"calm.\\"Morris had access to more Jewish and Israeli sources than Arab-Palestinian-Muslim sources, so of course critics can claim that the conclusions are \\"biased\\" in some ways. Nevertheless, at each turn in the narrative, Morris clearly describes the political, social, economic, demographic, ideological, intellectual, national, and military consequences of each \\"phase\\" or \\"stage\\" in the conflict, from \\"both\\" sides. (The conflict is far more complicated than \\"two\\" sides, however.)No matter how one regards his conclusions, Morris's dual empathy--for a people nearly crushed under (centuries of European) anti-Semitism and Hitler, and for a dispossessed, poorly led, and impoverished people--comes clear. The book is 784 pages (counting the index) so there is ample opportunity to find something to disagree with, but the thrust and conclusions are hard to escape: security eludes Israel, which has never felt safe; and the Palestinians are citizens of nothing outside the refugee camps.At some level, this book sadly reminded me of Yeats' poem, written in WW I, \\"Slouching toward Bethlehem.\\" What new beast, in this terrible time for both Israelis and Arabs, is waiting to be born?"},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"I recently finished my master's thesis, writing about the debate between Israel's &quot;New historians&quot; and the traditional accepted version of the events surrounding the establishment of the State of Israel.

It is the most comprehensive of the new historians' works, and probably also the most tame.

He has avoided the extremes that an emotionally provocative subject as this usually inspires in some people. He has presented both sides of the conflict, or at least done so as good as anyone could expect, as well as pointing out the failures on both sides that have conspired to leave us with a seemingly hopeless situation today.For anyone looking for a broad introduction into the history, causes, contributing factors and personalities of the Arab-Zionist conflict, this book is hard to go past.

It is a difficult question, and not an easy thing to do. So much of what people have written here is true. This book is everything that has been written here.The book is highly readable. The book is as up to date as possible. It goes to the election of Ariel Sharon. The book has so much information it can be exhaustive at times. And yes, the book at times seems very sympathetic to the Palestinians and the Arabs. There are many examples of the author leaning a bit in that direction. HOwever, the author does make it clear in many places as well that the Palestinians and many of the Arab nations and extremists other than Egypt and Jordan have been against the peace proccess and are very anti-event the very existance of Israel.so is the book pro-palestinian? at times yes, but i think it is part of a bigger picture and goal of showing all sides and angles of the situation.The bottom line about this book or any history book is whether or not you learn new things by reading it. This book is not perfect. I do not agree with everything in this book, but this book taught be a lot about the situation, this book made me think, and this book exposed me to some point of views and historical facts i was not aware of.Ultimately, this book taught me a lot about what is going on in the Middle East and that fact alone made it a good read."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Actually, for a topic this fascinating, it could've been longer. Great book. One gets the impression Morris genuinely desires to be objective. The problems, however, were these: It WAS slightly biased towards the Palestinians. However, my guess is this was not ideologically based and more the result of another flaw: the overwhelmingly Israeli source material and the paucity of Arab documentation. This is glaring. How can one be totally objective with such missing data? It's easy to discuss Israeli aggressions with pages of detailed reports. Would he have found the same evidence of atrocity and plotting with adequate Arab documentation? My guess is the information would be rather disturbing and might vindicate the Jews a little more than does the tone of this book. Still..........great book."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Benny Morris, the author of \\"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-2001,\\" has been counted as one of the Israeli \\"revisionist\\" historians, that group of Israelis that have debunked some of the myths that have surrounded the birth of Israel. In an earlier book, \\"The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949,\\" Morris examined one such myth: that Palestinian Arabs left the nascent Israeli state in 1948 of their own volition or under the direction of their own leaders. Although that occurred in a small number of instances, there were many more cases in which the Israeli army drove Arabs out at gunpoint. Such revelations have not endeared him to many of his countrymen. In \\"Righteous Victims,\\" first published in 1999, Morris also describes many instances of Arab antisemitism, venality, and brutality directed against Jewish settlements in Palestine. He provides many fascinating details in the early years of the interaction of the Zionist organization in Europe, British and French colonial policy, and the moribund Ottoman empire. For example, the Balfour Declaration of 1917 in which Great Britain promised the Jews of Palestine a national homeland was seen to be a completely self serving act by Britain to further its own military-political aims in World War I. This nearly 700 page book, as its title indicates, covers the entire history of the conflict from the origins of the Zionist movement including the birth of Israel and all of the subsequent Arab-Israeli wars as well as political considerations and attempts by Arab and Israeli leaders at achieving peace. Objectivity is Morris's aim, and he achieves it quite well."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"If you want to understand the Arab Israeli conflict this is the best book that you can get.

The book is brisk. Fortunately, Morris has an even tone throughout and does not remain fixed on any one subject for too long. As anyone knows who has written on a broad topic, this is an exceptional accomplishment. Even at 600 plus pages, this book could have easily gotten bogged along the way on the wealth of detail about this well researched conflict.

Morris clearly has access to high quality IDF intelligence and archives. While many reviewers have focused on the Arab vs. Zionist sections of the book - presumably because these tensions feed naive political emotions - the text itself devotes a large amount of space to the double dealing by Britain that sowed the seeds of much of the current conflict. In my opinion, an understanding of international subterfuges plotted against, and subsequently thwarted by, a nascent Israel is proably the primary added value of this text. Irrespectove of one's ideological stance, Morris draws together a compelling account of the injustices directed at the early state of Israel (Yishuv). Well worth reading. Packed with detail and certainly not propaganda."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"The author covers a long period of this one century old conflict.

I don't know where the other reviewers are coming from in calling it biased. I did not see that at all. Morris does not appear to be a fan of Ben Gurion, but he also did not give a lot of attention to the Israeli massacres in Lebanon. He is not into emotionalism in this book but more into just recounting the facts of history. This is not a book to build up one particular side or another on the issue. It is a good book to learn the actual history though."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Any book on the Arab Israeli conflict that is not 100% pro- Israel is labeled as objective, critical and balanced in the US. In his book, Benny Morris discusses some aspects of the Palestinian sufferings such as mass uprooting and forceful deportations of the Palestinian people and to a limited extent other forms collective punishments which makes his book a balanced and critical book for the NY Times and the Washington Post. However, I do not see this book as objective but rather as an attempt to lay the blame squarely on the Palestinian people. He portrays the Palestinians as uncompromising, prone to violence, unsympathetic to the Jewish suffering and human suffering as well, while the Israelis as the opposite: civilized, compromising, sympathetic to humane causes.He begins his book by stating that Muhammad, the Muslim prophet, had killed many Jews during his era. He states this without going into any context of those events. It is simply stated as to some how show that as the Europeans, the Muslims had forced the Jews to find a homeland and the Palestinians being mostly Muslims are partly to blame for their own suffering.Moreover, the overall tone of the book is pro-Israel addressed to the liberal readers who are patient enough to read how Israel at times had to act inhumanely towards the Palestinians and commit acts that are not reflective of its \\"democratic\\" and \\"civilized\\" values, but were forced to do so because the Palestinians forced them or gave them no other choice.His thesis is basically Israel had acknowledged the Palestinian problem and was willing to make some \\"painful compromises\\" to find a resolution but the Palestinians refused because they prefer terrorism as a way of life. Anyone familiar with Palestinian history realizes that Palestinian are the ones who made the painful compromises by giving up 78% of their homeland and seeking to establish a state on only 22%.Even before the current intifada, Israel through its settlers and the IDF subjected Palestinians to daily and systematic methods of collective punishments including home demolitions, land confiscations, economic blockades and all forms of abuse and humiliations ( of course all of this is done under the pretext of \\" security concerns\\".)For the Palestinians to be \\"true peace seekers\\" they have to sign an agreement as dictated by Israel without nay questions asked. Concurrently, The Palestinians have to endure all the Israeli acts of torture and watch the Israelis elect new leaders that scrap previous agreements at their whim and continue to expand the so called settlements which are in fact cities being built on the Palestinian homes and blood.Again very good read for the pro-Israel liberals that want a sophisticated way to blame the whole conflict on the Arabs and the Palestinians.I recommend these excellent resources on the subject : The Iron Wall by Avi Shlaim , The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine by Ilan Pappe and The Politics of Dispossession by Edward Said. For a broad history of the region I also recommend: The Unmaking of the Middle East: A History of Western Disorder in Arab Lands by Jeremy Salt."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Benny Morris rose to the forefront of Israel's 'New Historians' in the 1980's with the publication of 'Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem,' which provided radically new evidence which altered modern perceptions of the region forever. Morris retains his important findings in Righteous Victims and expands on them, covering virtually the entire history of the Israel-Palestine conflict. I found the earlier chapters leading up to the creation of the State of Israel on the earliest Zionist settlers to be particularly interesting; Morris presents a picture which indicates that the current bloodshed is by no means a product of natural necessity. The ethnic cleansing of Palestine and subsequent military occupation is the cause. However, Morris becomes overly ideological in the concluding sections of the book, allowing his harsh realist politics to creep in. Nevertheless, this is arguably the most comprehensive single volume about the history of the conflict."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Reading the other reviews here it is hard to believe that we have read the same book. Morris, far from being any sort of anti-Zionist fanatic, is in fact consistently sympathetic with the the Zionist movement. In a book that often reads like an apology for Zionists action, he demonstrates, without ever saying so outright, how a\\" democractic secular state\\" containing both Jews and Palestinians was never an option since from almost the beginning of the Jewish migration to Palestine the Arabs consistently used violence to attempt to expel them. While a significant number of the Arab elite appeared inclined to tolerate the Jewish presence up to the 1930s, they were eventually driven into silence, exile or the grave by the Husseini family and their sympathizers, who only paused in their campaign of violence against Zionist and their colloborators when physically crushed in battle. Morris even goes some way to demonstrate that the mass exodus from Palestinian refugees in the 1947-48 war, far from being the product of a concerted policy of Jewish ethnic cleasing, occurred on a piece meal basis in response to a wide variety of events, and that much of Jewish ethnic cleansing was a necessary military response to Arab tactics of using villages to cut off roads and lauch attacks on Jewish settlements, and from a practical point of view their really was no effective military alternative to simply depopulating certain strategic areas of their Arab population. The book is well worth reading for providing a comprehensive overview of the conflict from the beginning of European Jewish immigration to Palestine in the 19th century to the election of Barak in 1999. If anything, I suspect it of being too sympathetic to the Zionists, from whose perspective it is clearly written. My next book on the subject will be one written from the Palestinian perspective.Post script:Benny Morris has now come out and openly proclaimed his lack of sympathy for the Palestinian cause, stating that \\"Yes, the Palestinians are to blame. And this is true not only because they rejected Ehud Barak's generous offer but also because they are unwilling to come to terms with Israel's existence here. They want to throw [the Jews] into the ocean, and anyone who holds a different opinion is mistaken. These are the words of the Historian\\". http://pnews.org/art/10art/1HIST.shtml . Perhaps some of those who condemned Morris for his perceived anti-Zionist bias will now recognize that this \\"revisionist\\" history is in reality a sophisticated defense of the Jewish state."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"This is encyclopedic review and a detailed chronicle of the events surrounding the birth of nation of Israel, first as a homeland for the disposessed and decimated Jewish masses and then eventually as a colonizing military regional superpower. It is extremely detailed and well researched. Facts and salient information is presented without much fanware and distracting analysis. I chanced upon this jewel as it was a textbook for a course on this topic at my son's college.The only shortcoming is that it ends a little short. Another print should have been attempted covering the all important Camp David talks in much more detail, rise of Sharon and Hamas, passing of Arafat, and bloody Lebanon and Gaza invasions.Revealed facts and testimony removes the veil from much of the mythology and propaganda that both sides have been busily fabricating. The Israeli author obviously has more access to the Israeli side of the events.There are very few innocents in this tragedy, but clearly, there is a lot more of their blood on the Israeli hands."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Morris' review is coloured in his attempt to provide equity between Palestinians and Israelis. Historically, the bottom line is that Israel absorbed almost 1 million Arab and Perisan Jews, while the Arabs failed to absorb less than half a million displaced Arabs from the creation of Israel. (Population transfer was the original mandate for Israel, see League of Nations Mandates of 1917, which also created mandates for independent states such as Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, and were affirmed in the first paragraph of the UN Charter) If you're looking for historically documented facts, I suggest Joan Peters' 'From Time Immemorial'. She is a journalist who set out to write a pro-Palestinian book and ended up finding (in almost exclusively Arab sources) a strong history which debunks current Arab claims about refugees and the right of Israel to exist in all of the land west of the Jordan river. For instance, it is interesting that even the UN claims that only 20% of the Arab refugees were landowners (and that the other 80% were migrant workers from other Arab lands and not indigenous to Israel at all), and that these displaced persons were included in the refugee rolls because Arab countries refused to take them back [and they needed shelter and food, which UNRWA could provide). We find from Peters' multiple Arab sources that Arabs openly stated repeatedly that they would use these non-refugees politically (and so far successfully) in attempts to destroy nascent Israel. Morris also completely ignored the facts that 1) until 1981, most Palestinian refugees held Jordanian citizenship, and 2) that Jordanian law, based on the Mandate from 1917, carries a clause which stipulated [until 1981] that all non-Jewish Palestians have a 'right of return' to Jordan. Peters' book is completely annotated, and as I mentioned earlier, her sources are almost exclusively Arab, which lends her book a lot of validity and debunks the most basic premises' of revisionist histories of the conflict."},{"Title":"Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1999","review":"Not at all even handed. Morris makes sweeping statements about what an entire group of people were thinking or feeling based on antidotal evidence at best. Anyone looking to this book to educate themselves about the history of the region should also know that the author has since recanted much of the editorializing he did in these pages. Besides being misleading, it's dense, boring and long. I recommend it only in lieu of a sleeping pill.

Though each part of this can be used independently I recommend using it all together. The book is excellent, as are most of Dobson's parenting tools. This book addresses the concerns of this most turbulent age in childhood - that of becoming a young adult and leaving the time of being a child. I found it to be extremely helpful. The Family Guide is for use with your child and has many helpful ways to engage your child and keep communications open. The Group guide has further exercises and studies. I think the thing I liked most were the Cd's. The first one is for parents only - an overview of the study and encouragement for them as they navigate this time. The remaining Cd's are for the child. Though Dobson does not use alot of modern lingo his messages are direct, to the point, and honest. Each one is based on a subject that is of interest to the child. I thought it was excellent. I highly recommend it to parents. If nothing else it will help you to stay engaged with your child at a time when most children seem to be pulling away. The other benefit it that Dobson can address issues to your child that they may be reluctant to bring up with you or to embarrassed to ask about or afraid to admit that certain things are bothering them. This allows you to approach a subject without being nagging or nosy - they will feel their boundaries are still intact. Wonderful parenting resource!Thank you GospelLight/Regal for the review copies."},{"Title":"Preparing for Adolescence","review":"The book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about. How can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you don't allow them to be well educated about it. Remember the \\"Just say no\\" program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction? Well, telling teenagers simply not to do it only encouraged more of the same and it's certainly no different when it comes to sex. No wonder the Bible belt has higher cases of teen pregnancy for following Dobson's pathetic advice whereas the West coast and the Northeast have far lower numbers and percentages of teen pregnancy by providing sex education to students. If you're going to read this book, be warned that the author is just another rightwing special interest hack."},{"Title":"Preparing for Adolescence","review":"We used the Preparing for Adolescence book for our Disciple Now with 5th and 6th graders.

It is a great way to introduce your teens-to-be to the concepts, challenges, and rewards of growing older. It's more than a discussion about sex - it deals with all the craziness of the teen years. You should have the talk you're your child before someone else does. This book will help you do it in a Biblical and common sense approach. Highly recommend. I know that not everyone agrees with everything that comes from Focus on the Family and Dr. James Dobson; however, this book is pretty straightforward.

I also teach a preadolescent sunday school class for my church. I read the book and began immediately encouraging my oldest son to read it also. As a thirteen year old boy, he had more important things to do than read a book his dad recommended, so I bought the teaching guide and taught it to my sunday school class. We are now exploring other areas, but every time we cross a subject that we studied in the book, the kids remind me where that came from and which of the symptoms the person in question is suufering from. This book has helped a great deal with my children as well as other children in my sunday school class.

We have loaned the tapes to many friends, and each have been pleased with the experience.Many ask when to do this trip with their child.

I thought I wouldn't have to think about it until my child was 13! Ha! The moodiness has already started -- at 10!I enjoyed this book by Dr. Dobson, a well known & trusted author. The book helps the parent see this phase from the child's perspective and is written in a style the child can relate to. It assists them in trying to make sense of it all. It offers the child a preview of what to expect as radical physical and emotional changes begin and suggestions of how to handle them with practical common sense and their faith. The section addressing the \\"facts of life\\" is respectful, frank and thorough, but only offers age appropriate \\"details\\". It is appropriate enough for a 10 year old.The book cover-to-cover may not keep the attention of a 10-12 year old who is accustomed to reading \\"action\\" type books, but if they are searching for answers, it's all there. Whether you buy the book for guidance as a parent, for your child to read, or as a tool to open up discussion on these topics, it is a worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"Preparing for Adolescence","review":"This book is written to 10-12 year-olds and covers self-esteem, feelings of inferiority, peer-pressure, body changes, romantic love, and emotions. I just finished reading it to my sons. It provoked many questions and good conversations. I guess most everyone either loves or hates Dr. Dobson, but this book is just solid preparation for the teen-age years. Other than a couple of overt calls to faith in Christ, the book could be extremely helpful for a parent of any faith to use to help their children get ready for the challenges of adolescence. After all, there's not Christian puberty and Buddhist puberty. The problems addressed are universal."},{"Title":"Preparing for Adolescence","review":"I purchased this book for a niece who is almost twelve and has recently lost her mother because of a traffic accident.

It seems all you need is for someone to shove you through the door (with your fingernails leaving ruts in the door way!). The book opens the door gently for you and your kid. The 3rd chapter covers all the physiology and does it so easily. The rest of the book surprised me with the emotional and mental changes. My daughter has requested I read the rest of the book aloud to her. I read it first and wished I had had this book as a kid. Dobson says that about 85% of pre-adolescent kids willing and desiring to talk to the parents close down communication after the onset of puberty. Do the right thing for your kids before it's too late."},{"Title":"Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective","review":"One of the most biased aspects of this book is found in the recounting the l991 legal ordeal of Frithjof Schuon, known as the pre-eminent spokesman for the Religio Perennis in the 20th century. The author states that as a result of the allegations of Mark Koslow, Schuon was indicted by grand jury, which is true. However, the author goes on to state that the charges were \\"mysteriously dropped\\" even though there was \\"an abundance of evidence\\". As a resident of Bloomington, Indiana where these events occured I would like to correct the false information reported in Mr. al-Rawandi's book. Shortly after the formal charges were filed, as soon as the chief prosecutor began to review the evidence, the assistant prosecutor who was in charge of the investigation was fired. The charges were immediately dropped and a formal public apology issued to Schuon. The prosecutor publicly stated that \\"there is not one shred of evidence\\" to support the charges against Schuon; that a \\"miscarriage has occured\\"; and that Koslow \\"has come under a very large cloud of credibility\\". All of these statements may be found in the November 21, l991 edition of the Bloomington Herald-Times newspaper. Further, the same newspaper in its November 26 lead editorial \\"Schuon Case a Travesty\\" sharply criticized the prosecutor's inattention to the case while he was out of town running for a state-wide political office. Either Mr. al-Rawandi did not bother to research the facts before falsely supporting this attack on Schuon, or he purposely distorted the facts to support his case. In either case, it seriously calls the credibility of the rest of his book into question."},{"Title":"Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective","review":"Written by a failed spiritual seeker turned anti-spiritual polemical secularist, this book lacks the substance and insight possessed by a vaguely similar but nevertheless far superior work of disenchantment, Jeffrey Masson's *My Father's Guru*. Having spent three years attempting without success to follow the Sufi path, Ibn al-Rawandi in this book returns to Sufism but weakly flails about in his efforts to exact from it his revenge. Ultimately his message is that if you are a rationalist and do not believe in spiritual transformation, do not get involved in Sufism. Sound advice--but isn't this obvious?! The bottom line, though, is that a good piece of yellow journalism should at least be a juicy and engaging read. Sadly, this work is by and large flat. So if you want a book on spiritual disenchantment, read Masson. If you want something on Sufism, read anything but Ibn al-Rawandi."},{"Title":"Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective","review":"Let me disabuse Fred Donner of the notion that authorIbn al-Rawandiis the same person as Ibn Warraq (author ofWhy I Am Not a MuslimandQuest for the Historical Muhammad, among innumerable other scholarly titles on Islam). The assertion is false, even preposterous --- and a good indication that Fred Donner has read neither of these authors.Ibn Warraq (whom I'm honored to call friend) has never claimed any association with Sufism, and in each of his many volumes takes a much tougher and more agnostic view of central Islamic theological points than Ibn Al-Rawandi. Ibn Warraq frequently focuses on the violent and warlike features of Islam, and passages in sacred texts that incite such jihad and violence. Al-Rawandi, while skeptical, is also nostalgic.There are some similarities between the two: both were horrified by Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 Islamic fatwa seeking Salman Rushdie's death for having written his novelSatanic Verses. Both are self-described ex-Muslims. And obviously, since Ibn al-Rawandi thanks Ibn Warraq for his encouragement, they do know one another and converse.One enlightening difference, however, is Al-Rawandi's effort to explain, albeit sometimes in the quotations of others, how it is that Muslims perceive their belief and that of others. According to a citation of Frithjof Schuon (the subject of subsequent criminal prosecution and much controversy) --- which comes closest to anything I've seen to describing the \\"reality\\" --- is the \\"curious tendency [of the average Muslim] to believe that non-Muslims either know that Islam is the truth and reject it out of pure obstinacy, or else are simply ignorant of it and can be converted by elementary explanations...\\" The idea that anyone can in good conscience oppose Islam \\"quite exceeds the Muslim's imagination precisely because,\\" to him, Islam is entirely coincident with \\"the irresistible logic of things.\\"To average Muslims, then, \\"no explanations are necessary,\\" and indeed, no probing or doubtful questions are allowed or to be tolerated. To Islamic believers, not believing is \\"not like failing to turn up in church on Sunday,\\" but rather akin to \\"a traitorous act in time of war.\\" It's making an alliance with an enemy \\"for whom no good word can be said, an act for which the only appropriate penalty is death.\\"Furthermore, by way of explaining the appeal of Islam to some conservative intellectual Westerners (who take a romantic view of \\"The East\\" and Arabs) \\"Islam is in fact the last refuge,\\" as they wish \\"that the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, in short the 'modern world,' had never come about.\\"Al-Rawandi is also refreshingly skeptical about Sufism, which far too many Westerners believe to be a \\"kinder, gentler\\" form of Islam. This supposedly mystical counter-movement, however, is in the author's words \\"as much a late construct resulting from the Arabs' acquiring an empire as Islam itself.\\" And like Islam itself, Sufism is also \\"heavily dependent on hadith qudsi, supposedly direct sayings of God not included in the Koran,\\" That is to say, it is antithetical to logical reasoning and fully dependent on total acceptance of Islamic doctrine and an entire tradition without definitive evidence of any kind.This book is not at all like the works of Ibn Warraq, except that if offers the willing reader much additional material as to encourage healthy skepticism of Islam, and particularly its mystical incarnations.--- Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective","review":"The author provides very little information about himself; he joined a sufi order in Cyprus in 1985 and left them three years later, he has written for Philosophy Now and New Humanist and now lives in London. His pseudonym is taken from a famous historical skeptic of Islam; it makes it hard to Google him without getting results for the well-known one. Chapter two of this book appears in another form as chapter two of the pseudonymous Ibn Warraq'sThe Quest for the Historical Muhammad. A reviewer of that book, Fred McGraw Donner, speculates they're the same person. Well, in a sense they might as well be: two unknown writers critical of Islam who don't appear to have any original ideas of their own.I liked the first two parts of the book. He does a decent job of summarizing the origins of Islam from the Islamic standpoint, and then the criticism of the sources hits the mark, I think. However, he lacks the same skepticism regarding some of the works providing a different account of the origins of Islam. He completely acceptsHagarism:The Making of the Islamic World, for example (maybe Prometheus Press should simply reprint that book?).I found the chapter on Islamic mysticism to be almost totally incomprehensible, even though the book is supposed to be aimed at \\"the general reader\\" as he says. Most of it focuses on ibn Arabi. Maybe the ideas are just so irrational and esoteric they make no sense (quite possible), or perhaps he's just really bad at explaining mystical Islam. I found the following chapter on the secular perspective of sufism to be just barely more comprehensible. The short chapter \\"Islam's View of Itself in the Modern World\\" was odd, didn't seem to be about that at all. The following secular perspective was much more readable, but instead of being about \\"Islam in the Modern World\\" in general as titled, it's primarily about perennialism and Sheikh Nazim's Naqshbandi Sufi order. Since Nazim lived in Cyprus and did outreach to non-Muslims in London, it's easy to infer that the author had been a student of his, but oddly he doesn't say.In the end, he writes \\"the aim of the book\\" was to \\"offer arguments for [leaving Islam] and provide the intellectual basis on which it can be done.\\" It's disingenuous, I think, not to have said that in the introduction (or title). I would have liked the book to have been entirely about what the title promised.There's also an appendix on the number 19 theory of Rashad Khalifa, late founder of the Quran-only/anti-Hadith sect now called \\"The Submitters.\\" This is somewhat interesting, but seems to have been included not so much because of any thematic relation than because he feels it's an argument in favor of the human creation of the Quran. More information about Khalifa can be found inDid Adam and Eve Have Navels?: Debunking Pseudoscience."},{"Title":"Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective","review":"Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective by Ibn Al-Rawandi (Prometheus Books) Any believer needs to fairly read some debunking views of one's beliefs. First it is always important to know other points of view, even if they do not persuade or even tend to subvert the truth of the positions one holds as true and life-saving. This book offers a critique of the Sufi path of transformation by a former seeker who feels there is serious deception and self-deception on the spiritual path and it is better to be rational and consistent in one's views than to seek fantastical delusions. Now such a position is unlikely to appeal to the mystic but if one wants to mature in one's mysticism one should give such nay-sayers a careful hearing, concede their good points and carefully critique the limitations of their point of view. Otherwise perhaps such rationalists are correct and such pursuits are bunk."},{"Title":"Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective","review":"Ibn Al Rawandi's book is a rare example of someone who puts people and human rights before ideology. In this time where ultra-right Christian fanatics and Islamist fanatics actively kill each other and advocate yet more violence, Ibn Rawandi urges caution and thoughtfulness and respect for human rights. He advocates studying honestly the history of Sufism to provide a new, critical analysis of Islam. This of course offends the partisans of reactionary Islamism as well as traditionalists, who hate democracy and rational inquiry. The book bravely takes on the traditionalist Sufi and cult leader Frithjof Schuon, who was accused of child molestation in 1991. Charges against Schuon were dropped, evidently due to cult pressure. The Schuon group has sought to intimidate anyone critical of them since then. It's no wonder they denounce Ibn al Rawandi's book, since they still need to cover up for their Master's abuses. But the truth is that since 1991, and despite intimidation, many have come forward and supplied new evidence that shows that Schuon was indeed a polygamist and had strange mystico-sexual rites in which children were involved. One of Schuon's four wives , Maude Murray, supplied evidence against her husband, for instance. In any case, Ibn al Rawandi's book is to be praised for its effort to find the truth in an age of fanaticism and religious wars. His support of human rights over and above fanatical traditionalist ideologues is commendable."},{"Title":"Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective","review":"Ibn Al-Rawandi ...died more than a thousand years ago. Ibn Al-Rawandi the author of this book lives today, As a matter of fact he dedicated the book to his mother 1903-, and inside the book he discussed the views of modern - twentieth century - thinkers as P. Crone and M. Cook who published a book together 1980's, and probably the author assumed the alias Ibn Al-rawandi for himself. To clear the Matter to the reader I add the following two notes:Ibn Al-Rawandi( 9th century):The moslem notion that the Koran, no one can produce like it and also - this came later by moslem theoligians - the Koran is as eternal as Allah itself and therefore was not created. was rejected by Nazzam a famous reasonable moslem theologian who was by no means secular. Nazzam saw that notion is damaging to islam especially among the intellectuals, so he said that the Arabs contemporary of Mohammad were able to write like Koran. But he then maintained that Allah stopped the Arabs from doing so as a proof to his prophet. This last statement by Nazzam is not strictly true, for some Arab contemporary to the prophet Mohammad did compose like Koran and their works was destroyed when Islam became dominant. These Statement by Nazzam that the Arab were able to produce like Koran - as the head of Arabic literatures Taha Hussein said in his Phd thesis - caused a great impact on Moslem free thinkers as Ibn Al-Rawandi and Abul-Ala Al Muary who wrote books challenging the Koran. Muary wrote a 4 volumes books in the same pattern as Koran, 3 were lost or destroyed and only the first volume survived. Although Muary and Rawandi shared the same views about religion, Rawandi was hedonist a wine drinker, Muary wasn't, he was strictly vegetarian never married wished if the human race perished from the earth even in one poem he gave the wolf a nobel position than man. Muary came after Rawandi and attacked him for his hedonismm but there is an important point about Muary which even today great sholars have not noticed, Muary was believing in many of the things h's criticizing Rawandi ofIbn Al-Rawandi (Today), the BookThe book is very great, terse and compact.

This trivialises it, for it is, to my mind, truly tragic. In a shockingly irresponsible drunken act, protagonist Michael Henchard sells his wife at a local fair. The consequences, stretching over a couple of decades, sweep away both him and other characters.The plot teems with journeys, coincidences, long-lost people showing up, and a strong vein of morality. In typical Hardyesque style, Henchard moves from the height of civic success to bankruptcy and alienation. A quasi-Greek-tragedy air of fate prevails, but Hardy manages to keep suspense alive. Protagonist and antagonist (Farfrae) are pitted against each other on civic and domestic fronts. There is not one Mayor of Casterbridge, but two, and success, failure and rivalry play a large part. There is also competition among the males as lovers, husbands and fathers.This novel gives an insight into civic life, the worthy burgesses of Casterbridge networking in their council-rooms and taverns. But the animal instincts of the wife-sale, the gutter-press viciousness of the locals' \\"skimmity-ride\\", and the proximity of the countryside, where so many Victorian characters wander to survive and to lay bare their feelings, reveal the fragility of civilisation and our urban constructs.Great stuff."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I read this novel in English class, like most people probably did. It was one of the best assigned to us.Hardy is a gifted author. He writes in a clear style with vivid descriptions that really bring the setting alive, without making the reader (at least this reader) feel inundated with borning, unnecessary detail.The thing that I look for most in a novel, however, is quality characterizeations, and this book had them in spades. Dialogue was used effectively to flesh out characters. These are not stock characters, either. These people have flaws and shades of grey. They seem as though they could be real. I found that I could relate to the characters, and I did empathize with them, even when I didn't agree with their choices. Everyone had clear motivations. The characterization of Henchard shows that Hardy clearly understood the notion of the tragic flaw and the tragic hero/anti hero.Students who have to read this book as part of their English class may find it a bit on the long side. I would urge you to stick with it; once you get through the initial chapters the book will pick up (a commonality that all British classics seem to share). The book is easy to follow and understand. It is a key novel that marks the shift from Romantic Age to the Victorian Age, so it's an important read for anyone who has a serious interest in English Literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions: that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the events arise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering: the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for.As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones, lacking even Hardy's Preface, though it has a bibliography. The dedicated will want something more extensive, but the work more than stands on its own."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Michael Henchard, a down-on-his-luck, unemployed hay trusser, succumbs to the siren call of alcohol at a country fair. Subconsciously feeling his wife, Susan, is holding him back from success in this world, he awakes to sobriety the next morning and realizes that, in a foolish fit of pique, he has auctioned her and his daughter, Elizabeth-Jane, off to a sailor. Despite his frantic efforts to find them, they have disappeared. Ravaged with guilt over his selfish, impulsive act, he swears he will not take another drink for twenty-one years.Whether his wife was indeed one of Henchard's problems is left for the reader to ponder as Henchard moves to Casterbridge, prospers wildly in business and eventually becomes the town's leading citizen and mayor. Henchard's wheel of fortune, however, begins to spin on a wobbly axle as Donald Farfrae, an enterprising young Scot travelling to seek his fortune, enters his employ as the manager of his business. At the same time, Susan and Elizabeth-Jane, re-enter Henchard's life believing that Michael Newson, the sailor who had purchased them some nineteen years earlier, has perished at sea. Henchard's life truly begins to come apart when Lucetta Templeman, a former lover, also moves to Casterbridge and, ashamed of her past romantic entanglement with Henchard, seeks to hold him to his promise of marriage!Hardy raises many issues but, not expressing his own opinion through an unequivocal direction in the story's plot line, seems content to leave these issues as topics for sober analysis by his readers. Hardy questions the conflict between the merits of tradition vs modernization. There is the enormous irony that Henchard's success as a business person seems clearly attributable in part to his tee-totalling vow but is founded upon the five guineas seed capital raised through the auction of his wife and daughter! Henchard seems to epitomize the constant personal conflicts we all face between decisiveness and strength of character as opposed to impulsiveness and stubborn bullheaded intransigence! One wonders whether Lucetta is flighty, coquettish, thoughtless and selfish or is she an early manifestation of modern woman sadly out of time and years ahead of the ladies around her? Is Farfrae to be admired or scorned for his meteoric rise to power in Casterbridge and his complete devastation of Henchard's place among his peers?Perhaps the most powerful moment of the entire novel comes with the discovery of Henchard's will and his words directing that the world leave him to rest in forgotten isolation and that no person mark or mourn his passing in any fashion. Once again, we are left to decide for ourselves whether Henchard's life should be pitied, forgiven, admired or looked upon with scorn and disgust.To the readers of the day, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" would have been perceived as a darkly pessimistic tragedy that might have evoked emotions akin to those raised by Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" or Sophocles' \\"Oedipus Rex\\". A classic worthy of the term, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\", certainly never cheerful or uplifting, is however many, many things - compelling, moving, disturbing, thought-provoking and poignant. Above all, it is worthy of being read and enjoyed by any lover of classic 19th century British Literature.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This book has everything fans of the 19th century novel, such as myself, love-melodrama, romance, secrets, plot twists, mistaken identities, rising fortunes, and, of course, a tragic ending. I can't give much away because the novel rests on a series of shocking revelations-each more shocking than the last!However, since the book begins with the most startling event of all, and since it is given away on the back of the book, and happens at the very beginning, I will only deal with that event, which is what drew me to the book in the first place. This will set the stage and make you want to read the book as much as I did when my friend told me about it!The main character is a certain Henchard who SELLS HIS WIFE AND INFANT DAUGHTER. That's right, he sells them! To a sailor! Granted, he is drunk. It's an intriguing study of alcoholism, although some men wouldn't have to be one to want to sell their wives for some beer if they could get away with it. Henchard's wife is understandably furious, and leaves with the sailor. After this, Henchard vows to never again drink-although the introduction to my edition suggests that he remains a \\"dry drunk\\". I don't exactly know what that that entails, but the introduction assured me that it was one of the first books on alcoholism which is important enough.Henchard then redeems himself and in Jean Valjean fashion would like to both atone for, and hide, his shameful past. He tries to find his wife and daughter, and that's where all the fascinating plot twists come in. It's very well-written and kept my attention throughout. I have also read \\"Tess\\" by Hardy and I like his writing style. I cannot say that his works moved me in any profound way as other literature has, but I'm not sure why that's important. There's a lot of humor and farce in this book which is first-rate, and I just enjoyed his protagonist-it's not easy to create one so believable and yet so interesting at the same time.Yes, there's a lot of melodrama, but who is to say that an individual like Henchard, with his addictions and his furious personality, wouldn't realistically live a melodramatic life? I'm sure all those who panned this book may have known someone who found a way to surround themselves with drama even in this day and age. All the book's drama is caused by Henchard and his mercurial personality-if at any time he'd played things differently he could have had a better life. But no, he had to be a lunatic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"One of my favorites works of English literature. The opening \\"wife selling\\" chapter is one of the best in all literate, setting the major tone and themes for the entire book. The ironic twits of fate provide a wild, entertaining ride that shows off Hardy's themes of the balance between fate and individual choice in a non-didactic way. The Mayor must be ranked as a tragic character in line with Shakespeare's best work. A work that makes profound psychological and philosophical statement while remaining engrossing on every level."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I began reading The Mayor of Casterbridge as an ISP (Independant Study Project) novel, as it was reccommended to me by my English teacher. At first, I found the book to be unbearably boring, but beautifully written. The language is something to be admired. But I soon became absorbed in the story, and I have to say it was one of the most compelling ones I've ever read. I might just say it's the best book I ever have read. And it's sad. I'm a 16 year old guy, and I cried at the end. I don't want to sound prissy, but it's true. And you will cry too, I'm sure. If there is one thing I can say to you, it's this: read The Mayor of Casterbridge. It would be a great injustice to one of the most profound stories of our time."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"For being written in 1886, this book felt surprisingly modern and completely engrossing. The twists and turns of Henchard's life enthralled me and though many of his actions proved him reprehensible, he was still somehow likable... Farfrae also was an interesting character, though Elizabeth-Jane truly stole the show. All in all, I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed reading this and I will certainly keep an eye out for his other works. Hardy is one of those classic authors that genuinely isn't a chore to read!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" es a truly remarkable novel. Interesting throughout, it is the story of the rise and fall of a man named Mechael Henchard. Ay the beginning of the novel, Henchard is a volatile, twenty-one-year-old hay-trusser. He becomes drunk at a fair and sells his wife and daughter to a sailor in an auction, which originally began as a joke, turns serious.Upon realizing that he has sold his family, Henchard searches for them to no avail, and takes an oath to give up alcohol for twenty-one years. After the supposed death of the sailor, Michael's wife, Susan Henchard, and her daughter began a search for Michael Henchard, who has become the mayor of Casterbridge.The novel proceeds as many soap-opera-like events unfold. The unique plot-twists made reading the novel a very entertaining experience. An unfavorable trait Henchard possesses is not letting go of past mistakes. Although he tries to atone for the past indiscretions, fate always seems to catch up to him. These factors and others contribute to the downfall of Michael Henchard."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Thomas Hardy has a reputation for writing bleak, sad stories. The Mayor happens to be my first Hardy read, and I can't tell you how saddening I found the overall tale.Many points are made by Hardy: dealing with the past and its haunting effects; pride before the fall; and even the folly of mental inflexibility.I couldn't shake the parallel of the King Saul/David story from the Bible while reading this. You have the powerful man who takes in an apprentice then becomes overcome with jealousy and envy as his apprentice eventually outshines him. And rather than putting his usurped life in perspective, allows his anger and envy to make matters much worse.I saw Michael as a flawed man who is redeemed by his sense of duty and obligation.I think the theme of duty to world versus self is important here. Michael's duty to his first family overrides his desire to be with his new girlfriend Lucetta. He probably would have been happier with Lucetta; but wouldn't we as the audience have seen him as selfish if he had chosen her instead of Susan? Both women were manipulative, one aggressively, one passively, so it probably didn't matter. But it does raise the question of how much of our personal happiness should be sacrificed for societal duties.Donald Farfrae, the Scottish apprentice is put here purely to provide Michael Henchard with a foil. I don't feel he is developed at all, and is kind of dull, as is Elizabeth Jane.There are character driven stories and plot-driven stories. And in plot-driven stories, you know that the characters' personalities or decision-making won't really matter in how things end. That's an aspect of Mayor...that some may find the most frustrating. You never could shake the feeling that destiny was unalterable. I, however, had no problem with it. It was a good ride."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Opinions on this novel seem to be a bit polarized to say the least. The plot is a tad too complex and soap-opera-ish for its own good, but the twists and turns are interesting enough to keep people interested, and it really isn't a tough read. Additionally, it represents the transition between the more emotional, passion-centered Romantic era (Henchard) to the more mechanical Victorian Era (Farfrae), and that in itself is a pretty interesting concept."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The story twists and turns and Hardy takes the reader on a journey exploring the hopes and shattered dreams of the book's central characters.This is a masterpiece.I, like many reviewers above, had to study this text aged 16 for school exams. At the time, I remeber thinking that the long winded descriptions of the countryside irritated me. Perhaps now, aged 28, I would appreciate this book more. I feel that those who criticise it are entitled to do so - but the criticisms (if genuine) ought to be more constructive than those above - which are just bitter and inmature!As a story, this is first class and a must. Read it and savour it."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"If I were ever to be an English Literature teacher, The Mayor of Casterbridge is the first book I'd start with. Not just because it's filled with themes of major gravity or features extraordinary descriptions of England and its culture, but simply because it's a damn good read. One reads it at a breakneck pace, occasionally stopping only when plot twists have one's jaw dropping on the floor. This is one of the most truly amazing books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is a superbly crafted tale of youthful folly and the futility of repentance. Set in the early Victorian Wessex beloved of Hardy, the time and place still speak to audiences more than a century after the novel was written.The title character commits one huge act of drunken folly in his youth, to his eternal regret. He seeks to put it behind him and become a pillar of his community. But the consequences of his deed come back to haunt him and one by one he is stripped of all that he holds sacred and dear.The prose is so vivid and the tragedy of the ending so great that it is like being pierced with hot and cold daggers again and again as one reads the last fifty pages or so.Vivid characterization, realistic deeds, thought, and dialogue, and graphically depicted settings all combine to make this one of the finest novels in the English language.Even if you are not a Hardy fan, this novel is a must-read! The many TV movies and mini-series do not do it justice!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Thomas Hardy's books are somewhat difficult to read, but this book, set in an English market town, is well worth reading to obtain a picture of life in rural England during that time period along with a complex tale of an ambitious man's rise and ultimate fall. A man rising from the ranks of farm laborers builds himself up to become a successful grain merchant and leading citizen of the town.

Traveling by foot with his stoic wife and baby girl, hay-trusser Michael Henchard arrives in Weydon-Priors during its annual fair. Having drunk too much laced furmity he makes an astounding offer to those gathered in the tent: he will auction off the unvalued females to the highest bidder! Fate protects poor Susan and Elizabeth Jane as the only bidder proves a decent sailor named Newsome. The simple-minded woman does not realize that such a contract is not binding, but remains with him--even emigrating to Canada for 18 years--until his reported death at sea.Somewhat sobered the next day Henchard feels deep remorse--to the extent that he enters an empty church and swears abstinence for 21 years in penance. Arriving in the major city of Casterbridge-site of ancient Roman ruins and some lugubrious customs-he works his way up in Society until he becomes a respected grain merchant and eventually the mayor. Though unwed he had a dalliance on the island of Jersey with a local girl named Lucetta, who nursed him through an illness--thus compromising her own reputation.The wheels of fate are grinding away when Susan and Elizabeth Jane-who may not be his daughter after all-arrive in Casterbridge. The latter has been raised in ignorance of the auction and Henchard's role in her life, but her mother is nervous, desiring to appeal to him quietly before deciding her next course of action and residence. On the eve of a big feast in town another newcomer arrives: a young Scotsman named Donald Farfrae, en route to Canada himself. Taking an immediate liking to the smart young fellow, Henchard convinces him to stay on and serve as his manager. Thus Hardy sets in motion the literary mechanism of a complicated plot: two men courting one woman; two women who are attracted to one man and eventually two men claiming to be Elizabeth Jane's father.There is a sense of fatalism in many of Hardy's novels; his characters strive against their destiny (the result of poor choices, as well as untoward coincidences) but they seem compelled to play out their dismal roles. Tragedy perhaps, pathos definitely. Hardy highlights the often unfair role of women in his society, set against a backdrop of snobbery, poverty, a strict class system and an undercurrent of superstition. A bit grim but satisfying for devotees of 19th century British literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge, Thomas Hardy's great novel published in 1886, is a classic of English Literature.

If you are a reader who likes suspense and tragedy then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"One of Hardy's best novels. The characterisation are excellent and the descriptive writing is superb. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" seems to be a moral allegory. In a moment of drunken callousness, young Michael Henchard sells his wife and daughter to a genial sailor. When he awakes from his drunken stupor Henchard sinks deep in regret, and swears not to touch the bottle again for two decades. He searches for his family, and unable to locate them he stumbles into the town of Casterbridge where he develops a successful farming business, becomes mayor and the pillar of the community. Eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter find him the single and temperate Mayor of Casterbridge makes haste in reclaiming his lost family, and it seems it's all well that ends well.At the same time a young dashing Scotsman Donald Farfrae enters Henchard's life, and the Mayor is determined to make Donald his acolyte. It seems that the two have much in common, but Donald proves he is in fact the Mayor's polar opposite. Whereas Michael can be both generous (he pleas with Donald to remain in Casterbridge to work for him) and stingy (he fires Donald after dancing with his daughter Elizabeth-Jane), loving and brutal, brooding and quick to anger, Donald is the model of the proper Christian businessman and husband. Donald understands, forgives, tolerates, and endures all of Michael's impetuous insults and attacks, and he is finally rewarded with Michael's lover, daughter, business, and mayorship.But ultimately Michael Henchard is the protagonist of the novel, and while he is certainly petty, provincial, and proud his fall is both epic and poignant. Michael had eighteen years of quiet prosperity in Casterbridge, but the novel makes no mention of it at all, and Michael must endure one tragedy after another. It seems that Michael's undoing is that he thinks and feels too much. He is quick to anger and proud of mind because he is first to love and steadfast in his loyalty; in comparison, Donald Farfrae seems cold and calculating, slowly and methodically building his reputation at the cost of Michael's. Yes, Michael did fire Donald, but Michael had urgently pleaded with Donald to stay in Casterbridge and given him experience, connections, and a reputation: if Donald had truly been good and loyal he would have left instead of staying to compete with Michael. And then there's Lucetta who was engaged to Michael but eloped with Donald: this one act proved the irreversible destruction of Michael's fortune.If this is a moral allegory, and ostensibly it is nothing but a moral allegory it is not certain what is being said. Should we really aim to be like Donald Farfrae who is cold in his generosity and calculating in his fair-mindedness? And yes there really isn't much to be said for Michael Henchard's pride and anger, but there was also something concretely good and stubbornly noble about the man. He was also capable of reflection, and in the end he sought to do what was good, even if it meant disappearing forever. Look under Donald Farfrae's smooth handsomeness, and you'll discover guile and duplicity. Look under Michael Herndon's rugged vehemence, and you'll discover love and goodness. Michael Herndon has wronged so he seeks to do right. But having never done wrong does Donald Farfrae know the difference between right and wrong?\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" marks a revolution in rural England, as the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution finally begin to set in. Calculating reason and Christian piety seek to overturn the rural tempers and superstitions that have dominated the England countryside for so long, and so Donald Farfrae must inevitably triumph over Michael Herndon. Yes, with Michael Herndon's departure, the world has become a calmer, more reasonable, more enlightened place. But \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" leaves us with a hanging question: are we better for it?"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This was an ok novel. It has many plots and twists and is a little hard to follow. The cliff notes make the book much easier to follow."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This book was astounding. Never have i read such a wonderful piece of literature. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The notes on the back of my copy of this book describe it as a &quot;Sophoclean&quot; tragedy. This is a very apt description. Like the plays of Sophocles, Hardy's novel proceeds directly from one mistake and misunderstanding to the next with very little padding in between. As a result, the plot can seem unlikely (as several below have commented). It's sad, however, if people reject it for that reason.This novel contains one of the more fascinating characters in literature. Michael Henchard is a man of the &quot;old school&quot; who conducts business on a hand shake and who constantly acts and reacts to the visible world. Despite this, he is often aware of his mistakes after the fact, yet is unable to use this knowledge to avoid future pitfalls.He's contrasted brilliantly with Donald Farfrae, who is a &quot;new man&quot; who trusts in the future. Ironically (and I suspect intentionally) Hardy make Farfrae seem a far shallower man than Henchard. Yet, the &quot;new man&quot; ends up on top.The end of this novel is one of the bitterest in all of literature. Henchard's will being an almost total negation of his existance. What could be more tragic than that for a flawed, but essentially good man?"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I loved the irony. I mean, how much worse could life get for the Mayor? After selling his wife, and swearing off drinking, what was left for him? When he meets his wife again, it becomes to turning point of his life once again, including his &quot;daughter&quot;."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This is the easiest Thomas Hardy novel, but one of the most complex in terms of emotions. Being an English literature fan, I have to say that the story that goes on in this book is one of the most original and refreshing. If you found Tess of the DUrbervilles (another Hardy book) too difficult but loved the general storyline, read this, it's simpler for the simple minds out there."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"&quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I loved the book! It is not for the faint of heart as it takes a little more time to read....the old English. The story is classic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This book is similar to a Dickens novel in that it seeks not to reach perfection, but to please its audience at the time. Like Dickens, it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still, Hardy paints a very lively, realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days, before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy, if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Michael Henchard (yep - - later he's the Mayor, all right), having sold his wife and baby early in the novel for 5 guineas while in a drunken rage, gets what he deserves despite his valiant efforts at atonement years later after an initial rise in fortune and a 'chance' reunion with his long-abandoned wife and daughter. Not that an example of Divine retribution is Hardy's intention; Hardy was an atheist. But he stacks the cards so heavily against Henchard that it's hard to believe he isn't a True Believer after all. Chance? Irony? Coincidence? (Synchroncity?? Gadzooks!) Divine retribution? All grist for Hardy's deterministic mill, and a grinding mill it is for Henchard. It ultimately doesn't matter - - to prove his point Hardy orchestrates the narrative so obviously and nothing can stop Henchard's downward spiral, of course. Everywhere in the novel, it's plain he's doomed. Hardy created this character whose final wish, as Hardy has him spell out in his will, is that he be forgotten. And then Hardy titles the novel after him for the ages. Did I hear someone say 'Omniscient Narrator'? Pretty divine, I'd say."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The book is essentially a daytime soap opera. Except, none of the characters are likeable.My suggestion: read only the very last line of the book. The book's very existence strives to make this sentiment true."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I began reading this novel since it has such a great reputation as being a &quot;classic.&quot; However, after reading well over a hundred pages, the book failed to keep my attention in the least bit. The plot is weak and pathetic, and the characters are too one-dimensional. Although it may pick up later, it certainly is not worth it."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I read this book for a class, and I am sorry to say that it was a disappointment. It is a silly tale, and totally unrealistic. I cannot believe that something like this could be considered a &quot;classic&quot;. Mike sure made some dumb choices, and it is unrealistic! No one could make that many blunders. It was bogged down by unnecessary details, etc. All-in-all, a 100% waste. Don't buy this book. You've been warned."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Thomas Hardy, while certainly an extremely talented author, seemingly had the knack of producing Victorian-era soap operas which never fails to depress even the most cheerful soul. Sometimes his depressing stories has a message that produces a somewhat cathartic reading experience (as with Tess of the D'Urbervilles), but with The Mayor of Casterbridge all we get is utter negativity. This mayor is one twisted, selfish and self-loathing individual. He seems to live with a rain cloud over his head, and doesn't quite understand how it is to be loved. Fun guy? Nope. And there isn't even a happy ending.Bottom line: nice characterizations and fine prose amount to lipstick on a sow. Not recommended."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I skimmed some of the longer descriptions of scenery/village life. There was still plenty to stir my imagination. This study of human character - especially that of Henchard - was very interesting. Really enjoyed the book!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge is a story about Michael Henchard attempts at redemption and the many sorrows, pain, and misery that comes with his decision to uphold his pride and name. To say that Henchard is the only character that suffers in this novel would be a misrepresentation; almost every character at some point suffers immensely in some trial of life, whether it is death of someone close, pain of separation, or the frustration of a relationship. For these reasons, this work is not a \\"light\\" read by any stretch of the imagination, and will probably test even the optimist's patience in getting through. Still, Hardy's story, the descriptions of the countryside and the characters' inner feelings, as well as the way he ties together every character in this book, is a remarkable feat and makes for a powerful read.The story begins with Michael Henchard walking with his wife, Susan, to the fair as they cross the countryside. While there, in an act of drunkenness, Henchard sells his wife to a sailor, and seemingly sets in motion his irreversible bad fortune. Not being able to find his wife the next day, he makes an oath to not drink alcohol for 21 years, the exact amount of years he has lived. The novel then fast forwards 19 years to find Henchard the Mayor of Casterbridge, and a noteworthy man of respect. Susan finds him, marries him after forgiving him, but there are many secrets that both parties have and will have until the end of the novel. It seems that many of these secrets are the character's downfalls. Henchard, while Mayor of Casterbridge, meets a man named Donald Farfrae, who he comes to like and implores to stay in town; however, eventually he and Farfrae become bitter rivals in not only their business and society, but also in their relationship with Lucetta, a woman who had an affair with Henchard in the past.Henchard's fallacy of character lay in his stubborn pride and his foolish belief that name and appearance is everything. He sometimes tries to create a faade, or cover up one sin with another secret or problem. When he tries to persuade Lucetta to marry him, so as to not destroy her name, he retorts: \\"But it is not by what is, in this life, but by what appears, that you are judged.\\" He is a tragic individual who seems to not be able to change his views long enough to make something right occur; when something does go well, it is short lived. He even gets to a point where he connects himself with an ominous and unpreventable fate, at one point referring to himself as Cain. He never really heeds Elizabeth's attempts at love until very late in the novel when tragic occurrences seem to be set in motion.Still, despite all his problems, and all his pride, he is a \\"likeable\\" character because he makes the effort at retribution and is sorrowful each time he gets hit with a dilemma or makes an unfavorable decision. He has the willingness and conscience to try to amend his deficiencies, but, in the end, he just makes too many mistakes, and has too much pride to reverse his fortunes."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"&quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; feels like something Charles Dickens would have written if he had been a more efficient storyteller, more economical in his prose, and had a better understanding of how humor is supposed to be applied to tragedy, if at all -- with subtlety and congruity. This is not intended to be a slight against Dickens, but rather a testament to the quality of Thomas Hardy's writing.The first chapter alone is a dramatic masterpiece and perfectly sets the rhythm for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work as a hay-trusser. They go to a country fair where Henchard immediately gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Regretting his actions the next day, Henchard looks for them in vain, swears off liquor for twenty-one years, then takes up residence in a town called Casterbridge.Nineteen years later, Susan, now widowed, and Elizabeth-Jane track Henchard to Casterbridge. It turns out that in the intervening years, Henchard has become a successful granary owner and is now the town's mayor. He welcomes his former wife and daughter, proving himself to be genial but often petty and easily vexed. For one thing, he is in a bitter rivalry with a former employee, a young Scotchman named Donald Farfrae, not only in business but also for the affections of a vixenish woman named Lucetta who has recently moved to town.Hardy wastes no pages unfolding the plot, which is filled with Dickensian intrigue. It chronicles Henchard's relationship with Susan and Elizabeth-Jane after their return, his jealousy over Farfrae and Lucetta (who happens to be Henchard's old flame and inadvertently incites a public scandal because of this), his fear of the discovery of his deceit, and, finally, his feelings of isolation from Elizabeth-Jane and the town he loves. By the end, you realize that Henchard is not a bad man; he's a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment.Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid. He has a sharp ear for native dialects, and the dialogue of Casterbridge's inhabitants comes off as genuinely homey chatter rather than just dispensations of information set up to advance the plot. Moreover, like any good fictional place, Casterbridge takes on a vibrant life of its own, offering a realistic bucolic backdrop for this stormy human drama."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"An early fall afternoon in the 1840s bucolic world of Wessex. Michael Henchard, a young hay trusser, sells his wife Susan to another man for the paltry sum of five guineas. The 400 page classic by Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) goes on to chronicle the rise and fall of Henchard. The main characters are:1. Michael Henchard-The tragic Mayor of Casterbridge who loses all he values in life and all those people he loves to his rival. Henchard is a visible proof of the fact that fiction displays \\"the human heart in conflict with itself.' He is a Faustian striver who is ambitious in business as a corn chandler; politics as he becomes mayor and love losing the three women who have meant most to him. Henchard dies in an obscure hut near Egdon Heath desiring to be completely forgotten by the world. He has a death wish and wishes to achieve the oblivion of death in a universe controlled by fate, chance and irony. He is one of Hardy's great creations.2. Sue Henchard is the wife sold by Henchard to a sailor. She emigrates with him to America. When she returns 20 years later to Casterbridge she remarries Henchard but dies soon after the wedding. She is a simple-minded country woman lacking in knowledge and sophistication.3. Donald Farfrae-While Henchard represents ancient Wessex in folkways and beliefs, Mr. Farfrae is a young Scotchman who soon steals Henchard's supremacy in Casterbridge. He is hired by Henchard to straighten out the latter's business affairs but leaves him to start a successful rival business firm. Farfrae is the second Mayor of Casterbridge in this novel. He marries Henchard's mistress Lucetta. When Lucetta dies after being the center of a scandal caused by old loves letters to Henchard being revealed, Farfrae weds Henchard's stepdaughter Elizabeth Jane. He is a kind man who seeks to help Henchard to no avail.4. Eliaabeth-Jane-She is an intelligent person who returns from abroad with her mother Sue. She has been raised to believe that Michael Henchard is her father. Elizabeth-Jane becomes a hired companion to Henchard's quondom mistress Lucetta. Elizabeth Jane later weds Farfrae. This young lady learns her real father is the sailor Newson and Sue.5. Seaman Newson-The real father of Sue who returns to find her twenty years after the deal of exchange he made to purchase Sue as his wife from Michael Henchard.6. Lucette-The Jersey miss who had an affair long ago with Michael Henchard. Lucette is sexy and exotic. She weds Donald Farfrae dying after details of her affair with Henchard lead to scandal.The characters in this ironical novel are all puppets in an uncaring universe.The last word in the novel is \\"pain\\"! There is plenty of pain to share among all the characters.As with all of Hardy's classic novels, the descriptions of the town folks and the flora and fauna of Wessex are beautifully written. Hardy is the best regional novelist in all of English literature.The Penguin Edition of the novel contains excellent illustrations by Robert Barnes which were included in the original edition. A helpful chronology of Hardy's life; discussion of the textual history of the novel and a useful introduction by Dr. Keith Hardy are included. The novel is one you should read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"My second reading of a Thomas Hardy novel was every bit enjoyable as the first, if not more. Having a very limited background with this gifted author, it has taken years to appreciate his talents.The Mayor of Casterbridge starts with a very dubious event...concerning a drunken 'sale' of two persons by one Michael Henchard...bidding them a not-so-fond farewell; once Michael sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family.Flash forward 19 years, when a weary woman and her now-grown daughter appear near Casterbridge, searching for the woman's first husband, who has now become the mayor, and succeeded in keeping his 21 year pledge to abstain from drink following his grievous error years before.Susan Henchard, now the widow of a missing sailor, comes looking for Michael, and is surprised at what she finds. A sober, well-to-do, respected member of the community, and a leader. A far cry from the man who bartered her away years before. Also new in town is Donald Farfrae, who, once apprenticed to hay and corn merchant Michael, becomes more than Michael bargained for.To tell any more of the plot would be to deprive a reader of numerous twists and turns that occur along the way to the conclusion of this wonderful novel. Perhaps its due to a limited amount of experience with Hardy, but I found several jaw-dropping revelations along the way, and more twists than a television reality series.The story is never dull, nor is it mired in too much unnecessary detail or character introduction. Each of the 'dramatis personae' are well-realized, as is the notion that the past can always change the course of the future.For newcomers to Hardy's works, indulge in this page-turner, which is fraught with enjoyment. As this is a less 'dreary' tale than Jude the Obscure, I would recommend it as an introduction to Hardy's style...and a chance to meet a masterful storyteller."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge has so many plot twists and turns that it would not be an exaggeration to label this book as a \\"plot spiral.\\" With practically every new section, Hardy invents a new way to reveal some surprising (and sometimes not so surprising) twist to the plot line. Hardy creates a complex story about love, lust, relationships, economical hardship, family, shifts in power, and more in a beautiful and picturesque way. He concentrates so much on detail that it seems as if you are watching the events first hand. His style presents information as if you were reading it in the form of a play. He nearly always sets up the scene before beginning the action, which makes it so much easier to delve deeply into the action of the characters.Hardy also creates enormously dynamic characters that are subject to so many changes throughout the novel that they become like real people. The author's grip on human emotions makes his characters believable and easily loved and then hated. The fluctuating emotions of the main character, Michael Henchard, as he falls subject to disappointment in every avenue of his life is a true example of Hardy's gift for characterization.The contrast of the out-dated and underdeveloped town of Casterbridge vs. the complexity of the relationships that develop within it is brilliant and makes the reactions of the common townspeople to these relationships even more significant to the development of the setting and also the relationships themselves. Though not portrayed obviously in the book, the town of Casterbridge itself plays a very large role in the story. As Hardy thrusts outsiders from other cultures into this archaic town, things suddenly become very complicated and even more so when the newcomers begin to meet and mix together. The Scotchman, Farfrae, and Lucetta, the Jersey girl, as well as some others, react in such a way to the old ways of this society as to disrupt the harmony of this simple community, making this novel an avenue for Hardy to demonstrate his gift for rich dialogue and language, as created in direct relation to the character&#65533;s point of origin.Hardy has created a book about rises and downfalls of a small group of people and presents a very fitting theme about the events of ones life and how they affect everyone around them in death. I must say that I enjoyed this novel for its substance and complexity, as well as the timelessness of the general plot outline."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages. But the story is more than the blurb on the back cover. It is about betrayal, last wishes, the &quot;evils&quot; of drink, and how one mistake can affect you 21 years down the road. Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.Like many of the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book. There are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it into the depths of depression. This book is not an easy read though. There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry, but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_ that made me buy this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I remember having read this book in high school. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. (I was also fond of Hardy Boys at that time, so in my opinion the name Hardy acquired a special significance.) Unfortunately, though, I never liked another book by him quite so much. I've read Tess of the d'Urbvilles, Under the Greenwood Tree, Far from the Madding Crowd(which was perhaps his second best novel, as others here have affirmed), and perhaps a few others. It is strange, or perhaps significant that I remember the exact circumstance when I was reading this book. It must have been about ten in the night. I had cleared my study desk, and unlike my common practice of lying on my stomach on my bed to enjoy a book into the night, I sat down on the straight-backed chair at the desk to read it. Very soon, I was overwhelmed by the narrative of Mr. Hardy. My father came in to see what I was up to, saw the tears streaming down my face as I turned the pages of my book, and quietly went away. I have never before owned any story books- my parents told me to read out of libraries. But now I am 22, and have started earning some money of my own, and I'm going to start a little collection of my most beloved books, to pass on to my children, perhaps? And this is among my very best."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge, focused and simple the premise has been in itself, affords a quite convoluted plot that packs with events as the memorably niched characters play out their lives and unravels the novel. The book is riddled with a well-faceted theme of conscience: the purging of conscience and its reconciliation through an allusion to deceit and characters' shameless past that ceaselessly haunt them and render them despondent and guilty. The tragic actions revolve around one man who manages to establish prestige, wealth, and authority over Casterbridge and ironically the very elite status leads to the fall of the deeply flawed man.In a fit of drunken anger and delirium, young Michael Henchard sells his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor for 5 guineas at a county fair. Over the course of the years, though he manages to establish himself as a respected and prosperous pillar of the town from literally nothing, Henchard still affords a ray of hope in reuniting with his family, until he meets Lucetta Templeman who nurses him in America. Such black spot of his youth as wife-sale caused by his fits of spleen not only renders him ashamed of himself but also wears an aspect of recent crime: something that will shame him until his dying day. Behind his success is always lurking such shameful secret of his troubled past shielded from the public and a personality prone to self-destructive pride and temper.Contributing to the suspenseful nature of the novel is the return of the mayor's wife and daughter some 18 years later whom Michael Henchard believed to have perished at the sea. The sentimental reunion, which marks Henchard respectable 20-year abstinence from alcohol, brings about a heartrending revelation and an ironical sequence of events that irritate Henchard. The very truth cruelly leaves in him an emotional void that he unconsciously craves to fill. At the same time, the regard he has acquired for Elizabeth-Jane has eclipsed by this revelation. The new-sprung hope of his loneliness (or \\"friendless solitude\\" in Hardy's own words) that she will be to him a daughter of whom he can feel as proud as of the actual daughter she believes herself to be, has been stimulated by the (yet another) unexpected arrival of the sailor to a greedy exclusiveness in relation to her.All these ineluctable consequences of his past shameful transaction at the fair take a stupendous toll on Henchard and his conscience. He is also uneasy at the thought of Elizabeth-Jane's passion for Donald Farfrae, whose rising prestige and success in his independent business provoke in Henchard enmity and envy. Henchard quails at the thought that Farfrae shall utterly usurp her mild filial sympathy with him, that she might be withdrawn from him by degrees through Farfrae's influence and learns to despise him. The pricking of conscience subtly manifests in Henchard's solicitous love and growing jealousy. His fear of losing tie after the death of his wife is sympathetically understandable. Though he in his effrontery has been weaning Elizabeth-Jane from the sailor by saying he is her father, she understands that Henchard has himself been deceived in her identity.Lucetta Templeman, inescapably torn between her past disgraceful entanglement with Henchard and her love for a more refined gentleman, is also pricked by her conscience. In an impulsive moment, purely out of gratitude, Henchard proposes to the Jersey woman who has been so far compromised to him. But as the years gone by, Lucetta is more convinced that she has been forced into an equivocal position with Henchard by an accident. She has discovered some quantities in Henchard, who is either well-educated nor refined in manner, that irretrievably renders him less desirable as a husband than she has at first thought him to be, notwithstanding there remains a conscientious wish to being about her union with him.When Lucetta learns of the wife-sale, she immediately dismisses any possibility of being with him and realizes she cannot risk himself in his hands. It will have been letting herself down to take Henchard's name after such an ignominious scandal. But her past which she diligently seals, if not expunge altogether haunts her. The surreptitious history with Henchard becomes the torture of her meek conscience and the reconciling of which through a marriage with a second man remains also her secret alone.Subtitled \\"A Story of a Man of Character\\", Henchard's origins remain unexplained but he literally begins and ends the novel away from Casterbridge, where he achieves his prominent status ironically destines his downfall, through the lampooning and skimmity-ride. A psychological study, the novel accentuates the fury that causes him to lash out against both himself and those who stand closest to him. It depicts to the fullest the very self-destructive nature of the power that causes Henchard's fall, which is so obvious through his louring invidiousness.2004 (46) MY"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Luckily I have the physical book too so was able to read the missing bit.

The hardcover is appropriately decorated with motiffs of Casterbridge. The wood engravings by Agnes Miller Parker are wonderful and unique! Of course, the story reads like a tragedy - Henchard is certainly his own worst enemy. On the other hand, Thomas Hardy's prose is certainly wonderful reading, unlike many 20th century so-called literary authors. Hardy's descriptive analyses of places and characters are exquisite, including the historical aspect of the English countryside near Casterbridge. The secondary characters are varied, some solid and some weak in spirit. Henchard seems to use them all to his detriment and the detriment of others. Elizabeth-Jane and Farfrae give the story balance and in the end are winners despite Henchard's downward spiral.This review is not in any way a descriptive review of the book's story line.

The story revolves around Michael Henchard who, under the influence of alcohol, sold his wife and child. This is enough to demonstrate that one mistake can lead to a life of utter misery. Although Henchard thrives and becomes mayor, his past comes to haunt him when his wife returns. Hardy's description of Henchard's downfall is unrealistic.

It came just in time."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"About two thirds through this undeniably great work, I began to question everything I thought I knew about this book. Kicking off in high drama and then barrelling on in that fashion with not even a stop for air, the twists and turns in Hardy's tale of morality, regret, and character seemed to occur due to the faults and failures of the principal actors, and not thanks to any plot contrivances on the part of Hardy. Which ever the case, this is a great testament to Hardy's writing abilities, but as the story progressed, the idea that Hardy was pushing the limits of \\"fate\\" and \\"tragedy\\" to its extreme seeped in. By the time I finished the book and sat puzzled over the complete change in tone for the last two paragraphs, I realized that Hardy had written one of the greatest pieces of satirical tragedy ever.Based on an actual inicident Hardy read about in a local newspaper, a husband, travelling on the road with his family, gets drunk and auctions off his wife to the highest bidder. After being offered a considerable amount of money, the wife is sold and she willingly leaves with the highest bidder, daughter in tow, as the drunken husband stays behinds and drinks.End first scene, cut to 18 years later. The man has become a teetotaler and has so righted his life, he has become the Mayor of Casterbridge. The wife enters the town, beautiful now older daughter in tow, looking for her former husband now that her husband-by-auction has died. They meet, work out a plan to remarry, and set about doing that.We then discover that the Mayor is already engaged to another woman. We discover that one of the Mayor's enemies is interested in wooing his daughter. We discover that the girl he believes is his daughter- has been told is his daughter!- is not actually his daughter. Discovery after discovery rain down upon us, each one forcing the characters to react in ways that while always consistent with their characters, creates further drama and eventually, tragedy.Hardy is an incredible author and even if this was nothing more than a tale about character and ethics, it would be an incredible read. When viewed as a satire of such tales, however- like an updated Job story without the God aspect, with the Mayor being Job- the work rises to another level. Hardy is funny, and even in the context of obviously serious works, there are occasional lighthearted moments. But once one grasps this complex work as a satire of similar works, Hardy verges on being hysterical. The Mayor of Casterbridge is a living character with obvious faults, but the heap of abuse that Hardy piles upon him in no way corresponds with his initital heinous act. Unless, of course, you're trying to be funny.Regardless of whether this is meant to be taken seriously or not, it is an underrated (as far as Hardy books go) classic.(And those last two paragraphs I alluded to above: their tone, syntax, vocabulary all sound like they come from a different book. To me, it sounded like Hardy was having one last laugh, foolishly trying to validate all the tragedy that occurred with two \\"intellectual\\" sounding paragraphs. One last bone to throw to those so absorbed in morality tales that they couldn't see that this whole journey was a farce.)"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Fast delivery and was able to enjoy with my daughter on a cross country trip. It came just as I thought."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Nineteenth century literary classic, details a man seeling his wife and daughter and the long term consequence. It's a pretty powerful and deeply ambitious story, one that makes up for a couple feeble plot stimulators with a powerful psychological representation. What's most interesting is the protagonist, the titular individual. A man so committed to drunk and evasion that he will sell off his own family. Also a man that works across the rest of the novel to redeem himself from this moment, but not without much backsliding and fresh egotistical mistakes. He's also capable enough to claw his way up into a position of wealth and authority, but then later lose that fortune, and the book is quite effective in showing the degree to which his admuirable qualities are tied in with his core defects. He's far from a monster, and for all the damage his pride and spiteful rejection cause to other lives there is much to admire about him, his strength of character, his general optimism and the way he's able to come forth with strong ethical choice at the most surprising moments. He's an intriguing, complex and overall plausible character, most notably in the way that none of his grand transcendetal moments lack, the way he continually reverts back partially to his earlier ways.More generally, the work shows an engaging cynicism about the status of class, gender and hypocrisy in contemporary England. There are some very strong critiques in here against Victorian society, to the extent that I'm surprised it attained the popularity it did in its own time, and these are always coonected to an engaging novel. It makes me a lot more interested in reading the other nineteenth century literary classics I've so far neglected. And more Hardy, of course.Worse than: Crime and Punishment by Fyodor DostoevskyBetter than: A Tale of Two Cities by Charles DickensAlso better than: Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The story of a man who ruins his life by doing the right thing at the wrong time, both in business and in his relationships with his wife, a potential wife, and his stepdaughter.

Hardy came after Dickens and before James, and his style intrigues as you connect parts of it to the former, parts to the latter.His plotting is sort of Dickens \\"lite.\\" There are mysterious benefactors, sudden tragic deaths, reversals of fortune, paternity mysteries, ect. His prose is cleaner and easier to read than both Dickens and James; \\"Casterbridge\\" scans better than \\"Bleak House\\" or \\"The Wings of the Dove.\\"The story begins when a pastoral laborer, in a drunken rage, sells his wife and child one evening (I hate it when that happens...). When he wakes the next morning, abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life. The novel truly begins eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, we witness the fall of the now Mayor of Casterbridge, brought about by his own character flaws and the interventions of fate.Henchard, the main character, is a facinating combination of hot-spirited volition and turn-on-a-dime repentance. He is quick to do things which damn him but just as quick to admit his guilt. He is a wonderful character and a precursor to the later \\"psychological\\" novels of James and Forster. The satellite characters remind one of Dickens, but they are not nearly as startling and interesting, but of course, a character such as Henchard never existed in all of Dickens.The novel proceeds to its forgone conclusion inexorably, albiet with a few melodromatic touches, yet it sustains its tone and readibility due mostly to Henchard, and the dramatic situations Hardy puts him through.Well worth a look."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Since I have decided to dedicate part of my time spent reading in 2003 to the classics, I started first with The Mayor of Casterbridge, not the most famous of Hardy's works but seemingly a good place to start. I will definitely read the other works by this author since I was so captivated by this book.The novel begins with the sale of Michael Henchard's wife and child to the highest bidder at a local summer fair. Henchard is drunk and his wife, tired of his habits, decides to leave with the sailor who bids on her and her daughter. Henchard wakes up the next morning, somewhat remorseful for what he has done and vows not to drink for twenty-one years.The very next chapter picks up the story nineteen years later, with the return of the wife and child into Henchard's life. Henchard is now quite wealthy and is such an important man in his community, he is now Mayor of Casterbridge. From here, a series of wrong decisions and misunderstandings lead to the devastating conclusion.Hardy is well known for his tendency towards gloomy endings and this book certainly fits the mold. But he is also well known for his lyrical descriptions of the English countryside and describing a way of life which had disappeared even in his own time. There were beautiful passages about the hay carts being driven through town, loaded so high that people on the second floor of homes could reach out and touch the top of the hay. Small details abound, describing the sound of rain on trees and the smell of the local foods. But perhaps the most significant aspect of the novel for me was the feeling that Henchard had wished for everything that had happened to him, and all of his wishes came true, and thus ultimately his downfall. These wishes were almost all made in a rash moment, when perhaps a minute or more of reflection could have produced a clearer head. Yet Henchard lives by his instincts, since for almost twenty years they seemed to serve him well.I would recommend this book to any serious literature lover and I believe it serves as a good introduction to his other works. His books serve as a bridge from Victorian literature to modern literature, with no happy endings guaranteed."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"At first I was forced to read &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; in school more than 12 years ago. Reading it slowly made an impact on my life. This book always served a special purpose in my life. It introduced me to the wide world of Literature. It sort of enlighten my interest and liking for English literature. Now re-reading it not only brought back fond memories of my yester school days but also renewed my liking to one of the greatest writer of all time Thomas Hardy.Through this novel I came to the understanding of Irony and oxymoron. Hardy totally wrote with a sense of awareness of human characteristic and he had a amazing style of mixed humour with tragedy.His protagonist,Michael Henchard's life was under the microscope of Hardy.I love the way the story began I quote:&quot;ONE evening of late summer, before the nineteenth century had reached one-third of its span, a young man and woman, the latter carrying a child, were approaching the large village of Weydon-Priors, in Upper Wessex, on foot. &quot; I love the Englishness and the sense of intriguing events that would follow...In brief, Michael Henchard was a drunk who sold his wife and daughter at the fair. Later he realised his mistakes he work real hard and eventually became the mayor of Casterbridge. His life took another twist 20 years later when his wife and daughter came back to his life plus a few more other characters adding on the complexity of his life.Soonafter events unfolded and many things became to go against his way and then came his downfall. Indeed Michael Henchard's rise and fall were filled with compelling details and his encounters with numerous intestering people.What I love most about this novel was the way Hardy depicted Henchard's behaviours and thoughts and totally enhanced his weak character and irresponsibleness with dashes of ironies. His sardonic literary style were brilliant and at the same time he also vividly described the scenery and situations. Another greatest of Hardy was his ability to create innovative characters still account for in modern contemporary days and he was a pioneer in analysising human's weakness and blended it into his creation. It's a vintage classic,psychoanalytic and intriguingly written ,a must read for all books lover."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I'm re-reading this book that thrilled me years ago and thrills me today. Now, however, I realize just how &quot;modern&quot; it is, even more so than the works of Dickens, whom I also revere, but whose writing had a quaint quality that actually makes him the lesser artist, in my opinion. Hardy's writing is spare but nothing is left out. You feel it, you taste it, you live it. It has the firm, sure quality of a minimalist work of art, and yet the twists and turns of its plot are dizzying. I detect its influence on novelist Toni Morrison, I might add. I'd be willing to bet she's a Hardy scholar. I read many passages, many scenes, that reminded me of her &quot;folksy&quot; conceits. And I was amazed at Hardy's contemporary understanding of addiction, in this case alcoholism. In fact, Henchard is a &quot;dry drunk.&quot; He abstains from liquor for 21 years, but his character defects and lack of spiritual awareness catapault him right back into his disease when he begins drinking again. In fact, his life spirals out of control faster and faster with his first return to drink, showing that alcoholism, like all addictions, is a progressive disease. A reviewer here said the book was depressing, and that Hardy is dark. However, the &quot;light&quot; in Hardy comes with his wisdom, not unlike Faulkner's, of human nature. There are so many themes of the enduring truths that one is uplifted just by the reading. Sometimes I mourn for the writers I will never meet, the ones who have passed on. Their teaching is so important to my own spiritual and artistic growth, that I have experienced a great love from them and for them. Hardy is one of those for me. Wherever he dwells now, I send him my appreciation."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions: that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the events arise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering: the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"When Thomas Hardy penned The Mayor of Casterbridge, he brought to life a very authentic character in Michael Henchard. He is possibly the perfect tragic character. The only other character I can think of to compare him to as I struggle to describe him and the story - for he is so much the story - is King Lear. But where Lear was a King who was foolish, Michael is the common man, a simple hay trusser, with several character flaws ... most notably shortsightedness and a desire to \\"be on top\\". He at no point feels something that most people don't but where we restrain our first rash and selfish actions (most of the time), he goes full out until he has cost himself everything and too late finds redemption. His flaw is insidious and all too common, so we relate easily even through his most outrageous misadventures.In a fit of drunken despondency, feeling that he is being pulled down by the responsibility of being a twenty-one year old husband and father, he jests that he would gladly part with his wife and daughter for the sum of five pounds. After having sworn this so vehemently for the entire evening, he has little recourse when someone takes him up on it and his wife, in shame and anger, agrees to go with the purchaser, taking their daughter with her. When sobriety brings full realization, it also brings a vow of temperance from Michael who in the following fifteen years builds himself up to a position respectability and public admiration in the nearby town of Casterbridge.Though he seems to have learned his lesson, we are only on chapter two and his story is just beginning as his wife and child return and his friendship with a trusted friend and critical advisor becomes a bitter rivalry. Time and again he demands allegiance when he need only ask it and return it in kind.Hardy's writing style is direct and straight-forward with no flourishes like you might find with Dickens or Twain. He has a story to tell and he tells it - no swashbuckling adventures like DeFoe or Dumas. However you feel about that, the character of Michael Henchard continues to skulk around in my head. He represents to me a very real possibility of personal failure and haunts my mind now just as Scrooge's deceased partner haunted him in A Christmas Carol. I would have given this book a fun factor of three stars when I first read it. Now I give it five stars because I have had the time to realize what a masterful job Hardy did when he created Michael Henchard."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Having thoroughly detested Tess of the d'Urbervilles for its overload of melodrama and odious characters, I was hesitant to It often seems that to be considered a classic, a work must be both lengthy and tragic. Mayor is indeed a tragedy, but unlike start on another novel by Hardy. It was then a happy surprise to find that The Mayor of Casterbridge, though less famous than Tess, is an infinitely more enjoyable work.Tess, it succeeds in drawing sympathy from the reader. Thomas Hardy's irony is also much in evidence, and he comes across as quite witty. The result is a concise and interesting mixture of humor and tragedy in which characters are reasonably likable. Henchard is impetuous and comes to his end almost entirely through his own actions, but his actions are always motivated by realistic emotions and there is nothing overblown or melodramatic about his downfall. Because he is so human and flawed, it is far easier to feel sorry for him than it was for Tess, Hardy's embodiment of the perfect woman.There are, of course, elements in Hardy's style that do not change from novel to novel. His writing remains very Victorian and therefore rather ornate and longwinded. Nor is the melodrama absent from Mayor-- events often take on such an absurd turn that the reader is left momentarily with the impression of a soap opera. The plot relies heavily on coincidences, reminiscent somewhat of Dickens, and things work out so neatly and implausibly that incredulity must be firmly restrained.It is worth it, though. Beneath the superficial plot lie careful writing and hidden parallels. The elaborate Biblical Saul and David parallel with Henchard and Farfrae throughout emphasizes the unchangeability of human nature (the love/hate relationship between Henchard and Farfrae) and the cyclical rise and fall from power. Hardy also uses limited third person narration that allows the reader to know the characters and events only through their actions and conversations, further evidence of a meticulously constructed novel. In a refreshing change, Mayor moves along quickly with virtually no extraneous events.The Mayor of Casterbridge is an unusual book, and one that can be understood on multiple levels. On one, it is the simple story of the fall of a proud man; on another, it is a retold Biblical story, updated but not deprived of its original power. And though I never thought to say this about Hardy's novels, The Mayor of Casterbridge also does pretty well as entertainment...Ailanna"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The first book I read out of Thomas Hardy's many works was \\"Far from the Madding Crowd\\" back in my secondary school days.

The Mayor of Casterbridge is absolutely brilliant as the author uses his perceptive insights into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalities. For example, Henchard is an alcoholic who suffers from many of the accompanying afflictions that include low self-esteem, shame, guilt, self-castigation, self-punishment, loneliness, a death wish, and a tendency to depression.The book starts in the first chapter with a dramatic masterpiece that perfectly sets the tone and theme for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work. They go to a country fair where Henchard, an alcoholic, gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Once Henchard sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family. Abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life. The story unravels nineteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, Henchard who was now the Mayor of Casterbridge falls from grace, this being a result of his own character flaws and the hand of fate.I enjoy reading Hardy's impressive prose, which is strong, sharp and descriptive. The various scenes the author describes are filled with vivid and compelling imagery that leave one wanting to read more and more. Thomas Hardy is especially adept at describing the environment which he has a deep seated love for. The ironic twists of fate provide a setting that demonstrates the brilliant writer that Hardy is where he expertly weaves a plot that shows the themes of the balance between fate and individual choice. That makes The Mayor of Casterbridge very pleasant to read despite the sad story.For those who wish to study English Literature, The Mayor of Casterbridge is on the top of the recommended list. The book provides exceptional descriptions of England and its culture as well as exposing the student to themes of profound gravity and importance. The book provides clear and concise explanations, dialogue and emotional energy. It is well-written, is easy-to-understand and to follow."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Having never read Hardy before, I picked this book at random off a list provided by my Western Civilization teacher. I can't help but attribute my choice to destiny; this is quite possibly the best book I've ever read, written by the single greatest English author in history. While some other reviewers have classified his descriptive passages as somewhat dull, I thought they were rather intoxicating; I don't know how one could not enjoy the superbly vivid style Hardy employs. It's impossible to really describe his writing to one who hasn't read it.The plot in Mayor of Casterbridge is compelling throughout. I read somewhere that the book was originally published a few chapters at a time in a literary magazine, and this is quite evident, as every many sections seem individually complete with rising action, climax, resolution, etc. Hardy still manages to integrate these individual sections without flaw and create a wonderful composition of the life of Henchard. As everyone else has testified, the conclusion of the book is moving beyond description- without a doubt the most affective book I've ever read. Be forewarned: this is a book that will surely leave the reader in a depressed and brooding state. Going by Kafka's standard, that a book should be &quot;like a suicide... an axe for the frozen sea within us&quot;, The Mayor of Casterbridge is surely one of just a handful of the great books in English literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I can understand the polarity of opinion about this book. And you certainly don't want to be reading Thomas Hardy while listening to Leonard Cohen. Don't dismiss the negative comments out of hand - Hardy is probably not for all tastes.In my case though, as a student disinterested in reading, this novel turned me into a reader. It has a \\"heavy\\" style, but I think it was this depth that appealed to me most - that, and the obvious devotion Hardy felt toward his beloved Wessex (strange how this passion of the author for his countryside seems to me more forcefully written than most other stories where passion is thematic). Of course I have since read all the Wessex novels but this remains my favorite, and probably my favorite novel of all.Still, not an easy recommendation."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Mayor of Casterbridge is a tale about a man named Michael Henchard and the mistakes he makes in life. It is really well written, Hardy has a skill for great storytelling. There are so many surprises and details, which you at first think at irrelevant turn out to be the turning factors of the entire book. Hardy is not one who puts in a lot of useless text, everything has to be thoroughly read or you will not enjoy it. Anyways boys and girls, hope you enjoy this, I sure did"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The book itself is excellent. Thomas Hardy was a master writer, and look no further than the fact that he makes a story about a person that buys and sells corn interesting. But, the kindle edition is, like the title of the review says, missing a chunk of the text. There might be other parts omitted, but that's the only one I've caught.Perhaps this is evidence that you get what you pay for."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Rather than repeat tired platitudes about this established literary classic, I'll simply describe my reaction to 'The Mayor of Casterbridge'. It made me nervous and stressed, dreading the next awful event that would follow the painful scene I had just finished, and sure enough, another calamity would promptly occur. Foreseeing its approach, I would want to put the whole novel aside, but morbid fascination led me to continue reading. That's the way it is with thrillers. At least most of the disasters befell the main character, a loathsome individual who, unfortunately, reminded me very much of someone in my own life. I thought I had read this book in high school fifty years ago, but if I really did, it affected me less then than it did now. Finishing the last page with a sense of relief, I gratefully turned to Anthony Trollope for my next read."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"\\"For my part I don't see why men who have got wives, and don't want 'em, shouldn't get rid of 'em as these gipsy fellows do their old horses.\\" ---The Mayor of CasterbridgeAnd with those words (and the act they inspire), Michael Henchard brings a lifetime of misery down on himself. The Mayor of Casterbridge is widely considered to be Thomas Hardy's greatest novel. It is a classic tale of the spiral and eventual demise of an essentially bad man. The story is rich with personal intrigue... sins, lies, cover-ups, love triangles, secret identities and so on... making it a continual pleasure to read. The regional dialect (spelled phonetically throughout) can be a bit cumbersome to wade through at times, though it certainly lends atmosphere to the novel.The characters are interesting and easy to relate to and Hardy did an admirable job of making most of them distinctly human: Michael Henchard is \\"bad\\" (as evidenced by the sale of his wife and child in the opening scene) but is also carefully drawn as essentially flawed and insecure, rather than a flat parody of evil. Donald Farfrae, who is as good as Henchard is bad, is also flawed in his own ways which adds depth to his character too. Hardy was obviously better at creating men than women because the women are a little more \\"Victorian stereotypical\\": the good ones are pictures of chaste virtue who can actually take ill and die over a nasty shock (puh-lease) and the bad ones are fat hags in bawdy houses. The women are certainly less interesting than the men in this book.The plot is nearly impossible to adequately discuss without writing a book of my own. After the initial unforgivable act, the book fast-forwards 19 years and we soon learn that the previously down-on-his-luck Henchard has made a success of himself in the rural town of Casterbridge, where he is a wealthy merchant and mayor of the town. At the same time that he takes on a quick and capable apprentice (Farfae), his wife and daughter reappear in his life. Farfrae proves to be better at Henchard's business than Henchard is, Henchard has to abandon another woman in favor of doing right by his wife and the daughter's paternity is quickly called into question. Intrigue, twists, turns and surprises ensue. And all the while, Henchard's selfishness, quick temper and poor-decision making contrive to bring about his eventual fall. It all makes for a very satisfying read... not as satisfying as say, reading about the Count of Monte Cristo dealing out his brand of justice... but it is interesting to see how things unravel for Henchard nonetheless.The Bottom Line: a very entertaining and complex story from the Victorian era. Worth a read whether you're plowing through the 1001 Books list or not.This review originally appeared on my blog. See my profile for details."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"\\"The Mayor Of Casterbridge\\" captures a lot of what makes Thomas Hardy resonate with people today: hard existential truths playing out amid pastoral splendor; naturalistic descriptions of fantastic events; an agnostic worldview that centers around a sense of Christian guilt and loss. The countercurrents create a lot of creative tension.But what makes \\"The Mayor Of Casterbridge\\" so powerful more than a century after its 1886 publication is its multifaceted, emotionally conflicted depiction of the central character. Like King Lear and Ibsen's Solness the Master Builder, Hardy's Michael Henchard has no one but himself to blame for most of the misery that befalls him. Still he compels sympathy and a growing sense of investment from the reader.We meet him, in one of the all-time great openings of noveldom, selling off his timid wife and child in a fit of rum-tinged pique. He regrets this almost immediately, but fails to relocate them. Instead, he swears off liquor and remakes himself years later as a prosperous leader in a town he chances upon in his travels, Casterbridge.Alas the dark spikes of his id are never far from the surface, especially after his wife and her daughter come to Casterbridge. \\"Though under a long reign of self-control he had become Mayor and churchwarden and whatnot, there was still the same unruly volcanic stuff beneath the rind of Michael Henchard as when he had sold his wife at Weydon Fair,\\" Hardy writes.Henchard is a portrait in grayscale, nothing too black or white. In one scene, Hardy shows him mercilessly humiliating a lazy farmhand, then tells us Henchard keeps the farmhand's mother stocked with coal in winter. When the wife returns, Henchard has a romance brewing but puts it aside to do right by the woman he wronged. He's definitely not happy about it, and prone to self-pity and lashing out, but Hardy's intuitive narration keeps you identifying with Henchard, never leading you too far from his point of view.For a character study the story moves fast, even if the prose style is ornate. Hardy's descriptive abilities are on constant display, with scenic rides through the country. There's much local Wessex color (Hardy's own quasi-mythical kingdom, where most of his novels are set) and a chorus of memorable townspeople, like a fellow whose theft of coins from the eyes of a corpse is excused thus: \\"Money is scarce, and throats get dry. Why should death rob life o' four pence?\\"Death is omnipresent in \\"Mayor Of Casterbridge\\", but Hardy justifies the novel's gloomy tone with a memorably powerful, courageously bleak conclusion. \\"Casterbridge's\\" greatness lies at its two ends. In between, the story keeps your interest but keeps hitting the same notes, with some sketchy melodrama and improbable coincidences amid brighter moments. Hardy even gets maudlin with a dead goldfinch metaphor.Most problematic of all is the absence of interest in the main characters beyond Henchard. Except for a jilted lover who forces her way back into Henchard's life with minxish self-possession, they are an entirely boring crew, existing only to be contrasted with Henchard's more forceful personality.\\"Casterbridge\\" may leave you wishing you chose something else to read in a lighter vein, say \\"The Painted Bird\\" or \\"The Bell Jar\\". But it's worth reading for that same emotional toll, a reminder of life's harder truths that may leave you sad but perhaps a bit more conscious of the truth behind the line: \\"There but for the Grace of God go I.\\""},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"In some ways this is a hard book to get into since it is set in a totally different culture from ours -rural England of the mid-nineteenth century. You would think that that is close enough in time to not be a problem. But to me the things like their courtship customs, or what is considered scandalous/honorable behavior, are really at a variance with the way we act today that I found it hard to relate to. Add to this some of the implausible melodrama and coincidences that make up the plot and I almost ended up putting down the book.However I kept reading and in the end I thought it was an excellent story. This is because it illustrated a truth about life that I could empathize with. How a man through pride, anger, stubbornness and alcoholism could end up destroying his relationships with all of the people he is close to and in middle age end up being alienated from everyone who was important to him in his life. Since this story was written there have been millions of guys like Michael Henchard. The details of their lives are different, their endings may have been different. But there is an underlying truth that is the same. That aspect of the story is timeless."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"this is the first book ive read out of thomas hardy's many works, and i thought it was absolutely brilliant. he uses his perceptive insight into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalites.each scene he describes is filled with vivid imagery that leave your senses tingling.i highly recommend this book to anyone that loves a well-written, easy-to-understand classic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I have not read any of Hardy's books before - and chanced upon this one, and found no regrets. Once I developed a comfort zone in his type of writing, I found myself totally engrossed. His literature style is one of grace and flowed easily between each new turn of the plot. Not only was it beautifully done as a character building story, but it was full of surprises, twists and turns you didn't expect. I recommend this book, and intend to continue reading the rest of his writings."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy is a fictional novel teaching many life learned lessons. When a man sells his wife and daughter to a sailor for five guineas, he becomes devastated. Finding a whole new life, he becomes the wealthy mayor of Casterbridge. Not ever thinking he would see his wife and daughter again, the inevitable happens. As the story goes from bad to good and good to worse, various characters explore the realms of fate.The work of Hardy allows his readers to have a better understanding of the world. Many people today are nave of the terrible things happening all around them. The exaggerated situations, such as a woman dieing because of embarrassment, allow readers to have a new perspective of life. A realization is created that everyone has two sides to them; good and bad. Whether it is a lie or the truth, people affect the lives of others.What if one secret could ruin the lives of many others? What if one secret could ruin the life of one? As lies and secrets lead to the downfall of many characters, life is taken advantage of and hearts are broken. When evil seems to take control, it is learned that no one can control the power of destiny. In The Mayor of Casterbridge the truth of life is displayed. The light of the world can not always hide the dark shadows that dwell in everyday life."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I greatly enjoyed The Mayor of Casterbridge, not only for its clear and concise explanations, dialogue and emotional energy, but also for its themes. The loss of a wife, mother, daughter, love, husband, father and mentor are all carried off extremely well. I chose to read this book for a project I'm doing in my English class and although it was not my first choice, I do recommend it to anyone who loves English literature. I'm a big fan of Dickens and Hardy and truly loved this magnificent piece of work."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Thomas Hardy was never one to refrain from controversey in his writing, as is evidenced by his decision after the negative reviews that \\"Jude the Obscure\\" received to never write novels again but to devote himself entirely to poetry. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" opens with perhaps one of the most unique plot devices in Edwardian/Victorian literature, when Michael Henchard, a young haytrusser becomes drunk at a country fair and sells his wife and daughter to whoever will pay five guineas for them. What follows afterwards, for Michael Henchard, is a life tinged by regret, even as he finds himself prospering in all other manners. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a compelling story of how falsehoods and regrets can overshadow one's life if they are allowed to do so.After selling his wife and daughter, Michael Henchard vows that he will not touch alcohol for twenty-one years and manages to build himself up to the position of a prosperous businessman and mayor in the town of Casterbridge. As he nears the twenty-first year of his oath, his wife Susan returns, finding him in his exalted position, and Henchard knows the only right thing to do is \\"remarry\\" her since they have been legally married all these years, and therefore make it possible for him to claim Elizabeth-Jane as his true daughter, not just step-daughter. Yet life has many secrets for Michael Henchard - some he keeps, like the fact he is engaged to another woman, and one shocking one that his wife keeps from him that will desperately impact his dealings with Elizabeth-Jane. While Henchard has prospered up to this point, a falling-out with his foreman, the Scotsman Donald Farfrae, leads to his eventual downfall in both his private and his public life. As evidenced by the selling of his wife, Henchard allows his quick temper to get the better of him, and he sets his mind on revenge to all those who have wronged him, whether acutal or not. Therefore, he constantly finds himself at odds with Elizabeth-Jane, with Donald Farfrae (whom he would like nothing better than to kill), and with another woman from his past who has upset his life.Michael Henchard is truly a tragic character, for while it may be easy to dislike him for his roughness and his callow actions, he is not entirely an evil man. His fault is that he regrets his actions, just usually too late. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a surprisingly fast-paced read, with a vivid setting and an extremely intriguing character in Elizabeth-Jane. The web that Michael Henchard manages to spin for himself is compelling and familiar, as these characters and their motives transcend beyond the time period captured so effortlessly by Hardy."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"...but without the histrionics.One of the greatest novels ever written. Also one of the most suspenseful and (for those whose palates have not been ruined by trash) one of the most enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Reread this one recently - what a great book. This is my favorite of all Hardy's books. The fascinating part of this novel is the protagonist, because he is such a mix of good and bad. He has good and even heroic impulses and acts, and bad and even evil impulses and acts. The way he manages to sabotage the good things he could get reminds me of Lily in the House of Mirth, although Henchard's sabotage is due to through bad temper and anger and insecurity, while Lily's are due to ambivalence. But the trip downward is quite similar. Basically it ends up being the story of a man's self-destruction. What a crime that Hardy's novels were unpopular when he first wrote them, and the bad reviews discouraged him from writing more! I have them all but wish there were more."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is undoubtedly one of the finest novels of the Victorian Era - quite a tribute given that the period produced a countless number of classics. The conflict between Michael Henchard and Donald Farfrae reflects a clash between tradition and modernity. This dichotomy is perhaps best encapsulated in their contrasting styles of record keeping; Henchard relies entirely on intuition and memory while Farfrae maintains extraordinarily meticulous accounts of all his transactions. Furthermore the struggle between Farfrae and Henchard reflects a conflict of vastly different temperaments. Henchard proves to be of a passionate temperament while Farfrae is rational and levelheaded. For instance, despite his modest means and limited experience, Farfrae boldly ventures into agricultural trading and through a series of shrewd bets manages to unseat Henchard as Casterbridge's preeminent merchant. In order to regain his erstwhile position, Henchard engages in rash and seemingly desperate speculation - in contrast to the prudent risk taking of Farfrae - that ultimately culminates in his ruin.While some AP students have chastised Henchard for his inability to overcome his animalistic nature, the more astute reader realizes that his inveterate character serves to illustrate a basic theme of most Hardy novels - the philosophy of determinism. The rise and fall of Henchard illustrates the unpleasant reality that one's life is subject to forces beyond one's control - in Henchard's case a deeply flawed character - and these forces often overwhelm the power of one's determination and ambition. This doctrine is certainly anathema to 21st century Americans who firmly believe in the concept of free will and a future holding great promise. While constantly lamenting one's ill fate is self-defeating, it would be naive to entirely disregard the power of destiny to shape one's life for worse as powerfully shown in the tragic tale of the Mayor of Casterbridge."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The mayor of casterbridge is a descriptive, sad, but fun to read novel that keeps the reader glued to the seat. In this novel, Tomas Hardy's skill for describing the enviroment is clear, and his characters are vibrant and true to life. I recommend this novel to anyone who is in search of a great read."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This is truly a classic tragedy, and perhaps Hardy's very best. The opening is one of the most memorable I've ever read; Michael Henchard gets drunk and auctions off his family. The tale spins off from there, boldly and without restraint. Though Hardy is a pessimist, he knows how to craft a story of unforgettable characters inspired by all sorts of passions- some taking whatever they can find for themselves, and some giving generously and unconditionally. Wait until you meet and get to know Elizabeth; she is a beautiful human being! I always learn so much from Hardy. I'm grateful that he wrote the novels he did before turning exclusively to poetry. This one in particular is so well done that I don't know how anyone can fail to be impacted and changed by it."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"A question about the source of human tragedy lies at the heart of The Mayor of Casterbridge. Characters frequently mention fate and providence as causes for tragedy (and joy), but Hardy offers more subtle and complex explanations for individual tragedy. At times, Hardy seems to indicate that circumstance and timing play a more important role than Providence in shaping the course of human destiny. Can people survive without the aid of luck or providence by pure force of will? Henchard (the Mayor) is a man whose loneliness, egoism, and pride cause him to make bad decisions. His faulty judgement certainly do not help him in his quest for fulfillment, either. Hardy's depiction of an ultimately unknowable universe is achieved partly through his characters' false assignment of meaning to meaningless incidents. Fate, human will, and faulty perceptions are central issues in much of Hardy's writing. Though not as moving and intense as Hardy's masterpiece Tess of the d'Urbervilles, The Mayor is not to be missed. Hardy's complex rendering of Henchard's multi-faceted personality is remarkable. In addition, The Norton Critical Addition provides excellent commentary and background information from noteworthy critics."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"In the novels of Thomas Hardy, tragedy can be an externalized force like Egdon Heath in THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE or it can be of the internalized sort, the kind that Michael Henchard brings on himself in THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE. In either case, nature is unforgiving, a quality which is a given in any of Hardy's works. When tragedy is of the latter kind, then the protagonist is not unlike the doomed tragic hero from classical Greek drama wherein he is first seen as a great or simply a good man who suffers from a tragic flaw, the results of which drag him down so that by the end of the action, his state is so miserably pathetic that the reader/audience can do no more than shake their heads in sorrow at his downfall, that in another and less proud man need not have happened at all.Michael Henchard is the post-Victorian man of mixed qualities who like Oedipus, commits a sin and then spends the rest of the book trying to make amends. His sin is maudlin self-pity. He allows his current debased financial position to lead him to drink, all the while blaming his wife and child. At an auction, he offers his family for the sale to the highest bidder. He ignores the warnings from those present that he is courting disaster. An unknown man offers the highest bid and off he goes, taking Henchard's wife and child with him. Hardy takes pains to place Henchard squarely in the middle of this somber farce. Hardy gives no name to the successful bidder nor does he allow the reader to note the wife's actions. She, surprisingly, remains silent, but weeping. Henchard, by contrast, is loud, crude, and obnoxious. He occupies central stage until the next chapter when he sobers up, is filled with remorse, and then tries to set things right. He fails and winds up the leading citizen of Casterbridge. The image of the drunken Henchard and the mayor Henchard are startlingly unlike. The latter is sober, industrious, and respectable, causing the reader to commiserate with him. But the tragedy of Henchard does not lie merely in a series of vain regrets. Just as he seems to undergo permanent rehabilitation of self, his ex-wife shows up again, with a new child from the now dead bidder. Hardy complicates the plot with his usual unwieldy complications. As a result, Henchard plunges again into the depths of despair; this time he shows that his old sins of false pride and egotism have returned with a vengeance. He tries to bankrupt his business partner Farfrae, for reasons purely of jealousy. It becomes progressively more difficult for the reader to maintain the same sympathy that they had earlier. Later, at the novel's close, Henchard is made to wander like a wounded Lear, and this alone partially elevates him back to his previous stature of a tragic figure. He, like Lear, dies repentant. From his death, the audience discovers that the essence of a tragic fall lies not so much in how much sympathy that protagonist garners during that fall but rather in how true to life his fall was. Michael Henchard was neither saint nor reprobate sinner. He was the Victorian Everyman with a mixture of goodness and mean-spiritedness, either of which could emerge under the right circumstances. At his fall, the reader saw that the \\"right\\" circumstances were sufficiently ordinary so that anyone of us might have done the same. This is the essence of the tragedy of THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Read this novel after Far From The Madding Crowd and Return of the Native. It's a very bleak and depressing novel - without the comic flourishes and moments of his earlier work.The story follows Michael Henchard, a hay-trusser, who sells his wife and child for five guineas in an 'auction' during a fit of inebriety. He spends the next 21 years regretting his action, but during that time he does well for himself, becoming mayor of Casterbridge, a rural town. Years later, his wife and daughter reappear. This starts a chain of events that leads to Henchard's fall. He eventually ends up losing everything because of his pride, passion and stubborness. The main character isn't very likeable, but there is something of the tragic about him that commands your attention."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Mayor Henchard was drunk when he sold his wife and child. This instance of reckless cruelty would come to haunt him in his later years. Overall a pious and good man, his downfall was his reluctance to face his past. His will dictated his epitaph. He will never be heard from again. (The will is on the last few pages of the book.) Fading into nothing, it challenges the reader to find a term for death. Is death the physical end of life, or the emotional end of life.

Although I do not feel it is one of Hardy's finest, it was, never the less, entertaining. It did not seem to achieve the level of pathos, or engender the concern for the main characters that \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" did. There were numbers of similarities between this book and Dickens' \\"Little Dorrit\\", except Hardy appeared to see how many mistaken innuendos, statements never made that could have cleared up false impressions, and misguided moralistic pressures could be fit into one story.

Once you get used to the period of time and the style of writing ~ in old english, of sorts ~ one needs to continue this type. You get so much more out of a book that way.While this book may have been written in the 1800's I must say that the events taking place, the people and their responses doesn't seem to have changed one iota to the way society behaves today. This is a charming story of rags to riches to rags again. A story of humility, starting over, of pride, of desolation and back to humility again. It does have a bit of subtle romance, which keeps the story flowing.Both of the Thomas Hardy's books (Tess of the de'Ubervilles) and this one are wonderful stories and well worth reading.Interestingly it wasn't after I finished reading them that I discovered that these books were considered Young Adult reading. I guess someone rated it this way because it's a pure, non-smuttly book so ubiquitious of today's media.I don't care about the rating I just appreciated Thomas Hardy's contribution of literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I read this book for my English exam and after reading it, I cannot understand how it can be described as a classic novel. The only possible reason that I can come up with is that people in 19th century England, did not have things like T.V. and so were absolutely desperate for anything to entertain themselves. This is possibly the most boring book that I have ever read. Nothing happens! I feel that a lot of people call this book a classic simply because some literary expert happened to like it once, and so these people, in a vain attempt to appear more intelligent than they are, simply churn out someone else's opinion, without actually thinking of their own response to the novel. I don't know how many copies of this book have been printed, but it is bound to be a large number, and all I can say is that it is a huge waste of paper which could have been put to better use elsewhere. I wish that I had not wasted some of my life reading this book."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I have recently read this book (not out of choice) and I am at a loss to understand why Hardy wrote this and why anyone would willingly read this for &quot;fun&quot;.

People are always going on about how we should stop cutting down the rainforest etc. and if this is what all those trees are turned into, then I'm with them 100%."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I had never been so against reading a book in my life. Everything about it seemed boring; the cover, the title, and even the way the pages smelled. It was only the fact that Henchard sells his wife and baby in an auction; that kept my interest alive.Even with a premise as weird as this one, the book's beginning was painful. It wasn't until later on that I discovered the book wouldn't be as painful as I feared. The Mayor of Casterbridge is based entirely on irony and coincidences. Never have I rolled my eyes so many times in disbelief.Hardy created a soap opera-like world in the town of Casterbridge. This actually gave a humorous appeal to the book. After every major section of the book you can't help but mumble, \\"Sure...\\"Some people deem this book, \\"Depressing,\\" however The Mayor of Casterbridge didn't once give me a similar feeling. This book is presented in such a way that it helps you laugh at other people's misfortune.I wouldn't recommend this book as a \\"free-read;\\" But if you must choose between a bunch of boring books, and this one happens to be on the list, then I highly recommend you choose it. It may seem boring at first, but give it a chance; Hardy's humorous look at tragedy will give you a good laugh. I mean how bad can a book be, that starts out with its central character actually selling his wife and baby girl at a fair?"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Hardy was a naturalist in whose novels everything goes wrong. Michael Henchard is a drunk who \\"sells\\" his wife Susan and infant daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor. Susan doesn't realize the sale is bogus because she is \\"simple,\\" throws her ring away, and leaves with the sailor. When he sobers up next day, Henchard searches all over for his lost family, and finally enters a church and swears an oath over an enormous bible that he will not drink from his current age of 21 to double that age. Meanwhile, and 18 years later, when the sailor dies, Susan, with Elizabeth, comes looking for Henchard at Casterbridge. He is now a corn merchant and mayor of the town. As a teetotaler, he is described as drinking glass after glass of water at table for a town hearing. Eventually Susan, via Elizabeth-Jane, contacts Henchard and he pens a note suggesting that they meet at the \\"Ring.\\" This last turns out to be a ruined Roman amphitheater or coliseum, a 1500-year-old relic full of ghosts and whose very name symbolizes the dark past. Henchard and Susan agree to remarry, playacting a courtship for public appearances, and to keep the daughter in ignorance that the sailor was not her biological father. After they marry, Henchard and the manager of his business, Farfrae, have a falling out because the latter shows the former up and makes a fool of him, making himself more popular than the mayor. To make matters worse, Elizabeth-Jane falls in love with Farfrae.Frankly, that's as far as I've gotten. I know how it ends for Henchard, but I won't spoil the ending. Hardy is a mean naturalist writer, and has no sympathy for his characters whatsoever. _Casterbridge_ was first published in 1886, when alcoholism was little understood - least of all by people like Hardy who didn't have the disease. It's all too easy for this author to condemn and be judgmental of alcoholic people. I would suggest for an alternative reading Eugene O'Neill's _The Iceman Cometh_, since O'Neill was himself an alcoholic and could rightfully speak for alcoholics. The subject, no matter in whose hands, is by nature depressing. All my editorializing aside, Thomas Hardy is a great novelist who has earned his place in the canon. His poetry is good, too. _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ is worth pursuing to the end if you're not an alcoholic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This book was originally written to be printed in newspapers, newspapers were then used to wipe one's posterior. I feel i have already said enough."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Good story for a movie. In fact there was a movie set in the west during gold rush based on this story. Good, but I forget the movie title. Both are very believable, which I like."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Modern novels can be so pretentious, with their needless philosophizing and conscious experimentation with the language. So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no, it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence, melodrama, and, as the afterword in my edition puts it, &quot;the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.&quot; I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption, it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started, but the crazy, unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters, ever. You learn nothing in the end, except life is cruel and if something can go wrong, it will. Read something else."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"&quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" ought to be the model of what a classic is not. Books deemed as a \\"classic\\" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. \\"Blas&eacute;\\" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth. I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable. I do no recommend."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I recently had to read this book as part of my English GCSE and I can honestly say that much paper has been wasted and our trees are being destroyed to churn out a book, which is quite frankly absolutly awfull. I also am very glad that I was not around to ever meet Thomas Hardy as from this book it sounds to me that he may well of been a manic depresent, also in most, if not all, of his other books they all end in a very sad a depressing way. Hardy describes Henchard as 'dogged' and i feel if you want to read this you too will have to be dogged and determind to start and finish this book."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Michael Henchard, a 21-year-old itinerant farmhand, enters a refreshment tent with his wife and baby girl at a country fair. Depressed by his poverty, Henchard gets blind drunk. He'd get along so much better without the burden of a family, he declares to one and all - and he offers his wife for sale to the highest bidder.Am amiable sailor throws down five guineas, and Susan Henchard, babe in arms, goes off with him.Amazingly, such things did happen in nineteenth-century rural England. This shocking event is our introduction to Michael Henchard's tempestuous character.Once sober, Henchard searches high and low for his wife and child, but with no success. He makes a vow in church to abstain from alcohol for the next 21 years, and he keeps that vow.We encounter Henchard two decades later, now a prosperous corn and wheat merchant and the Mayor of Casterbridge.Character is fate. Henchard's nature, violent and remorseful, jealous and generous by turns, will give him no rest in this life. We can't help pitying the man, deeply flawed though he is.The Mayor of Casterbridge is a classic of English literature. It's also a totally gripping story, abounding in reversals, romances and local color. Don't start reading it on a night that you hope to get to bed early!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"In Michael Henchard, Thomas Hardy created a tragic figure of Shakespearean dimension. The opening scene of a drunken Henchard selling off his wife and infant child at a country fair immediately establishes him as a rash and impetuous character. These qualities will return to haunt him and those nearest to him again and again as his fortune rises and falls.Henchard is contrasted with the genial and almost too innocent Scotsman Donald Farfrae who starts as his friend but becomes his rival in almost all things. Farfrae has an easy charm about him that makes him an unwitting competitor that stirs additional dark forces in Henchard as his rashness mixes with a growing envy.The Mayor Of Casterbridge is one of Hardy's great works alongside Tess and Jude The Obscure. Hardy's vision is dark and the relentless sadness in his work may put off some but in the end these characters he created are as strong as tragic figures as those of any writer in the English language.Finally Hardy's descriptions of rural England and the people who inhabit including their dialects of the time are priceless."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Good literature provides keen observations in behaviors and psychology of human beings when faced with moral choices and consequences, and this book definitely is filled with good stuff. The main character, Mr. Henchard, is severely flawed and his iniquities are multiple, and yet, he also is so human and really hard not to have sympathetic feelings toward him in the end. The writing is wonderfully philosophical and dramatic, especially the last paragraph of Elizabeth-Jane's reflection on life is movingly insightful."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Hardy mixes the comical here with the sorrowful so you're at once, entertained and saddened by the events; the largest event which brings on the sale of one man's wife and child to another; a moment which both liberates and destroys the main character through-out the story. Competition and jealousy figure prominently in the time line, which covers many years in the lives of a few sad people. You could say Michael Henchard was doomed from the 1st chapter. He certainly is haunted by his past to the point of no escape. And in fact, it's his past (as well as everyone who was part of it) that fuels the inevitable heartbreak to come. Casterbridge as a central location isn't quite as powerfully stark as Edgon Heath from... Native but the landscape does affect the players in similar ways. A wicked sense of folly usually dominates every novel Hardy has written."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This story STILL haunts me since first reading it in college, 20 years ago. It is about a man so destitute and desperate he sells his wife and baby daughter. Unburdeoned, his pockets full, he goes off to seek his fame and fortune. Though he becomes the wealthy and much-respected Mayor of Casterbridge, he is unable to escape the horror of what he has done. Everything he has built threatens to unravel when his dying wife shows up, almost-grown daughter in tow, seeking a guardian for her child. So well written, so cativating, it is like the making of a braid, every page woven together neatly, to a grand and shocking finale. This book turned me into a Hardy fan."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"What a story! What a tragedy! The Mayor of Casterbridge faces secrets told and untold, misunderstandings, betrayals, loves won and lost... a bona fide soap opera set in a faraway time! Yes, some of the coincidences are a little too convenient, but they kept me reading into the wee hours of the morning! And in the end I cried. This book's characters help us to consider the effects on others of the way we live our own lives. We are truly sorry for the way the Mayor lived his."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"&quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; was a wonderful story which engulfs the reader in perhaps one of the greatest stories I have ever read.

In conclusion I highly recommend this novel to everybody."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Ah, the small town of Casterbridge, or rather the outskirts to start.

It is a must for anyone who has read and enjoyed Hardy."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Very few people can see the real meaning of reading, especially reading a classic.

I would read the sentence again and again, feeling a mixture of awe and complete despair that I'll never write as well.This book kept me riveted, not so much by the plot, as by the writing itself. It is writing for readers who love words and the way they can fit together to express something that is so familiar and yet never properly articulated. Rachel Cusk has an astonishing talent and she's only 36. She has a great future ahead of her.The story is about a young lonely woman, and a young lonely man, who are somehow thrown together in a world that is disorienting, and alienating. At times it is painful, other times it is so funny that you cannot help laughing out loud. The main characters, Francine and Ralph, are a match made in hell. She is vain and petty and superficial. He has resigned himself to a life of familiarity. Their relationship is fascinating and depressing and often hilarious all at once. You feel genuine compassion for these two; neither is bad nor good. And you want a happy ending for them both because they are suffering.Unfortunately, the ending bothered me and left me uneasy. But it's a good story and it is written in language that requires a certain amount of penetration; it is not a book that you read with the stereo on. I highly recommend it and will add Rachel Cusk to my list of admired writers."},{"Title":"The Temporary","review":"I do not understand why this book is out-of-print, when Rachel Cusk's first novel won an award, and her third is doing so well. I have not yet read The Country Life, but Saving Agnes seemed like a mere preliminary exercise to gear up for the writing of the masterpiece that is The Temporary. Just as I could not understand what was so outstanding about Saving Agnes (although I did enjoy it), I could not understand why this wonderful book has been overlooked. Aside from the sophisticated, intricate writing, the kind that may not have been successfully executed since Jane Austen, Rachel Cusk's insights into human behavior are dizzying. She uses unique, unexpected metaphors to describe, and almost every paragraph includes a disturbing glimpse into the human psyche. In my opinion, The Temporary is a psychological thriller, and the genius of it is that Cusk has created a sympathetic character whose behavior we sometimes question, and an unlikable character for whom we come to have compassion. At least that's how it worked for me. The fact that the ending left me mildly baffled only increased the novel's success. It ends with a cliffhanger, which in hindsight is almost the only way the author could end this book without disappointing, b/c I wanted to feel that the characters go on and are not trapped in their happy/unhappy/anticlimactic fates. Anyway, I cannot say enough good things about this story of a temporary, her hapless victim, and the womanizer who brings the whole thing to a head in one of the most chilling scenes I have ever read. Go to the out-of-print section and get it!"},{"Title":"The Temporary","review":"With her first novel, Saving Agnes, Rachel Cusk laid the foundation for her writing. The Temporary is her second novel. It was published in 1995, two years after her first. And I see improvement. The author is using fewer words, and in places, she goes deep. Overall, though, the writing is uneven. Here is a highlight:\\"He groped for a date and remembered then that it was still only February. The year stretched before him in all its unavoidable detail, the hundreds of days and thousands of hours which he would endure as if something more lay at their end than mere repetition. He wished that he could be tricked, as others seemed to be, by the close of each week, seeing in their false endings the immience of some sort of conclusion, like a soap opera. He wondered why he had never fallen into step with this pattern of days, comprehended in the helpful clarity of a week's tiny eras-birth, growth, productivity, decline, dormancy, regeneration, played out beneath the celestial presence of longer phases of weather-a system that might ease the slow construction of his life.\\"I'm off to read her next novel."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This book, should be required reading for a multiple-birth pregnancy. Noble assumes you're looking for detailed information, and provides it. Unfortunately, having an unexpected multiple-birth pregnancy IS scary, and I don't think a chapter on death is out of place--particularly now that women are having higher-order multiples. I was actually grateful to read about other women who weren't especially thrilled to find out they were having twins. (Of course, many women who were absolutely thrilled were also included in the book.) It's a hard happiness for many women. Finding out other people had difficulty accepting the news helped me a great deal.Noble's view on sea vegetables might seem a little weird, especially for people who've never traveled. Surprise--people are finding out that the &quot;traditional&quot; American diet may not be the healthiest, especially for a pregnant woman. I live in a rural area and wasn't able to get sea vegetables, but if you're sick of milk and cottage cheese, you'll try anything. The calcium requirements for a mother carrying multiples are amazing. She also is a great person to read if you feel pressured into &quot;not eating&quot; during pregnancy for fear of gaining too much weight. The health of the babies is what's paramount, and she does a great job of supporting women. Doctors in America are much more likely to do c-sections for multiples --that's a proven fact, and it's also been proven that might not be neccessary. The more informed you are, the better your choices. Get this book if you only buy one multiple-birth book--it's the most complete."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"My midwife advised us to get this book as soon as we found out we were expecting twins.

I too followed their advice on nutrition as also advised by my midwife. It was difficult to consume so many calories and protein but I did it for the health of my babies and myself.While reading this book I found out why I was experiencing all these different things with my body that I never experienced with my other 4 births and pregnancies. I also was very prepared and informed of all the things to expect with multiples.Between my midwife and this book I felt totally confident and positive about my pregnancy and birth. Without it I would have been in the dark and frightened!I ended up delivering vaginally and totally natural at 39 weeks and 4 days. My b/g twins weighed 7lbs 14oz and 7lbs 15 oz.

My twins are now 9 years old, and I have not seen a book since then that is as informative and emotionally holistic as Elizabeth Noble's HAVING TWINS. I followed her advice for weight gain and protein intake as well as whatever other advice I was able to accomodate. My twins were born 1 week AFTER their due date and 7 lbs 2oz and 7 lbs 4 oz. I guess you could say it really worked!I felt the chapter on the death of a twin was completely appropriate. I appreciated being able to talk about that possibility and make plans for &quot;what if.&quot; The chapter is tastefully written with deep respect for the reader. I found it extremely moving and useful.I am just about to buy this book and give it to a friend of mine who is pregnant with triplets - super twins.

The inability to distinguish correlation from causality is the next (castor oil preventing hare lip, pg 183.) But the worst is the entire chapter on fetal memories, recovered with the aid of hypnotic or primal therapy. The author remembers knowing about, while still a fetus, not just the death of her sibling, but the death of her theoretical twin, whose existence is unsupported by any other evidence.On top of this are the obvious errors: 15,000 diaper changes in the first year (pg 55), mislabeled graphs which contradict the text (pg 90), presenting only a study contradicted by the bulk of the medical literature on the miscarriage rates from amniocentesis (pg 166).Given the new age nonsense, the lack of understanding of what constitutes scientific proof, and the fact that the book is dated (revised in 1991, there is no mention of the triple screen AFP test), it is impossible to evaluate the author's much more reasonable sounding advice on topics like diet."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I bought this book when I found out I was having twins in 1997. The chapter on Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome scared me to death and I skipped over the information on loss and planning after the loss. I SHOULDN'T HAVE! We lost our twins to TTTS on 7-4-97 and I then went back to the chapters I had skipped and found very useful information that I wished I had taken the time to read before our loss. Not all parents have successful twin or higher pregnancies and the media tends to 'glamorize' the successful ones while the rest of us are left to wonder if we made the right decisions or not. More needs to be available to the parents who are struggling daily to save their babies. Not all multiple pregnancies end with two or more healthy beautiful babies to bring home. But these babies do matter and do affect many, many lives and are NEVER forgotten by the families that lose them."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I was startled by those who rated this book so poorly simply because it covered the negative aspects of carrying twins. For those of you who had a rosy experience carrying your twins, BRAVO! However, in many instances, there are terrible things that can occur, and do. That is why a multiple gestation is considered such high risk. If you are not interested in reading the negative aspects, skip those parts. I lost my twins at 36 weeks and searched for any and all information I could find. I was thankful to have a resource so complete. This book could leave out all of that information, but how helpful would that be? The author would be negligent in not reporting all the facts, regardless of whether or not it's what I want to hear.

There were areas that did not apply to my pregnancy, but to have the information available was invaluable.As someone who had an &quot;event free&quot; pregnancy... all the way until my 28th week, I was able to focus until that point on all the exciting things happening (and not happening) to my body and those of my babies. When the unexpected and unexplained happened during a routine ultrasound, the discovery that one of my twins had died, I found the section on the loss of one twin to be an invaluable resource. When I had subsequent bedrest, preterm labor, tocolytics, then was able to deliver both babies naturally 8 weeks later, this book continued to keep me informed. This book was something I could turn to during each of the very different stages of my pregnancy. I strongly recommend it. And I attest the health of my surviving twin to the teamwork between myself, my OB and my perinatologist. I would not have been such an educated patient, able to participate in my and my surviving daughters care, without this book."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"As a mom of triplets and a childbirth educator who works with multiples I suggest this book for all expected parents. The simple truth is that most OBs don't tell couples what they really need to know. I think couples need to be able to make informed choices and to do that they need ALL information. They need information about nutrition, lifestyle, bedrest, preterm labor and the drugs that are used to try and stop it, and about how important state of mind is in every pregnancy. I believe Elizabeth has one of the most honest books about multiple pregnancy. She has good information about nutrition and the work Dr. Brewer has done in the field. She gives accurate informtion on the side effects of most preterm labor drugs and she gives moms the information they need to make it to term. It isn't bad to question authority it is healthy.

I found it to have a common sense approach to the process of having twins.I tended to follow its advice and found it very reassuring. Its dietary recommendations were sound. I followed them, as they were not inconsistent with my doctor's own. I felt good throughout my pregnancy and was very happy to be having twins. When they were born, my son weighed in at 7 lbs. 2 oz., and my daughter weighed in at 6 lbs. 6 oz.The book really gives one all the information about having twins that one could ever want: the good, the bad, and the ugly.

As a veterinarian and graduate of The Ohio State University College of Food, Agriculture, and Environmental Sciences, I can testify that the quality of such &quot;natural&quot; products is often much lower than their farm-grown counterparts.

Furthermore, the agricultural processes decried by this author in fact serve to make our food supply safer than ever before. Certainly this book does not present an &quot;expert&quot; opinion, nor does it provide safe and accurate information for the women who need it most. As far as the rest of the information in this book, I found it outdated and, in other cases, inaccurate. The author apparently has never been through a twin pregnancy herself; she is not particularly sensitive to the emotions of the mothers for whom the book is ostensibly written."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"There are plenty of other great books on parenting twins &amp; other multiples out there -- do yourself a favor &amp; don't buy this one! First of all, it is very technical &amp; difficult/unpleasant to read. Second, it has pictures of women after childbirth with like several feet of hanging extra skin -- not something I needed to see when I was emotional and pregnant with two. It also had the most negative, scary tone. It seemed to tell you all of the things that could go WRONG and very little of what could go right. Let me tell you, from a woman who has been there -- it can go beautifully &amp; without incident -- &amp; not everyone ends up with miles of extra skin on their stomachs. If you buy this book while pregnant, it will only serve to scare the wits out of you. Save yourself the stress and look elsewhere for good information!"},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This book was originally written in 1980 and, although a few chapters were added in 1991, it still reads like the early 80s - a time when a woman really could &quot;fail&quot; childbirth! If you are looking for an excuse to gain 50-60 (or even 70!) lbs or an excuse to never drink another glass of milk (according to the author, the idea that milk is good for you is just a myth propagated by the highly government subsidized dairy farmers), then this book could be for you. On the other hand, if you're on bedrest, considering using an epidural or even (gasp) a c-section, this book will try to make you feel bad about it.Then there are the chapters about the long term psychological effect of having to share a womb. If you believe, as the author does, that you can remember back to the day you implanted as a little embryo in your mothers womb, then you might think there's something to this. I just had to laugh.The author cites a lot of conflicting studies about twins and draws whatever conclusions she wants from them. All in all, I didn't get any of the practical advise I was looking for."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I've read most of this book and the more I've read the more bizarre it is. Noble claims that hypertension, anemia, and gestational diabetes are natural aspects of pregnancy that can be harmful if treated. She says bedrest is actually harmful, that ultrasounds increase fetal mortality and left-handedness (???) and a host of other claims. She implies that those carrying multiples many years ago gave birth to healthy 7-lb each infants with none of the problems that some of us having multiples face today. She is an advocate for veganism, water births, home births, doulas and midwives and avoiding pain meds. Though my twins are big and healthy I certainly didn't take the advice in this book.This is not medically sound advice nor is it objective or open-minded. It is a book of extreme views."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"Having already had one child, I am aware of what childbirth entails, and the associated risks. When I bought this book, I was hoping to have more of a comparative narration of the differences that I would go through with a twin pregnancy. I find that the so called advise that this author gives is not clear, is not helpful, and above all puts a fear on the mother, above and beyond the recognition of risk. The excerpts that are included in the margins are extremely negative, and irrelevent to the reader. Almost every time a doctor is mentioned, the person describes how the doctor didn't/wouldn't believe them, or that the Dr. did not take anything the patient said seriously. Along with that the exerpts generally describe the doctor as being incompetent in his/her diagnosis. The information that is included in these exerpts is irrelevent to carrying twins - nurses yelling at you because you're not pushing correctly, or experiences at the doctors office that resulted in the patient being ignored. This information has more to do with the assertiveness of the patient than it does of carrying twins and I found it to be very discouraging. The incessant focus on the loss of one twin is also extremely disturbing. While the occurance can happen, I desperately searched in the book for a positive majority of successful twin births, and this book did nothing to assuage my fears that had been instilled right from the beginning. The authors descriptions of the irreperable damage that having twins will do to your body, does not allow for any alternative methods to avoid such things. Vericose veins, and stretch marks, and incontinence apparently are a guarantee with twins, as is the extra fold of skin that will never go away. Nothing I read in this book gave me anykind of positive outlook for carrying, delivering, or caring for twins. I do not recommend this book to anyone who is expecting twins."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This book had me convinced that amy twins would have some type of birth defect, or that something would go wrong with my pregnancy, labor, or delivery. I read this when I was on bedrest, and finally had to remove it from my room because it scared me too much. The author seemed only to concentrate on what could go wrong with a twin pregnancy. I would recommend the only other twin book I read - &quot;Keys to Parenting Twins.&quot; It's much more positive! By the way, my twins were born completely healthy &amp; normal at 36 weeks."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"Noble's book is best summarized as &quot;frightening&quot; and &quot;far out.&quot; Her thoughts on twinship experiences in utero sound like something out of the X-Files; her warnings against the evils of consuming dairy products and foods containing preservatives are pure paranoia; and the gorey details of multiple pregnancy hazards are nothing short of terrifying. In fact, the positive aspects of having twins are completely ignored. The only redeeming quality of this book would be the last 3-4 chapters dealing with prematurity and dealing with loss. However, this same content can be found in many other less frightening and definitely more positive books, such as &quot;Twins!&quot; by Agnew, Klein and Ganon."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This was the first book that I bought when I found out that I was expecting twins and I found it to be outdated and full of a lot of biased information. The author has her own thoughts about what type of diet you should eat and advocates natural childbirth but doesn't provide a very comprehensive point of view to assist those that may not want to experience childbirth the way that she has. If you share her views then this book will be very helpful to you.I also tried contacting a lot of resources at the back of the book and found most of the numbers to be disconnected."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"While this book didn't scare me, I found it laughable and largely useless for the majority of twin-carrying women who like and trust their obgyns, believe that pain is generally to be avoided, and are actually comforted by the fact that institutions such as hospitals exist. Also, I found the book highly offensive in that it strongly suggested that miscarriage in twin pregnancies is caused by a mother's doubts about carrying twins. Gee, what a wonderful guilt trip to impose on a grieving mother..."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I do not recommend this book at all. There is way too much discussion of what can go wrong and too much &quot;new age&quot; philosophy that is very strange to me. Elizabeth Noble is under the impression that she had a twin that died in utero and that influences the way she has gone about writing this book. This is very scary reading for any woman pregnant with twins."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This was the scariest book on twins that I read. If you want to be afraid to eat, sleep or breathe during your entire pregnancy than this is your kind of book. Almost every chapter focuses on a negative aspect of carrying more than one baby and there are more chapters on what can go wrong than what to do to help things go right."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"Having just been told I was expecting twins, I was keen to find a book that could give me the information and reassurance that standard, &quot;singleton&quot; pregnancy books could not. But instead of finding useful information and reassurance, I finished this book feeling anxious and alarmed. It focuses far too much on the negative aspects of having twins - loss of one twin, preterm labor, birth complications, vanishing twin syndrome, etc. It is daunting enough being pregnant with twins without reading a book that reminds me of all the things that can go wrong. In addition, the author offers impractical advice on nutrition and exercise, which in many cases is contrary to advice from the medical profession. Not everyone has the money or the desire to eat seaweed and other &quot;macrobiotic&quot; health store food. All in all, I would not recommend this book to any woman expecting twins. It is alarmist and out-of-touch with real pregnant women."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I really appreciated the author's views on protecting children. I found her to be progressive and well-informed when it came to such issues as circumcision. There is a great deal of medical research which shows that circumcision is harmful and traumatizing to the child, and this author tells it like it is."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"My favorite part of the book was the story about a woman who carried unsuspected triplets to full term, with no drugs, no C-section, at home, with midwives. The book is overall so interesting that I've read it from cover to cover several times. It is encouraging, particularly in its assertion that with proper nutrition and care, &quot;routine&quot; C-sections, episiotomies, and premature deliveries can be avoided altogether. I recommend it even for mothers of singletons!"},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This book was very disturbing to me -- most notably in its judgmental tone. One very offensive statement: The author actually asserts that miscarriages often result from the mother's ambivalence about being pregnant. Anyone who has been close to anyone who has had the misfortune to lose a much-wanted pregnany can understand how potentially damaging and hurtful such an assertion can be. The book also discourages anything but a vegetarian diet, when research actually suggests that even vegetarian moms of multiples should consider supplementing their diet with red meat, given the special challenges of properly nourishing multiples. Being pregnant with twins is stressful enough without reading such ill-informed nonsense. If readers are looking for a book that provides great information on multiple pregnancies, as well as helpful suggestions for how to contribute to a healthy pregnancy, I suggest that they turn to Barbara Luke's book on &quot;When You're Expecting Twins ...&quot; instead."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I bought this book because it seemed to be highly regarded by other parents of multiples. However, I have been disappointed in the overall content. While Elizabeth Noble does a fine job of pointing out that carrying and delivering multiples is often risky (which I knew -- that's why I wanted a book!), she inserts a lot of personal bias and commentary into passages that are presumably meant to be factual/informational. Those of us who are not strongly interested in an organic, vegetarian/vegan diet, and those of us who are NOT REMOTELY interested in childbirth without pain meds, might find the tone of the book off-putting.The many cross-references could be valuable resources for the reader, but the references and information do tend to be older. The first edition of the book was published in the early 1980s; subsequent editing has not addressed Ms. Noble's reliance on studies from the 1970s. Without more recent information on twin mortality and complications, it is difficult for the reader to determine what is REALLY worrisome or advisable.My biggest concern about this book is its focus on all the things that could go wrong. It's true that expectant mothers need to be informed, but we also need to be supported and reminded that the vast majority of twin pregnancies result in two perfectly healthy babies. FWIW, *most* resources that I've seen focus on the scary side -- but the fact that they all do it doesn't make it ideal.I plan to buy another, more recent book to get me (and my babies!) through my twin pregnancy."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"Finding out I was pregnant with twins was moving, exciting, shocking and scary. I wanted a book that would help me understand how my pregnancy would be different to a singleton pregnancy, what to expect and some guidelines on how to look after myself. Although the book was informative and I loved the little comments made my mothers of multiples in the borders I didn't feel satisfied. I was more worried than before as the book goes into so much detail about the loss of a twin (this was the majority of a book) and premature labor. It started out good explaining the types of multiples and how common they are (or not) was interesting but there were very few pictures and I found it to be quite long winded. I must say that although this book was informative I felt more worried and anxious for my twins after reading it than before and was left still not knowing what to expect during my pregnancy."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I found out at 18 weeks that I was having twins. An incredible surprise that I still have not gotten over. I received this book as a gift and read it almost cover to cover. I found it to be very practical, helpful, supportive and generally very easy to read. It explained in detail what to expect and how it all works. I learned a great deal and feel a little more comfortable about having two babies at once. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a little extra help."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"The first thing to buy after the doctor says...&quot;I think I can hear another heartbeat!&quot; Twin pregnancies ARE different, and as a recent twin Mom, I relied on it from beginning to end of my pregnancy...right to 38 weeks, with over 14 pounds of combined birthweights. It's a great book."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I agree that many sections of this book are out of date and that some of the material can be scary but for those of us who experienced difficult twin pregnancies it was a great resource. I found this to be the only book that described in detail the complications I experienced and medical solutions to those problems. I felt comforted to read about my situation and read botht he positive and negative outcomes so that I was prepared. If you have and uncomplicated pregnacy I would not recomend the book."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This is an excellent book which covers all aspects of twin pregnancy and birth. Ms. Noble provides clear, much needed information on the joys and risks of multiple birth pregnancy. During my twin pregnancy this book helped me to be aware of the potential difficulties I could face and helped me to seek out good medical care when there were difficulties. Ms. Noble presents the information on the loss of a multiple in a compassionate manner. When one of my babies died, this book was the only resource I had which helped me to contact organizations which were a lifeline for me after the loss. THANK YOU!!!"},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"If an expectant multiple mom read nothing else but this book, she would have the information she needed to have a happy, healthy, FULL-TERM multiple pregnancy. Multiple pregnancies ARE different, and that is what this book is all about. As a childbirth educator and doula, I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"Wow! This book has certainly aroused a lot of strong feeling! I feel very lucky to have found it early in my pregnancy almost nine years ago. I credit the book, as did another reviewer, with having full-term babies who were both over 8 pounds, with feeling good about labor even though I did end up with a (very well-handled) c-section, and with having no separation from my babies throughout their birth and our time in the hospital. While I didn't agree with everything in this book, I never agree 100% with anyone, so that didn't bother me. The most important and helpful thing about Elizabeth Noble's book is that it doesn't whitewash the many intense feelings and struggles that twin pregnancy brings--of course I can't speak for everyone, but Ms. Noble's candid explorations really resonated with me. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to love two at once, and I still think that babies do better coming one at a time, even though having and being twins has its magical side. I'm a proponent of attachment parenting, and I know how hard it is to fill two babies' needs for touch, attention, and attunement if there's only one of you! Anyway, I urge those who want to explore the full nature of their feelings about having twins, and who want to avoid unnecessary interventions and separations from their babies, to read this book and see for themselves how they feel about it! For myself, I say, &quot;Thank you.&quot;"},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I read this book right after I found out that I was having twins. Although I was a little concerned about the financial aspects of having two children, I was very positive about having twins. This book absolutely scared me! Doom, gloom, and more doom! After reading it, I thought that I would end up on bedrest early, that my twins would end up in NICU for months, and that all sorts of problems would come up. My husband and I later attended a childbirth class for multiple births and one of the first things that the instructor told us was to NOT read this book. There are so many other books out there that do tell you the risks and the problems, but manage to stay positive. Incidentally, I never was put on bedrest, my girls were born at 36 weeks, they spent one night in NICU and came home with me three days later. Believe me, from talking to other moms of twins and my own experiences, this is much more common than this book would make you believe."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"This book met my need for information regarding vaginal birth of multiples, in my case triplets. There are almost NO books available with the same depth of coverage. If you ask around, you will find that many people think vaginal delivery of multiples is too risky or downright negligent. I was very encouraged by the chapter on \\"SuperTwins\\" and went on to deliver vaginally at 34 weeks. My boys were healthy but did stay in NICU for a month. E. Noble's info prepared me, though I must say, I didn't read all of it. I particularly skipped the chapter on fetal memories. I think there are books out there that will meet whatever informational need you have. It is obvious from the reviews that this book isn't for everyone. I bought this book when I thought I was expecting twins."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"Noble's book provides information on everything and anything that you would ever need to know about having multiples.

Had to laugh at some things in this book. Please go with a newer version from this century:-)"},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I read this book while I was pregnant with my twin daughters and found it incredibly depressing and scary. It was filled with morbid quotes from parents who had a bad outcome, along the lines of, \\"when not even one of the triplets lived, I went out and got drunk,\\" and seemed to dwell on every possible problem and complication to the point that I was quite stressed and anxious when in fact, my twins were born naturally, five days before the predicted due date, had none of the complications this horrible book made me worry about, and were in excellent health. In fact, I so dislike the book that I go out of my way to warn expectant parents of twins to avoid it. In addition, the dietary advice is ridiculous and it's impossible for even a hearty eater to consume the massive amounts of food this writer claims are necessary to having a healthy baby. So, unless you like being scared, I recommend against buying this book."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I was looking for a comprehensive, layman terms guide that I can refer to in anticipation of the birth of my twins. This books wasn't it. Its seems as if the author forgot her audience, parents that do not have time to completely comprehend each and every detailed paragraph of a page. Extremely busy/expectant/multitasking parents are the norm - they are looking for bite sized data that they can learn from - quickly.

While every other developed country in the world knows the benefits of hormone-free meats and animal products and evidence-based maternity care, we Americans still suffer under our unrestrained capitalistic model of care. Yes, the author, Eliz. Noble, recommends organic and natural foods and yes, vegetarianism. Food corporations began giving them to animals in the 70's--not for our benefit--but for their's. Faster growth and more production. The American Cancer Society recognizes that vegetarianism is the most effective way to avoid most cancers. But Noble says if vegetarianism isn't for you--go organic. It is also the TRUTH that our bodies have not changed in the last 35 years, but how OBs treat women certainly have. What mainstream Americans consider \\"in their best interest\\" advice from their OBs is often actually \\"liability-risk care\\" and not \\"evidence-based care\\". Noble cites studies and evidence-based care and this is simply too difficult for most mainstream Americans to hear. That's why, out of the 26 placings of developed countries, we rank #25 in maternal mortality and #21 in infant mortality. That's bad, very, very, very bad. For the truth that other developed countries know, read this book."},{"Title":"Having Twins: A Parent's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Early Childhood","review":"I HAD TWINS IN MAY OF 99.

She accepts the deal between Peyton Kincaid and her deceased father only because she is worried about her younger sibling Bo. Still she adds a few stipulations as does Peyton's angry son Royce the other target. The two will wed, keep their marriage secret, and Royce demands Annabelle inherits all as he plans to vanish out west without any offspring.At the end of the Civil War, Royce returns home to fulfill one of his codas that he will give his wife one year to decide to divorce him. As he becomes better acquainted with the intrepid Annabelle, Royce realizes he prays she will not send him packing. Annabelle also loves her husband, but knows his freedom is what he desires so plans to let home go even though that is the last thing she wants in life.Fans of American Civil War romances will appreciate this pleasant tale. The story line is well written though the animosity of the hero towards his father and the lead female's brother towards her husband is not clear for most of the tale although her sibling may resent his inability to offer any options. The characters make the tale as they bring to life the years just before, during, and just after the War Between the States.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Seen By Moonlight","review":"I love the fact that Ms. Eschenburg was not afraid to add history to her historical romance. In this story our hero and heroine come to terms with life and love with the Civil War as a backdrop for their story. This story in many ways reminded me of the old classic &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; in the fact that the time period was the same, pre civil war to the call of arms and the &quot;excitement&quot; that was felt by so many during this time period.Royce and Annabelle's story takes place in pre-war Virginia and they are forced into a marriage that does not seem like it will have a happy ending. It's really a deal made between Royce and his father with Annabelle caught in the middle. As both of these strong people come to terms with what life has dealt them, they are also facing the coming storm both realizing that war won't be glorious but that it's a foregone conclusion. Despite this they fall in love and their love story is wonderful. Full of all kinds of emotion.Secondary characters only enrich this already wonderful story. This is the first time that I've read Ms. Eschenburg but it won't be the last."},{"Title":"Seen By Moonlight","review":"This could have been a good book but the writer puts in child rape which is gross and doesn't have the couple together enough. Teh war is used to take up space and the romance with the slave couple was more believable. Not enough passion and does not cover the war very well"},{"Title":"Seen By Moonlight","review":"Ms. Eschenburg takes the arranged-marriage plot device but doesn't really give it anything new. The \\"hero\\" really isn't that likable, and spends half the novel apart from the heroine. They end up together, but the reader is left wondering \\"why?\\" The author attempts to fill up the lack of real romance by setting the story against the American Civil War, but makes some mistakes with that as well, and child sexual abuse just flat does not belong in a romance novel AT ALL. That chapter nearly made me lose my lunch and it really didn't add anything to the plot. Not the worst \\"romance\\" I've ever read by any means, but definitely not worth the cover price. Buy used."},{"Title":"Seen By Moonlight","review":"As a reader of historical romance, a civil war buff, and a fan of the Outlander series author Diana Gabaldon, who once recommended this book on her web site, I came to this novel fully expecting to like it. I was severely disappointed. This is a middling, at best, romance novel with a pedestrian plot, predictable characters, and a hero and heroine who couldn't be more representative of all that's tedious in the genre. The author seems sincere and there's a sense that she did her civil war era research, but the book holds no surprises and little inducement for the reader to continue past the first few chapters.If you're going to write a novel about another spirited, plain but beautiful, impoverished girl-woman who makes a marriage of convenience with a gorgeous, tortured, secretly-sensitive man who-pretends-to-hate-but-really-loves-her than it better be exquisitely plotted and beautifully written. This book is neither."},{"Title":"Seen By Moonlight","review":"Seen By Moonlight is a love story that goes far beyond romance. The story spans the Civil War, showing us the beautiful Virginia countryside from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the great river valleys in peacetime before taking us through the destruction that the war brought to that country.Ms. Eschenburg's skill as a writer is to put the reader into a scene so fully that you will believe you are there. I recently saw the movie Cold Mountain, which has a similar setting. This novel painted more of a picture of beauty, horror and love than the big screen was able to capture.With the horrors of war raging around them we see Royce Kincaid and Annabelle Hallston slowly changing until each of them chooses to take the most courageous step of all--to surrender to love.Don't be fooled by the embrace on the book jacket--the love these two share is not mere lust. They discover the depths of each other as people before they ever explore their physical passion. When that time comes Ms. Eschenburg uses her wonderful descriptive skills to show us both tenderness and fire.This is a book I won't soon forget."},{"Title":"Seen By Moonlight","review":"Writer uses the war as filler while trying to pass off child molesting as romance.

That's why the book works."},{"Title":"Seen By Moonlight","review":"bought this book eagerly because I'm a Civil War reenactor and love the period. This book is a major disappointment. The hero and heroine don't get together until the last third of the book. The war is little more than a backdrop \\"Oh, this is going to be a terrible thing\\" over and over. Instead of real romance, we get child molestation, slave concubinage, the obligatory PC horrors of slavery....gag. I wanted history and romance and this book fails to deliver. The author also made a few mistakes with her research and does a poor job of depicting historical figures such as General Lee, Stonewall Jackson and others. She tries to describe the heroine looking sexy in pantalets (which were out of style by the time of the war) and a camisole (which is an undergarment that didn't exist yet - women of the period wore chemises). If you want to read real Civil War romance written by somebody who really knows the period, buy Heather Graham instead."},{"Title":"Seen By Moonlight","review":"A story that has everything set against the background of the civil war. Really enjoyable. See Klausner review above."},{"Title":"Seen By Moonlight","review":"Brought to the brink of bankruptcy following her father's illness and death, Annabelle Halleston agrees to honor a bargain struck between her father and Royce Kincaid's father. It allows her to save the family home while assuring her brother's futures. In addition to a few other demands, however, she changes their wedding day to April Fool's Day.Royce counters with his own expectations regarding inheritance of his property in the event of his death or the dissolution of their marriage should he survive the war. Indeed, should he survive the war, Royce intends to go west and wishes no further contact with Annabelle. It does not take long for Royce to realize that if he does not die in the coming war, he would live to regret this marriage.Author Kathleen Eschenburg recreates the beauty and the grace of the south before the Civil War with all possible poignancy and pain of that lost era. She deftly exposes the flaws of slaveholders, for example, yet they can be ethical, sympathetic and terribly flawed. The result is a story that springs vividly alive with the tragic nuances, triumphs and perplexities that makes it truly believable. From the main characters to the slaves, these are characters readers come to care for.

I can say that for me, the 20 essays in 'Transient and Permanent,' edited by Charles Capper and Conrad Edick Wright, were excellent in content, style, and helpfulness, with only one exception. I found 'Brook Farm, Fourierism, and the Nationalist Dilemma in American Utopianism' to be the only weak one of the lot, little more than a leftist-semi-socialist screed with some references to the title-contents to enable it to be included in the book.The book's title, \\"Transient and Permanent,\\" comes from an 1841 sermon by Theodore Parker. I found insights which would please both those who are partial to the Transcendentalist movement, and those who find that it the 'missing link' between orthodox Christianity and the growing agnosticism of the Western World and specifically the USA in the 19th century. For instance, on p. 25, RWEmerson is quoted as believing that \\"family, church and state [are] decomposing\\" in his time. Did he ever consider that his writings contributed to that decomposition? The fact that the Transcendentalists were proud \\"to make liberation from the 'supulchres of the fathers' the exiliarating (and covertly anxious) center of their social world view' is cited approvingly by Charles Capper on p. 30. But isn't making this the center of your world view inherently adolescent, even infantile? Did the Transcendentalists, and anyone else who rejects tradition completely, believe that their ideas emerged from the brow of Zeus? Were they so egotistical to think that no one who lived before them was as wise and intelligent as they?I found it interesting that, although the Transcendentalists usually prided themselves on their social justice stances, that Emerson lived very comfortably, and when Parker died, his estate indicated that he was in the top 1% of wealth in Massachusetts. However, Emerson did call Andrew Jackson, one of the co-founders of the Democratic party, along with Thomas Jefferson, \\"a charlatan, a frivolous nobody.\\" And Emerson was for removing regulations on trade, and on p. 239, John Patrick Diggins summarizes Emerson's economic outlook as \\"the basis of political economy is non-interference,\\" attitudes out of line with 21st century liberalism.I found the articles by Nancy Stula and Michael Broyles/Denise von Glahn, on the relationship of Transcendentalism to art and music respectively, particularly valuable, especially since i am a non-specialist in those areas.I think it safe to say that the San Francisco Chronicle, as quoted on p. 502, was a bit over the top in ranking Emerson up there with \\"Dante, Galileo, Montaigne, Newton and Darwin' in their obituary for the sage of Concord.On p. x of the Preface, the editors state that \\"the essays in this collection attempt to capture New England's Transcendentalists in all their complexity.\\" The authors' and editors' attempt was successful."},{"Title":"The Arabic Role in Medieval Literary History: A Forgotten Heritage (The Middle Ages Series)","review":"Menocal's now classic (and still controversial) book is well worth the trouble of finding a copy (I waited 6 weeks for mine). She uncovers a hidden thread of influence on Dante, Boccaccio, and Petrarch (and thus our Western Heritage) that most scholars would have preferred lay forgotten.Yes, Virginia, there really wasn't a &quot;Renaissance.&quot; Instead, European authors tapped into the great watershed of Islamic culture and borrowed the best of it, recasting it for a Christian audience.Michael KucherUniversity of Washington, Tacoma"},{"Title":"The Arabic Role in Medieval Literary History: A Forgotten Heritage (The Middle Ages Series)","review":"Meaningful silences punctuate our lives. How silent is a first kiss, yet how potentially significant?In this history of literary histories, Menocal delves deeply into a hush that fell on certain theses -- certain most undesireable theses -- as the 19th century dawned. She deftly traces an intellectual theory of the birth of the poetry of courtly love from Dante's level Latin language defense of the vernacular through Schlegal's mind-numbing dismissal through those enormous silences of the 19th and 20th centuries and on to the more riotous days of her student youth.The theory -- that most undesirable, unimaginable theory -- would potentially root the emergence of European vernacular poetry of the troubadours not in a moment of proto-French genius summoning rhymes of courtly love from the mists but in a moment of Andalusian (and distinctly Mozarabic) brilliance that recreates and recasts the worlds and sounds before it.Wisely, in this magical tale of literary and linguistic adventures, Menocal does not begin with the theory itself, which has been researched, argued, buttressed, and reinforced from Medieval times to the present, in many languages and many times. Instead, she launches into the poetry of the many cultures of the time, both Romance and Arabic, and then moves on to the history of the silence. We hear Dante struggling in Latin with thoughts on the vernacular and the sources of his inspiration; we hear Arabic and Mozarabic speaking women finding new masters among the Christians as the Reconquista commences, we hear forms emerge from the classical Arabic and in the Mozarabic and Provencal and Sicilian vernaculars, and then, we hear silence. First, Schlegel's dismissal: \\"they\\" don't love or treat women as \\"we\\" do; \\"our\\" love and our poetry are ours alone, not theirs; we listen to the ignorance and intense pride of emergent Europe, and we watch as the theory is isolated and sequestered among the Arabists. The silence falls.Understanding the history of the theory reveals the theory itself, playing out in the world in which the poetry and conceptions of courtly love emerged. Menocal raises question after question, all good questions, but denies us the answers. We can look and listen for ourselves. She gives us ears.This is a personal work, autobiographical in places, exploring a personal intellectual history written on a grand scale. Much of Menocal's thesis is unsurprising to today's historians - indeed, her discussion of the interaction of Islamic, Judaic and Christian cultures on the fringes of Medieval Catholic Christendom, whether in Al-Andalus, the islands of the Mediterranean, the Byzantine empire and its successors, or the ever-changing Slavic lands, would be self-evident among the historians with whom I studied. But in the world of Romance literature and literary history, the interaction and cross-pollination, the notion of Arabic genes in European poetry undermines fundamental mythologies that are deeply resilent and shape the very basis of the \\"western canon\\". The clash of history and mythology can be among the most challenging and deeply personal of dialectics; the recognition of the unity of the mythological and historically can be fundamentally shocking. Menocal leads us through her and now our journey.So, in this deeply poetical work, Menocal breaks through the silence to listen to voices that have spoken to us for centuries. It was never truly silent anyways: that first kiss always fills the silence, laying open new possibilities. So with Menocal: read carefully and inherit a broader world, one whose words and emotions are freed from a narrow pennisula.

Far from a dry text, I found this book to be an enlightening view into the roles of women in Renaissance society, the social mores and opinions that restricted them, and the many ways in which some circumvented society in order to express themselves (there is a lot more there than you think!). It is full of primary data, some of which is only available in Italian and other original languages, and translated for this book by the author. One who reads this book will come away with a more complete and well-rounded view of Renaissance women's lives, (at their best and their worst) and a greater respect for those who lived them. In response to the previous reviewer, and as a warning to those looking for an &quot;easy read&quot;.

This was a required text for an upper division college course I took.Margaret King knows her stuff. I've studied the Renaissance in other classes, so had touched upon gender issues already, but King's work filled in many empty spaces. Her thesis is that although socially women didn't gain much (or even lost ground), something important happened within women's minds during the Renaissance.Options were limited for women during fourteenth through seventeenth centuries. Roles were generally defined by men or faith (ostensibly controlled by men); wife, mother, celibate religious, spinster, witch. But even these categories, King shows, were full of complexities. Women, other than nuns, shouldn't be taught to read, rather spin and sew. Women couldn't be trusted with too much knowledge. Even the Greek term for \\"womb,\\" hysteros, gave a clue to a woman's basic \\"hysteria.\\" Often, women bought into this paradigm and were their own worst enemies.But King shows that the scene was more complex than that. Some fathers taught daughters Latin, Greek, philosophy. Heretic nuns wrote private treatises from within the shelter of their cells. Men marvelled at living Amazons, such as Joan of Arc who walked the thin line between deification and devilment. Before Joan burned, Christine de Pizan wrote about a \\"City of Ladies\\" where femininity would be protected, and no man could cause hurt.This is a beautiful book and should be read by historians, feminists, and anyone who loves to see flowers grow through cracks in inhospitable terrain."},{"Title":"Women of the Renaissance (Women in Culture and Society Series)","review":"The title of this monograph well describes its subject: the lives of women during the Renaissance. However, Margaret L. King pays close attention to the roles available to women in the family, church, and high society. This text's intended audience is the general academic community. This book's purpose is to clarify the nature of women's lives during Renaissance.King's primary thesis is that women did not have a Renaissance. The realms of family, church, and high culture all relegated Renaissance women to subservience in some way. In the family, women were essentially their husband or father's property. In most cases, the church viewed women in a similar fashion. Conversely, in high culture, Renaissance women had a chance of wielding power and receiving education. King relies on diaries, religious texts, trial transcripts, medical literature, and several personal letters to support this argument.This book examines the Renaissance, defined by the author as the period from 1350 to 1650. Subjects discussed include the cultural, economic, and political circumstances of women. The first chapter is titled \\"Daughters of Eve: Women in the Family.\\" Here, King asserts that Eve's punishment in Genesis epitomizes the lives of Renaissance women. According to this story, the punishment for Eve's sin is that all women have to endure labor pain and remain subservient to men. Similarly, a Renaissance woman's worth is dependent on her ability to produce several children in succession and remain submissive to her male family members. King goes on to discuss a woman's progression from daughter, to wife, and eventually to a widow. She ends this chapter by discussing the woman as a worker. Here, King's main argument is that women's public labor was mostly menial and became increasingly restricted as time went on.In chapter two, \\"Daughters of Mary: Women and the Church,\\" King examines Renaissance women's role in the church. Unlike women in the family, the lives of women in the church do not revolve around bearing children. However, women of this realm still remain nominally subservient to men. In discussing women and the church, King starts by examining women who live in convents and those who live in autonomous and uncloistered female religious communities. King also spends a moderate amount of time discussing women and the reformation. She argues that while Catholicism provided an alternative to family life in the form of a convent, Protestantism provides no such choice. King ends the chapter by discussing witch-hunts, which she likens to genocide.In chapter three, \\"Virgo Et Virago: Women and High Culture,\\" King examines the role of Renaissance women in the upper class. These women enjoyed better access to education and some attended school. King also mentions a few rare Renaissance examples of female rulers. All of these educated and powerful women upset the gender roles for women in Renaissance society. Some of the words used to describe these women include Amazon, armed maiden, and crone. At the end of this chapter, King examines primary sources created by Christine de Pizan, Modesta de Pozzo, and Mary Astell. Using these sources, King finishes her book by examining the way women's ideas about themselves changed during the Renaissance. Specifically, they began seeing themselves as equal to men.This book does carry out its purpose of clarifying women's lives during the Renaissance. Some of the strengths of this book include extensive use of primary evidence and the author's knowledge of the existing literature on this subject. It also has an extensive bibliography and index. Nonetheless, this text has significant faults. The most significant fault is the complete lack of a proper conclusion. King's entire summary consists of two paragraphs on the last two pages of the third chapter. King also continually jumps from one side of Europe to the other. Occasionally, she even discusses women in America. This disorients the reader and inhibits the academic usefulness of this text. Due to these shortcomings, the reviewer is hesitant to suggest this book as a good resource."},{"Title":"Eton Voices: Interviews","review":"Eton College may not be the best school in Britain (in its 2000 survey of UK schools, the Financial Times newspaper ranked Eton 26th; Winchester College was number one), but it is certainly the most famous and the most storied. From its formation by King Henry VI, Eton's old boys consistently have become some of the most powerful or influential men in the Empire. Someday, God willing, one of its more recent graduates will become King.In his introduction, interviewer and editor Danny Dangizer (the British son of American parents and an Old Harrovian) writes, '[T]here is something very un-English about Eton ... in that it leaves its boys with an unshakeable confidence in their own ability, combined with the conviction that anything in life is achievable. While these qualities may seem unpleasantly arrogant and mark Etonians as different, even from the products of other public schools that have neither the initiative nor the resources to indulge and fulfil every boy's expectations, the success rate of Etonians in their traditional fields is an inescapable fact of life: Etonians have great expectations -- and Etonians are rarely disappointed.'Therein lies one of the weaknesses of this otherwise very interesting book. Danziger's comments sound like a self-fulfilling prophesy, given the 42 OEs he has interviewed. They include one former prime minister (Lord Home of the Hirsel), several rising (at the time of the interviews, anyway) politicians and potential prime ministers, a handful of bishops, well-known writers and artists, a general, two other Earls, three Lords .... in short, people who have indeed been successful 'in their traditional fields.' It would have been interesting, and I believe given a more complete look at Eton, if Danziger had interviewed a dozen or so OEs who had not been so successful, for whom attending Eton may have been the high point of their social achievement ... or even men who had lived perfectly productive and honorable lives without ever becoming big names in the UK.Danziger has a very light hand in these interviews -- so much so that the chapters (each in the interviewee's own words) sometimes read a little abruptly, like a Q&amp;A session with all the Qs removed. Danziger helpfully includes a glossary of Eton slang for people who may be unfamiliar with Library or Pop. Unfortunately, he doesn't provide the same service regarding the men he interviewed. If you don't know who Andrew Callendar or The Hon. Jonathan Porritt or Sir Ranulph Twistleton-Wykeham-Fiennes are, for example, you'll have to try to figure it out from the context of their interviews, because Danziger won't tell you.Despite that difficulty, however, I felt like I knew Eton better after reading these interviews. For someone who already knows a little bit about the Iolani of England and its history, I recommend this for additional reading."},{"Title":"King of the Dead","review":"All I can say about this series is WOW!!

Abandoning the &quot;present&quot; story line where Buffy's 19-year-old body had been possessed by Zotzilaha, the estranged bride of Camazotz, the ancient Mayan demon-god, Golden focuses entirely on the alternative Buffy future, where the now 24-year-old Slayer has finally escaped captivity and has been reunited with the old Scoobey Gang. Whereas the first two parts of the Lost Slayer ended with the reader dying to find out what happens next, &quot;King of the Dead&quot; ends with us wanting to know more about what happened to everyone while Buffy was lost. But all we really get are vauge references to the horrors that happened in Sunnydale while Buffy was imprisoned, namely the deaths of Joyce, Faith and Anya (and presumably Angel), and like Buffy we want to hear more of the details.Golden takes full advantage of the fact that these books are set way back during the early part of Season 4 of Buffy, so that his characterizations of Willow as the defacto leader of the Watchers Council forces, Xander as the grim death machine, and Oz as the unleashed werewolf, ring true. One of the most impressive developments on Buffy has been the emergence of Willow as a wicca of considerably and growing power. Perhaps even more than the relationship between Giles and the Slayer, it is the relationship between Buffy and Willow that is at the heart of the Buffy mythos. The most poignant scenes in &quot;King of the Dead&quot; have to do with the two friends trying to find themselves again, and the realization that Willow has remained true to Buffy, even at the expense of her relationship with Oz. It is character relationship rather than action that ultimately dominates Part Three of this tale and provide the novel's best moments.My previous bafflement as to why Buffy was incarerated in a cell that actually had a door, through which escape was finally possible after five years, is explained away by Golden's revelation that her former Watcher has further, darker plans for Buffy in his new vampire kingdom. Although as a tendency I have little fondness for writers providing their villains with an Achilles heel that will allow the hero to triumph at the last moment, there is a certain deliciously twisted logic at work here. You can certainly argue that if Giles the Vampire King is as smart and as patient as everybody keeps saying he is, then he would not play with fire in this manner, and I would absolutely agree with you. But Golden makes the whole idea work for the most part as he builds up to the final chapters of the tale. &quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; is far and away Golden's best solo work on Buffy and his efforts do not suffer in comparison to &quot;The Gatekeeper&quot; Trilogy."},{"Title":"King of the Dead","review":"Bloody Hell!!!

Together they're incredible, apart they're still heads and shoulders above the rest of the professional Buffy novelists. So, when I picked up this book, I was expecting to enjoy it just as much as I have the others, especially when reading the premise off the back. Unfortunately, the short length of the books takes away all the potential the storyline had. Details are glossed over, and the emotions of the characters are skimmed so briefly you can't possibly feel for them. The dialogue is impressive, as it always is with Christopher Golden, but that's about the only good thing I have to say about this book and the others in the series. Trust me when I tell you, save your $3.00 and put it towards a different, longer novel by the same author, or by Nancy Holder. Or both. Because while I can't say enough good things about full length Christopher Golden stories, he definitely should avoid short length from now on.

And her old friends don't know quite what to make of her either. One part of Buffy, imprisoned for 5 years, is colder and calculating. The other part, the mind of the 19 year old that was thrust forward in time, still loves her friends dearly, and hates what has happened. Buffy must determine the mistake that has let this future occur, and then find a way back to her past to undo it.Spike, always a rebel, has a confrontation with Giles over the death of Drusilla. The argument ends when a thoroughly irritated Giles throws Spike out into the sunlight. Thus it is a badly singed vampire that shows up at Resistance headquarters seeking revenge. Buffy is in no mood for games, and Spike has a very uncomfortable interrogation. Then, in short order, she has her first confrontation with Giles. He is now a master of the very things he once trained her in, and dreams of turning her into his mate, at his side forever. He escapes, and Buffy prepares for war.The subsequent battle for Sunnydale is a miniature military action, fought by commandos against sun protected vampires, demons, and human conspirators. The action is furious, as the old team members slip back in synch again. And the ending is another shocking surprise. Christopher Golden is completely successful in maintaining a level of excitement higher than several other recent Buffy books, proving himself still a master of Buffy lore.

Forced to kill the second Slayer August (Faith's successor) Buffy is reunited with her friends who have also been changed in the five years she's been held prisoner. Here Golden makes some rather remarkable predictions about the character's future personalities: Willow's incredible power as a witch, Oz's inability to fully surpress his werewolfry, Wesley's new kick-butt attitude, Faith's redemption - these are but a few of the accurate soon-to-be fates of the Scooby gang on the television show.But despite these interesting points, the plot soon begins to waver. Buffy learns that due to the mistake she made over five years ago concerning the bat-god Camazotz and her Watcher Giles, she herself is responsible for all that has come to pass. Giles is now a vampire himself, sporting the rather ridiculous title of 'King of the Vampires', and his goal is to turn Buffy herself into a vampire. Also on the scene is the new Vampire Slayer, Anna Kuei, who serves no real purpose in the story that I can see, and Spike whose death is equally pointless, especially since he rather stupidly walks into the Watcher's compound to give them information they already knew. And what exactly was his escape plan...?The basis of the story is Buffy joining forces with the Watcher's Council and her old friends to go up against Giles and his minions. The whole 'two souls in one body' nicely contrasts the theme of the former books in which Buffy-the-person tries to separate herself from Buffy-the-Slayer, but all tension over this is lost, as Golden continually informs us that the rightful soul will eventually return to the nineteen year old Buffy. There's a nifty Buffy physic dream and a pretty cool twist involving a priest and fire sprinklers in the ceiling, but other times the story falls short of expectations - a fighter named Yancy is introduced as a somewhat irratic killer (aha! I thought, there's the turncoat!) but is needlessly killed off before he plays any sort of impact in the story.Basically, a quick, mildly entertaining read, but with too much descriptions on endless fighting and unlikely what-if senarios to be taken seriously."},{"Title":"King of the Dead","review":"As a huge fan of Buffy-only the original novels, though, this whole 'series' was actually pretty good. I may still like the gatekeepers trilogy better, but hey, each of these 4 books were only 2.99 or so, and they don't take long to read. Worth a look ."},{"Title":"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need: Newly Revised and Updated","review":"I bought this book in 1999 and read it annually. I always laugh out loud and recommend it to everyone I meet who is not and does not want to be an \\"expert\\" in the market but does want honest, forthright, expert advise on what's what in personal finance and investments. I re-read it recently and 10 years after it's release it's still dead on.

It, along with other reading, was instrumental in forming the basics of what would become an adult life of very succesful money management. I recently read the book again (it's latest, updated version), and enjoyed it every bit as much as I did the first time. This is not a \\"get rich quick\\" book. This is 300 pages of complete common sense regarding how to avoid all the nonsense hype, and manage you money in a way that will put you in the best financial shape over the long term. Don't listen to all those friends and relatives that think they have the latest and greatest way to make a killing. Instead, listen to the sound advice of Andrew Tobias who will never steer you wrong. I promise."},{"Title":"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need: Newly Revised and Updated","review":"Tobias is, by quite a large margin, the personal finance writer who is most fun to read. His conversational and funny prose goes by so breezily that the reader almost doesn't notice that there's a ton of advice packed into it. Tobias also recognizes that personal finance is just that -- personal. Sample from the section on money-saving tips: &quot;You will never find me eating a ketchup other than Heinz. But is it really worth 80 percent more to you to sneeze into a genuine Kleenex-brand 'kleenex'?&quot; Not only is the thinking right on, but how 'bout that &quot;eating a ketchup&quot; -- touche!

If that sounds good, also consider The Mindful Money Guide. While The Mindful Money Guide isn't quite as witty as The Only Investment Guide, it is also fun to read and supplements Tobias' book well--for unlike Tobias' book, The Mindful Money Guide covers the emotional and social aspects of money (in addition to offering good financial advice)."},{"Title":"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need: Newly Revised and Updated","review":"Enjoyable, easy to read book.

Both are well-written by the two biggest names in consumer finance. But Quinn is encyclopedic and tends to explain everything to exhaustion. Tobias, on the other hand, has mastered the art of the clear, short sentence.

It's a little bit of theory, mixed with some good stories, and examples.Remember, a penny saved is still two pennies earned."},{"Title":"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need: Newly Revised and Updated","review":"After buying this book in 1990 and using his (now-defunct)finance software, Managing Your Money, I'm a believer in slow but suregrowth. I re-read this book to keep my feet on the ground and not let the &quot;quick buck&quot; mentality knock me off course. As Tobias writes, the more mundane (but most important) issues of personal finance must be dealt with first: create a budget, live below your means, and stay out of debt. The revised edition keeps up with all the new wealth options (Roth IRAs, automatic transfers, etc) available, but the commonsense premise remains. My networth is now over $250,000, thanks to Mr. Tobias. But his most important message to me (from the original book) was this: &quot;Don't lose sleep envying the wealthy.[My rich friend] makes 50 times as much money as you, but gets to see only the same TV shows you do, sleeps in a bed very much like your own, eats and drinks only marginally tastier food and wine.&quot; This book is a confidence builder as well as a nuts and bolts primer."},{"Title":"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need: Newly Revised and Updated","review":"Not only does Andrew Tobias suggest that readers save and invest, but also shows real ways that people can spend less (through conservation, stocking up on essentials at warehouse prices, saving money on insurance (auto, life, etc), paying yourself first, etc). Additionally, he explains investment vehicles in simple layman terms while divulging his personal opinions. All of this is done in a humorous, witty and quick read...a pleasant surprise to those of us picking up Investment Guides. Tobias truly covers it all, from savings accounts, to options and everything in between such as treasuries and annuities. He also discusses the merits of self-directed investing. It is telling that he dedicated the book &quot;To my broker -- even if he has, from time to time, made me just that.&quot; This is a must read for those seeking entry-level knowledge of the ins and outs of investing or simply a witty read on the topic."},{"Title":"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need: Newly Revised and Updated","review":"Like The Millionaire Next Door, the utility of this book is that it emphasizes saving money, rather coming up with some brilliant investment to make you rich. If you don't save, you'll have nothing to invest. If you save and get a market return over a long period of time you'll amass a lot of money. Stop worrying about finding the next Microsoft, and start worrying about how to cut your expenses.

I recommend &quot;How to Buy Stocks&quot; by Louis Engel as a first step in learning the stock market terminologies and how it works. Then, read this book by Tobias. I beleive those two books are good enough for any first time investor"},{"Title":"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need: Newly Revised and Updated","review":"This book is always fresh, valuable and insightful: Partly because Andy Tobias updates the book whenever new technology or financial instruments appear that require serious consideration, and partly because he uses his own advice, and has done quite well. Mr. Tobias believes that each of us can control our future to become wealthier. He also believes that it is important to keep it simple. The joy of this book is that you can do all of your financial &quot;cooking &quot; with one reference. He covers stocks, real estate, IRAs, and a myriad of other investments. He is also humorous, fun and easy to read. He encourages us to invest ourselves, not to be &quot;stalled&quot; by thinking that professionals can always do better, or investing is too complicated, or you can never make real money anyway. To read more about these bad-thinking habits that hold you back and how to overcome them, you should read a new book by Donald Mitchell, Carol Coles and Robert Metz called The 2,000 Percent Solution.

It's aimed at the intelligent but beginning investor looking for practical advice and guidance on investing and money management. Although it does discuss buying options, day-trading, etc. readers looking for detailed comprehensive information and advice on these and similar topics probably should look elsewhere (or perhaps they should look here first-- after reading this book they might think twice about investing in more complicated schemes). For those looking for sound unbiased advice and information on basic investing and money management however this book will be very helpful. And as an added bonus, its actually fun and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need: Newly Revised and Updated","review":"If you are expecting to learn everything you need to know about investments from this book, you will probably be disappointed.

And now my only wish is to have some money to invest! I really enjoyed reading it and learned a lot. It's a great book for a beginner who wants to know more. If that's you, you'll be satisfied after you read it.Some things in life are worth the money. Today I save my money for those things. One of them is peace of mind. I read the book and incorporated its basic message into my daily life. Especially important is calculation of the value of saved money: a dollar (or Russian ruble) saved is one that has escaped taxes and the demands of living. As he puts it, a penny saved is two pennies earned. I remember this message as I walk through stores in Moscow. Now most of our stores in Russia are looking absolutely the same as in Western Europe.Enjoy the book and start enjoying saving! Informative as well as entertaining, this could be the best twelve bucks you'll ever spend. Andrew Tobias makes a good introduction reading about personal finance for everybody."},{"Title":"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need: Newly Revised and Updated","review":"I read the original and incorporated its basic message into my daily life: When you know how to save money, you free yourself. There are those who would make you think that consuming beyond your means is acceptable, even expected. Reading and remembering this book will help you protect yourself from believing them. Especially important is his calculation of the value of saved money: a dollar saved is one that has escaped taxes and the demands of living. As he puts it, a penny saved is two pennies earned. Saved money is pure payload; it is free to work for you. Budgeting does not diminish you, it frees the fruits of your labor from being consumed. I remember his message as I walk through stores, when I contemplate taking on consumer debt, when people try to make me feel embarrassed about being thrifty. Yes, some things in life are worth the money. I save my money for those things. One of them is peace of mind. Tobias reminds us that no matter how much we make, we have choices: what we buy, or not to buy at all; to master money, or let it be our master.By the way, Tobias is hilarious. I can't forget a line from the original classic, something like, &quot;Most futures traders wouldn't know a pork belly if they hit one with their car.&quot; Enjoy and start enjoying saving!"},{"Title":"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need: Newly Revised and Updated","review":"Andrew Tobias knows his stuff and he lays it out in clear and simple terms. Whether you know very little or a lot about investments this book is a good investment. To complete your financial library I would also recommend a book by NPR's Personal Finance Correspondent, Nancy Lloyd.In &quot;SIMPLE MONEY SOLUTIONS: 10 WAYS YOU CAN STOP FEELING OVERWHELMED BY MONEY AND START MAKING IT WORK FOR YOU&quot; Nancy puts on paper more of the savvy advice that she regularly shares with Bob Edwards on &quot;Morning Edition.&quot; While every one else in the financial press is telling consumers to switch from a credit card to a debit card, to stop writing checks and start using online bill-paying services, and to swap their credit card debit for a low-interest rate home equity loan, Nancy is the only one telling about the costly downsides and increased risks that you will take on with these money moves. Both books are eye openers."},{"Title":"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need: Newly Revised and Updated","review":"BOTTOM LINE - If you are new to finance buy this book. There is no better book that I have ever read on personal finance. This book covers it all; from buying in bulk to insurance to investing in under 300 pages. Better than that, Andrew Tobias is fun to read. I have given this title to many friends through the years, in large part because I feel very comfortable with the advice it contains.This is really a life guide to financial planning. There are bigger books, bigger names, and tons of approaches to finance. What I would say is this should be the 1st and maybe the only (if you hate finance) book to buy before making a major financial move."},{"Title":"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need: Newly Revised and Updated","review":"I'm just starting out learning about investing. This is the second book about money I read. I really enjoyed reading it and learned a lot. It's a great book for a beginner who wants to know more.

I'll keep this one on my bookshelf to look at again and again, though."},{"Title":"Sultans of Swing - The Very Best of Dire Straits (Fretted)","review":"This is a very good book with some of the most well-known songs by Dire Straits. The songs are in the right keys. I found that it was worth the price if only for the Romeo and Juliet tab. This song uses an alternate tuning that you won't find on free internet tabs. The only trick you have to know is to tune lower and capo at fret 3, then you're set to play it the way Mark Knopfler does. Of course, Dire Straits is recommended for, at least, intermediate guitarists. I put myself in that group. Advanced players will have fun on Sultans of Swing, Tunnel of Love and all soli. Some tablatures are less easy to read. They seem to come from magazines and the notation (bends, slides) is different. Unfortunately, the tabs are really for the Sultans of Swing compilation, i.e. shorter versions of the songs. For instance, many bars are missing for the beginning and last solo of Brothers in arms compared to the version of the eponymous album. Still, it's a lot of fun and practice, even for the rhythm chords."},{"Title":"Sultans of Swing - The Very Best of Dire Straits (Fretted)","review":"Not sure what the other person was smoking when reviewing this book, but must be a beginner to Dire Straits. This was very poorly done. In many places, the tabs are incorrect. It looks like the transcriber just did what they thought or liked rather than validate it. I would not have bought this book if I had known how wrong it was. I suppose on a plus note it provides an alternate method. Also, the print it too small.Don't buy the book. There are free tabs on the internet that are closer to the way it was played."},{"Title":"The Divine Mercy Message and Devotion: With selected prayers from the Diary of Saint Maria Faustina","review":"The message of Divine Mercy is a message meant for all people.This is a great little book. It has prayers, novenas, information about Sister Faustina, excerpts from the messages she received from Our Lord, and the history of the painting.It is a wonderful resource small enough to fit in your pocket or purse."},{"Title":"A Husband For Mama (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"In \\"Child of Her Heart\\", governess Caroline Morton returns home after 5 years abroad. Her charming French charge, Marguerite, injures her arm--and reunites Caroline with her former fiance. Reynaud (or \\"Reynie,\\" as Caroline used to call him) has missed Miss Morton, and must convince her that they are meant to be together--with a little bit of help from Marguerite. But first, Caroline must learn to accept her past... This story receives 4 stars from me. Interactions between Reynaud & Marguerite were sweet, and the characters were warm and convincing.In \\"Rescuing Captain Rocher\\", French sea captain Bastien Rocher finds he knows nothing about giving his daughter a proper come-out. His neighbor, Lady Anne Westhaven, is growing quite frustrated with her troublesome son. And while they don't get along at first, Rocher & Lady Westhaven eventually decide to join forces. Anne will chaperone his daughter, and the captain will give her son the disciplining he needs. ...Actually, I didn't really like this story. Within 20 pages, I think Anne & Marie (Bastien's daughter) had wept about 6 times. I prefer my heroines to have a bit more backbone. Also, I thought Bastien's character was fairly inconsistent. The only redeeming factor was the interesting brother-sister relationship between Marie & Matthew Westhaven (the son). 1 1/2 stars from me.In \\"A Mother at Heart\\", Julius Sutton never expected to be an earl. And he never expected his mother, who abandoned him 22 years ago, to show up at his doorstep. Since he stumbled into his fortune, Julius has had to deal with several money-hungry \\"supposed\\" relatives--none of which he believes. This woman is no different, he is convinced. She AND her pretty companion, Miss Charity Smith, are out to dupe him... even if the pretty chit is one of the most desirable females he's ever met. I give this story 4 stars as well. The ending was surprising and touching and very sweet. I would've liked to read it as a full-length novel, however.The cover & title of the novel are a bit misleading. The picture represents none of the stories. And only one lead female is actually a \\"mama.\\"Overall, the book is worth your time. Mostly sweet, cute & enjoyable. If you're looking for a quick, noncommital read--this is a good choice."},{"Title":"Blue Mound To 161","review":"A few years back I began seeing the name of \\"Garin Cycholl\\" in a number of small press publications. Maybe the unusual name grabbed my attention, but what I began to notice when I sat down and actually read the work is that Cycholl is one of those guys who has a million ideas, all of them generative; he's a whirlwind of energy, and the juice flows out of him with centrifugal speed. I wondered if he'd ever be able to put it together into one thing, one unified document. There are some poets, you know, who are mere flashes of energy, who strike with brilliant colors that don't manage to stick to the cave wall.With BLUE MOUND TO 161 Cycholl redeems his promise. It is an ambitious book that mixes Cycholl's interest in experimental narrative with the kind of analytic lyric that's all over Chicago these days. The American Midwest is where it's all happening now, and with BLUE MOUND Cycholl celebrates and locates this excitement within a regionalism that works like a magnifying glass: if you hold the glass with a steady hand to one patch of ground for a long enough period, pow, it goes up in flames. In this case, it's a close study of historical space a la WISCONSIN DEATH TRIP, with some of the investigative energy of Ed Dorn or Ed Sanders. What happened on this location? Can we still hear the voices? Not content with an aware, intense observation of the hills, grounds and grasses, Cycholl penetrates underneath the loam into the earth itself, with a delirious movement that puts one in mind of a Chicago Visconti.Blood has seeped into this soil, and perhaps Cycholl is reviving that blood, warming it with his hands, to raise the ghosts of the \\"thee Jonesboro girls\\" his poem mourns over and over again. Perhaps they lie in the blue mound of the title. As for \\"161\\" that's anybody's guess; I thought it was a highway, you know, like, maybe there's a Highway 161 running through Illinois. With his panoramic view, in which history sprawls out at any given time from both directions (past and future) it's hard to get your bearings. In \\"This Savage Land,\\" Cycholl writes, \\"which traveled better, religion or/ moonshine?/ / while a black wave/ on both sides/ pushed out onto the land.\\" Other poems cite specific buildings: one takes place in the high security federal prison at Marion, where Leonard Peltier, Ted Kaczynski, Manuel Noriega all sit in wait. Down in the coal mine a spritz of coal dust stains the air like the simple attestation: \\"I am a Christian man./ I have nothing to hide.\\"Good work all around, to Gariin Cycholl, to Pavement Saw Press, and to their Transcontinental Poetry Award which made possible this publication. It's strong--strong enough to break your heart."},{"Title":"The history of Detroit and Michigan: Or, the metropolis illustrated ; a chronological cyclopaedia of the past and present, including a full record of ... in Michigan, and the annals of Wayne county","review":"Very interesting book and an important addition to my personal collection on the history of Detroit and Michigan and about some of my ancestors who played such important roles when the French occupied the area."},{"Title":"Six Israeli Novellas (Verba Mundi)","review":"Each of the Novellas has a protagonist of unusual proportions, attempting to find something just slightly beyond himself or herself. While being a part of contemporary fiction, there is a certain historical perspective such as the disposed, wandering Jew of Aharon Appelfeld's &quot;The Isles of St. George.&quot; Almost alone on this island, he wants to forget Europe, Israel,and his past. One of the most interesting characters in my opinion is Yani in David Grossman's &quot;Yani on the Mountain.&quot; Here is a soldier left to oversee a mountain after the war of 1973. The mountain becomes a support, a challenge, something to be overcome, but his friend confronts him, &quot;Hiding uphere on the mountain--armoring himself with hostility and contempt. Afraid. Afraid..&quot; Benjamin Tammuz has one brother living his life vicariously through watching his brother's life unfold in a near-by house. &quot;The Brother&quot; is a thoughtful tale of envy, suppressed love, and hatred. In Yaakov Shabtai's &quot;Uncle Peretz Takes Flight&quot;, a zany Jewish communist wants to save the world (which he doesn't even like very much), attending meetings during the day and coming home to climb up on the roof in preparation for flight. Altogether, this is a wonderful collection of stories."},{"Title":"Brave Jimmy Stone","review":"This book helped my daughter age 7 to understand the importance of sacrifice of comfort for others.In society where children are only expected to preform well academically despite great lack in morals and character this book goes a far way and is a great read she could not get away from."},{"Title":"Ocean Circulation and Climate: Observing and Modeling the Global Ocean (International Geophysics)","review":"Being the manager of an EAS office in France (bureau d'&eacute;tude d'impact sur l'environnement), the book represent a great help for my work. Despite the price, all the datas are useful. From deep water to ocean surface circulation, from sattelite global observation to shipboard observation, you will miss no data, no equations and no methodology (that's the bestpart for my office). For people who want to work in this field of research, this book is a masterpiece. Not only for the professionnal qualities of the authors but for the synthesis of the WOCE.

LuAnn, Patricia and Toni each wrote a compelling and tantalizing story.

Ian Parker especially is having difficulty adding a romantic angle to his mystery series, but his fans are clamoring for his characters to get together, and the solution is to have bestselling romance writer Maxine Mitchell help him out. Of course Ian is reluctant, having met Ms. Mitchell previously and finding himself a little too taken with her for his peace of mind. Maxine is delighted to be working with Ian Parker. Not only is he like one of her sexy and brooding heroes, he also makes her hot, and that is an irresistible combination. Only they don't start out on the right foot, and the sparks fly all over the place. A rather intriguing bet kicks it up a notch, and you will fall in love with Ian right along with Maxie. Their romance is one dynamic collaboration that will have you longing for more.Anyone who's ever been to Vegas knows that \\"What Happens In Vegas\\" stays in Vegas. Patricia Ryan has created an intriging character in Jay Douglas, a high roller who's winning millions at the blackjack tables of casino owner Eddie Flynn. Flynn isn't too happy with Jay, and sends in sexy yet sweetly innocent Libby Thatcher to find out Jay's winning secrets. Libby is in a bind, and agrees to help out Eddie if he'll agree to her business deal. Only she doesn't count on being so drawn to Jay, and finds herself getting too involved. And Jay can't keep his concentration when Libby is in his zone. He finds himself unable to resist her, no matter how much he tries. A steamy encounter in the hot tub will definitely leave you breathless, not to mention Jay's ability to tie a decent knot. This is one resourceful hero, and Libby is a genuinely likeable heroine drawn to a man she must lie to against her better judgment.

Mia is a struggling artist who creates heavenly creatures filled with longing, a feeling she heself possesses for bar owner Rick Rose.

Yes it fell within the time frame, but it should have arrived sooner. I was just disappointed in how long it took to get here."},{"Title":"The case for modern man","review":"This book was published in 1955, when the horror and despair of two world wars, the Great Depression, and mass genocide were fresh memories, when democracy was still under full assault from warring ideologies and nuclear holocaust was a distinct possiblity. It was this era in which ideas attacking the liberal ideals of reason and progress and advocating irrationality and mystery gained large public following. The author summarizes some of the most convincing of these attacks, explains their attraction, and then exposes their fundamental flaws and contradictions. He redeems the liberal creed by showing it as unique among human notions in being able to effect real improvement in the human condition. And he examines why we are so susceptible to these attacks.This is a very interesting read, and a good exposition of many of the ideas that spawned much of the current cynicism towards the achievements of Western civilization and much of the animosity towards \\"liberals\\", to the point of this name being used as an insult."},{"Title":"Man and Superman: A Comedy and A Philosophy","review":"George Bernard Shaw was called, with good reason, the &quot;English Nietzsche&quot;. Though Nietzsche was an aristocrat and Shaw a socialist, both cherished the dream of the superman and looked forward to the day when he would be realised. Both, however, were characterised by their mordant wit and intellectual cynicism, in which &quot;Man and Superman&quot; abounds. Shaw manages to compress a number of disparate themes into a relatively taut dramatic format, even throwing in a scene in which Don Juan, the Devil and a gang of anarchist brigands make an appearance. The central event of the plot involves the wealthy Tanner, a member of the &quot;Idle Rich Class&quot; making himself subservient to the Life Force and seeking the perfect woman to marry, who would guarantee him a very special offspring, his ideal, the superman himself. Though Shaw was not known to have read the works of Bergson at that time, nor to have been conversant with his vitalist doctrine of the Life Force, his use of the Life Force motif and the philosophical underpinnings of the play attest to a pure Bergsonism. The most delightful part, however, is the &quot;Revolutionist's Handbook&quot; at the end, which contains Shaw's most scandalous anti-Establishment jibes. For instance, &quot;Do not do unto others as you would them do unto you. They might not have the same taste.&quot;"},{"Title":"Man and Superman: A Comedy and A Philosophy","review":"Shaw has packed many high-level topics into this play, while at the same time keeping long portions of the dialogue fairly low-level. Two topics jump out most frequently: hell and enjoyment. His take on each respective topic is fresh, seemingly from an entirely new perspective.In the third act, the characters' conversation stands out in a couple ways. The explanation of hell from Don Juan, the Statue, and The Devil's point of view is unique. From a Judeo-Christian standpoint, it reeks of blasphemy, twisting around the traditional views to show things as they really are: The devil finally gets to tell his side of the story; heaven is boring; anyone can go between the two afterlives whenever they please. What is interesting is that Shaw's hell can fit with the Judeo-Christian/Biblical facts, something that the blasphemy police certainly will not give any credence to or spend any time investigating. His idea that heaven and hell are created for those who are going there matches perfectly with Biblical theology. A person not living in the grace of Jesus would hate heaven just as much as a person living in his grace would hate hell. Biblical theologians would not agree (if one could get them to listen) that people can choose their own eternity, nor would they agree with the concept of non-believers enjoying themselves in hell, even if one could get them to voice their belief that they will be given over to all the desires of their flesh.What is fascinating about Shaw's hell is just that idea - that if life is about your passions and enjoyment (namely, the flesh) then your afterlife will be personal to those same passions and enjoyment. At this point, the conservative Judeo-Christians would be sharpening their inquisition equipment in a fervent rage because much of the play speaks to that idea of personal enjoyment during life, specifically the English. Don Juan says that humans live to try to understand life more but later adds to that idea by saying that understanding only helps us to know that we are enjoying ourselves. Life then becomes the pursuit of enjoyment, and hell mimics that pursuit as a sort of eternal amusement park. In a statement that seems like a pre-response to his opponent's case, Don Juan then says that although he spent his whole life looking for pleasure, he never found it. If it could ever happen, it is that response which could appease the frantic theologians. The devil, being the father of lies has pulled the eternal wool over everyone's eyes, both the living and the dead, and has gotten them to abandon their real purpose.Shaw's flirtation with both sides of the controversy is what allows this play such success. He angers both the proponents and opponents of Christian \\"myths\\" and then offers possible solutions to appease both sides.Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"Man and Superman: A Comedy and A Philosophy","review":"In this title, G.B. Shaw outdoes himself. Not only does he manage to turn up with a Don Juan play in our modern day and age, which is full of cynicism, and doesn't give in to 'medieval' codes of behaviour, but he even manages to turn around the table. Here, the hunter becomes the hunted, forced to flee from his pursued/pursuer. Shaw includes in this play an ingenious conversation between the original 15th century characters, which not only explains about Don Juan's philosophy, but shines a new light upon our own lives, here and today."},{"Title":"Man and Superman: A Comedy and A Philosophy","review":"I read this play after enjoying Pygmalion. Shaw creates a female lead who uses her femininity and supposed delicacy/cluelessness to manipulate those around her, ultimately trapping the Don Juan-esque male lead into marrying her despite his objections to the institution. Although she pretends to be helpless, she actually controls the situation, so I think this counts as a feminist work, although I'm confused about what his ultimate message is. I'm also not sure how the whole philosophy of the life-force, superman thing fits in, but I haven't read much philosophy, and I enjoyed the play regardless. Like all of Shaw's stuff, the play contains social commentary, humor, and wit."},{"Title":"Man and Superman: A Comedy and A Philosophy","review":"I appreciate some of what Shaw writes in his introduction, his propositions about relationships between men and women and the need to strive for a humanity that transcends baser human behavior and elevates the race above the current rabble. However, some classist and more-knowledge-able-than-thou language along with misguided eugenics seem to dilute his arguments. He mentions a handbook of the revolution following the play that will tell more. The free Kindle edition doesn't include the pamphlet, a big disappointment and likely an omission that may have improved my rating had it been included and had it added to what was said in the play.Earlier reviews mention that the play is hilarious and eye-opening. I didn't find the play funny. It starts out confusing, with two men being proposed as guardians for a grown woman whose father has died--one of the men is equal in age to her. The play consists of shallow elitists and stereotypical characters written so falsely that the message is nearly lost; perhaps I didn't catch the sarcasm. There is an absence of emotion towards each other; all are ruled by selfish desires and sentimentality with Shaw reducing every relationship to logic without emotion or empathy and little evidence of caring, compassion, or grace. I am still somewhat confused as to how Shaw proposes the way relationships with the potential to produce \\"Supermen\\" ought to be negotiated, but it seems he believes that subterfuge and pretense are favorable over mutual respect and shared goals. If he is being sarcastic, the sarcasm may be more distracting than illuminative.The play seems less a manifesto on how to advance humanity than it does an illustration of prejudicial attitudes towards women by fearful men at the pre-suffrage turn of the twentieth century, as well as a palliative for pious humans who strive to live in a way that might advance the species fearing consequences in the afterlife from a vengeful god. Given twenty-first century culture, this play, for me, has little to offer on current relationships between individuals, between classes, or between humans and their gods."},{"Title":"Man and Superman: A Comedy and A Philosophy","review":"This book was hilarious, and the concept was so true. I could see my friends in some of the characters.It seems that Shaw just couldn't resist showing us how crazy the human condition really is by his works that always include funny yet absolutely true twists on things, and his twist on the Don Juan tale is one of his best ones yet.This story was smart and funny. I loved it and wanted more when it was over. I'll have to buy another one of his books. I just love his style.I can't resist any chance I can get to peek into the mind of a genius, and Shaw was a true genius.

Shaw before nor have I read - though I am familiar with - Nietzsche's works; and, what's more, I was ignorant of the true Don Juan story (which plays an important role in 'Man and Superman') prior to sketching out the barest details from Shaw's introduction and cursory online research. In other words, I can't think of anyone less qualified to review Shaw's play than me. Woohoo! so here goes.There are four acts to 'Man and Superman' - the first, second and fourth consist of Shaw's comedic inversion of the Don Juan formula, used for effect to ridicule conventional ideas of the time about sex and relationships. The third act Shaw called \\"extraneous\\", though that's deceptive - Shaw had a philosophy he wanted to impart to the audience with this play, and the three acts surrounding the third are merely spoonfuls of sugar that help that philosophy go down. To further advance his ideas, there is a long letter to Shaw's contemporary and Times' theater critic, Arthur Bingham Walkley, that functions as an introduction; and an appendix in the form of a pamphlet - The Revolutionist's Handbook and Pocket Companion - facetiously authored by one of the cast of characters.The three comedy acts are still enjoyable today; as one who does not read much drama, I would say that 'Superman' reminded me a little of fellow Irishman Oscar Wilde's 'The Importance of Being Earnest', except perhaps a little less clever. Here the modern Don Juan, John Tanner, is pursued by the woman Ann Whitefield, instead of vice versa - but both sexes are really only unconscious puppets of the 'Life Force', which insistently demands they play the procreation role. The third act is a dream of the main character's - a long dialectical dream where the original Don Juan, his object of pursuit, her father, and the Devil meet in Hell to further discuss and elaborate on the nature of the 'Life Force'.The 'Life Force', says Don Juan to the Devil, has created in him a tool, a philosopher's brain, with the overwhelming urge now to know itself and its destination, rather than to follow the path of least resistance - in other words, it is for enlightened mankind to direct its own destiny, and from necessity to pull the masses up along with it. That necessity is a political one - \\"We must either breed political capacity (in the electorate),\\" says Shaw in his letter to Walkley, \\"or else be ruined by Democracy\\". He saw the work of reformers and progressives as insufficient, and even going so far as suggesting (in the words of the Revolutionary's Handbook) a State Department of Evolution to oversee matters. Before this could happen though, the ridiculous mores of Victorian society concerning sex and relationships had to be torn apart, and Shaw does his part by entertainingly lampooning and lambasting it in the comedic portions of the play. Once the romantic nonsense was swept away, the whole business could be conducted along more sensible lines, thus evolving the Superman. Otherwise, as willing or unwilling members of a democracy, the country would find itself at the whim of the 'swinish multitudes', or, the electorate.Well, anyone who is familiar with the 20th Century knows that creating supermen has so far proved to be a bad idea, and, as far as I can tell, repudiating the old customs associated with breeding has not brought overwhelming enlightenment to the masses. (Or refudiating, according to one of my companions in the swinish multitude). That a representative democracy is only as good as its public is, unfortunately, an inherent fact of the system. It may have looked tempting to try and improve that public by breeding - I only pray THAT particular method is permanently discredited.What is clear is that Shaw gives the Devil the most prescient lines of the play. \\"Beware of the pursuit of the Superhuman: it leads to an indiscriminate contempt for the human.\\" (I believe there are tens, if not hundreds, of millions of people from the last century who found this out firsthand.) Perhaps Shaw thought of this as the 'Devil's advocate' position, but since he more or less ends the third act with these lines indicates to me that he wasn't totally unaware of the dangers involved. Nevertheless, while the play - minus the third act, introduction and appendix - still reflects common habits (requirements?) between men and women today, so far, the empirical evidence of history weighs in against the idea of attempting to purposely breed a race of Supermen.Otherwise, I think Shaw is dead-on as he describes several primal instincts concerning sexual pursuit. Accurate, and perhaps a bit ruthless - one might even get the idea that Shaw had it in for women as a whole. There are also other conventions of his time that he attacks here, mostly involving class and privilege - but even though I think his points still apply, the framework of the problems have changed enough in the last hundred years to where his description of them is hard to transport to our modern situation. In the end, 'Man and Superman' is mostly interesting as a historical document - evidence of a mindset from the turn of the century, along with a mildly amusing entertainment.Also of note: At the end of the Revolutionary's Handbook is a lengthy list of aphorisms, such as \\"He who can, does. He who cannot, teaches,\\" and \\"Hell is paved with good intentions, not with bad ones.\\" Doubtless others on the list will be as familiar, and may be of interest to those who enjoy that sort of thing. Honestly, they seem self-congratulatory to me, but then I'm only part of the swinish multitude, so what do I know?This edition of the play is in the trade paperback format, and includes only the letter, the play, and the handbook. It is completely acceptable if this were the only play by Shaw that one wanted, though there are other collections that include more than one play and some commentary also, and surely for less than the cost of this edition."},{"Title":"Man and Superman: A Comedy and A Philosophy","review":"As a woman I have to agree with Shaw's theory to some extent. I've seen a lot of women chase after rogues they've perceived to be strong. The nesting instinct is a strange thing, causing women to desire the men least likely to settle down. Shaw takes this theory and runs with it producing a hilarious and thought provoking masterpiece with engaging characters entangled in the most interesting and entertaining situations.Shaw is my favorite of the Victorian playwrights. His works were revolutionary in many ways. Use of humor was rare and exceptional for playwrights during that era, but Shaw was not afraid to make audiences laugh. He also tackled serious moral, political, and social issues in his plays at a time when sappy dramas were all the rage. He was truly bold and innovative and greatly contributed to dramatic art. He had an amazing gift, the ability to make people think while simultaneously making them laugh.Reading Shaw's works are a genuine treat. All of his plays are fabulous. His characters are memorable, and his humor is brilliant.This is a wonderful book, charming, significant, and insightful.

There's plenty of comedy to be found in romantic attraction and Shaw manages to find all of it. Though it's a very humorous work, there's also a serious message that will leave every reader with something to think about.George Bernard Shaw created numerous masterpieces over the span of his writing career. He has the distinction of being the only person to ever be awarded both an Oscar and the Nobel Prize for Literature. He was a very humble and conscientious man, a political activist and a vegetarian. His conscientiousness shows in his work by his inability to write meaningless fluff at a time when fluff dominated the stage. His trademark is his classic use of ample humor in dramas with serious subject matter. It takes a special kind of genius to be able to pull that off as flawlessly as he did."},{"Title":"Man and Superman: A Comedy and A Philosophy","review":"This review is for the 1962 Heritage edition in the brown pebbled slipcase.Heritage really went to town with their edition of Man and Superman.

He crafts modern relationships using powerful mother, father, daughter, son, the loved and the rebuffed to allow us to reflect on our current state. This book contains clasic elements of a Don Juan dream, a &quot;road trip&quot; and an entire handbook written by one of Mr. Shaws main characters. The Don Juan dream is one in which the battle of the sexes is answered and shown to be a facade for an agenda that we perpetuate, but do not control or often acknowledge. The &quot;road trip&quot; appears to be the original of much of what we've experienced in Jack Kerouac's writings and see in our modern movies.The handbook allows Mr. Shaw to express his own ideas as those of his character. This provides some insulation from any contemporary criticism that may have come his way. This work, more so than any other, provides a wonderful avenue to Mr. Shaw's personal philosophy that can lend insight to his other works. It truly can be said that this book &quot;has it all&quot; with something for everyone.

It's unfortunate that whoever put this book together did not include \\"The Revolutionist Handbook,\\" whose authorship the playwright ascribes to the lead character of the play. That said, let's move on to what this book is and what it is not.The reviewing moaners' main beef is that the play \\"does nothing for them,\\" and \\"is out of date,\\" and only \\"works within a tiny niche,\\" and on and on. The play is billed as a comedy and a philosophy. I suppose the whiners expected to be enlightened - mostly about themselves, no doubt, and shown ways to \\"improve themselves\\" (i.e. to get ahead, probably at the expense of others, or at least to get an explanation why they're not getting ahead (because others get in the way, the bastards, stealing their thunder, or whatever).

Plays can be uplifting, life-affirming, spiritually edifying, but philosophy is a totally different genre.Shaw's introduction is very entertaining. The play is brilliant, and also very entertaining. The philosophical aspect included in both the introduction and the play is total nonsense (it's very funny, though. I love Shaw's nonsense). That's because each new philosophical paradigm becomes dated very quickly (in about ten years) and becomes total nonsense thereafter. Man and Superman was written more than a hundred years ago. Are you kidding me?So why is the play brilliant? Why should you read it? Because it is, and because you really should. The characters, the action, the conversation, the conflict, the doubt, the \\"Don Juan in Hell\\" scene - all that is great theatre. Very entertaining. Very life-affirming. Very edifying.

Yet, the book faults Prime Minister Nehru of India primarily for provoking and then mis-managing the war. The book is a damning account of the ineptitude of top Indian political leadership in strategic matters. India, facing all the disadvantages of terrain, chose to pursue a 'Forward Policy' of establishing indefensible flag posts that could only be supplied by air, against a world-class PLA land army that held the advantage of a well-connected road network throughout some of the most inhospitable terrain in the world. After refusing to enter into meaningful negotiations on defining the border, Nehru pursued this myopic policy because he foolishly deluded himself into believing that the Chinese would be unwilling to enforce their territorial claims by force of arms. In the end, the war broke out at in a narrow Himalayan valley that could not possibly have been any more disadvantageous for Indians -- the Chinese positions overlooked a denuded, unready Indian infantry brigade which lacked ANY ARTILLERY SUPPORT WHATSOEVER, that was THREE WEEKS away from the nearest Indian roadhead by foot across high mountain passes and thick tropical forests, and supplied exclusively by erratic air drops. The Chinese, by contrast, had a 7-ton roadhead barely a few hours walk away. The book also severely castigates the Indian political leadership for interfering with the functioning of the military in matters of promotions of senior officers. The end result was that by 1962 the Indian General Staff had become mere supplicants of their political masters, and unable to counter impossible strategic/tactical demands with an objective, professional military analysis. Thus, senior military officers at the general staff level (who had never held major combat commands before) were often making decisions for individual battalions or companies -- all the while not protesting against the impossible demands being made of them. Another excellent account of the military aspect of the battle at Thag La is 'Himalayan Blunder' by Brigadier JP Dalvi -- the beleagured brigade commander who was given impossible orders to assault well-defended Chinese positions at an altitde ranging from 14,000 feet to 18,000 feet with no air/artillery support, roughly 3 battalions spread over 12 miles, and only 50 rounds of pouch ammunition per man! Thus, did David take on Goliath."},{"Title":"Veto procedures (House Research information brief)","review":"London TIMES reporter Nevile Maxwell wrote this book solely based on the declassified documents from India's Defense Department.

The book was based on the declassified documents from India's Defense Department. Contrary to the common believe that China was the aggressor, the war actually happened because of Nehru's agressive but foolish Northern-advance policy in the believe that China, while politically isolated from the world community, will never resist India's advancement. The loss of war by india was assured by an incompetent and ill prepared Indian army. Although China has won the war, but she nevertheless has suffered tremendous propaganda defeat and was portrait as an agressor trying to take advantage of the &quot;peace-loving Democratic India&quot; by the world news media. Solely based on information from India, there was absolutely no material was obtained from Chinese sources."},{"Title":"Veto procedures (House Research information brief)","review":"This book is definitely one of the best book I've ever read about a limited war between two countries. While I don't think the author has any bias against India, as one of my fellow reviewers suggests, I believe other reviewers have already discussed the merits of this book. I would only like to add three points in this discussion:1. It is really sad that the UK's imperalism/colonailism haunts these two countires even after withdrawing from India. The MaMahon line is not a written agreement between UK &amp; Chinese (Ching dynasty) governments but a product of some irresponsible officials in India &amp; Tibet. The UK government should have the ultimate blame for the whole debacle.2. It reminds us that how media can affect our point of view so easily. We must beware of our inherent assumption about the righteousness of a democratic government.3. In view of Nehru's statement about &quot;driving out the enemy&quot;, recent Indian leaders' decalration that China is still the biggest threat for India, I think these Indian leaders should concentrate on improving the life their people instead of fabricating an emeny from these agressive statements."},{"Title":"Veto procedures (House Research information brief)","review":"Since the book tells the truth of Nehru's government's foolishness, arogance, adventurism and opportunist mentality, this otherwise excellent book however was not very popular in India, even to this date.The disputed McMahon Line was a unilateral imaginary line drawn by the British colony authorities without the awareness of the Chinese and without consulting to the Chinese government. Therefore it was not challenged by the Chinese government before British withdraw from India in 1947. During Nehru's rein, he foolishly pursue the so called &quot;Forward Policy&quot; to take effective control the territory and border that the British imagined and wished to establish. But China in 1962 is no longer the China 1897 under Ching Imerial dynasty who was unable to exercise a strong protection of her own territory. Now Nehru faced with was a formidable Chinese Red Army (PLA) who was battle hardened and had just defeated Chiang Kai-Sheik in 1949 and have fought a war at par with the US army in Korea (1950-1953). Nehru foolishly believed China has no will to defend her territory by force. Therefore Nehru advanced to McMahon Line and tresspassed it. The &quot;Forward Policy&quot; inevitably provoked the Chinese garrison force and the war was erupted inevitably. Although the Chinese has tried to settle this by negotiations, but it was flatly refused bny Nehru's government. The result is the illprepared Indian force suffered humiliating defeat on both west and east fronts. The war however was stopped by a surprising Chinese unilateral withdraw back to the north of McMahon Line. The rest, is history.Neville Maxwell's book was the result of his extensive research of the Indian Defense Department's archive. It sould be noted that Maxwell was unable to access the records from the Chinese side. So how could it be biased against India? For the reason along, how could it be said he was a Indophobe and a Sinophile? For a loser who does not learn from his mistakes and admit his own failure and shortcomings, a bigger disaster is waiting to happen."},{"Title":"Veto procedures (House Research information brief)","review":"This book provides disturbing and damaging insight, and challenges the prevailing view popular in India and in the west about the Sino-Indian border war of 1962. There were significant negative consequences for India on account of a reckless and short-sighted policy that was far removed from ground realities. The book has two important shortcomings. One is that it is based solely on declassified information made available to the author from the Indian side. Two is that the author, for want of an additional perspective (that was not made available to him from China), exhibits what seems like a slightly anti-India bias (for want of a better word, but may really a result of not having access to any information from the Chinese side). That, however, does not and should not detract from the essential merits of the book. It is very well-written, insightfully researched, and extensively quoted and documented. The author does interpret a number of events and the intentions of the key players, but the author's reasoning and logic are all compelling and plausible. My feelings at the end of the book was one of anger and angst toward the Indian leaders and some of the generals, and to think that the fates of nations and their people are left in the hand of the less than competent makes me even more angry.

A must read for all students of international relations."},{"Title":"Veto procedures (House Research information brief)","review":"I don't think the book is biased against India, expecially after reading much materials about this war from Chinese side.This book is exclusively based on documents from Indian side, so inevitably adopt many Indian assertations. for example, It claims that Indian army in this war was outmanned and outgunned by Chinese. In fact, the two army of both sides are of roughly the same size. Since China got many more strong neighbours and enemies than India, She has to maintain large forces on the border of Soviet Rassia, on the border of Korean in preparation for the possible invasion of US force, and on the southeast coast to watch Taiwan, who always threat to recover the mainland.How can Chinese outmanned Indian on the desolate Tibetan plateau?another wrong Indian assertation in this book is that they believe Chinese army are better supplied in the war. If we simply have a look of a map we would easily know the Indian side of the border is mostly plain, while Chinese side is the vast mountainous Tibetan plateau.It's much more difficult to build roads on Chinese side (in fact there is no railway cuts into Tibet even nowadays, 2004). Indian army could be supplied by air, the Chinese actually were supplied by men and mules.The author could have easily know this point if he got chance to read some Chinese documents about the war."},{"Title":"Veto procedures (House Research information brief)","review":"The book reveals a surprising fact that the British had secretly redrawn the Indo-China boundary without Chinese agreement. Moreover,When the British relinquished the Indian Empire in 1947, they started to translate the McMahon Line from the maps as the effective northwest boundary of India, despite that the Line appeared on its maps only ten years before. As the British departed, the new Indian government assured that they would complete their work: &quot;If anything, they intended to pursue an even more forward policy than had the British.&quot;I can't believe that we were all fooled by the media. India, not China was the aggressor!"},{"Title":"Veto procedures (House Research information brief)","review":"Recently, India and China, the two most populous nations on the planet, have taken significant steps to improve a bilateral relationship deeply scarred by a 1962 war centering over a territoral dispute in an area bordering Chinese-annexed Tibet. This thaw in relations may reflect a generational shift in both countries since this dispute. It is not entirely surprisingly that press commentary on these events, notably in India, has also revived attention to this book published in 1970 by British journalist Neville Maxwell which focuses on the 1962 war which had since scarred relations between the two Asian giant.Anyone who has not read this book, but has an interest in the future relationship of these two Asian powers, should read it, if only because it remains one of the most important, albeit somewhat controversial, reference on the Sino-Indian conflict.Maxwell's account of this dispute is held by some observers, including many Indians I have talked to, to be biased against India, particularly as Maxwell (described in at least one Indian paper as a notroious Indophobe and Sinophile) has written QUOTE Indians will be shocked to discover that, when China crushed India in 1962, the fault lay at India, or more specifically, at Jawaharlal Nehru and his clique's doorsteps. It was a hopelessly ill-prepared Indian army that provoked China on orders emanating from Delhi, and paid the price for its misadventure in men, money and national humiliation UNQUOTEIt is timely to reintroduce this book and the controversy surrounding it, since any improvement in this relationship is likely to be mediated by a new generation in both countries, and to involve a generation outside both countries, which did not live through the 1962 conflict."},{"Title":"Veto procedures (House Research information brief)","review":"In 1962, there was a brief but sharp border war between India and China. Since this conflict took place at the height of Cold War and coincided with the onset of the Cuban missile crisis, it was reported in the Western press as another case of a Communist country attacking a peaceful nation. The truth was far different.Neville Maxwell, an Australian, was posted in New Delhi in 1959 as a South Asia correspondent of the Times and therefore was on the scene prior to and at the time of the conflict. In 1967, he returned as a senior fellow from the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, this time as a scholar. Therefore, he had a unique perspective both as a journalist and as a scholar. His definitive book, India's China War, set the record straight once and for all. Ironically, in a country claiming to be a democracy, India banned his book. The truth was just too inconvenient. However, it was read by Henry Kissinger, who recommended it to President Nixon. When Nixon met Premier Chou En-Lai in his historic visit to China in 1972, he told the Chinese Premier that he finally and fully understood the truth of the conflict. Nixon, by the way, thought Chou was the greatest statesman of his era. Chou, however, complained to Nixon that Nehru was by far the most difficult and arrogant person he has ever dealt with."},{"Title":"Veto procedures (House Research information brief)","review":"The book stays almost unknown in the U.S. only because it provides solid evidences of how aggressive India was. It is an offense to those see China as a demon and India as an angle of democracy."},{"Title":"Veto procedures (House Research information brief)","review":"Forty years ago, the Indian nation was convulsed by fear and eventual humiliation as its army was vanquished by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in a bitter and cold battle in the Northeast. Forty years later, India has repaired its relationship with the Chinese to some extent, but those wounds have not been forgotten. Excuses have been thrown up for the military debacle. India was ill prepared; it believed in non-violence; it trusted the Chinese and in 'Hindi-Chini bhai bhai'. Fingers have been pointed, most famously at then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, defence minister Krishna Menon, and Lieutenant General B N Kaul, who was in charge of the army on India's eastern frontier. After the war, India claimed that China was occupying about 33,000 square kilometres of its territory in the Aksai Chin region of Ladakh. China claimed that India was occupying 90,000 square kilometres; Beijing claims the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh as its territory.Forty years later, few know the real story of what happened, what went wrong. Successive governments have refused to release the Henderson-Brooks report that investigated the lapses of 1962. Though the two Asian giants have tried to mend their relations over the decades, several issues remain unresolved: the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile in India; China's non-recognition of Sikkim's merger with India; the nuclear tests in 1998 by India; and India's allegation that China is arming Pakistan, including the latter's nuclear programme. And now, in August 2009, relations between the two countries are again deteriorating....given the latest reports (August 2009) that the stand-off between India and China over a little-known region of the Himalayas could seriously damage ties between the Asian giants. China continues to lay claim to much of Arunachal Pradesh, a mountainous Indian province on the country's north-eastern extremity, and strategic experts in New Delhi are now warning that tensions in the remote border region are on the rise. India-China border tensions have escalated in recent months and it appears that more aggressive border patrolling by Chinese forces including incursions into Indian territory has forced the Indian army to bolster its presence along the 3500-kilometre border. Representatives from both governments held an inconclusive round of talks over the disputed border in New Delhi in early August 1009. A day after these talks, India's foreign policy establishment was rattled by Indian media reports that a think tank linked to the Chinese military had called for India to be split into 30 independent states. The paper said that if China ''takes a little action, the so-called great Indian federation can be broken up''. This would be in China's interests and lead to more prosperity in the region, it said, according to reports. Countries friendly to China like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal could help ''different nationalities'' such as Tamil and Kashmiri people so that they can establish independent nation states of their own.The Indian Government took the article so seriously it issued a statement saying the two countries had agreed to ''resolve outstanding issues, including the boundary question, through peaceful dialogue and consultations, and with mutual sensitivity to each other's concerns''. Feathers were again ruffled in Delhi in early August 2009 when the Indian media said Google satellite maps mysteriously showed the names of several towns in Arunachal Pradesh in Mandarin, not English or Hindi, making it appear the region was part of China. There was further tension two months ago when Beijing objected to a $US60 million ($71.3 million) Asian Development Bank loan to India for a project in the territory China claims. The disputed border follows the ''McMahon Line'' drawn up in 1914 when the British ruled India. Beijing does not recognise this demarcation and claims a large portion on the Indian side of the border, including the town of Tawang, the birthplace of the Dalai Lama. In June the Governor of Arunachal Pradesh and former army Indian chief, retired general J.J. Singh, said up to 30,000 new troops would be deployed in the region. In June a state-run newspaper in China accused India of ''unwise military moves'' along the Arunachal Pradesh border.The author of this book, Neville Maxwell, an Australian was born in 1926 and educated at McGill University and Cambridge University. He joined The Times as a foreign correspondent in 1955 and spent three years in the Washington bureau. In 1959 he was posted to New Delhi as South Asia correspondent. Over the next eight years he traveled from Kabul to East Pakistan to Kathmandu to Ceylon, reporting in detail on the end of the Nehru era in India and on post-Nehru developments. In 1967 he went as a senior fellow to the School of Oriental and African Studies in London in order to write India's China War. He was with the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at Oxford University at the time when his work India's China War was published in 1971. In a Rediff Special \\"Remembering a War\\", the editorial wrote: \\"No account of the 1962 war (between India and China) would be complete without Neville Maxwell's authoritative analysis.\\"Mr. Maxwell's book was the first detailed account of the events surround-ing the dispute and to date probably the best as there's not to much published and easily available on this was. His thesis is that India, and not China, was largely responsible for the deterioration in Sino-Indian border relations after 1959,and that it was directly responsible for the fighting of October, 1962. The detail of Maxwell's research and his use of confidential documents that he obtained from Indian sources to substantiate details is impressive. His account of the day-to-day moves by the Indian military leading up to the futile attack on the Chinese in the Dhola Strip area is a classic in historical suspense. Maxwell wrote for The Times (the UK paper) from New Delhi during the 1962 fighting and was the only correspondent there who refused to accept uncritically the official Indian account of events. This led to his virtual expulsion from the country.At the time of the war in 1962, Beijing had all but declared openly it would renounce its not inconsiderable claim to the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA), by far the largest and most valuable of the territories in dispute. Its claim to the Aksai Chin region in the west seemed strong, and it was clearly moving towards an Aksai Chin/NEFA exchange as a basis for settling the dispute. India however, rejected this highly favourable proposal, and demanded a complete Chinese evacuation of the Aksai Chin. To validate its claimto the area its historians produced an obviously false quotation from a British proposal to China in 1899. During 1962 India began openly tomove troops into the disputed territory to force the Chinese from positions they already occupied. Chinese protestations that this would inevitably lead to serious clashes were ignored. The Chinese argument that an evacuation of the Aksai Chin should in all fairness be matched by an Indian evacuation of the NEFA was dismissed. This in itself was remarkable enough, but Nehru then decided to go one step further and drive the Chinese out of territory to which India could not conceivably have any claim. At the western end of the McMahon Line which separates India and China in the NEFA there is a small wedge of territory known as the Dhola Strip. It was clear from the maps available before the fighting, and from the original of the McMahon Line circulated by the Chinese after the fighting began, that the area lay to the north of the McMahon Line. Even on the basis of co-ordinates given by the Indians the strip lay in Chinese territory.Two small criticisms of Maxwell's book should be made. He seems to ignore the Indian point about differences in the Chinese 1956 and 1959 maps of the claimed Aksai Chin frontier. True, India at the time did not make an issue of this; it was claiming the whole Aksai Chin and, just as China did not make an issue of India's misquotation of the 1899 proposal because it did not want to imply approval of the proposal, Delhimade only brief mention of the map differences. The Chinese denied there were differences. But one of the more rational explanations - in fact the only rational explanation - hinges on the 1956 map: India's move to patrol behind the Chinese 1959 line of control in the Aksai Chin was a reaction to an unjustified change in the 1956 claim line. Of course, if India genuinely believed the Chinese to have cheated it should have taken up the Chinese 1962 offer for negotiations. The adamant Indian refusal of these negotiations undercuts Indian protestations of innocence and injury.The other point is Maxwell's interpretation of Nehru's motives. There is much evidence that Nehru up till 1959 genuinely favoured Chou En-lai's compromise proposal for an Aksai Chin/NEFA exchange and was trying to prepare Indian public opinion. Why else would he have publicly cast doubt on India'sAksai Chin claim, as he did in the Lok Sabha during 1959? Alter theT ibetan fighting and subsequent border clashes, however, he seems to have lost control of the situation and allowed himself to be swept along by the intense and irrational nationalistic passions generated throughout the country. Maxwell's dissection of these passions is the major contribution of his book.With all the above in mind, Maxwell's book from 1971 is probably the only reasonably easily available publication on the background and history of this dispute over the India-Chinese border, which resulted in the little-know border war of 1962. The 1962 war was rather decisively lost by the Indians for a number of reasons, foremost being they didn't expect and weren't prepared to fight a war. Usual story when politicians without a military background get involved in these kind of disputes. The background to the whole dispute is complex and goes back to the British Raj, Imperial China and Tibet and it isn't quite as simplistic as those reviewers looking at this book from an obviously nationalistic perspective would have you believe. Maxwell does however explain the background very well indeed. The book itself is largely based on extensive research of the Indian Defense Department's archive - for obvious reasons, Chinese archives were not available to the author. That said, the book covers the whole dispute and it's background very capably, and in light of the current rising tensions it's a good familiarisation read.A number of other reviewers have taken issue with the author on various points. Such as the Indian Army being the same size as the Chinese and on relative supply lines. Suffice it to say the author is correct and the reviewers are incorrect as anyone with even a modicum of actual military experience will recognize after reading the book and checking out some maps (and having been in the Himalayas on a number of occassions, the maps don't do the terrain justice - think standing a on ridge with your buddy beside you and taking a photo between his knees looking straight down at the valley floor 3,000 feet below - that kind of terrain, and that's just the foothills). While the Armed Forces of both countries were comparable in size, the Indians on the ground in the actual conflict were severely outnumbered and outgunned. Given the lengthy supply lines of the Indian Forces (in some cases seasonal, in other cases by air) while the chinese had built military roads almost to the front, the chinese had a major logistical advantage. And very likely still do - keeping in mind the problems the Indians had a few years ago dealing with the Pakistani incursion into Kashmir. The book itself is rather critical of the Indian handling of the dipsute and the war, and with good reason. Here's hoping history doesn't repeat itself and that saner heads prevail.Over books on the Sino-Chinese War and associated border conflicts include:War at the Top of the World: The Struggle for Afghanistan, Kashmir and Tibet, Revised EditionTibet, China and India, 1914-50: A History of Imperial DiplomacyThe China-India border: The origins of the disputed boundaries (Chatham House essays;no.2)The Kashmir Problem; a Historical SurveyHimalayan Blunder: The Angry Truth About India's Most Crushing Military DisasterWar in High Himalaya: The Indian Army in Crisis, 1962"},{"Title":"Veto procedures (House Research information brief)","review":"1) Nobody denies that Nehru was one of the most incompetent leaders India had the misfortune to be governed by. However to blame him for the war, as the author does, is unfair.2) Nehru is recognized for his inability to defend India's territory against Chinese aggression. He is known to have made several wrong decisions that led to India's complete defeat in the war. He is not KNOWN to have caused the war. To compare him with a psychopath like Chairman Mao is doing him a great disservice. Mao is to be compared with the likes of Hitler, Stalin or Papa Doc. Not by any stretch of imagination; Nehru. Incompetent, skirt chaser,stupid, vain, bed-hopper - Yes. Pure Evil like Mao- NO. To attribute that India took onChina and refused to negotiate with Chinese is not believable. To expect that diplomacy can work with someone like Mao is simply hilarious.3) To implicate that Tibet was an integral part of China (historically) is also wrong as many authors have already pointed out. And that Tibetans \\"welcomed\\" the invasion is an unacceptable gaffe of epic proportions. To say, that India forcibly occupied Tawang under heavy Tibetan \\"protest\\" is another piece of fiction. Even as I write this review, two youngsters in that unfortunate land self-immolated themselves.4) If China is so Miss Goody two-shoes, then how come it has territorial disputes with countries like Japan with which it shares no physical border?I wouldn't be surprised if this so-called writer was Kim Phelby's clone ( for Chinese).Believing this book, is dishonoring the Dead Tibetans who are giving up their lives everyday under Chinese Tyranny.

One is a framing story of an elderly Church of England pastor newly assigned to a rather remote area of the Australian outback and his efforts to minister to a flock that is literally spread over an area larger than many states. Nevil's description of the area and people in this area both during the dry season and 'in the wet' is startlingly full of life, a fine portrait that does much to illustrate some of Nevil's social commentary, which creeps in almost from the side, rarely directly presented. But from this everyday world, we move to a totally different one as our priest, suffering from malaria induced fevers and hallucinations, is forced by circumstance to minister to an old, dying drunkard, Stevie. In trying to learn about Stevie's past, we enter the world of the future, as Stevie's half-incoherent words combine with the priest's inner hallucinations to form the story of David Anderson, an Australian pilot chosen to fly the personal aircraft of the Queen.This vision of the future shows an England of near total socialism, sadly depopulated by emigration to other Commonwealth countries, poorly ruled and near bankrupt, questioning the value of supporting the royal family. Opposing this are the pictures of Canada and Australia as vibrant, growing economies, and where one of the key differences in government is the idea of individuals being able to earn more than the basic one vote, available to everyone, by education, military service, public service, travel, and by special dispensation (i.e. 'The Queen's Favor). Supposedly this form of enfranchisement has led to better, more efficient government - whether it really would is an obvious topic for debate.What is intriguing about this is just where Nevil got events right and where his vision diverged from what really happened. Little things like his prediction that Christmas Island would be turned over to Australian governance in 1961 (actual was 1958) and his portrait of a middle-aged Queen Elizabeth (startlingly accurate) and major things like his prediction of England's economic sharp decline and turn towards socialism show just how in tune with the times Nevil was. At the same time, his predictions on technology were sadly off the mark, the 'security' procedures surrounding the Queen are almost laughably inadequate when seen from today's viewpoint, and he took the problems of England too far, not foreseeing its eventual recovery from losing its empire.Lying atop all of this is a finely told love story between David and Rosemary, a secretary to the Queen. Nevil's characterization is always very strong, and his ability to show a slowly developing attraction is highly realistic and satisfying. And just under the surface is some commentary on issues of race, as David is one-quarter abo, and commonly goes by his nickname of 'Nigger'. Nevil is clearly pointing out the invalidity of judging people by race, and by extension he makes the point that all 'class' distinctions are artificial and, in the long run, detrimental. In presenting this point, he shows some of the treatment of the 'servant' class in ways that may offend some modern sensibilities, but his portrayal is very accurate for the times.The last portion of the book gets into a metaphysics where all religions have a validity and circles back to the book's starting point, providing much food for thought well beyond the parameters of his envisioned future.Each of the above items adds to the total of this very strong book, a book that has been sadly neglected and out of print for a long time. It is very encouraging to see most of Nevil's works being brought back into print in the last couple of years, as almost all of his works are deserving of a read, this one especially so."},{"Title":"In the wet","review":"Nevil Shute captured some wonderful ideas about balancing the power of governance. In his new utopian community, created as a result of the horrific expense of maintaining the &quot;royals and their lifestyle&quot; should be explored for implementation in the U.S. By Shute's plan every man and woman received a birthright vote. However, you could add votes, up to a maximum of 4 (total votes to be cast = 5) by the following: (1) if you owned property -- I believe this was a requirement in early history. (2) If you completed a certain level of education -- presumably public high school (3) If you served your country in the Armed Forces, and (4) reserved for very special situations, like the Congressional Medal of Honor or the Nobel Peace Prize. With all of our computer technology this seems to make great sense to vest the governance of our country with those who have, mostly by their own efforts, contributed more than just being born and having a birthright vote."},{"Title":"In the wet","review":"Nevil Shute has the most emotionally compelling writing styles I've ever encountered. &quot;In the Wet&quot; is a odd and lovely example of this. Without ever being maudling, in a quiet, understated way Shute weaves a beautiful combination of feeling and character.&quot;In the Wet&quot; takes place in the Australian Outback. One can feel the heat, the dust, then the rain and the mud, as well as vividly seeing and being part of the scenery. The story is that of a Church of England parson well past his prime running a church in a very remote and widespread area. He's a practical man, acknowledging that &quot;wrong isn't always wrong&quot; in the Outback. He encounters a dying man who takes him on a trip through reincarnation, telling the tale of the life the man will live his next time around.As science fiction the book is severely outdated, yet--I've found this works well with the bomb classics like Shute's &quot;On the Beach&quot;--if you read it more as alternate history rather than a look to the future (the 'future' is the 1970s in this case) you'll be able to enjoy the wonderful writing, well-rounded characters, and the solidly crafted plot."},{"Title":"In the wet","review":"As a dying man drifts towards death in the Australian Outback (it takes place in the rainy season, thus, \\"In the Wet.\\"), he tells an odd tale to a Church of England clergyman, of a pilot in 1980's Britain (the novel, written in 1952, is set in 1952) The story: David Anderson, a quarter-Aboriginal Australian pilot, is selected to fly for Queen Elizabeth, in a world where a sizable portion of the British people has emigrated, primarily to Canada and Australia. The remaining British have become \\"red\\",....Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the novel is the \\"multiple vote\\", which, when it was mentioned at the last SF convention I attended, immediately provoked a half-hour debate. Democracy has been modified, leading to the possibility of earning additional votes in elections...OK, so Shute didn't forsee the rise of republicanism in Australia and the Parti Quebecois in Canada. And television is mentioned exactly once, there's no satellite transmissions, and a lot of other similar difficulties. All the same, Shute provides an interesting political novel/love story for us.I withhold a fifth star on this one because I don't find the character of David Anderson believable. This guy's supposed to be a quarter-Abo born in a ditch who came up through the ranks. He talks like an Oxford grad, and knows a fair number of polysyllables. Not only this, the quarter-Abo, discussing how the Queen should allocate her time if all was fair, discusses the proportion based on the overall population of the Commonwealth, and based on the white (!) population. Shute should have avoided these obvious howlers."},{"Title":"In the wet","review":"This is definitely one of Shute's best novels, His accurate portrayal of post war Britain to his vision of the British Commonwealth was excellent. He made the the characters and the country of Austrialia come alive and like most of his books I had a hard time putting it down. In The Wet was the the first Shute book I read and it is still one of my favourites."},{"Title":"In the wet","review":"This is a wonderful book; it has instantly joined my personal top ten. Beautifully written, in the straightforward enconomical storytelling style which Shute mastered, it is several stories within a story, with wonderful historical accents, delicate interplay between Australian and English culture, a spicy dose of politics, a tender love story, and even some farsighted future gazing (the story was written in 1952)."},{"Title":"In the wet","review":"Although some of Nevil Shute's work is created using a fairly large canvas (one thinks of \\"A Town Like Alice,\\" more than any other), most of his novels are simple tales about everyday life. The trick, or real art, which they demonstrate, is in showing us a slice of that ordinary world we think we all know, as though it were the most normal thing in the world, and then bringing out the oddity that is never far below the surface. So \\"In the Wet,\\" one of his more imaginative novels, takes us bit by bit into the remote parts of tropical northern Australia, building up tiny details from characters and race days and scraps of conversation, until the real story, hidden just below the surface, begins to emerge. Shute, whose background is very much that of an experimental scientist with oil on his hands, is never more impressive than when he leads the unsuspecting reader through the mundane material world that we think we see, onto another plane altogether. Not afraid in the least of exploring spirituality, Shute acts as an intelligent, well-informed guide for the reader on a voyage of discovery. Never intruding on the narrative, yet masterfully keeping it in rein, he is an author whose novels have long been considered merely \\"popular,\\" when in fact they are often penetrating inquiries into the meaning of life.One other characteristic of Shute's writing that is perhaps more apparent today than it was in the fifties and sixties is that his work is always set in the contemporary period of a world undergoing vast change. He lived and served and worked through two world wars and the effects of these cataclysmic events were such as to shake up the foundations of the very science which had made so many people feel so secure for a time. Therefore, his texts today also provide interesting excursions into that world, from 1920 to 1960, which was not only metamorphosing into the more colourful world of the Beatles, Vietnam and Tricky Dicky Nixon, but which has since very completely disappeared from the ken of anyone much under fifty. Of course, if all you are after is a good story told by a competent storyteller, you won't be disappointed either."},{"Title":"In the wet","review":"This is another of Nevil Shute's great stories of Australia. The frame of the story is really what is so marvellous. Shute is excellent in capturing the point of view of an elderly Church of England priest out in the sparsely-populated outback of the late 1940s. The futuristic body of the story is touching, to contrast Shute's projection of the British Royal family with the way that they have behaved in reality. But the voice of that old priest is what one simply cannot forget. It's similar, but even better, than the frame narrator of the old solicitor in &quot;A Town Like Alice.&quot;"},{"Title":"In the wet","review":"One of Shute's strengths is his ability to brilliantly project into a reasonable future, reasonable in view of the world as he knew it. His best known novel, On The Beach, is set in the future, as is this novel. Here the future takes form in the malaria-induced dream of an Australian bush-brother, stricken with a bout while tending a sick man during the Australian rainy season. From the small study in which he wrote, Shute gave his readers a prescient look at the English monarchy and race relations in the context of his usual fine tale. And, as is typical for this author, we are all ennobled in the reading. After the final page you too will wish to be worthy of the seventh vote...."},{"Title":"In the wet","review":"Nevil Shute was a sturdily competent author. His plots are as well constructed as his planes probably were. Solid, orthodox in design and execution, no unnecessary frills - the embodiment of the stiff upper lip of the Englishman. This is no exception as it artfully tells a future tale of an England riven by an envy-based Socialism (that its author had recently escaped from)that is rapidly destroying those few institutions remaining. It has a solid emotional connection to present-day 'utopian' Australia (as wonderfully observed from the point of view of one who lived there as, say, Orwell's 'Burmese Days').Hmmm...author wishes to tell of past or future and make politicised point therefrom. Problem - how to do this without breaking the emotional connection to the narrative of the present? Solution - make a character have a 'dream' of some kind.I rolled my eyes - this device was becoming hackneyed (cf.'An Old Captivity', 'The Rainbow &amp; The Rose' etc.) and one might have expected Shute to be a little more inventive with his literary devices. Nevertheless, it works and functions adequately as a means of establishing and maintaining a fluid connection between the two.Well done, sir!"},{"Title":"A Business of Ferrets","review":"With &quot;A Business of Ferrets&quot; Beth Hilgartner has created a tale (or the beginning of an epic if she continues the series) that is a riveting cat and mouse chase of good vs. evil and weak vs. strong. An Empire in turmoil, a Emperor good and honorable in a time of need, and a world devoid of honor. It will take the lowest members of society to sacrifice all and stand against the power hungry and selfish. Good shall reign once more, the strong shall fall by the weak, and Children shall lead them.&quot;A Business of Ferrets&quot; is the ultimate culmination of Mrs. Hilgartner's previous books. The deep friendship and character development from &quot;A Murder for Her Majesty&quot; is present and magnified. The chess like maneuvering of corrupt political/religious leaders from books like &quot;Colors in a Dreamweavers Loom&quot; &amp; &quot;A Murder for Her Majesty&quot; is organized into an addictive and unpredictable plot here in &quot;A Business of Ferrets&quot;. Finally the rich psychological questioning of self-being, purpose &amp; relationships that was found in &quot;Feast of The Trickster&quot; is more relevant and better used in the latest book. &quot;A Business of Ferrets&quot; is a high watermark for Mrs. Hilgartner and a must read for anyone who loves a great character driven story. My only complaint is to Meisha Merlin &amp; the lack of a hardback copy!"},{"Title":"A Business of Ferrets","review":"A great book!

The plotting was superb; there were enough twists and turns to keep me surprised, but at the same time everything seemed thoroughly believable. I loved the multiple levels of the plot(s), just who is pulling the puppet strings and how much autonomy do the puppets have? The minor characters were as interesting as the major ones and the villains were engaging too. My only quibble was that it took me a while to get used to the names of the people at court - all those k's and h's and y's!"},{"Title":"A Business of Ferrets","review":"Empire of Bharaghlaf has been blessed with a thoughtful and kind Emperor. Alas, he is almost powerless, and the ruthles noble houses scheme and murder with little restraint. Meanwhile, the slums remain poor and deadly for their inhabitants.The book describes a group of children from the slums, when they become embroiled in noble schemes. It's written mostly for young adults; there are some intense scenes in the book, though.The most prominent character, Ferret, is interesting, but the viewpoints shifts constantly between different characters, leaving little room for engagement. Most of the action is streamlined, almost oversimplified; and the magic is fairly superficial.On the whole, a pleasant fantasy, but not gripping, original or intricate enought to stand out...."},{"Title":"A Business of Ferrets","review":"A plucky young apprentice thief, a slave boy with eyes full of visions, a young street artist named Mouse-how can this motley group of slum-children hope to win against the scheming and politics of the nobility and save the Scholar King? With the help of some rather unusual allies, some divine intervention, and a whole lot of luck and courage!Ms. Hilgartner deftly weaves the lives of her vivid and delightful cast into a tale of high adventure. When a plot to kill the scholar king is uncovered by a plucky young thief named Ferret, she and her young friends soon find themselves unwittingly embroiled in a dangerous world of court politics, with enemies and suspicion at every turn. Each character has their part to play; their move to make in the intricate game that means their very survival. The author maintains a brisk pace, keeping the action moving and all of her characters vivid in the reader's minds. This is a pleasant, if not completely original, romp through an adventure fantasy and perfect for YA readers who enjoy a good story. Those looking for something breathtakingly new may find the plot and story elements all too familiar. Street thieves, beggar children and kings in danger are all fairly traditional elements, but they in no way make for a dull story, as Ms. Hilgartner does an exceptional job whisking us up into her world and her characters' adventure.Perhaps my main complaint with the book was that the central villain of the book was a little overdone, so that the result was more of a caricature than I think the author was aiming for. The villainy and cruelty is so over the top in a story where most of the characters have more complex motivations that I wished for a little more subtlety. The author's technique of maintaining a large cast of characters and jumping from character to character has its drawbacks in that the story never gives readers enough time or text to touch on the inner lives and emotions of cast. The reader is ever kept at one remove, and the emotional impact of the events is not as powerful as it otherwise could be. One last concern was the dizzying number of names to keep track of; most of them containing the letters y, z, or h in some combination and making it hard to remember who was who at times.Ms. Hilgartner's writing has only improved with time, and this book is one of her best to date. She is a fine storyteller with a real sense of pacing and energy as well as a skill of weaving her plot threads together into a satisfying whole. While epic fantasy fans may find A BUSINESS OF FERRETS a bit lightweight, it is an excellent, engaging tale and will likely appeal to those readers who enjoy Tamora Pierce and Mercedes Lackey. Don't miss the next book in this series; A PARLIAMENT OF OWLS.Happy Reading! ^_^ shanshad"},{"Title":"A Business of Ferrets","review":"What a wonderful imagination Beth Hilgartner has! .

Ross behaves horribly to those he loves most, but in the end he does right by the one who has loved him most of all. All the characters from the previous novels are still there, even one you never expected to see again.Totally addicted to this series back in the 70's watching it on Masterpiece Theatre Sunday nights with my mom and sisters. I eagerly gobbled up the first 4 books1945 - Ross Poldark1946 - Demelza1950 - Jeremy Poldark1953 - WarlegganWere I to have named them it would have been Poldark; Demelza; Warleggan; ElizabethI stopped reading the series in 1977 as the novels had gotten so dark that I wasn't enjoying where the author was taking the characters.1973 - The Black Moon1976 - The Four Swans1977 - The Angry TideI was poking in a book store on vacation and picked up \`The Twisted Sword' and enjoyed it tremendously (with one exception - I didn't care for the outcome for Jeremy at all).It was so good seeing Zacky Martin & Mrs. Zacky, Tholly Tregolis, Jud & Trudy Paynter - they hadn't changed at all. Dwight & Caroline Enys (and Horace), Verity & Andrew Blamey. And of course Demelza and Ross (still all too human). George Warleggan remains the same fascinating character. And Cornwall, Nampara (the Ross Poldark home) Wheal Grace and Wheal Leisure all so familiar 40 years later.1981 - The Stranger from the Sea1982 - The Miller's Dance1984 - The Loving Cup1990 - The Twisted Sword2002 - Bella PoldarkI am not sure I will pick up the last book as from the the reviews I don't think I will enjoy it as much. The author passed away in 2003 at age 90 so it is truly the last written by him.From the publisher: Ross Poldark plunges into a speculative mining venture which threatens his financial security and his stormy marriage to Demelza. When the old attraction between Ross and Elizabeth begins to rekindle itself, Demelza retaliates by becoming dangerously involved with a Scottish cavalry officer.Also from the Publisher: the Poldark series, the subject of the landmark BBC series Ross Poldark is a heartwarming, gripping, and utterly entertaining saga that brings to life an unforgettable cast of characters and one of the greatest love stories of our age. An intricately plotted story spanning loves, lives, and generations. The Poldark series is the masterwork of Winston Graham, who evoked the period and people like only he could, and created a world of rich and poor, loss and love, that readers will not soon forget."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia Brown Takes The Cake (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Encyclopedia Brown is a detective, not a chef.

She is a gifted and inspiring person and this particular book lays a solid foundation for everything she does. What has been strange is that following her teachings & trusting my inner senses has led me away from her a bit. At a seminar a few years ago I sensed immense fatigue from her. The reviewers who mentioned a \\"frostiness\\" echo a few of my friends who have wanted or had readings with her recently(2005). I was told her current insanely high prices for personal readings are an attempt to deter people and cut down on her work load. It hasn't worked. I think her ego is clouding her judgement and she can't accept that she needs to take time off to regroup & recharge. I wish she'd take a year or two off and just rest. We will survive without you.

Follow the steps, work at it diligently, and you'll find that you are a psychic.If you want to develop your psychic abilities in a carefully controlled fashion under the guidance of a masterful teacher, buy this book."},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"Everyone is psychic. This is the fundamental message of The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul by Sonia Choquette. As children, our intuition is heightened, undisturbed and uncorrupted by society's teaching us how like \\"should\\" be lived. False prophets, dishonest cheats, and scam artists also teach us that those claiming to have highly developed psychic abilities are not what they seem. The Psychic Pathway is a gentle approach to finding your own intuitive voice and learning to trust it.Designed as a 12-week workshop in book form, The Psychic Pathway begins with a deep analysis of understanding your own beliefs and opinions of the word \\"psychic,\\" its connotations and conditioned responses. Then, Ms. Choquette moves onto encouraging you to be open-minded in expecting and trusting psychic guidance. Through two tools, meditation and the keeping of a psychic journal, Ms. Choquette helps you to first unblock your internal censor by examining your own religious beliefs, getting organized, forgiving those who have hurt you in the past, and tuning into your own energy and the energy of others. Meditation truly is key to working closely with the tools in this workshop. Those uncomfortable with the concept or feelings of meditation are those who will most benefit from its effects. For those who struggle with meditation, keep practicing. It will get easier, and the results will be profound.Ms. Choquette takes common words associated with intuition and psychic energy and makes them understandable. Energy and keeping oneself grounded are keys in working with The Psychic Pathway. Ms. Choquette explains the aura and offers sound techniques to both see and cleanse your aura. A most fascinating chapter discusses the various energy sources within the human body, the chakras, how each chakra works, and the type of energy associated with each one. Techniques in this chapter include balancing the chakras, and Ms. Choquette even describes the various types of food to eat or avoid when attempting to regulate the chakras.In the last third of the book, you are encouraged to really have fun and play with your psychic abilities. Key to the success these techniques is the ongoing theme of playfulness. Per Ms. Choquette, intuition and guidance from the Higher Self is most prevalent when one remains lighthearted and playful. Her \\"I Am Psychic\\" game encourages you to spend the entire day in the guise of a psychic character you have created, using your intuition to guide your every move and decision for an entire day. In later chapters, you will learn about your various spiritual guides (angels, runners, helpers, teachers, masters, and joy guides) who, when called upon, can both enhance life and help you through the journey of your soul. Ms. Choquette ends the workshop with an explanation of various tools that can enhance and assist psychic abilities such as pendulums, tarot cards, and runes.This is truly a profound, life-changing, and miraculously accurate resource for enhancing psychic abilities."},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"I am more than halfway through this workbook. As a therapist I am impressed by the step by step clearing process that she initiates. I am enjoying exploring myself as I open to more of my psychic skills and I love her playful attitude and encouragement. I will recommend this book to anyone wanting to increase their psychic awareness."},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"the author uses a very down to earth style, and tells of many of her personal anecdotes as she starts her own journey on a path of awareness and spirituality. this is one of the few books that is Good for children, as it has lots of such short stories. In this marketplace, FULL of self help and spiritual books( most of dubious value), if a library (or a person )were limited to only about a few dozen books, THIS book is one to be definitely included."},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"I loved this book and will be reading it again and referring to it often.

However, if life has \\"conspired\\" to prevent you from feeling connected to yourself, you may be better off finding out who you really are first, THEN going into a program of psychic development like Sonia Choquette's. That said, other books have been written by people with great psychic abilities who actually address connecting to yourself through vocal toning, grounding (only minimally discussed by Ms. Choquette), and connecting with nature, all of which seem to be essential building blocks on a path toward the successful intuitive life. One of these books is The Beckoning Song of Your Soul by Nancy Marie. Another is Reconnecting with Nature, by Dr. Michael J. Cohen. Dr. Cohen's book is about \\"finding wellness through restoring our bond with the Earth. Most of us have been conditioned to ignore nearly 50 sensitivities that connect us to the natural world. This separation stress contributes to many of our environmental and personal problems.\\" Including access to psychic abilities.You may already have a great connection to yourself and to the earth. If so, go for Sonia's book!"},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"Probably the book on intuition/psychic skills that most shook me. You feel like you're coming home. She recommends things like clearing out clutter to allow your intuition to be heard, which is something which had been gnawing at me for a while, and which I'd started dealing with, to my mind as a separate project. Wrong, it was synchronicity.She fills in an awful lot of gaps to understand links between things; for example, I feel comfortable again, for the first time since I was a child, with the notion of angels.Only one minor negative point: I too was disappointed with Sonia's website. The coloured backgrounds to the text were overpowering and there was absolutely none of the &quot;earth-mother&quot; serenity which radiates from her book.A book to work with, to read again and again, and to share."},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"This book was a joy to read.

Since then I've had the privelege of having a reading done by her. It was amazing. Much of what she said has come true, and manifested in my life to my utter amazement! My own psychic awareness has gotten stronger as well, through the use of the book. I can't seem to live without it! It is the one book I take with me on all my travels near or far. I can refer to it for support, or inspiration whenever I feel the need, and it is a wonderful source for that. I'm sure anyone who is looking to improve thier life even the slightest bit will be happy with this purchase. It will change your life... and there are many surprises in store for you if you follow through with the excercizes in the book. Thank you Sonia for being a source of light and inspiration in my life, and so many others!"},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"This is a wonderful book which helps you expand your spiritual awareness. Using the tools of meditation, a psychic journal, grounding, auras, chakras, spiritual guides, and many other things, the author helps you along 'the psychic pathway,' with the goal of expanding your soul.Clearly written, with very useful exercises, she nudges you along gently, rather than overwhelming you with psychic mumbo jumbo. In fact, at the beginning of the book she tries to dispel preconceived notions that psychics are weird or charletons, and she does indeed convince you she is the real thing by her genuineness and honesty.I was particularly helped by her teaching that we have the intuition and insight to make our own judgements and should not give away our power to others (be unduly influenced by family and friends). We must take responsibility for our own lives and not expect others to take care of us.Sonia shows us that by working diligently, but at our own pace, we can indeed greatly expand our spiritual awareness, not only by connecting to the spirit within us, but by finding it outside us, as well."},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"I purchased this book about 2 years ago and refer to it often. Choquette does an excellent job in making this journey accessible to the average person. I admire her as a psychic as well as I have had several very accurate and insightful readings from her. On the flip side, I find her personal stories throughout the book to be uninteresting and would appreciate it if she had left them out -- it seems like an ego trip to me that she uses them in the first place. Secondly, while I did enjoy the readings with her, I did not find her to be as warm as she is in her witing at all and agree with the other reviewer about being treated &quot;frostily&quot; when you call to make an appt. My advice is to buy the book and develop your own intuition and skip the reading with Sonia. You will be better off!"},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"I just finished reading this book last night, and it totally moved me! This book is such an easy read, and it she keeps you tuned in because her words are so inspiring, and you don't want to put the book down. She makes you realize that you're not alone in this world, and that you have guides that love you and are there to help you. It's almost like taking a course, but on your own time. She makes you get rid of all your negative energy, and be more aware of yourself and others and your environment. She teahces everything from grounding yourself, meditation, clearing your aura, chakras, the sprits around you, forgiveness, awareness, the pendulum, tarot cards, I-ching, keeping a journal, etc. It is definatley a book I highly recommend! She seemm like a kind person, someone I'd like to meet one day, and get a reading. Her lessons in this book have helped me so much to let go of negatively, ground myself, and listen to my intuition and be more confident in my intuition, and just be more aware of myself and my environment, which are very important steps on the psychic pathway. This book is worth your money and then some!"},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"Sonia is a gentle soul who reminds us that the voice of spirit is always a guiding force in our lives.

I have also read Stillness Speaks, and many of Echo Bodine's books (Hands that Heal), and these are just the ones I learned something from, out of dozens I've now read. I would rate this one and Snow's book right at the top for spiritual enlightenment, and the Quest has been much more joyful since utilizing the exercises that these books teach.

There are sections for the reader to answer questions about one's self. As the title suggests, a workbook. I believe this is a plus for anyone learning or refreshing one's knowledge of the subject.I bought this book used. It was described as 'very good'.

Each chapter is presented at the most beginner level, which is nice, but repeats very simple ideas, then flies off into 10 pages of a related story. If you are looking to simply just take the cap off the bottle of psychic development this is the book. If you want to read about the author plus Jane, Dick and Joes success then this is most def. the book."},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"I have known I was psychic from birth. My mother also encouraged me to live with my soul.

The book is actually fun to read and informative. By doing the exercises I started to learn more about myself and found that there we things that I was just ignoring because I didn't understand or didn't know about them. Sonia cleared all that up for me.

The most helpful info was the one section for oracle cards/tarot cards/ how to use a pendulum. I became an avid pendulum user when I realized how easy it was.

I loved this book from the first till to the last page."},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"The Psychic Pathway is a 12-week plan on how to develop your intuition and psychic awareness to live your life more fully. Reading and working through one chapter a week, as recommended, gives you time to try out the exercises and assimilate the contents of each step, and become more aware of your developing psychic ability as well as the positive effects it will start to have on your life. What I liked about this book especially is that it seems to have gathered together in one place several tips that I have read in various books to &quot;clear the path&quot;, to create space mentally, spiritually and physically (i.e. in terms of your immediate environment) for new experiences to enrich your life, be it new books, new clothes, a new class, new people, travel or whatever. There are also numerous anecdotes taken from Ms. Choquette's own life and those of her clients to help the reader understand the impact of each step. Even if you don't do the exercises, just reading the book will change you and your approach to life."},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"I was first introduced to Sonia Choquette when a friend, knowing that I was on a journey of self discovery, gave me Sonia's book \\"Your Heart's Desire\\". The book was filled with so many incredible tools to help find and fulfill our heart's desire. 8 months after receiving the book, I attended Sonia's workshop based upon the book. Combined with the book, the workshop was a life-changing event for myself.After the workshop, I wanted to experience more of Sonia's wisdom, therefore I purchased \\"The Psychic Pathway\\". I must admit that before reading the book, I was uncomfortable with the word \`psychic'. To me, psychic conjured up images of the psychic hotlines that are advertised on TV. After reading the first chapter, I realized that I was not alone when it comes to \\"psychic heebie-jeebies\\". In fact there are exercises concerning this subject in the first chapter!I have read the book and have become very much aware of my own psychic abilities (Now I am even comfortable with the word psychic!). The book puts the core of what our soul is, in terms that anyone can understand and more importantly in a perspective that we can apply to ourselves. The warmth of the author is apparent with the many personal stories that she shares throughout the book. The questions, exercises and suggestions throughout the book are helpful, informative and insightful towards tapping into our soul. The book is totally awesome and I would strongly suggest anyone on a personal journey of growth, self actualization and authentication of self read this hands on book. The book truly gives perspective on reclaiming our birthright of living life from our soul!One sidenote. When I attended the workshop, the author and her assistant displayed a warmth that made them very approachable. I have attended book signings, talked to authors and none can compare to the sincerity that Sonia and her assistant have for each individual's own journey through life!"},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"Mathematics and science naturally attract me, and I can study those subjects myself. All my adult life, I've realized that I could use more extended and honed perceptions, not only for my own good, but for the good of the people around me, too. Therefore, I've sought very hard to develop the meditational or spiritual or psychic side of life. Along the way, I've consumed many seminars and read many books. While I imagine that some of those books were written only to make money, I do not assert that as the truth (and I have not in the past, either). I can say, with certainty, that many of those books and seminars have been closed to me. By that, I mean that it was clear to me that the writer and perhaps many other students or readers &quot;got it,&quot; even though it was abundantly clear (and frustrating) that I did not. It doesn't matter too much whether the material is based on someone's strong reality if we ourselves cannot have some share of the experience. I bought this book, and I have used it for a while now. My experience is that this book is open to me in a meaningful sense. I can do as it says, and I do actually have an improved experience. I wish I could get a better effect and get it more quickly, but the point is that with attention even a person like me actually gets some effect. I have read most of the book, but its main value is in working through the exercises, and I go slower than the schedule written in the book.Because the book works for me at least a little, I contacted Ms. Choquette and asked for a personal reading. She gave it to me. In preparation for the reading experience, I was hopeful in the sense that Ms. Choquette seemed to understand clearly that there is no real use in children's games. I don't care about lotto numbers or the identity of my &quot;soul mate.&quot; While her concerns are clearly different than mine, my guess, at least, is that Ms. Choquette doesn't care much about lotto numbers, either. The reading she gave me was truly stunning. It is impossible for me to retain objective clarity and say whether or not the hints she gave me will turn to my practical advantage in future. Time will tell something about that. The &quot;magic&quot; of the reading was that she framed a complete and sophisticated understanding of my whole life and times that was so far outside my own imaginings that I would never have thought about it. Whether her version is to be understood metaphorically or in a historical sense (and I cannot really say), it was the reframing that was so stunning and which at least potentially carried very great insight.I tell you solemnly (Amen, Amen, I say unto you), Sonia Choquette is sincere and has honed a real and meaningful psychic perception far beyond any level that I had previously encountered in anyone. I found her reading difficult to listen to properly, and I have no doubt that it was difficult for her to give to me. I recommend her and her books as being undoubtedly real and potentially a doorway or gateway for anyone (even someone previously frustrated, as I have been) to this realm of extended perception. I would have given 5 stars if I had been able to do the exercises faster (not her fault). Publicly, I acknowledge and thank Sonia Choquette."},{"Title":"The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul","review":"My name is Peggy Oborski, and I just wanted to write and comment on your book, \\"The Psychic Pathway.\\"In so many words, this book is absolutely, THE best book I have ever read in my entire life.

I would like to sincerely thank you, as I have found my inner voice, and everything seems to flow just right, now. I feel at home, whereas I did not before. I discovered my life's purpose with the help of your book, and am delighted to say I start school to learn the Art of healing through acupuncture next winter.

I wonder that she didn't cover an alternate way to deal with that kind of resistance.That aside, Sonia's style of writing is warm and engaging.I arranged for a reading with Sonia once, but MY psychic sense told me not to go. I was treated frostily by one of her administrative assistants, and another offered to arrange a reading for me OVER THE PHONE. Apparently I was meant to mail in a personal belonging that I carried often, for Sonia to read me with. I don't know how that works in the psychic world, but that struck me as really odd. I was immediately put off by this impersonal touch, so different from the warm and sensitive one that comes across in the book.Not to mention that the newsletter you can subscribe for when you write to Sonia's office is rambling and full of other people's boring self indulgence. Yes, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.Bottome line---if you want to try exercising your intuiton, buy this book. If you want to become The Amazing Kresgin, find a sensitive, supportive teacher like Sonia did, who can give you feedback.

I have had some experience with thyroid problems in the past so a lot of the information contained in the book was not new to me. The best part about the book is that you get detailed information without all the medical jargon. The author is very clear and descriptive about the different types of thyroid conditions, symptoms, common medical treatments, etc. I purchased it because I was hoping for more information on weight management and diet for tyroid patients. Although the book touches on this topic it was not as detailed as I would have liked. Otherwise, I would recommend this book as a guide to walk you through the maze of medical terms and to sort out some of the fact from fiction."},{"Title":"The Thyroid Sourcebook for Women (Sourcebooks)","review":"This book is informative and well-organized, it is great finding a Thyroid book dedicated to women's issues."},{"Title":"The Thyroid Sourcebook for Women (Sourcebooks)","review":"Unlike other resource books on thyroid disease, this offering gives specific information for women on the health connections regarding the female life cycles and other influencial female hormones.

It offers the basic information on thyroid disease (Are you hyper or hypo, symptoms, medication, etc.) without overwhelming the reader. The author is very precise in her explanations also. For those of you looking for answers to more challenging and complex thyroid problems, this would NOT be the book to buy. It doesn't challenge any of the current practices and assumes that you have a simple problem that one pill will cure."},{"Title":"The Thyroid Sourcebook for Women (Sourcebooks)","review":"While the information in this book might be a good starting point for someone totally new to thyroid disorders, I found it too basic, and too entrenched in mainstream theory and treatments to be helpful. Too much repeating of information easily found on just about any thyroid drug manufacturer's website, or just from surfing around the web. It is not a book I kept for my personal library --which for me (books are life!) is unusual."},{"Title":"The Thyroid Sourcebook for Women (Sourcebooks)","review":"This book is far too basic, with information easily found by a quick internet search.

With the information presented in the book I was better able to ask the right questions of my doctors, who in turn gave me more informed answers. I had a better idea of what to expect as I followed the various treatments I was subjected to when it was later determined that I had thyroid cancer. I only wish that the author covered thyroid cancer a bit more, since it's kind of light on that. However, this book is not the definitive source on thyroid disorders, and I don't think it was meant to be, rather it is a good guide for the patient and the patient's family. If you want something that is more definitive, then perhaps a textbook on endocrinology is what you need."},{"Title":"The Thyroid Sourcebook for Women (Sourcebooks)","review":"Very nice easy to read book about Thyroid and practical explanations, symptoms and questions about related issues once the illness is is established, such as selecting doctors, understanding what they say, etc. It is notwritten for Medical Students although it helps to any student in the way how to communicate with patients."},{"Title":"The Thyroid Sourcebook for Women (Sourcebooks)","review":"Why did McGraw-Hill publish this book? It is almost identical (verbatim) to The Complete Thyroid Book except that the latter book includes some additional information.

At least that has always been Lord Adderly, Christopher's grandfather's, plan. (Lord Adderly is also Cassandra's guardian.) And the very fact that both Christopher and Cassandra get on like oil and water, has not caused the old man to rethink his grand plan one bit over the years. Nor has he ever considered the notion that either Christopher or Cassandra may have dreams or desires of their own. So that even when Christopher was taken prisoner by the French while he was on the Grand Tour and was thought to be died in one of their prisons, the old man kept Cassandra (who had always cherished dreams of having a London Season and living in the city) firmly ensconced in the country.Now, however, it looks as if news of Christopher's death may have been premature. For with Bonaparte's final defeat has come the realization that Christopher has spent the past 11 years being moved from one French jail to another. Lord Adderly is ecstatic: at last his dreams of marrying Christopher and Cassandra off to each other are coming true. But Cassandra is livid: now she will have to marry spotty, chubby and fatuous Christopher after all. What neither expected was that Christopher would put his foot down and refuse to marry Cassandra, and that he would take off for London in order to have some fun and acquire some \\"town bronze.\\" And the last thing Christopher expected was for Lord Adderly (with Cassandra in tow) to give chase after him.It is still Lord Adderly's hope that the pair will make a match of it, even if it is fast becoming a dwindling one. For Christopher and Cassandra are soon happily sampling the many entertainments and diversions that the city has to offer and making new friends. It doesn't take Christopher long, however, to realise that he is actually very much in love with Cassandra. Unfortunately Cassandra has other ideas, and seems to have fallen for a handsome titled lord. What will Christopher do? Try to win Cassandra's heart? Or try to help her achieve exactly what (and who) she desires?\\"Town Bronze\\" was a rather fun read. Christopher Warrender was my kind of romance hero -- intelligent, charming, funny and masculine without being the type of alpha-male that many sensible women would just long to hurl bricks at! Cassandra, on the other hand, took a little longer to warm to. But this was mainly because she did not come across very well in the first few chapters -- ranting (and sulking) at a man who had just come home from hell as if it was all his fault that she had to marry him! Fortunately, the authour rehabilitates Cassandra fairly early on in the novel so that I was able to settle into liking this romantic pair and rooting for their happily-ever-after ending. I liked the manner in which Kate Huntington depicted the relationship that Christopher and Cassandra have, as well how she portrayed the deepening of this friendship, and how it blossomed into love. And I liked all the different kinds of gambits/obstacles that she threw at the pair so that I actually began to question if and when Christopher and Cassandra would find their way to each other. Also nicely done were the characterisations of the \\"other\\" woman and gentleman in this story: Mrs. Caroline Bellingham, a beautiful and fast widow that Christopher finds himself attracted to, and Lord Whitby, the handsome gentleman-about-town that Cassandra falls for. All in all, even though much of this novel was quite formulaic, there was much to appreciate and enjoy in \\"Town Bronze.\\" A truly fun read."},{"Title":"Town Bronze (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"There was only one review on the Amazon system when I bought this book and there is still only one so I decided to add my evaluation. I do not give out 5 star ratings lightly. I am hard to please as a reader, perhaps sometimes too much so. But the point is that I pay money for the privilege of reading a romance novel and I much prefer that the author give me something worth my money. Kate Huntington has done just that.I really like the plot of this book. Christopher has spent eleven years in a succession of French prisons because no ransome was ever demanded for his release and his grandfather had received information that Christopher and his tutor had died at the hands of the French. Without knowing this, Christopher had erroneously thought that perhaps his grandfather had chosen not to pay for his release. When he returns to England he is, naturally, a very different person. Not being willing to fall in with the wish that he marry Cassandra he rides off to London to enjoy life for a while before looking for a woman to be his wife. Cassandra is not in the picture as far as he is concerned. So who does he meet up with almost instantly? The widow Caroline Benningham of course, portrayed as \\"the other woman\\" so very well by this author.Cassandra really got on my nerves for a while with her constant whining about being expected to marry Christopher. Once she and her guardian got to London she wasted no time in looking around for a suitable match. She had been denied her London season several years ago and she meant to make the most of her time now. She quickly became the object of interest for Lord Whitby, the answer to any maiden's prayer. A titled gentleman from a very wealthy family. Could Cassandra be any happier? Well, actually, yes. Maidens need to look very closely at men who seem to be too good to be true.I liked watching Christopher and Cassandra find their true feelings for each other. I always liked Christopher more but Cassandra began to be a likeable character before the midway point in the book so I have no complaints about her. A nice little twist in the plot kept things moving right along. All in all, an enjoyable read which I would recommend."},{"Title":"Town Bronze (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Description from the book back cover:AN INCONVENIENT ENGAGEMENT: If life were fair, beautiful Cassandra would be on her way to enjoying her first London Season instead of having an awkward breakfast with the man she was promised to long ago. Christopher Warrender's years as a prisoner of war in France have done nothing for his table manners, though they have given him a bold, defiant spirit that Cassandra finds oddly compelling. In fact, she doesn't know whether to feel relief or indignation when he angrily informs her that he has no intention of leaving one prison only to be trapped in a loveless marriage. She is free to pursue her Season in London while he in turn will entertain himself with a bevy of society beauties ... A TIMELY GAME OF LOVE: Christopher has been accused of many things, but failing to expire at his fiancee's convenience truly nips at his pride. He understands what it is to be held hostage, and he has no desire to keep Cassandra from finding true happiness with some perfectly faultless gentleman, even if he has to run away to London to free her. He never expects her to follow, or for her beauty and charm to capture his heart. And when Cassandra falls for a fortune-hunting cad, the only way Christopher can possibly save her from a disastrous mistake is to insist on his right to marry her first ..."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:H},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],W={key:0},B={key:1};function q(s,o,n,c,r,i){const u=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(e(),w(u,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",B,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const E=d(C,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-ffb2b9d3"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/25.md","filePath":"guide/25.md"}'),P={name:"guide/25.md"},N=Object.assign(P,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(E)]))}});export{j as __pageData,N as default};
