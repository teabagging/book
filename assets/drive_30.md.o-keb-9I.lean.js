Counterfeit Money (Vol 1)","description":"Providing crucial scholarship on Derrida's first series of lectures from the Nationality and Philosophical Nationalism cycle, Herman Rapaport brings all 13 parts of the Fantom of the Other series (1984-85) to our critical attention. The series, Rapaport argues, was seminal in laying the foundations for the courses given, and ideas explored, by Derrida over the next twenty years. It is in this vein that the full explication of Derrida's lectures is done, breathing life into the foundational lecture series which has not yet been published in its entirety in English. Derrida's examination of a master signifier of the social relation, Geschlecht, acts as the critical entry point of the series into wide-ranging meditations on the social construction and deconstruction of all possible relations denoted by the core concept, including race, gender, sex, and family. The lecture series' vast engagement with a range of major thinkers, including philosophers and poets alike  Arendt, Adorno, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Trakl, and Adonis  tackles core themes and debates about philosophical nationalism. Presenting Derrida's lectures on the implications of key 20th century philosopher's understandings of nationalism as they relate to concerns over idiomatic language, notions of race, exile, return, and social relations, adds richly to the literature on Derrida and reveals the potential for further application of his work to current polarising debates between universalism and tribalism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=amcBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Around the U.S.A. in 1000 Pictures","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8bc46P2wYaYC&dq=Around+the+U.S.A.+in+1000+Pictures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Grits to Gourmet - Pheylonian Cookery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rML8AAAACAAJ&dq=From+Grits+to+Gourmet+-+Pheylonian+Cookery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recharge in Minutes: The Quick-Lift Way to Less Stress, More Success, and Renewed Energy","description":"101 ways to rev up your focus, confidence, and energy...every day!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2XQEAAAACAAJ&dq=Recharge+in+Minutes:+The+Quick-Lift+Way+to+Less+Stress,+More+Success,+and+Renewed+Energy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rachel Chance","description":"Not quite historical fiction, not quite historical romance, Rachel's Chance explores the journey of Rachel Smithson as she confronts life in 17th century Maryland (Maries Land).

The different sections of the reader explore: * the construction of gender categories through science * the interraction of technoscience and gender in contemporary science fiction film such as Bladerunner and the Alien series * debates around modern reproductive technology such as ultrasound scans and IVF, assessing their benefits and constraints for women * issues relating to artificial intelligence and the internet.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xd_cAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Lunatic Fear","description":"Jaguar Addams is back!

If only everything in life had been as easy as he made hitting look. In One Tough Out: Fighting Off Life's Curveballs, Carew reflects on the highlights, anecdotes, and friendships from his outstanding career, describing the abuse, poverty, and racism he overcame to even reach the majors. In conversational, confessional prose, he takes readers through the challenges he's conquered in the second half of his life, from burying his youngest daughter to surviving several near-fatal bouts with heart disease. He also details the remarkable reason he's alive today: the heart transplant he received from Konrad Reuland, a 29-year-old NFL player he'd met years before. Carew explains how that astonishing connection was revealed and the unique bond he and his wife, Rhonda, have since forged with his donor's family. An important thread running through this mosaic of Carew's life is his faith. He illustrates how his mother instilled those beliefs during their darkest days and how conversations with God helped him fight off every curveball life has thrown his way.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2YXNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Pick Up Guys","description":"Want to become a successful pickup artist?

The Years With Laura Diaz is Carlos Fuentes' most important novel in several decades.

Now the principle figure is not Artemio Cruz (who, however, makes a brief appearance) but Fuentes's first major female protagonist, the extraordinary Laura Diaz. Carlos Fuentes's richly woven narrative tapestry-filled with a multitude of dramatic scenes both witty, amusing, and heartbreaking-shows us this wonderful creature as she grows into a politically committed artist who is also a wife and mother, a lover of great men, a complicated and alluring heroine whose brave honesty prevails despite her losing a son and grandson to the darkest forces of Mexico's repressive, corrupt regimes. In the end, Laura Diaz herself dies, after a life filled with tragedy and loss, but she is a happy woman, for she has borne witness to, and helped to affect, the course of history and has vindicated the aims and intentions of the highest art.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d9zKxE9-qbQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Constitution (I Know America)","description":"Khan, a Gold Star father who spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, explains to young readers why the guarantees and protections provided by the Constitution matters for everyone.

No other American city has a population composed of so many different nationalities. Of these \\"foreign born,\\" a relatively small percentage come directly from Ireland, but the Irish presence in the city and America is ubiquitous. In the 1990 census, Irish ancestry was claimed by over half a million New Yorkers and by 44 million nationwide. The Irish presence in popular American culture has also been highly visible. Yet for all the attention given to Irish Americans, surprisingly little has been said about postWorld War II immigrants. Almeida s research takes important steps toward understanding modern Irish immigration. Comparing 1950s Irish immigrants with the \\"New Irish\\" of the 1980s, Almeida provides insights into the evolution of the Irish American identity and addresses the role of the United States and Ireland in shaping it. She finds, among other things, that social and economic progress in Ireland has heightened expectations for Irish immigrants. But at the same time they face greater challenges in gaining legal residence, a situation that has led the New Irish to reject many organizations that long supported previous generations of Irish immigrants in favor of new ones better-suited to their needs. Linda Dowling Almeida, Adjunct Professor of History at New York University, has published articles on the \\"New Irish\\" in America and is a longtime member of the New York Irish History Roundtable.

This was the age of the first world empires, the days when Assyria, Babylon, Greece and Rome each displayed their passion for power. It was an age which demanded the resounding and inspired voices of many of God s greatest spokesmen. The turbulent chaos of these centuries brought forth many mighty prophets of God -- Elijah, Elisha, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Jonah, Lehi, Nephi, Daniel, Zechariah, and many others. The lives and times of all these men are in these pages. This is the third and final volume of this series dealing with the Old Testament. The volumes which preceded it were entitled: The First 2,000 Years, which covered the period from Adam to Abraham, and The Third Thousand Years, which covered Bible history from Abraham to David. This present volume deals with the exciting scriptural epic which emerged between the time of David and the coming of Christ. For those who find the Old Testament arduous reading, these three books should prove especially inspirational and helpful.

Christopher Taucar provides a detailed history of the British system's development from state power being exercised by centralized royal courts to its present-day distinct legislative, judicial, and executive bodies with diverse powers. The British System of Government and Its Historical Development fills a large and important gap in contemporary understandings of British legal and political history by providing a broad overview of a system that influenced political systems across the world. The main constitutional settlements are examined, including the development of parliamentary sovereignty, courts, and the common law, emphasizing the supremacy of law and natural law. Thus, the findings question the assumptions held by many contemporary scholars and judges by reaffirming the centuries-old view of the supremacy of law as an objective and external standard. The British System of Government and Its Historical Development argues that knowing this system is vital not only to our understanding of systems of government in Britain and elsewhere, but also as the basis to hold governments accountable to their most basic rules and imperatives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sTPXBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","description":"A personal account of the Second World War by a White Russian princess who lived in Berlin and Vienna with insights into the ever-harsher conditions of civilian life and the ethical dilemma of upper-class anti-Nazis","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZlctAQAAIAAJ&dq=Berlin+Diaries,+19401945&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Brown's Body (International Collectors Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8vWPzgEACAAJ&dq=John+Brown%27s+Body+(International+Collectors+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In On It","description":"\\"Birthdays may be difficult for me.\\" \\"I want you to take the initiative in opening conversations about my birth family.\\" \\"When I act out my fears in obnoxious ways, please hang in there with me.\\" \\"I am afraid you will abandon me.\\" The voices of adopted children are poignant, questioning.

In important ways, little has really changed in the fundamental nature of presidential campaigns, presidential politics, and presidential lives. In these pages, a Nixon man shares incidents and anecdotes that illuminate the inner workings of a presidential campaign and life in the White House, revealing touching moments and flashes of personality from the controversial Nixon years. These are small items, some serious, some humorous; telling little moments not likely to be addressed in the writings of more famous authors. This is a collection of the stories that contribute to the drama of a campaign, of views from Pennsylvania Avenue, and with them some opinions on several White House personalities. * Charles Stuart joined Richard Nixon's campaign staff in 1967 and toured the US, hunting up voters to win his candidate the election. (He has since then hunted big game in many of the Western states, British Columbia and Mongolia.)

Devas are the radiant light of the Universal Divine that permeates all things. Since the earliest times, people were aware that all of Nature is divine. Great and wondrous myths were told that explained the presence of divine energy as it exists in thunder, in trees, and in sunlight. Some of this lore was the foundation of religions. But the simpler stories, such as those of a plant's energy, explored day-to-day matters like health and love. This understanding of the world has been preserved in folklore through poems, chants, ditties, and spells. From researching the history of folklore from cultures around the world, patterns emerge that enable us to approach the true nature of plants' devas. This compendium presents the lore and the corresponding usage for 330 magickal herbes. Great care was taken only to include folklore that was documented as authentic. You will meet many new herbes in this text and explore fascinating magickal and religi uses, but most of all, you will come to respect the divine that surrounds your everyday life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wA7xHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Master+Book+of+Herbalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silver Anchor","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Classical Long-playing Record: Design, Production and Reproduction","description":"In the history of records the vinyl LP occupies an important place.

This absence, in turn, reflects the collapse of the Keynesian view that provided such a foundation from 1940 through the early 1970s, comparable to earlier visions provided by Smith, Ricardo, Mill, and Marshall. The \\"unraveling\\" of Keynesianism has been followed by a division into discordant and ineffective camps whose common denominator seems to be their shared analytical refinement and lack of practical applicability. This provocative analysis attempts both to describe this state of affairs, and to suggest the direction in which economic thinking must move if it is to regain the relevance and remedial power it now pointedly lacks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V3_eh4oE1v0C&dq=The+Crisis+of+Vision+in+Modern+Economic+Thought&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"The Supply for Tomorrow Must Not Fail\\": The Civil War of Captain Simon Perkins, Jr., a Union Quartermaster","description":"Captain Simon Perkins Jr and his fellow quartermasters helped to make the Union's victory possible by providing the Federal army with vital equipment.

What is remarkable about this book is that a history of knitting can function so well as a survey of the changes in women s rolse over time.  The New York Times Book Review An historian and lifelong knitter, Anne Macdonald expertly guides readers on a revealing tour of the history of knitting in America. In No Idle Hands, Macdonald considers how the necessity and the pleasure of knitting has shaped women s lives. Here is the Colonial woman for whom idleness was a sin, and her Victorian counterpart, who enjoyed the pleasure of knitting while visiting with friends; the war wife eager to provide her man with warmth and comfort, and the modern woman busy creating fashionable handknits for herself and her family. Macdonald examines each phase of American history and gives us a clear and compelling look at life, then and now. And through it all, we see how knitting has played an important part in the way society has viewed women and how women have viewed themselves. Assembled from articles in magazines, knitting brochures, newspaper clippings and other primary sources, and featuring reproductions of advertisements, illustrations, and photographs from each period, No Idle Hands capture the texture of women s domestic lives throughout history with great wit and insight.  Colorful and revealing . . . vivid . . . This book will intrigue needlewomen and students of domestic history alike.

Unique in its emphasis on the art of shiphandling and manoeuvres for such vessels, it is a classic work designed to teach mariners and pilots practical shiphandling skills. The book is used as a text by maritime academies, shiphandling training facilities, ships' officers, and apprentice pilots. The text is a compendium of shiphandling information written by a father and son team of pilots, with contributions from several other pilots and shipmasters who provided material relating to their specialised skills. It is written primarily for the practising mariner -- the shipmaster, mate, naval or Coast Guard officer -- who already possesses some degree of professional knowledge, experience, and training. The text follows a non-technical format, stressing manoeuvres routinely used by working pilots and mariners. The material incorporates information from recent tests of the hydrodynamics of ship behaviour and simulator-developed data, with procedures and practices based on the authors' experience, gained while working as shipmasters, canal pilots, mooring masters, and river pilots. The fourth edition includes new information on squat and under-keel clearance in shallow water, bridge resource management for pilots, and discussions of new propulsion systems and hull types, including VMax ships and Azipod propulsion systems, proposals for a more modern approach to VTS, and laptop navigation systems for manoeuvring in pilot waters. Most manoeuvres used in docking, undocking, and shiphandling are covered, and many less commonly performed manoeuvres, including docking at single-point and multiple-buoy moorings, use of anchors in shiphandling, offshore lightering, and transiting of locks and canals. Good bridge practices in pilot waters and training techniques, including simulator training, are discussed, so that the potential deck officer or master can develop the shiphandling skills essential to the marine profession.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pwVUAAAAMAAJ&dq=Shiphandling+for+the+Mariner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Penal Colony","description":"Rikers Island--just six miles from the Empire State Building--is one of the largest, most complex and most expensive penal institutions in the world, yet most New Yorkers couldn't find it on a map.

She chronicles their journeys as they struggle to \\"go straight\\" and find respect in a city that fears and rejects them.

In the summer of 2020, Tupac Shakur s single  Changes  became an anthem for the worldwide protests against the murder of George Floyd. The song became so popular, in fact, it was vaulted back onto the iTunes charts more than twenty years after its release making it clear that Tupac s music and the way it addresses systemic racism, police brutality, mass incarceration, income inequality, and a failing education system is just as important now as it was back then. In Changes, published to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of Tupac s birth and twenty-fifth anniversary of his death, Sheldon Pearce offers one of the most thoughtful and comprehensive accounts yet of the artist s life and legacy. Pearce, an editor and writer at The New Yorker, interviews dozens who knew Tupac throughout various phases of his life. While there are plenty of bold-faced names, the book focuses on the individuals who are lesser known and offer fresh stories and rare insight. Among these are the actor who costarred with him in a Harlem production of A Raisin in the Sun when he was twelve years old, the high school drama teacher who recognized and nurtured his talent, the music industry veteran who helped him develop a nonprofit devoted to helping young artists, the Death Row Records executive who has never before spoken on the record, and dozens of others. Meticulously woven together by Pearce, their voices combine to portray Tupac in all his complexity and contradiction. This remarkable book illustrates not only how he changed during his brief twenty-five years on this planet, but how he forever changed the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s_0DEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linda's pictures: A collection of photographs","description":"A collection of photographs of family, rock musicians, and fantasy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lY6RygAACAAJ&dq=Linda%27s+pictures:+A+collection+of+photographs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The great auk,: A novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Roosevelt bears: Their travels and adventures","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CQFCAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"For the Beauty of the Earth: Birding, Opera, and Other Journeys","description":"A former executive director of the Maine Audubon Society combines a lifetime interest in classical music, literature, and art with his passion for nature in a collection of essays that take readers on an unlikely but heartfelt journey into the line separating thinking humans from the \\"natural world.\\" Reprint.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ke0mzgEACAAJ&dq=For+the+Beauty+of+the+Earth:+Birding,+Opera,+and+Other+Journeys&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Circle Of Stones","description":"This is the tenth anniversary edition of the classic bestseller for women seeking their sacred connections.

Often spanning generations, the stories are defined by subtle shifts in both family relationships and the ways in which we reconfigure them in memory and mind. Many of the stories revolve around end-of-life scenes. An elderly man is visited by his middle-aged son s young second wife and child, whom the son has temporarily abandoned in order to tend to his dying ex-wife. A recently widowed woman faces a complicated relationship with a troubled home health-care worker who had been uncommonly kind to her dying husband. Four middle-aged siblings reconvene in their childhood home to attend to the death of their father and find themselves simultaneously children of, and parents to, their own parents. The unobtrusive historical breadth of the stories is remarkable. Reflecting back to Depression-era southern America from the perspective of the early twenty-first century, the characters provide us with an intimate view of the changing cultural landscape of our country. Issues of class are not merely ideological here they are fluid and intricate aspects of fate and of soul. Justice s prose is characterized by quiet humor and attention to gesture. The deeply self-reflective and self-contained narrators offer us a window into issues of aging and mortality that is real and rare. In the manner of Alice Munro or William Trevor, Jean Ross Justice s thought-driven fiction centers on pivotal moments of action or conversation that haunt or reverberate for decades.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mq7GAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Value of Science: Essential Writings of Henri Poincare (Modern Library Science)","description":"More than any other writer of the twentieth century, Henri Poincar  brought the elegant, but often complicated, ideas about science and mathematics to the general reader.

She explores how and why the impoverished and mentally tormented van Gogh came to be glorified shortly after his suicide at the age of 37. Did the secular art world need a rebel-saint of its own? Heinich explores the history of efforts to celebrate van Gogh, showing how the details of his life have been constructed according to the pattern of a Christian saint's rise to recognition. Examines the economics of the art market and the themes that make up the van Gogh myth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qE1MPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Glory+of+van+Gogh&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Garlic And Sapphires - Secret Life Of A Critic In Disguise","description":"A funny, tell-all memoir from the New York Times' most controversial restaurant critic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nrES5-H8brEC&dq=Garlic+And+Sapphires+-+Secret+Life+Of+A+Critic+In+Disguise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quickies: Fascinating Facts About the Facts of Life","description":"Sure to titillate, spice up dull conversations, and satisfy one's lust for sexy facts and figures, \\"Quickies\\" is the perfect gift for friends and lovers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bB4E5rGpx6YC&dq=Quickies:+Fascinating+Facts+About+the+Facts+of+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going Too Far","description":"High school senior Meg revels in being a rebel; cutting class whenever possible and hanging out anywhere she's not supposed to be. Like on a railroad-tracks-covered bridge that's off-limits to trespassers. When she and her friends are busted for trespassing and underage drinking, she's sentenced to spend her spring break riding along with a rookie police officer on his nightshift patrol. To make things worse the cop, John After, is only two years older than Meg, and is sure that he knows all he needs to about her. John has nothing but contempt for her childish rebellion, but that's fine, because the feelings mutual - his straight-laced, by-the-book attitude is everything that Meg hates. But they're about to discover that they have a lot more in common than either one of them could have dreamed and, as they're forced to spend time together, sparks fly and a hot attraction between them becomes undeniable ","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1ypGqG4CkesC&dq=Going+Too+Far&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crying Heart Tattoo: A Novel","description":"An international cult classic and a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, The Crying Heart Tattoo follows the unlikely romance between a young man and a woman more than twice his age.

But the young naturalist s passion wasn t about to fade away any time soon. Written for the Durrell Wildlife Park s twenty-fifth anniversary, The Ark s Anniversary is the unconventional story of how one man s dream was transformed into the esteemed organization known today as the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, dedicated to saving endangered species from extinction.

This happened on Haramosh.  The Last Blue Mountain is the heart-rending true story of the 1957 expedition to Mount Haramosh in the Karakoram range in Pakistan. With the summit beyond reach, four young climbers are about to return to camp. Their brief pause to enjoy the view and take photographs is interrupted by an avalanche which sweeps Bernard Jillott and John Emery hundreds of feet down the mountain into a snow basin. Miraculously, they both survive the fall. Rae Culbert and Tony Streather risk their own lives to rescue their friends, only to become stranded alongside them. The group s efforts to return to safety are increasingly desperate, hampered by injury, exhaustion and the loss of vital climbing gear. Against the odds, Jillott and Emery manage to climb out of the snow basin and head for camp, hoping to reach food, water and assistance in time to save themselves and their companions from an icy grave. But another cruel twist of fate awaits them. An acclaimed mountaineering classic in the same genre as Joe Simpson's Touching the Void, Ralph Barker s The Last Blue Mountain is an epic tale of friendship and fortitude in the face of tragedy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E1PODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story of Stone: Intertextuality, Ancient Chinese Stone Lore, and the Stone Symbolism in","description":"A monumental reconstruction of ancient Chinese stone lore","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=49brOdOKlD0C&dq=The+Story+of+Stone:+Intertextuality,+Ancient+Chinese+Stone+Lore,+and+the+Stone+Symbolism+in&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mississippi, (Campaigns of the Civil War)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zg5h7x3g1z4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schools and Masters of Fencing: From the Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century (Dover Military History, Weapons, Armor)","description":"The definitive work on fencing history and the art swordsmanship traces the sport from its rough beginnings to its latter-day refinement, focusing primarily on the 16th-century development of the rapier and its popularity in Italy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r0PCAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evidence as to man's place in nature","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z1wSAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"California: A Bicentennial History","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JOOEtQEACAAJ&dq=California:+A+Bicentennial+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D6mUQgAACAAJ&dq=Scottish+Clan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marianne, the Madame, and the Momentary Gods","description":"Marianne plans to use the magic she learned from the magus to go back in time and save her parents from death, but she becomes trapped in a time warp, face-to-face with evil magic","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9F8lAAAACAAJ&dq=Marianne,+the+Madame,+and+the+Momentary+Gods&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toys & Prices 2006 (Toys and Prices)","description":"Hays Baker and his wife Lizbeth possess super-human strength, extraordinary intelligence, stunning looks, and two beautiful children.

Following the Editor's Introduction, John Macquarrie, Adriaan Peperzak, and Hent de Vries take up central themes in continental philosophy of religion. Macquarrie analyzes postmodernism and its influence in philosophy and theology. Peperzak argues for a form of universality different from that of modern philosophy, and de Vries analyzes an intrinsic and structural relationship between religion and the media. The next three essays discuss issues in analytic philosophy of religion. Philip Quinn argues that religious diversity reduces the epistemic status of exclusivism and makes it possible for a religious person to be justified while living within a pluralistic environment. William Wainwright plumbs the work of Jonathan Edwards in order to better understand debates concerning freedom, determinism, and the problem of evil, and William Hasker asks whether theological incompatibilism is less inimical to traditional theism than some have supposed. Representing the Thomist tradition, Fergus Kerr challenges standard readings of Aquinas on the arguments for the existence of God. David Griffin analyzes the contributions of process philosophy to the problem of evil and the relation between science and religion. Illustrating comparative approaches, Keith Ward argues that the Semitic and Indian traditions have developed a similar concept of God that should be revised in view of post-Enlightenment theories of the individual and the historical. Keith Yandell explores themes in the Indian metaphysical tradition and considers what account of persons is most in accord with reincarnation and karma doctrines. Feminist philosophy of religion is represented in Pamela Anderson's article, in which she argues for a gender-sensitive and more inclusive approach to the craving for infinitude.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i-nVBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theoretical Introduction to Programming","description":"Including easily digested information about fundamental techniques and concepts in software construction, this book is distinct in unifying pure theory with pragmatic details.

Case examples are used to illustrate refinements such as looking for opportunities in inner cities and keeping an open mind to creative financing possibilities. Nickerson is an experienced pro whose \\"How I Turned $1,000 into a Million in Real Estate in My Spare Time\\" is a classic. THERE ARE MANY obvious ways to make a fortune. One is to gamble. You might get rich overnight. But gambling is not a sure thing-that's why they call it gambling. There are other speculative, get-rich quick schemes-like buying real estate with dangerous nothing down balloon-payment financing and bleeding, rather than improving, the property but most easy-money fantasies turn into nightmares, and breed negative losses instead of positive profits. By far the surest road to a fortune that can match or surpass your golden dreams is to buy, with sound financing, fixer-upper properties that you can improve. You can choose from millions of deteriorated or obsolescent properties with repair and improvement challenges that you can readily correct. Many owners just do not have the gumption to fix up wounded properties that have bled their lives away with age and neglect. If you have a little courage and imagination, you can buy such distress properties at a bargain, correct imperfections, and make a sure and spectacular profit. This gives you a built-in safety factor that guards you against going wrong. If you faithfully follow my principles it is just about impossible to go broke. The only question is not whether you will make a profit, but how much you will make!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mxy3LwEACAAJ&dq=Nickerson%27s+No-Risk+Way+to+Real+Estate+Fortunes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Getting a Job at Microsoft","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Women Who Make the World Worse : and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports","description":"An analysis of how feminists may be compromising American institutions seeks to establish a difference between \\"pro-female\\" and \\"anti-male\\" feminism, citing the influences of such figures as Hillary Clinton, Gloria Steinem, and Maureen Dowd.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e0EFAQAAIAAJ&dq=Women+Who+Make+the+World+Worse+:+and+How+Their+Radical+Feminist+Assault+Is+Ruining+Our+Schools,+Families,+Military,+and+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Precalculus with Modeling and Visualization (3rd Edition) (Rockswold Series)","description":"Gary Rockswold focuses on teaching algebra in context, answering the question,  Why am I learning this?  and ultimately motivating the students to succeed in this class.

We can know of them only indirectly by mass, force, and energy, and by the intermediary of phenomena such as may be tested by our five senses. Without direct awareness of Space or Time, human beings lack two  senses  necessary for the knowledge of all causes. From this imperfection, of which we are always being made aware, is born our need to simplify. Thus we reduce everything to fundamental properties, without paying any attention to the underlying universal organization, the effects of which are all around us. The result is that the science of numbers, the most wonderful guide to the constant creation of the universe, remains an enormous hypothesis so long as its use has not awakened in us the higher consciousness of a universal order. By deepened knowledge of things and their process of becoming, we must come to recognize Numbers as a truth, and to experience with our senses the living relation of a cause to an effect, this relation being truer and more real than the effect could ever be. Published in 1917 under the author's given name of Ren  Schwaller, A Study of Numbers is the first expression of the teachings we have come to associate with his later and better known name, R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz. It is a masterly account of the living, universal, qualitative, and casual reality of numbers. Starting from the irreducible one, Schwaller deals with the unfolding of creation through the cycles of polarization, ideation, and formation. Topics covered include: numbers, values, and relations; the disengagement of numbers; the harmonic basis of numbers; the development of values; and the establishment of harmony.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LXhkHAAACAAJ&dq=A+Study+of+Numbers:+A+Guide+to+the+Constant+Creation+of+the+Universe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"David Charlesworth's Furniture-Making Techniques (v. 1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5MUPAQAAMAAJ&dq=David+Charlesworth%27s+Furniture-Making+Techniques+(v.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children's group programming: Ideas and suggestions","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=042a_Q0uySoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The forever Christmas tree","description":"The Christmas bells are chiming across the Outer Banks town of Bell Cove, North Carolina, but there s one local  grinch  who s not listening . . .

Goodhue's eclectic \\"planted patios and shaded portales, sheltering walls, and Persian pools\\" set the tone for the campus's illustrious architectural future. Throughout the first half of the century, Caltech's nearly continuous expansion would spawn such architectural jewels as the Athenaeum, a combination Italian villa and Spanish hacienda; Greene and Greene's bungalow-style student union; and the gardens of landscape architects Beatrix Ferrand and Florence Yoch, who thoughtfully mixed the campus's Mediterranean themes with its natural California setting. Well-researched and informative, this book details the organizational and architectural elements that have made Caltech a model for scientific institutions the world over. Rare photographs of lost and altered buildings portray an early Pasadena with ambitious plans to become a cultural mecca, while contemporary images reflect the Institute's continued dedication to a rich architectural future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O0JUAAAAMAAJ&dq=Caltech%27s+Architectural+Heritage,+From+Spanish+Tile+to+Modern+Stone&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Liberty","description":"A wonderful edition... -- Irving Louis Horowitz, Rutgers UniversityAlexander should be commended for making this invaluable material accessible to scholars and students... -- Maria H.

It's gloomy and makes things obscure. Darkness is disorienting and robs things of their identity, creating a fear of the unknown. Perhaps this is why this picture is used so often in Scripture to describe the devil's domain. Satan and his forces are constantly working in the shadows to draw us back into darkness. Never forget you have been created to thrive in the warmth of God's marvelous light. With God's strength, you can fight off the forces of spiritual darkness. In \\"The Devil's Domain,\\" you can learn more about spiritual darkness and equip yourself to find the spiritual victory promised to all who believe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9x7yrQEACAAJ&dq=The+Devil%27s+Domain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Are You a Champion for Christ?: Understanding and Identify the Attributes of a Champion and How to Win in Life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"THE PATRIOT.","description":"Another brilliant example of Evan Connell's art, The Patriot deals with an American boy who grew to maturity with World War II. He had learned his father's patriotism, and then, through the impact of firsthand experience, formulated his own. Melvin Isaacs, aged seventeen, became a Navy Air Force cadet in 1942. His course of training as a flyer was an education in fear and death, even though it had its wonderfully comic times and a sense of comradeship that was new to him. Perhaps it was in the air for Melvin loved to fly that the first feelings of aloneness stirred his mind. Melvin, who queried the whys and wherefores of his regimented training life, became, despite all efforts to conform, a maverick. This portion of the novel is a touching and true mixture of human comedy and tragedy, and it also embodies scenes of flight and danger that are unmatched for pure vividness and sensate realism. The story of Melvin after the war is a continuation of the absurdities that can pursue a man so constituted that he must think for himself. And here the implications of the novel become clear. It is partly the ageold story of a father and son in conflict, of an older generation's notions that are insupportable to the younger, a human dilemma that has no possible resolution. It is also the story of Melvin's final rejection of war, of his unshakeable conviction that a man today must think and act for the good of the planet, Stephen Decatur's slogan notwithstanding. With too many excellences to catalogue and extol, the novel has a total effect of a new voice telling a new story of this old familiar world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i5b3wAEACAAJ&dq=THE+PATRIOT.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lighting the stage;: Art and practice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ubYcAQAAIAAJ&dq=Lighting+the+stage%3B:+Art+and+practice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Heart Leaps Up (Chapters 3 and 4 Booklet Series No 26)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ER3cOAAACAAJ&dq=My+Heart+Leaps+Up+(Chapters+3+and+4+Booklet+Series+No+26)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TOMS, COONS, MULATTOES, MAMMIES, & BUCKS - An Interpretive History Of Blacks In American Films","description":"Annotation This classic study of black images in American motion pictures, this year enjoys its thirtieth anniversary of continuous publication through four editions, and is now available in a special hardcover gift edition, having sold over 200,000 copies in paperback.

Shenandoah: The Memoirs of Lieutenant Commanding James I. Waddell","description":"The last shot of the Civil War was fired, not on an obscure battlefield, but in the ice-locked Sea of Okhotsk off Siberia seven months after Lee s surrender. The last armed Confederate cruiser was the C.S.S. Shenandoah, a beautiful but dangerous vessel which scattered and burned the New Bedford whaling fleet in Arctic waters. She was the last cruiser sent to sea by James Dunwoody Bulloch, the captain who built the Confederacy s navy in the shipyards of Europe. Constructed at a cost of  53,715, the Shenandoah captured thirty-eight ships and burned thirty-two. She inflicted damage to Union commerce which was officially judged at $1,361,983. She took 1,053 prisoners. In fact, she took so many her skipper, Lieutenant-Commanding James Waddell, had to rig a chain of whaleboats that could be towed along by his vessel, to accommodate captured Union seamen and the crews of the whalers he had burned. A few years after the war, Waddell wrote his account of the Shenandoah s great cruise, and it is published here complete for the first time. He tells of his own career in the United States Navy and in the Confederate Navy, and also of the events leading up to his taking command of the Shenandoah.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cHAdVkOGiWQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The XIT Ranch of Texas and the early days of the Llano Estacado (Western frontier library)","description":"Among the famous ranch brands of Texas are the T Anchor, JA, Diamond Tail, 777, Bar C, and XIT. And the greatest of these was XIT The XIT Ranch of Texas. It was not the first ranch in West Texas, but after its formation in the eighteen-eighties it became the largest single operation in the cow country of the Old West and covered more than three million acres, all fenced. The state of Texas patented this huge rectangle of land, at the time considered by many to be part of \\"the great American desert,\\" to the Capitol Freehold Land and Investment Company of Chicago, in exchange for funds to erect the state capitol building in Austin. This \\"desert\\" became a legend in the cattle business, and it remains today a memory to thousands who recall the era when mustangs and longhorns grazed beneath the brand of the XIT. The development and operation of this pastoral enterprise and its relation to the history of Texas is the subject of this great and widely discussed book by J. Evetts Haley, now made available to readers every  where. It is the story of a wild prairie, roamed by Indians, buffalo, mustangs, and antelope, that became a country of railroads, oil fields, prosperous farms, and carefully bred herds of cattle. The XIT Ranch of Texas is the epic account of a ranching operation about which many know a little but only a few very much. It is the one volume that, more than any other, portrays the early-day cattle business of the West.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cuXgSKacKo4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Noodlehead Stories","description":"A collection of folktales from around the world, all featuring the character of the fool, with tips for telling the stories aloud, related activities, and source notes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XFZzDktykwgC&dq=Noodlehead+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HTML Style Sheets Design Guide: The Web Professional's Guide to Building and Using Style Sheets","description":"A full-color introduction to the basics of HTML and CSS from the publishers of Wrox!

Hopkins s music directly and indirectly influenced an amazing range of artists, including Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Tom Waits, and Bob Dylan, as well as bands such as the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and ZZ Top, with whom Hopkins performed. Mojo Hand follows Lightin  Hopkins s life and music from the acoustic country blues that he began performing in childhood, through the rise of 1950s rock  n  roll, which nearly derailed his career, to his reinvention and international success as a pioneer of electric folk blues from the 1960s to the 1980s. The authors draw on 130 vivid oral histories, as well as extensive archival and secondary sources, to provide the fullest account available of the development of Hopkins s music; his idiosyncratic business practices, such as shunning professional bookers, managers, and publicists; and his durable and indelible influence on modern roots, blues, rock  n  roll, singer-songwriter, and folk music. Mojo Hand celebrates the spirit and style, intelligence and wit, and confounding musical mystique of a bluesman who shaped modern American music like no one else.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3H7QFe_p5AoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Water runs downhill : a history of the Indianapolis Water Company and other centenarians","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9hhvAAAAMAAJ&dq=Water+runs+downhill+:+a+history+of+the+Indianapolis+Water+Company+and+other+centenarians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spice Ingredients Cookbook","description":"Spices and herbs, also called seasoning, are an important part of cooking, if not the most important.

While other books plot out the battles and examine the participation of the German divisions on the Westfront, there are no books that discuss the shared experience of both sides. Uniquely, Fritz and Tommy examines the commonality of frontline experience. Significantly the book is the result of a close collaboration between a British and a German military historian, both well-placed to draw comparisons and highlight differences. Drawing upon unique archives, Peter Doyle and Robin Sch?fer examine the soldiers  lives, and examine cultural and military nuances that have so far been left untouched. Mapping out the lives of the men in the trenches, ultimately it concludes that Fritz and Tommy were not that far apart, geographically, physically, or emotionally. The soldiers on both sides went to war with high ideals; they experienced horror and misery, but also comradeship/kameradschaft. And with increasing alienation from the people at home, they drew closer together, the Hun transformed into  good old Gerry  by the war s end.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F3gTDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Amazing Results of Positive Thinking","description":"\\"This is a result book....It is the story of the thrilling things that happened to people when they applied the principles of dynamic change to their lives.\\" -- Norman Vincent Peale This accessible, all-encompassing guide will help you to achieve success and confidence, a sense of well-being, and an inner strength that you never dreamed possible.

The angel was pure as one could be -- purity never before seen. The angel was called to duty, as Christ was, not to save the world from sin, but was asked to take part in a great mission saving lives with the use of education and love helping to divert the devastating consequences of the AIDS epidemic during the late 1970s and 1980s. This was during a time when there was a sudden, explosive increase in this disease.

The fateful interaction by the so-called \\"Judas,\\" Mike Kessell, Beth's boyfriend, in the story seems incongruously introduced in the turning point.

Among the deaths, love affairs, and small town gossip, a love story emerges at the heart of the novel-between Dr. Sachs and a young woman upon whom he once performed an abortion.

Getting it wrong can leave a room looking bland and insipid or overpowering and garish; getting it right is both exciting and rewarding. Here, leading authority on interior design, Caroline Clifton-Mogg, guides you expertly through every aspect of using colour in the home, from choosing the right scheme for the right room to adding the perfect finishing touches. The first hurdle is finding inspiration, so advice is offered on applying the lessons of nature, art, and history to your home. Caroline then explores colour in depth, delving into the nuances of the interior decorator's palette. All colours have hidden subtleties and resonances--think of the rich brown of tanned leather, the gray-blue of a frozen pond, the faded purple of old velvet--and, depending on how they are used, they can make or break a room's design. No colour works in isolation, and successful colour combination is the only way to achieve a winning design scheme. \\"The Color Design Source Book\\" shows a wide range of classic and unusual looks--sometimes subtle and sophisticated, sometimes bold and humorous, but always stylish and inspirational. The book also offers advice on using colours to create the atmosphere you want or to affect the shape or size of a room. A frosty living room becomes a haven of comfort; an oppressive hallway, a welcoming entrance; and a dreary kitchen becomes the heart of the home. Finally, the mysteries of professional colour finishes are unraveled, from selecting the right paints for the job to applying decorative finishes or even using textiles to cover your walls. So, whether you are planning a whole new look or simply enhancing an existing scheme with a fresh splash of colour, \\"The Color Design Source Book\\" shows how to make colours really work for you in every room of your home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pk8wGQAACAAJ&dq=The+Color+Design+Sourcebook:+Using+Fabrics,+Paints&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Notre-Dame de Paris","description":"The gypsy street dancer Esmeralda captures the hearts of many men, including those of Captain Phoebus and Pierre Gringoire, but especially Quasimodo and his guardian Archdeacon Claude Frollo.

Teachers and researchers explore the role of grammar in the teaching of writing and describe ways that grammar instruction has been, is, and should be used in our writing programs. The contributors share their insights from a variety of perspectives: as college composition teachers, as writing center directors, as rhetoricians, as students, and as writers themselves. They are not grammarians in the conventional sense. Rather, they are voices from various writing settings who show college writing teachers how to reconnect writing and grammar. Divided into three sections, the book allows for a progressive observation of the places of grammar in writing instruction. In the section on past attitudes toward grammar instruction, the contributors discuss the history of teaching grammar as it relates to teaching writing. In the section on present concerns, contributors re-evaluate the belief that little grammar instruction is needed to teach writing. In the final section, contributors evaluate what we have learned with a view to what we need to learn or teach the next generation of writing teachers about the role of grammar.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0kJZAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Place+of+Grammar+in+Writing+Instruction:+Past,+Present,+Future&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Skinny Eighth Avenue","description":"Skinny Eight Avenue is a surreal and extraordinarily witty intrusion into the flow of postmodern life, altering its course and in doing so disclosing the assumptions of its power.

Jaime Lara contends that the design of missionary centers, or so-called \\"fortress monasteries,\\" can only be understood against the backdrop of the eschatological concerns of the age and the missionary techniques of the mendicant friars. Lara argues that these architectural constructions are quasi-theatrical sets for elaborate educational and liturgical events that served as rehearsals for the last age of world history. By analyzing the iconography associated with the Aztec religion and with Euro-Christian apocalyptic texts, Lara has been able to trace a consistent thread through two distinct religious and liturgical imaginations. Lara's narrative is supported by more than 225 images.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aFd2QgAACAAJ&dq=City+Temple+Stage:+Eschatalogical+Architecture+and+Liturgic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The BBI Dictionary of English Word Combinations: Using the BBI Combinatory Dictionary of English: A workbook with exercises","description":"While many professional translators believe the ability to translate is a gift that one either has or does not have, Allison Beeby Lonsdale questions this view. In her innovative book, she demonstrates how teachers can guide their students by showing them how insights from communication theory, discourse analysis, pragmatics, and semiotics illuminate the translation process. Challenging long-held assumptions, she establishes a fascinating framework on which to base the structure of a professional prose-translation class. Her original contributions to the question of directionatliy and to the specific strategies of tranlsating are applicable to not only the teaching of translation from Spanish to English, but to other teaching situations and to other pairs of languages as well. She also reviews the latest attempts in translation theory to define and contextualize ideal translator competence, student translator competence, and general translation strategies. Beeby Lonsdale completes her book by applying her conclusions to selecting and organizing the content of teaching translation from Spanish to English. She illustrates one or more of the basic translation principles through 29 teaching units, which are prefaced by objectives, tasks, and commentaries for the teacher, and through 48 task sheets, which show how to present the material to students.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qW2kiADQhHQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Painting and the Market in Early Modern Antwerp (Yale Publications in the History of Art)","description":"This study of the ways in which Flemish painting between 1550 and 1650 reflected the burgeoning capitalism of Antwerp, focuses not only on the market-scene paintings, but also on the interaction between painters and markets as it was influenced by merchants, governments and consumers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wl-Ii1RCzegC&dq=Painting+and+the+Market+in+Early+Modern+Antwerp+(Yale+Publications+in+the+History+of+Art)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Golf After 50: Playing Without Pain","description":"Addressing the specific needs of mature golf enthusiasts, a guide on how to minimize game-compromising pain discusses how to avoid common injuries, implement common-sense nutritional practices, and overcome such maladies as shoulder pain and hip replacement discomfort.

In this book, award-winning sociologist Elaine Howard Ecklund questions this assumption based on research she has conducted over the past 15 years. She highlights the ways these two spheres point to universal human values, showing readers they don't have to choose between science and Christianity. Breathing fresh air into debates that have consisted of more opinions than data, Ecklund offers insights uncovered by her research and shares her own story of personal challenges and lessons. In the areas most rife with conflict--the origin of the universe, evolution, climate change, and genetic technology--readers will find fascinating points of convergence in 8 virtues of human existence: curiosity, doubt, humility, creativity, healing, awe, shalom, and gratitude. The book includes discussion questions for group use and to help pastors, small group leaders, and congregants broach controversial topics and bridge the science-faith divide.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D9bIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who's Haunting the Eighth Grade (Junior High)","description":"An eighth grade class trip turns scary when the lights go out at the old boarding house where the students are staying and they begin to hear strange noises.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XSM3A_rUaFAC&dq=Who%27s+Haunting+the+Eighth+Grade+(Junior+High)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Options in Contemporary Christian Ethics","description":"This update of a classic text evaluates contemporary ethical options and pressing issues of the day from a biblical perspective.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2oGqaL9-LZgC&dq=Options+in+Contemporary+Christian+Ethics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early Writings of Gustave Flaubert","description":"No history of literature could afford to overlook Gustave Flaubert, the meticulous craftsman whose Madame Bovary and Sentimental Education are enduring classics. His finished novels are easily available, but his earliest works have been the private province of professional scholars. Early Writings is the first English translation of Flaubert?s astonishing juvenilia, astonishing not only because of its glimmers of genius but also because of its fantasy. Now readers will be able to see the contours of Flaubert?s career more fully; no note how much effort he took to learn and unlearn, to overcome and suppress. The eleven essays ad tales in this collection include about half of Flaubert?s early experiments in writing. They reveal the eye of a precocious artist who used everything from routine newspaper accounts to the psychopathology of his everyday life as material for fiction. His transformation of reality is best exemplified by ?Diary of a Madman,? based on a chance encounter of the pubescent Gustave with Elisa Schlesinger at Trouville during the summer of 1836. The range of his youthful imagination is illustrated by pieces in the Byronic mold, by caricature of philistine values, epic scenes, metaphysical themes, the fantastic genre of the ?wild tale,? and psychological studies that anticipate his larger portrayals of character. Early Writings reveals the young writer working toward more complex tableaux, increasingly preoccupied with the tension between language and art, medium and ideal. From the beginning Flaubert was obsessed by the daunting task of making language eternalize fleeting perceptions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SU9OwCiN7X0C&dq=Early+Writings+of+Gustave+Flaubert&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Radiation and Human Health","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RHlrAAAAMAAJ&dq=Radiation+and+Human+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Delta Sisters","description":"From Essence bestselling author Kayla Perrin comes the compelling story of three generations of African-American women---of their deepest secrets and most cherished lies. The Grayson family is a pillar of the African-American community in New Orleans. But Sylvia Grayson, the matriarch, has deep secrets that she conceals beneath a veneer of propriety. She keeps a tight rein on her daughter, Olivia, and has the perfect life mapped out for her: go to college, join the Delta sorority, and marry the proper boy. After the town's \\"bad girl\\" is found murdered one summer day in 1975, Sylvia pulls Olivia even closer. But when Olivia's one last attempt at rebellion is subverted by her mother, Sylvia's relentlessly tight hold shatters the ties between them. Years later, Olivia's own daughter, Rachelle, is trying to make her way in the world. Olivia does not want to make the same mistakes as her mother, nor does she want her daughter to repeat the errors Olivia made out of rebellion. Meanwhile, a killer is watching from the shadows, determined to bring the secrets of the past to light. The Delta Sisters is a gripping, intimate portrait of what happens when these passionate women have to band together at last in the face of danger.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2P9kAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Middle of the Fire","description":"In this daring expose by a survivor of a unique era in the New York occult scene, James Wasserman, a longtime proponent of the teachings of Aleister Crowley, brings us into a world of candlelit temples, burning incenser, and sonorous invocations. The author also shares an intimate look at the New York Underground if the 1970s and introduces us to the company of such avant-garde luminaries as Alejandro Jodorowsky, Harry Smith and Angus MacLise. A stone's throw away form the Velvet Underground and Andy Warhol's Factory, William Burrough's \\"bunker,\\" and the legendary Chelsea Hotel was a scene far more esoteric than perhaps even they could have imagined. When James Wasserman joined the O.T.O. in 1976, there were fewer than a dozen members. Today the Order numbers over 4,000 members in 50 countries and has been responsible for a series of groundbreaking publications of Crowley's works. The author founded New York City's TAHUTI Lodge in 1979. He chronicles its early history and provides a window into the heyday of the Manhattan esoteric community. This is also a saga with a very human tableau filled with tender romance, passionate friendships, an abiding spiritual hunger, danger, passion, and ecstasy. It also explores several hidden magical byways including the rituals of Voodoo, Tibetan Buddhism, and Sufism. Reconstructed from personal memories, magical diaries, multiple interviews, court transcripts, witness depositions, trial evidence, and extensive correspondence, this book elucidates a hithero misreported and ill-understood nexus of modern magical history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ux96JEl-DuoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Those of My Blood","description":"In the world of the future, Titus Shiddehara has a unique heritage.

But Titus can't be killed quite so easily; and when he embarks on a space mission to save Earth, he encounters his fiancee once again. Once again Titus's \\"father\\" threatens to destroy her--and perhaps Titus too. Can the lovers be reunited--and can they rescue the Earth from certain invasion?

Lewis A Life, Alister McGrath, prolific author and respected professor at King s College of London, paints a definitive portrait of the life of C. S. Lewis. After thoroughly examining recently published Lewis correspondence, Alister challenges some of the previously held beliefs about the exact timing of Lewis s shift from atheism to theism and then to Christianity.

This river, the longest in the world, flowed through the desert, bringing life in its floodwater every year. Where did all this water come from? Christopher Ondaatje, long fascinated with Richard Burton and wishing to relive his 1856 African exploration, prepared for this journey by studying the expeditions of several Victorian travellers, for each had returned with part of the answer to the Nile's riddle. In 1996 Ondaatje followed the Victorian explorers' routes, to see for himself what they had seen. Although acutely aware that their claims of \\"discovering\\" a mountain or river were ridiculous, he quickly realized that he was indeed on a journey of discovery, and that the search for truth is often about finding new and better questions, not just answers. His trek across the Serengeti Plains to Olduvai Gorge provides the most striking revelation of all: the forces which shaped the Nile may also have triggered the evolution of the human race.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zCpD4V381GEC&dq=Journey+to+the+Source+of+the+Nile&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The outbreak of rebellion (Campaigns of the civil war)","description":"John G. Nicolay (18321901) was an undeniably apt and brilliant choice to inaugurate the landmark Campaigns of the Civil War series. Private secretary to President Lincoln and coauthor (with John Hay) of the monumental, ten-volume Lincoln biography, Nicolay experienced the Civil War from a unique vantage point: living in the White House, witnessing the many momentous events and minor wranglings, sharing the nation's trauma with Lincoln, and winning his open confidence. It is Nicolay's firsthand knowledge and personal observations of the key figures that imbue The Outbreak of Rebellion (1881) with immediacy and thrust. Here is the secession fever that swept the South; Lincoln's shrewd and desperate maneuverings to hold the border states; the behind-the-scenes debates about how to respond to the crisis; the attack on Fort Sumter and the call to arms; and the hard-fought battle along Bull Run creek that resulted in a chaotic Federal defeat and the first appalling casualties of the war. Nicolay's insider view of the opening act of the Civil War has produced a succinct, compelling account of considerable value and fascinating insights.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BUDzswEACAAJ&dq=The+outbreak+of+rebellion+(Campaigns+of+the+civil+war)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gluten-Free Friends: An Activity Book for Kids","description":"An activity/coloring book to help gluten-free kids understand how to make the right food choices on a gluten-free diet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QECxAAAACAAJ&dq=Gluten-Free+Friends:+An+Activity+Book+for+Kids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edward Stratemeyer: Creator of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew (Who Wrote That?)","description":"CHBiographies","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S_9bAgAAQBAJ&dq=Edward+Stratemeyer:+Creator+of+the+Hardy+Boys+and+Nancy+Drew+(Who+Wrote+That%3F)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Happy Days and Wonder Years: The Fifties and the Sixties in Contemporary Cultural Politics","description":"In the twenty-first century, why do we keep talking about the Fifties and the Sixties? The stark contrast between these decades, their concurrence with the childhood and youth of the baby boomers, and the emergence of television and rock and roll help to explain their symbolic power. In Happy Days and Wonder Years, Daniel Marcus reveals how interpretations of these decades have figured in the cultural politics of the United States since 1970. From Ronald Reagan's image as a Fifties Cold Warrior to Bill Clinton's fandom for Elvis Presley and John F. Kennedy, politicians have invoked the Fifties and the Sixties to connect to their public. Marcus shows how films, television, music, and memoirs have responded to the political nostalgia of today, and why our entertainment remains immersed in reruns, revivals, and references to earlier times. This book offers a new understanding of how politics and popular culture have influenced our notions of the past, and how events from long ago continue to shape our understanding of the present day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iVJhCnsxWzEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Artistas","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zl8cjF-fIVoC&dq=Artistas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outlaws: A Quest for Butch and Sundance","description":"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were legendary figures even in their own time, and their lives are shrouded in myth and controversy.

The range of such products is vast: from agrochemicals to pigments, from detergents to foods, from plastics to pharmaceuticals. However, surveys of the performance of processes designed to produce particulate products have consistently shown inadequate design and poor reliability. \`Particle technology' is a new subject facing new challenges. Chemical and process engineering is becoming less concerned with the design of plants to produce generic simple chemicals (which are often single phase fluids) and is now more concerned with speciality \`effect' chemicals which may often be in particulate form. Chemical and process engineers are also being recruited in increasing numbers into areas outside their tranditional fields, such as the food industry, pharmaceuticals and the manufacture of a wide variety of consumer products. This book has been written to meet their needs. It provides comprehensive coverage of the technology of particulate solids, in a form which is both accessible and concise enough to be useful to engineering and science students in the final year of an undergraduate degree, and at Master's level. Although it was written with students of chemical engineering in mind, it will also be of use and interest to students of other disciplines. It comprises an account of the fundamentals of teh subject, illustrated by worked examples, and followed by a wide range of selected applications.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oCnyCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scrapbook of the American West","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cXhiQwAACAAJ&dq=Scrapbook+of+the+American+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sacred Hoop: Recovering the Feminine in American Indian Traditions","description":"Almost thirty years after its initial publication, Paula Gunn Allen s celebrated study of women s roles in Native American culture, history, and traditions continues to influence writers and scholars in Native American studies, women s studies, queer studies, religion and spirituality, and beyond This groundbreaking collection of seventeen essays investigates and celebrates Native American traditions, with special focus on the position of the American Indian woman within those customs.

This new collection of essays sharpens the focus on the nature of cities by exploring the facets of an urban ecocriticism, by reminding city dwellers of their place in ecosystems, and by emphasizing the importance of this connection in understanding urban life and culture. The editors?both raised in small towns but now living in major urban areas?are especially concerned with the sociopolitical construction of all environments, both natural and manmade. Following an opening interview with Andrew Ross exploring the general parameters of urban ecocriticism, they present essays that explore urban nature writing, city parks, urban \\"wilderness,\\" ecofeminism and the city, and urban space. The volume includes contributions on topics as wide-ranging as the urban poetry of English writers from Donne to Gay, the manufactured wildness of a gambling casino, and the marketing of cosmetics to urban women by idealizing Third World \\"naturalness.\\" These essays seek to reconceive nature and its cultural representations in ways that contribute to understanding the contemporary cityscape. They explore the theoretical issues that arise when one attempts to adopt and adapt an environmental perspective for analyzing urban life. The Nature of Cities offers the ecological component often missing from cultural analyses of the city and the urban perspective often lacking in environmental approaches to contemporary culture. By bridging the historical gap between environmentalism, cultural studies, and urban experience, the book makes a statement of lasting importance to the development of the ecocritical movement.

As the great balloon bearing the image of a clock swoops across the River Grande, Pauly Caton watches her husband of four days fall from the sky. Who is the naked child who scrambles from the gondola when it strikes a sandbar and flees? Did she just imagine it? Why would he have been up with Randy and the pilot on the honeymoon ride she was too chicken to join? Who, in fact, was meant to die? And meant to die it was   her hastily snapped photos of the scene show a masked sharpshooter stationed high up in a tree. As Pauly tries to put her shattered life together, she discovers the lies. The first in the morgue. How else had Randy deceived her? Had he told her anything that was the truth? Were his partners in their get-rich company any more honest?

Bikers, con artists, drunk drivers, drug dealers - they're all on Mickey Haller's client list. For him, the law is rarely about guilt or innocence, it's about negotiation and manipulation. Sometimes it's even about justice. A Beverly Hills playboy arrested for attacking a woman he picked up in a bar chooses Haller to defend him, and Mickey has his first high-paying client in years. It is a defense attorney's dream, what they call a franchise case. And as the evidence stacks up, Haller comes to believe this may be the easiest case of his career. Then someone close to him is murdered and Haller discovers that his search for innocence has brought him face-to-face with evil as pure as a flame. To escape without being burned, he must deploy every tactic, feint, and instinct in his arsenal - this time to save his own life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bZoibWwaSNoC&dq=The+Lincoln+Lawyer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Short History of The Catholic Church","description":"In this extraordinary book, the renowned Hans Kung chronicles the Roman Catholic Church s role as a world power throughout history.

In 1941, when Germany turned against the USSR, tens of thousands of Poles men, women, and children who were starving, sickly, and impoverished were released from Soviet prison camps and allowed to join the Polish Army being formed in the south of Russia. One of the survivors who made the difficult winter journey was the painter and reserve officer J zef Czapski. General Anders, the army s commander in chief, assigned Czapski the task of receiving the Poles arriving for military training; gathering accounts of what their fates had been; organizing education, culture, and news for the soldiers; and, most important, investigating the disappearance of thousands of missing Polish officers. Blocked at every level by the Soviet authorities, Czapski was unaware that in April 1940 many officers had been shot dead in Katyn forest, a crime for which Soviet Russia never accepted responsibility. Czapski s account of the years following his release from the camp and the formation of the Polish Army, and its arduous trek through Central Asia and the Middle East to fight on the Italian front offers a stark depiction of Stalin s Russia at war and of the suffering, stoicism, and bravery of his fellow Poles. A work of clear observation and deep compassion, Inhuman Land is one of the twentieth century s indispensable acts of literary witness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oOeODwAAQBAJ&dq=The+inhuman+land&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Home Wine Cellar","description":"This popular classic, which is based on the author's personal experiences of building a wine cellar in his home and collecting wines for fun and investment, is now completely updated for the modern wine collector.

Regardless of her response, she needs to know that she can and will make it through this difficult time. And she needs to know that--no matter how it feels--she is not alone. More than two decades ago, author Lois Mowday Rabey experienced firsthand the confusion and devastation that follows a husband's death. When Your Soul Aches is an intimate collection of inspiration and insights born of that journey through grief. Every woman who has been rocked by the loss of her partner will find relief in Rabey's vulnerable and touching account of her real-life experiences and those of dozens of other widows. Every widow's pain is unique. So are her circumstances and her experience. Yet she shares many questions and concerns with other women who have lost their husbands--ones that may be best addressed with the help of those who have previously walked through the fire. Such is the help found in the pages of When Your Soul Aches. Written by a widow who remained single for ten years while raising her two daughters, it offers invaluable guidance to women facing the painful emotions and difficult challenges of widowhood. Compassionate, empathetic, and wise, this book gently encourages those grieving the loss of their husbands to be honest about their feelings. At the same time, it offers real hope that life, though forever changed, can be sweet and good once again.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s8dvDwAAQBAJ&dq=When+Your+Soul+Aches:+Hope+and+Help+for+Women+Who+Have+Lost+Their+Husbands&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Internet Jobs: The Complete Guide to Finding the Hottest Jobs on the Net","description":"For more than 20 years, Network World has been the premier provider of information, intelligence and insight for network and IT executives responsible for the digital nervous systems of large organizations.

The endowments are granted for outstanding innovative and comprehensibly documented research.This book offers an innovative approach to three interlaced topics: A systematic analysis of the morphosyntatic organization of Nivkh (Paleosiberian); a cross-linguistic investigation of complex noun forms (parallel to complex (polysynthetic) verb forms); and a typology of polysynthesis. Nivkh (Gilyak) is linguistically remarkable because of its highly complex word forms, both verbs and nouns. They are formed productively from ad hoc concatenation of lexical roots in dependent ? head relations without further morphological marking: primary object ? predicate, attribute - noun, noun ? relational morpheme (\\"adposition\\"). After an in-depth examination of the wordhood of such complexes the morphological type of Nivkh is explored against the background of polysynthesis, noun incorporation, verb root serialization, noun complexes and head/dependent marking. For this purpose, a new delimitation and classification of polysynthesis is proposed on the basis of an evaluation of 75 languages. Besides contributing to a reconciliation of previous diametrically opposed approaches to polysynthesis, this study challenges some common preconceived notions with respect to how languages \\"should be\\".","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z9pz0obAMgcC&dq=Dependent-Head+Synthesis+in+Nivkh:+A+contribution+to+a+typology+of+polysynthesis+(Typological+Studies+in+Language)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Alchemist's Daughter (Harlequin Historical)","description":"THE QUEST FOR SECRETS HAD DESTROYED ONE MAN SHE LOVED.

Weaving together issues in cognitive development, philosophy, and cognitive psychology, he reconciles numerous theories, backed by empirical evidence from nominal kinds studies, natural-kinds studies, and studies of fundamental categorical distinctions. He shows that all this evidence, when put together, leads to a better understanding of semantic and conceptual development.The book opens with an analysis of the problems of modeling qualitative changes in conceptual development, investigating how concepts of natural kinds, nominal kinds, and artifacts evolve.The studies on nominal kinds document a powerful and unambiguous developmental pattern indicating a shift from a reliance on global tabulations of characteristic features to what appears to be a small set of defining ones. The studies on natural kinds document an analogous shift toward a core theory instead of simple definition. Both sets of studies are strongly supported by cross cultural data.While these patterns seem to suggest that the young child organizes concepts according to characteristic features, Kell argues that there is a framework of conceptual categories and causal beliefs that enables even very young children to understand kinds at a deeper, theoretically guided, level. This account suggests a new way of understanding qualitative change and carries strong implications for how concepts are represented at any point in development.Frank Keil is Professor of Psychology at Cornell University and Co Director of the Cognitive Studies Program at Cornell.

Nation: Retelling the Life","description":"Carry A. NationRetelling the Life Fran Grace The story of one of America's most notorious and misunderstood women. Carry Nation was 54 when she \\"smashed\\" her first saloon, but her life before she started her infamous hatchet crusade has been little known until now. In this first scholarly biography of Nation, Fran Grace unfolds a story that often contrasts with the image of Nation as \\"Crazy Carry,\\" a bellicose, blue-nosed, man-hating killjoy. Using newly available archival materials and placing Nation in her various historical and cultural contexts, Grace \\"retells\\" the crusader's tumultuous life. Brought up in antebellum Kentucky, Nation lived through the devastation of the Civil War and endured a failed marriage to an alcoholic physician. In her early 20s, a single mother and a destitute widow, she experienced a spiritual crisis. Her second marriage, to a much-older David Nation, grew strained under the failure of their Texas farm, her exploration into Holiness religion, and her attempts to work outside the home. When the couple moved to Kansas, Nation's disappointments translated into an agenda for social reform. Frustrated by the rampant violations of the state's prohibition law and empowered by a sense of divine mission, Nation responded with rocks, crowbars, and hatchets. Though much of her last two decades was spent on stage or in jail and in battles with other family members over the future of her unstable adult daughter, she edited two newspapers and founded several homes for abused and needy women. This complexly woven and delightfully written biography adds depth to the popular image of Carry Nation, situating her at the center of major cultural currents in her time.

At the end of World War II, hardly anyone in public life would admit to being a conservative, but as Lee Edwards shows in this magisterial work, in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, a small group of committed men and women began to chip away at the liberal colossus, and their descendants would scale the ramparts of power in the 1980s and 1990s. Not even the fall of Newt Gingrich has changed the indisputable fact that the movement has truly rewritten the rules of American political life, and the republic will never be the same. Edwards tells the stories of how conservatives built a movement from the ground up by starting magazines, by building grass-roots organizations, and by seizing control of the Republican party from those who espoused collaboration with the liberals and promised only to manage the welfare state more efficiently and not to dismantle it. But most of all he tells the story of four men, four leaders who put their personal stamp on this movement and helped to turn it into the most important political force in our country today: * Robert Taft, \\"Mr. Republican,\\" the beacon of conservative principle during the lean Roosevelt and Truman years * Barry Goldwater, \\"Mr. Conservative,\\" the flinty Westerner who inspired a new generation * Ronald Reagan, \\"Mr. President,\\" the optimist whose core beliefs were sturdy enough to subdue an evil empire * Newt Gingrich, \\"Mr. Speaker,\\" the fiery visionary who won a Congress but lost control of it By their example and vision, these men brought intellectual and ideological stability to an often fractions conservative movement and held the high ground against the pragmatists who would compromise conservative principles for transitory political advantage. And through their efforts and those of their supporters, they transformed the American political landscape so thoroughly that a Democratic president would one day proclaim, \\"The era of big government is over.\\" Political history in the grand style, The Conservative Revolution is the definitive book on a conservative movement that not only has left its mark on our century but is poised to shape the century about to dawn.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jn9mEDvqdZAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emma (Progress English)","description":"Emma is beautiful, clever and rich.

Besides his predilection for creating tall tales around his early life as a scoundrel, Mundy could create larger than life heroes. Unlike creations like Robert E. Howard's \\"Conan\\" or Edgar Rice Burroughs' \\"John Carter of Mars,\\" Mundy's heroes, while courageous and plenty brawny when the situation required it, were capable of bluffing, playing one enemy versus another, and exploiting the character flaws of foes, and the fortes of his associates -- traits largely absent in other adventure heroes of the time. Also, like Mundy himself, his characters pondered the meaning of life, of destiny, a spiritual development that would mold their characters and set them apart from the typical pulp heroes. \\"In 'The Seventeen Thieves of El-Kalil, ' Jimgrim is sent to Hebron to defuse a situation where the Moslem population, led by a family of thieves, is intent on slaughtering the Jewish population. It takes all of Jimgrim's savvy to play off the different factions until help can arrive from Jerusalem. If I had one warning about the stories for today's readers it is that while Mundy could hardly be accused of racism, his characters' views do reflect 1920s attitudes about the ethnic/religious groups of the region.\\" --Georges T.

And, confusingly, many of the British women detectives who have made it to American television are far from typical of the latest women detectives. This work is a study of British detective fiction with female protagonists written by women. Authors included are P.D. James, Jennie Melville, Liza Cody, Val McDermid, Joan Smith and Susan Moody. Special attention is paid to the evolution of the British female sleuth from the 1960s to the year 2000, particularly the 1980s, and how this shaped and altered detective fiction. Also discussed is the effect of the British judicial system and gun laws on detective fiction and real life, the types of crimes women detectives usually investigate, why certain directions have been taken and which ones may be taken in the future, issues being raised by the authors, and new women authors of detective fiction with female protagonists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tnPGIKaVgUcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trial by Jury: Vocal Score","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kF4IAQAAMAAJ&dq=Trial+by+Jury:+Vocal+Score&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meter Maid (Career Examination Passbooks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0OYfygEACAAJ&dq=Meter+Maid+(Career+Examination+Passbooks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dumb But Lucky!: Confessions of A P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II","description":"Second lieutenant Dick Curtis arrived in Italy in May 1944twenty years old and part of a shipment of P-51 Mustang fighter pilots so desperately needed that they were rushed into combat with less than thirty hours of flight time in their new high-performance aircraft. Six of the twelve pilots assigned to the 52nd Fighter Group were shot down in the first two weeks. By his ninth mission, Curtis was the only one still flying. A maverick, he barely escaped court-martial with his high-flying antics. Escorting bombers sent to pound heavily defended oil fields was risky enough, but strafing the enemy supply lines, ports, and airfields was even more dangerous. Curtis may chalk up his success to dumb luck, but these missions took exceptional skill and courage. This hair-raising account captures the air war in all its split-second terror and adrenaline-pumping action.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EZbu3npYUkgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Do You Really Need Surgery?: Do You Really Need Surgery?

However, instead of serving just as an account of Adams  deeds, The Education of Henry Adams is a series of observations and introspections Adams makes on social changes, scientific advancements, personal relationships, professional success, travel, religion, war, and education. Born into the privilege of wealth and the renowned success of his ancestors, President John Adams and President John Quincy Adams, Adams received an education from notable schools, such as Harvard. He continued his prestigious education in Berlin, studying law and the German language. Despite his formal education, Adams felt unprepared to face the changing dynamics of his country, including shifts in social, religious, political, and scientific beliefs. For this reason, Adams advocates for  self-education  through experience, friendships, and reading. In his autobiography, Adams endorses studying American history and science in school, and encourages the process of self-educating after one s formal education. With a set of strong political and religious beliefs, Adams invokes a substantial impression with his perspectives on the on-going transformation of the United States of America. Henry Adams  autobiography, The Education of Henry Adams, has earned remarkable acclaim, including receiving a Pulitzer Prize. As a man who had direct access to many American political offices, including the presidential cabinet, the senate, and the congress, Adams had an intimate view of the innerworkings of American politics, and lived through social changes such as the Civil War, the abolition of slavery, scientific advancements, shifts in religious views, and the first World War. Though he felt his formal education left him unprepared for such happenings, Adams encourages readers to learn from their experiences and relationships. The Education of Henry Adams offers invaluable insight on the rapid changes in society, and reminds readers that one s education is never finished. Now with a new, eye-catching cover design and reprinted in a modern font, The Education of Henry Adams by Henry Adams is more accessible than ever and able to offer modern-day readers insight on historical events and philosophy of learning that will always be relevant.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nPIIEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to economic science","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NegsAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Siraiki saqafat","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CB7gAAAAMAAJ&dq=Siraiki+saqafat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star-Making Machinery: Inside the Business of Rock and Roll","description":"Follows the musicians, engineers, technicians, and others involved in the making of a typical rock album, from initial concept through packaging and marketing, detailing the entire process of those involved","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XaAwAQAAIAAJ&dq=Star-Making+Machinery:+Inside+the+Business+of+Rock+and+Roll&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Well with My Soul: Four Dramatic Stories of Great Hymn Writers","description":"The stories behind many favorite hymns are as inspiring as the hymns themselves!

The word  Trappist  has become synonymous with  ascetic  and definitely indicates a monk who leads a very hard life. But . . . Penance and asceticism are not ends in themselves. If monks never succeeded in being more than pious athletes, they do not fulfill their purpose in the Church. If you want to understand why the monks lead the life they do, you will have to ask, first of all, What is their aim?  In his bestselling memoir, The Seven Storey Mountain, Catholic poet, theologian, and mystic Thomas Merton chronicled his journey to becoming a Cistercian monk of the Abbey of Gethsemani, Kentucky. In The Waters of Siloe, he provides an enlightening account of the Cistercian Order, better known as the Trappists. With clarity and wisdom, Merton explores the history of the Cistercian Order from its founding in 1098, its development and waning, and the seventeenth-century reforms by the Abb  de Ranc , which began the second flowering that continues today. Throughout, Merton illuminates the purposes of monasticism and its surprising resurgence in America and elsewhere.  Only Thomas Merton could have written single-handed this history of Trappist monks, for it is a work of diverse gifts and skill, an ardent collaboration of scholar and story-teller, priest and poet.

Drawing on an original study of non-professional, 'ordinary' users at home, this book examines how people interpret, domesticate and creatively appropriate the Internet by integrating it into the projects and activities of their everyday lives. Maria Bakardjieva's theoretical framework uniquely combines concepts from several schools of thought (social constructivism, critical theory, phenomenological sociology) to provide a conception of the user as an agent in the field of technological development and new media shaping.

Who will step in to protect the public interest? The government, right? Wrong. The romantic view of bureaucrats coming to the rescue confuses the true relationship between economics and politics. Politicians often cite \\"market failure\\" as justification for meddling with the economy, but a group of leading scholars show the shortcomings of this view. In Government Failure, these scholars explain the school of study known as \\"public choice,\\" which uses the tools of economics to understand and evaluate government activity. Gordon Tullock, one of the founders of public choice, explains how government \\"cures\\" often cause more harm than good. Tullock provides an engaging overview of public choice and discusses how interest groups seek favors from government at enormous costs to society. Displaying the steely realism that has marked public choice, Tullock shows the political world as it is, rather than as it should be. Gordon Brady scrutinizes American public policy, looking closely at international trade, efforts at regulating technology, and environmental policy. At every turn Brady points out the ways in which interest groups have manipulated the government to advance their own agendas. Arthur Seldon, a seminal scholar in public choice, provides a comparative perspective from Great Britain. He examines how government interventions in the British economy have led to inefficiency and warns about the political centralization promised by the European Community. Government Failure heralds a new approach to the study of politics and public policy. This book enlightens readers with the basic concepts of public choice in an unusually accessible way to show the folly of excessive faith in the state.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=slqQAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Beatles Gift Pack","description":"Songs, with piano acc., chord symbols and guitar chord notation","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0DMjzwEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Beatles+Gift+Pack&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Los Padres Tambin Aman (Father's Love Letters ) (Spanish Edition)","description":"This third edition of this text presents the major grammatical contrasts between English and Spanish in a simple and direct manner that is ideal for teachers of either language.

The next three chapters explain the approaches to nature therapy, which is broken down into animal assisted, horticultural, and natural environment therapies. Each section contains the history, research, problems, evaluation, and resources for each therapy. The last five chapters form a handbook which contains ways to utilize nature therapy. Individual and group techniques are discussed, and examples are provided for experiences and activities in the area of nature therapy. The experiences are written as lesson plans, and are organized into animal, horticultural, and environmental activities. Guidelines are provided for bringing animals into the office or classroom. Federal and state laws are described, and issues are discussed concerning breeding the office or classroom pet, animals used in science projects, insect collections, white mice, hamsters and gerbils, rabbits, birds, cats, dogs, farm animals, and wild animals.

It is alive and growing in Canada, Russia, China, Italy, Belgium, Britain, and even the United States Yet secession remains one of the least studied and least understood of all historical and political phenomena. The contributors to this volume have filled this gap with wide-ranging investigations -- rooted in history, political philosophy, ethics, and economic theory -- of secessionist movements in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Is secessionism extremist, a dangerous rebellion that threatens the democratic process? Gordon and his contributors think otherwise. They believe that the secessionist impulse is a vital part of the classical liberal tradition, one that emerges when national governments become too big and too ambitious. Unlike revolution, secession seeks only separation from rule, preferably through non-violent means. It is based on the moral idea, articulated by Ludwig von Mises in 1919, that \\"no people and no part of a people shall be held against its will in a political association that it does not want. The authors cite the famed 1861 attempt to create a confederacy of Southern states as legal, right, and a justifiable response to Northern political imperialism. They note that this was not the first American secession attempt -- the New England states tried to form their own confederacy during the War of 1812. This evidence, they argue, begs a reinterpretation of the U.S. Constitution along secessionist lines. Further they believe that the threat of secession should be revived as a bulwark against government encroachmenton individual liberty and private property rights, a guarantor of international free trade, and a protection against attempts to curb the freedom of association. These straightforward, pellucid arguments include essays by Donald Livingston, Murray N. Rothbard, Clyde Wilson, Thomas DiLorenzo, and Bruce Benson, among others. If overgrown nations continue to decompose, as they have for the last decade, these authors believe it is essential that secession be taken seriously, and fully understood. Secession, State, and Liberty makes a vital contribution toward that end. This stimulating, thought-provoking collection is necessary reading for intellectual historians and political scientists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eNPAngEACAAJ&dq=Secession,+State,+and+Liberty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raggedy Ann and Andy help Santa Claus (A little golden book)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"50 Great Kitchens by Architects","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N_TizQEACAAJ&dq=50+Great+Kitchens+by+Architects&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Climbing Mount Everest: Understanding Commutative, Associative, And Distributive Properties (Powermath)","description":"Commutative, associative, and distributive properties of mathematics are used in relation to a climb up Mount Everest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HGf9d1_kXqAC&dq=Climbing+Mount+Everest:+Understanding+Commutative,+Associative,+And+Distributive+Properties+(Powermath)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last Generation","description":"Includes new introduction dated July 1994.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ShG4ax577ncC&dq=Last+Generation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A wonder book (Junior library)","description":"Inspired by the life of pioneering female baseball player Alta Weiss, and dramatized by Terry Widener s bold illustrations, Girl Wonder tells the unforgettable story of a true American original.

In addition, he uses the theme of Newton as a 'sort of middle man' to explore the religious understanding of a whole generation who knew themselves as 'evangelical' although this was different from those who later adopted the term as a badge of partisan loyalty. The author shows how Newton is related to other Church of England evangelicals, Methodists, and various Dissenting bodies, and how his life sheds light on little explored aspects of the Evangelical Revival which contribute to an understanding and reassessment of the eighteenth-century church. In addition to discussion of themes in historical theology, pastoralia, and spirituality, an analysis of conversion narrative, the familiar letter, and hymnody contribute to an understanding of the relationship between religion and culture more generally.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CCwHAGwJfJcC&dq=John+Newton+and+the+English+Evangelical+Tradition:+Between+the+Conversions+of+Wesley+and+Wilberforce&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colour Scheme: Library Edition","description":"Change the way you see color forever in this dazzling collection of color palettes spanning art history and pop culture, and told in writer and artist Edith Young's accessible, inviting style.

The novel was made into a silent film in 1920, another silent film in 1926 and a talking film in 1936 with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. starring as the protagonist, Barnabas Barty.The format of the novel is essentially that of a bildungsroman. It tells the story of Barnabas Barty, the son of John Barty, the former boxing champion of England and landlord of a pub in Kent. At the start of the tale, Barnabas comes fortuitously into the possession of a vast fortune - ?700,000, an astronomical amount by Regency standards - and determines to use this fortune to become a gentleman. His father objects to this plan and they quarrel. They settle their differences in a round of fisticuffs, which Barnabas wins, beating his father fair and square. Barnabas sets off for London to further his ambitions and, on the way there, contrives to make a number of influential friends and enemies.[1]Farnol exploits the na?vety of the youth for comic effect. For instance, Barnabas is gulled by the chapman who sells him a book on etiquette at an outrageous mark-up. At the other end of the spectrum, Farnol is equally disdainful of Barnabas' sophisticated concealment of his identity","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jm-ZAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Amateur+Gentleman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steel Magic","description":"A girl and her two brothers are transported back to the time of King Arthur, where they must return three magic talismans to their rightful owners or remain trapped forever in the distant past The adventure begins when Sara Lowry wins a picnic basket at the Firemen s Strawberry Festival.

Second edition","description":"This is a thoroughly updated edition of Dynamic Asset Pricing Theory, the standard text for doctoral students and researchers on the theory of asset pricing and portfolio selection in multiperiod settings under uncertainty. The asset pricing results are based on the three increasingly restrictive assumptions: absence of arbitrage, single-agent optimality, and equilibrium. These results are unified with two key concepts, state prices and martingales. Technicalities are given relatively little emphasis, so as to draw connections between these concepts and to make plain the similarities between discrete and continuous-time models. Readers will be particularly intrigued by this latest edition's most significant new feature: a chapter on corporate securities that offers alternative approaches to the valuation of corporate debt. Also, while much of the continuous-time portion of the theory is based on Brownian motion, this third edition introduces jumps--for example, those associated with Poisson arrivals--in order to accommodate surprise events such as bond defaults. Applications include term-structure models, derivative valuation, and hedging methods. Numerical methods covered include Monte Carlo simulation and finite-difference solutions for partial differential equations. Each chapter provides extensive problem exercises and notes to the literature. A system of appendixes reviews the necessary mathematical concepts. And references have been updated throughout. With this new edition, Dynamic Asset Pricing Theory remains at the head of the field.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f2Wv-LDpsoUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chattahoochee","description":"This useful guide traces the Chattahoochee's 430-mile course through 200 color photographs, 32 maps, and detailed practical information about public access points, potential hazards, and camping facilities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=824eBAAAQBAJ&dq=Chattahoochee&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Positive Power: 5 Keys to a Higher Leadership Profile","description":"Can a good company become a great one and, if so, how?After a five-year research project, Collins concludes that good to great can and does happen.

Always at the heart of discussions in social theory, the definition and specification of  the city  nonetheless remains illusive. In this volume, Phil Hubbard locates the concept of  the city  within current traditions of social thought, providing a basis for understanding its varying usages and meanings through a critical discussion of the contribution of key authors and thinkers. Written in a lively and accessible style, the individual chapters of City offer a thematic overview of four dominant ways of approaching cities: as lived-in places as imagined spaces as networks of association as technologies of flow. Drawing on a diverse range of literatures and case studies, the book spells out the importance of a geographical perspective on the city, suggesting that it is only by bringing these different ways of mapping the city together that we can begin to make sense of cities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1-p-AgAAQBAJ&dq=City+(Key+Ideas+in+Geography)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Houses of Old Cuba","description":"This superbly illustrated book reveals a Cuban architectural heritage that was hidden from view before the resurgence of tourism in this fascinating Caribbean island.

In it, the author analyzes \\"old masteries,\\" certain notions of freedom, individualism, and control long associated with the Renaissance, in relation to the ideologies of non-mastery that recur in theory today. This book has a dual purpose. First, it recontextualizes the debates on freedom and determinism presented by five \\"masters\\" - Petrarch, Luther, Loyola, Teresa of Avila, and Galileo - by showing that their paradigmatic discourses on will share a distinct rhetorical strategy. Second, it argues that the dominant critical paradigms of the late twentieth century, while ostensibly rejecting and transcending early modern ideas of subjecthood, actually recast Renaissance debates on freedom and power.

The book, which is self contained, begins with background material from mathematics, computers, and neurophysiology; this is followed by a step by step development of the memory model. The concluding chapter describes an autonomous system that builds from experience an internal model of the world and bases its operation on that internal model. Close attention is paid to the engineering of the memory, including comparisons to ordinary computer memories. Sparse Distributed Memory provides an overall perspective on neural systems. The model it describes can aid in understanding human memory and learning, and a system based on it sheds light on outstanding problems in philosophy and artificial intelligence. Applications of the memory are expected to be found in the creation of adaptive systems for signal processing, speech, vision, motor control, and (in general) robots. Perhaps the most exciting aspect of the memory, in its implications for research in neural networks, is that its realization with neuronlike components resembles the cortex of the cerebellum.

Johnson and the Ethics of Command (Modern War Studies)","description":"A man of extraordinary inner strength and patriotic devotion, General Harold K. Johnson was a soldier's officer, loved by his men and admired by his peers for his leadership, courage, and moral convictions. Lewis Sorley's biography provides a fitting testament to this remarkable man and his dramatic rise from obscurity to become LBJ's Army Chief of Staff during the Vietnam War. A native of North Dakota, Johnson survived more than three grueling years as a POW under the Japanese during World War II before serving brilliantly as a field commander in the Korean War, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for \\"extraordinary heroism.\\" The latter experiences led to a series of high-level positions that culminated in his appointment as Army chief in 1964 and a cover story in Time magazine. What followed should have been the most rewarding period of Johnson's military career. Instead, it proved to be a nightmare, as he quickly became mired in the politics and ordeal of a very misguided war. Johnson fundamentally disagreed with the three men LBJ, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, and General William Westmoreland running our war in Vietnam. He was sharply critical of LBJ's piecemeal policy of gradual escalation and his failure to mobilize the national will or call up the reserves. He was equally despondent over Westmoreland's now infamous search-and-destroy tactics and reliance on body counts to measure success in Vietnam. By contrast, he advocated greater emphasis on cutting the North's supply lines, helping the South Vietnamese provide for their own internal defenses, and sustaining a truly legitimate government in the South. Unheeded, he nevertheless continued to work behind the scenes to correct the nation's flawed approach to the war. Sorley's study adds immeasurably to our understanding of the Vietnam War. It also provides an inspiring account of principled leadership at a time when the American military is seeking to recover the very kinds of moral values exemplified by Harold K. Johnson. As such, it presents a profound morality tale for our own era.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CPF2AAAAMAAJ&dq=Honorable+Warrior:+General+Harold+K.+Johnson+and+the+Ethics+of+Command+(Modern+War+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lord of Thunder","description":"Relates the events of an uprising on the planet Arzor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TfrocAAACAAJ&dq=Lord+of+Thunder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ascension","description":"Recent theology offers few attempts to come to grips with the meaning and implications of the ascension of Jesus.

He explores the link between ideas of the ascension, cosmology and ecclesiology. Farrow goes on to examine the difficulties faced by the doctrine of ascension in the modern scientific world.

There are witches and mental patients in chains. There are judges who take the time to care; the murder of Rocky and Curly.

Anthony Lukas, High-Risers braids personal narratives, city politics, and national history to tell the timely and epic story of Chicago s Cabrini-Green, America s most iconic public housing project. Built in the 1940s atop an infamous Italian slum, Cabrini-Green grew to twenty-three towers and a population of 20,000 all of it packed onto just seventy acres a few blocks from Chicago s ritzy Gold Coast. Cabrini-Green became synonymous with crime, squalor, and the failure of government. For the many who lived there, it was also a much-needed resource it was home. By 2011, every high-rise had been razed, the island of black poverty engulfed by the white affluence around it, the families dispersed. In this novelistic and eye-opening narrative, Ben Austen tells the story of America s public housing experiment and the changing fortunes of American cities. It is an account told movingly though the lives of residents who struggled to make a home for their families as powerful forces converged to accelerate the housing complex s demise. Beautifully written, rich in detail, and full of moving portraits, High-Risers is a sweeping exploration of race, class, popular culture, and politics in modern America that brilliantly considers what went wrong in our nation s effort to provide affordable housing to the poor and what we can learn from those mistakes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NIHXDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"While the Gods Play: Shaiva Oracles and Predictions on the Cycles of History and the Destiny of Mankind","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Foundations of Vision","description":"Foundations of Low Vision: Clinical and Functional Perspectives, the ground-breaking text that highlighted the importance of focusing on the functional as well as the clinical implications of low vision, has been completely updated and expanded in this second edition.

Drawing on a wide array of sources--including tabloid journalism, popular fiction, movies, and television shows--Philip Jenkins argues that a remarkable confluence of panics, scares, and a few genuine threats created a climate of fear that led to the conservative reaction. He identifies 1975 to 1986 as the watershed years. During this time, he says, there was a sharp increase in perceived threats to our security at home and abroad. At home, America seemed to be threatened by monstrous criminals--serial killers, child abusers, Satanic cults, and predatory drug dealers, to name just a few. On the international scene, we were confronted by the Soviet Union and its evil empire, by OPEC with its stranglehold on global oil, by the Ayatollahs who made hostages of our diplomats in Iran. Increasingly, these dangers began to be described in terms of moral evil. Rejecting the radicalism of the '60s, which many saw as the source of the crisis, Americans adopted a more pessimistic interpretation of human behavior, which harked back to much older themes in American culture. This simpler but darker vision ultimately brought us Ronald Reagan and the ascendancy of the political Right, which more than two decades later shows no sign of loosening its grip. Writing in his usual crisp and witty prose, Jenkins offers a truly original and persuasive account of a period that continues to fascinate the American public. It is bound to captivate anyone who lived through this period, as well as all those who want to understand the forces that transformed--and continue to define--the American political landscape.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t3RDzkqR_88C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who's in Charge Here?: Overcoming Power Struggles With Your Kids","description":"From Dr. Bob Barnes comes this book showing how to discipline children with consistency and love without feeling guilty or causing anger and resentment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=anjw-D0I4KIC&dq=Who%27s+in+Charge+Here%3F:+Overcoming+Power+Struggles+With+Your+Kids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shopping Guide for Caring Consumers 1999: A Guide to Products That Are Not Tested on Animals (Shopping Guide for Caring Consumers: A Guide to Products That Are Not Tested on Animals)","description":"A comprehensive directory of cosmetics, household, and personal care product companies that have made a compassionate commitment not to test on animals.

Issues covered include categories of public and private schools and variations in academic performance and socioeconomic status therein; controversies surrounding school choice, including school vouchers and charter schools; accountability and assessment of private and public schools; debates about school environment, safety, and curricula; and teacher and administrator quality. All of these issues are examined in individualized entries, with objective responses grounded in up-to-date evidence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aF89EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Hundred More Poems from the Japanese (A New Directions book)","description":"A collection of Japanese poems accompanied by their English translations","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G8mYAA8CaSkC&dq=One+Hundred+More+Poems+from+the+Japanese+(A+New+Directions+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ramopakhyana - The Story of Rama in the Mahabharata: A Sanskrit Independent-Study Reader","description":"Based on the most popular story in all of India and a classic of world literature, this fully annotated reader is intended for independent study or classroom use for students of various levels who have had a basic introduction to Sanskrit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j6yhtj0uQTkC&dq=Ramopakhyana+-+The+Story+of+Rama+in+the+Mahabharata:+A+Sanskrit+Independent-Study+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Late Night Thoughts on Listening to Mahler's Ninth Symphony","description":"This magnificent collection of essays by scientist and National Book Award-winning writer Lewis Thomas remains startlingly relevant for today s world. Luminous, witty, and provocative, the essays address such topics as  The Attic of the Brain,   Falsity and Failure,   Altruism,  and the effects the federal government s virtual abandonment of support for basic scientific research will have on medicine and science. Profoundly and powerfully, Thomas questions the folly of nuclear weaponry, showing that the brainpower and money spent on this endeavor are needed much more urgently for the basic science we have abandoned and that even medicine s most advanced procedures would be useless or insufficient in the face of the smallest nuclear detonation. And in the title essay, he addresses himself with terrifying poignancy to the question of what it is like to be young in the nuclear age.  If Wordsworth had gone to medical school, he might have produced something very like the essays of Lewis Thomas.  TIME  No one better exemplifies what modern medicine can be than Lewis Thomas.

Jabotinsky was a Russian poet, playwright, journalist, and novelist as well as the founder of Revisionist Zionism and of Betar. His oratory in many languages was legendary. Katz first heard him speak in South Africa in the early part of the 20th century and was so impressed that he dropped out of university to work for Revisionist Zionism. Katz recounts Jabotinsky s efforts to create the Jewish Legion during World War I, traces the history of Jewish relations with the British during the time of the Palestine Mandate, describes Jabotinsky s role in the defense of the Jewish Yishuv and in organizing the Af-Al-Pi  illegal  Jewish immigration to Palestine before World War II. He paints a vivid mural of competing Jewish personalities, factions and ideologies in the decades before the establishment of Israel.  Shmuel Katz has written an intelligent, journalistic account of Jabotinsky s life [ ] and was able to use a substantial amount of previously unavailable material, particularly British archival documents. Although Katz clearly has tremendous respect and affection for Jabotinsky, he does not hesitate to criticize him, for example, for his ineffectiveness as a fundraiser [...] Lone Wolf s greatest strength is its comprehensive breadth. Every major event and many minor incidents are extensively covered. Furthermore, Katz has taken the rather unorthodox move of including verbatim large sections of Jabotinsky s original speeches and writings.    Paul Radensky, H-Net  [S]cholarly and yet totally gripping... we must be everlastingly grateful [...] to Shmuel Katz for so masterfully giving [Jabotinsky s] memory fresh life... this [book]   quiet, calm, and, while certainly partisan, without a single shrill note   may one day help to direct the course of Israel s seemingly endless argument with itself.

But as we reach the new millennium, the question needs to be asked: has this project of analysis and reconstruction based upon feminist principles run its natural course?

More than 20 years later, hospitalized for acute Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, he once again faced his personal demons. This work expands the memoir to include his post-war struggles with the US government and his own wounded psyche. He describes the shock of capture and ensuing long march to Pyokdong, North Korea, Camp 5 on the Yellow River, where many prisoners died of untreated wounds, disease, hunger, paralyzing cold, and brutal mistreatment in the bitter winter of 1950-51. He recounts Chinese attempts to mentally break down prisoners in order to exploit them for propaganda. He then takes the reader through typical days in a prisoner's life, discussing food, clothing, shelter, and work; the struggle against unremitting boredom; religious, social, and recreational diversions; and even those moments of terror when all seemed lost. It refutes Cold War-era propaganda that often unfairly characterized POWs as brainwashed victims or even traitors who lacked the grit that Americans expected of their brave sons.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IfJz0bwaURYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Words Of My Roaring","description":"\\"I was electioneering.

But the ghosts aren't the only problem. Mystery surrounds the hotel, too, as Johnny discovers reports of people who have gone missing from inside the hotel. Is there something supernatural haunting Johnny's guests ... or is it something much more human? Prostitution, gambling, and drugs run rampant on the island, due to the influences of the odious gang known as the Japanese Yakuza, and also by a Chinese Tong and several local criminal types. They may have something to do with the murders at the hotel. Johnny calls in reinforcements a private investigator, a retired Los Angeles Sheriff 's sergeant, and even an FBI agent. Together, they might be able to solve the mysteries. Johnny can't help but make time for love. The hotel's attorney, Jan Nan, has caught his attention. She's pretty, ambitious, and focused more so on her job than on a relationship. Johnny doesn't give up easily, though. He is committed to solving the mysteries and stopping the violence at his hotel.

Hollingshead Jr. first projected a movie onto a white bedsheet stretched between two trees at his home in Camden, New Jersey, in 1933, little did he know that he was on the verge of creating an entirely new entertainment industry. With America just beginning its romance with the automobile, it's no surprise that the general public found this new form of moviegoing irresistible. Fun and affordable, the drive-in quickly gained popularity among families with young children. And, of course, the local drive-in was a favorite weekend hangout for teenagers: a place where they could go just to meet friends or take a sweetheart for a romantic evening of movies under the stars. Although drive-ins are no longer as popular as they once were, in many communities a devoted following still seeks out the open-air theaters at twilight. Cinema Under the Stars\\"\\" is a reminder of those wonderful times, as well as a recounting of the history of the drive-in experience. Here is the story, and here are the memories: B movies, concession stands loaded with goodies, screen towers, ticket booths, scratchy speakers, speaker poles, and intermission.

Rapid developments in technology have revolutionized the libraries' means and mission, while declining budgets have adversely impacted the ability of librarians to carry out their roles. The literature of academic librarianship today reflects these changes and points to the direction in which academic libraries are headed. This book is a comprehensive guide to book chapters and articles written on academic librarianship between 1990 and 1993. Entries for nearly 1,700 works are grouped in six topical chapters for ease of use. Each entry includes an informative annotation that summarizes the key points made by the authors, the major findings of research projects, and the names and locations of libraries with innovative programs. Extensive author, article, book/journal title, and subject indexes conclude the work. The volume is a useful tool for locating specific information on various topics, and it is a forecast of the future of academic libraries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pGRT2_PpMIIC&dq=The+Armies+of+East+Asia:+China,+Taiwan,+Japan,+and+the+Koreas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Praise & Worship Collection Mb","description":"Rejection from other people can distress, wound, and imprison the soul. Equally harmful, the praise of man is also a snare, capable of disqualifying God's servants from their highest inheritance. Bob Sorge reveals in this brief book how the truths that set us free from both extremes are amazingly similar. This book answers some crucial questions which grip virtually every believer: What do I do when others demean or hurt me? And how should I respond when others honor or compliment me? Rejection and praise are like twin gullies that flank the narrow highway of holiness. Every step counts. For Jesus, man's opinions were meaningless in light of the exuberant affection and passionate approval of His Father. Let God's truth set you free from the power of rejection's woundings and from the entrapment of man's praises. Learn how to hold your heart before God in a way that pleases Him in the midst of both rejection and praise from people.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QT2S6A1ECIcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wellington (Armed Services edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VLq5tAEACAAJ&dq=Wellington+(Armed+Services+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Glencoe (IL) (Images of America)","description":"Glencoe, Illinois, \\"Queen of Suburbs,\\" has long been heralded as an idyllic place to live. Situated on Lake Michigan in the heart of Chicago's North Shore, Glencoe was first settled in 1835 by Anson Taylor, a young storekeeper. Glencoe began to thrive thanks to one of its famous early residents, Walter Gurnee, president of the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad. Gurnee moved to Glencoe in the mid-1850s and in 1855 established a railroad stop across the street from his home. His presence accounts for the town's accessibility and nucleus, but it was the vision of Dr. Alexander Hammond, who arrived in Glencoe in 1867, that helped to shape it into the model suburban town it has become. It is the people of the past and present who are at the heart of this community. This collection of over 200 images captures the heart and spirit of this all-American suburb, from the village's founding and early history as a farming community and utopian settlement to the annual Fourth of July parades that continue to trumpet through the town's center.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4rRvpvjG3kQC&dq=Glencoe+(IL)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Design for the real world: Human ecology and social change","description":"Design for the Real World has, since its first appearance twenty-five years ago, become a classic.

Yet \\"making\\" peace and \\"doing\\" justice must remain challenges that are among the highest callings of humanity especially in a terror-heightened world. Nigel Biggar, Christian ethicist and editor of this now more than ever \\"must read\\" (Choice) volume, newly expanded and updated, addresses head-on the concept of a redemptive burying of the past, urging that the events of that infamous date be approached as a transnational model of conflict-and suggesting, wisely and calmly, that justice can be even the better understood if we should undertake the very important task of locating the sources of hostility, valid or not, toward the West. Burying the Past asks these important questions: How do newly democratic nations put to rest the conflicts of the past? Is granting forgiveness a politically viable choice for those in power? Should justice be restorative or retributive? Beginning with a conceptual approach to justice and forgiveness and moving to an examination of reconciliation on the political and on the psychological level, the collection examines the quality of peace as it has been forged in the civil conflicts in Rwanda, South Africa, Chile, Guatemala and Northern Ireland. There are times in history when \\"making peace\\" and \\"doing justice\\" seem almost impossible in the face of horrendous events. Those responses are understandably human. But it is in times just like these when humanity can and must rise to its possibilities and to its higher purposes in order to continue considering itself just and humane.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3eN8eBXPycsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A plague of all cowards (Ace science fiction special)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8vaVGAAACAAJ&dq=A+plague+of+all+cowards+(Ace+science+fiction+special)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A World Full of Strangers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Own9twEACAAJ&dq=A+World+Full+of+Strangers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to tell others about Islam","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=The1lqctWeMC&dq=How+to+tell+others+about+Islam&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Two-Step: The Dance Towards Intimacy","description":"Equating the struggle to achieve intimacy with the choreography of a simple dance, the author demonstrates how easy it can be to sidestep conflicts of power and distance and transform them into a meaningful closeness","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jMXcwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Two-Step:+The+Dance+Towards+Intimacy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The sculptor's way;: A guide to modeling and sculpture,","description":"A guide to modeling and sculpture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xbtZ-RaZ1NcC&dq=The+sculptor%27s+way%3B:+A+guide+to+modeling+and+sculpture,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marienthal: The Sociography of an Unemployed Community","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Naked Liberty","description":"NAKED LIBERTY is a captivating memoir of Carolyn Resnick's detailed account of how she gained a magnetic connection with horses.

His techniques have spawned countless imitators, most of whom pay lip service to the buzzword \\"contrarian,\\" but few can match his performance. His Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund has been the leader since its inception in 1988 -- the number one equity-income fund among all 208 ranked by Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. Dreman is also one of a handful of money managers whose clients have beaten the runaway market over the past five, ten, and fifteen years. Now, as the longest bull market in the history of the stock market winds down, there is increasing volatility and a great deal of uncertainty. This is the climate that tests the mettle of the pros, the worries of the average investor, and the success of David Dreman's brilliant new strategies for the next millennium. Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation shows investors how to outperform professional money managers and profit from potential Wall Street panics -- all in Dreman's trademark style, which The New York Times calls \\"witty and clear as a silver bell.\\" Dreman reveals a proven, systematic, and safe way to beat the market by buying stocks of good companies when they are currently out of favor. At the heart of his book is a fundamental psychological insight: investors overreact. Dreman demonstrates how investors consistently overvalue the so-called \\"best\\" stocks and undervalue the so-called \\"worst\\" stocks, and how earnings and other surprises affect the best and worst stocks in opposite ways. Since surprises are a way of life in the market, Dreman shows you how to profit from these surprises with his ingenious new techniques, most of which have been developed in the nineties. You'll learn: Why contrarian stocks offer extra protection in bear markets, as well as delivering superior returns when the bull roars. Why a high dividend yield is just as important for the aggressive investor as it is for \\"widows and orphans.\\" Why owning Treasury bills and government bonds -- the \\"safest investments\\" for centuries -- is like being fully margined at the top of the 1929 market. Why Initial Public Offerings are a guaranteed loser's game. Why you should avoid Nasdaq (\\"the market of the next hundred years\\") like the plague. Why crisis, panic, and even market downturns are the contrarian investor's best friend. Why the chances of hitting a home run using the Street's best research are worse than being the big winner in the New York State Lottery. Based on cutting-edge research and irrefutable statistics, David Dreman's revolutionary techniques will benefit professionals and laymen alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zk8NMSoMDs4C&dq=Contrarian+Investment+Strategies+-+The+Classic+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 2)","description":"The Frankenstein story is updated to the 21st century by the great American storyteller Dean Koontz.

You wouldn't want to, and the people you lead wouldn't want you to either. The best leaders lead from their strengths. You want to lead in the way that works best for you. Only I can lead my way, and sometimes it's pretty bizarre. According to a fund-raising consultant, I'm not very presidential. I consider this high praise. We have to work within our basic dispositions to be effective. Unfortunately, a lot of parents, coaches, and inspirational speakers try to get us to believe otherwise. Commencements are breeding grounds for these aggrandizing lies, and it's the speakers who are doing the lying. Leading People from the Middle addresses 20th century leadership assumptions, the new dynamics of 21st-century leadership, and how leaders can change to meet the demands of today's organizations. Over the course of this book, the author, William P. Robinson discusses his understanding of leading from the middle as it refers to influencing from among, rather than from above, below, or in front of one's group. Leading from the middle refers to positioning ourselves alongside of those whom we've empowered, working shoulder to shoulder. It refers to living in the center of a mission, rather than simply lifting it up. He believes that leaders will set the standard and then work very hard to help their people achieve the group's goal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0o7XZZqmLz8C&dq=Leading+People+from+the+MIddle:+The+Universal+Mission+of+Heart+and+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manual on Demonology: Diary of an Exorcist","description":"Demonology (the study, classification and activities of demons) is \\"invading\\" the kingdom of Satan.

(Read the following Scriptures: St. John 12:31, 14:30, 16:11 and Ephesians 2:2.) Satan tried to stop the ministry of Jesus Christ in the wilderness by offering Jesus all the kingdoms of this world. (Read St. Matthew, Chapter 4.) Jesus used the word of God against Satan, continually telling him it is written...An exorcist, as one who drives out evil spirits, must do everything according to God's word. He cannot go beyond the authority that God has given him. No one can cast Satan and his demons \\"back to the pit.\\" His time is not yet and he knows it. Let us refer to St. Matthew 8:29.We must learn to rightly divide God's word because the demons know their rights. No one can take rights away from the devil that God has permitted him to have. Even Jesus could not torment the demons before their time by casting them back to the pit. The Word of God must be fulfilled. Again, their time is not yet. But the time will come.Knowledge according to the Word of God gives you power. Ask yourself, what does God say about it. When Christ came, he came to invade the kingdom of Satan. He also called unto Him his twelve disciples, and later seventy disciples and gave them power. He sent them out two by two and they invaded the kingdom of Satan. This is the ministry of Jesus Christ. (Read St. Matthew, Chapter 10 and also St. Luke, Chapter 10.) This is what demonology and the work of an exorcist are all about. Christ committed this work to the church. The ministry of Jesus Christ, to this day, has not changed. Ministries have changed, but the ministry of Jesus Christ has not. Neither has God's Word changed.When an individual receives the baptism of the Holy Spirit, he is snatched away from Satan's kingdom. The whole of heaven rejoices when a sinner repents. But this does not stop Satan from trying to snatch that soul back. If there were no deliverance ministers and if everyone was fighting against demonology, just imagine the state that churches would be in. If I, and other deliverance ministers, do not invade the kingdom of Satan, many souls will be lost to suicide, homosexuality, depression, lust, fear, witchcraft and thousands of other demonic spirits.Dealing as an exorcist, one must first have the anointing and be exercising wisdom and knowledge. Every deliver?ance minister should be able to operate in the gift of Discernment according to I Corinthians, Chapter 12. To \\"discern\\" means to be able to tell the difference between the flesh (person-ality of the person) and the spirit; what is of God and what is of the devil. Demons can take over the personality of a person and manifest themselves in his speech and actions. If we cannot discern, we will be talking to and sometimes arguing with demons and not know it. We must also discern what is of God. Sometimes the Holy Spirit is working through a person and because we do not discern it to be so, we attribute the works of the Holy Ghost to the devil. However, everything is not God and everything is not a demon. Sometimes it is just the flesh. (Read Romans Chapter 7.) We must discern the difference.The original Apostles have gone from the scene, but we are continuing their works. Remember Jesus said in St. John 14:12, \\"Verily, verily I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=22ezzgEACAAJ&dq=Manual+on+Demonology:+Diary+of+an+Exorcist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Folktales of the Amur: Stories from the Russian Far East","description":"A collection of 31 traditional tales from that far eastern part of Russia that lies along the banks of the Amur River.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6ibXAAAAMAAJ&dq=Folktales+of+the+Amur:+Stories+from+the+Russian+Far+East&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Sierra Club Naturalist's Guide to the North Woods of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota (Sierra Club Naturalist's Guides)","description":"An all-purpose field guide covering the North Woods of the upper Midwest, beginning with a detailed geological history of the region, then moving to a description of the nine typical plant communities and details of the region's abundant wildlife, before becoming a guide to public lands for the recreationist and vacationer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=01DwAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Sierra+Club+Naturalist%27s+Guide+to+the+North+Woods+of+Michigan,+Wisconsin,+and+Minnesota+(Sierra+Club+Naturalist%27s+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hiawatta, witt no odder poems","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rrkRAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The God who loves","description":"\\"God is love.\\" It's the most basic definition of God in Scriptures, but so profound that it's often misunderstood. In this probing book, a brilliant Bible expositor brings us into the very heart of God by answering such questions as: If God is love, how could He send anyone to hell? What's the difference between the loving God of the New Testament and the angry God of the Old Testament? If God is love, why did He require His Son to die such a cruel death on the Cross? How can God be both loving and jealous? The author argues against the two polar views of God as a sentimental grandfather whose doting love could not bring him to punishment of the disobedient and God as an angry tyrant who would rule by threats. \\"Both extremes paint a distorted picture of God and further confuse the issue of understanding God's love,\\" Dr. MacArthur writes. He insists that what God loves is actually defined by what He hates, and that neither His love nor His wrath can be understood in isolation from the other. Although the author is clearly aware of the way great men have grappled with these issues in the history of the Church, his doctrinal presentations arise more from the biblical text than from dogmatic theology. He examines in detail the way John?\\"the apostle of love\\"?treats love in his First Epistle, then fleshes out the doctrine of God's love in vivid representations of real people interacting with divine love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7wQq6ef-1u8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Campaign contributions by political parties: ideology vs. winning.: An article from: Atlantic Economic Journal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fgVPAQAAIAAJ&dq=Campaign+contributions+by+political+parties:+ideology+vs.+winning.:+An+article+from:+Atlantic+Economic+Journal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Statistics: Concepts and Applications for Science","description":"Designed for students majoring in the life, health, and natural sciences, Statistics: Concepts and Applications for Science is a text and workbook package that introduces statistics with an important emphasis on the real-world applications of statistical reasoning and procedures.

For Chidester, the murder-suicide of some 900 members of the Peoples Temple in Guyana recalls the American religious commitment to redemptive sacrifice, which for Jim Jones meant saving his followers from the evils of capitalist society.  Jonestown is ancient history,  writes Chidester, but it does provide us with an opportunity  to reflect upon the strangeness of familiar . . . promises of redemption through sacrifice.  His original conclusion that the Peoples Temple was a meaningful religious movement seems all the more prescient and astute today, when fundamentalism has raised the troubling spectre of violence and suicide all over the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6eMJAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wicca For One: The Path Of Solitary Witchcraft","description":" A step-by-step guide to Wicca as a lifestyle; practical, easy to read, and no-nonsense in tone.

The response from the motoring press and the motoring public was rapturous, though the price of this handbuilt supercar was beyond the reach of all but a favoured few. The coupe was soon joined by a 266bhp Vantage version, by the 302bhp short-chassis DB4 GT(only 75 produced) and by a convertible. The DB4 GT Zagato, most powerful of all at 314bhp, is also the rarest, only 19 examples being made. The 1964 replacement for the DB4 was the DB5, again offered as coupe or convertible, with standard 282bhp engine or the 314bhp Vantage unit, and the line concluded with the 1965-70 DB6, with cut-off tail, better aerodynamics and in Vantage form having 325bhp. All these cars remain as special and as exclusive as they ever were, and they command correspondingly high prices based on three factors a?? condition, history and most of all originality. Here James Taylor gives full details of correct original specification and equipment for all these cars, backed up by in-depth colour photography of outstanding examples of all models and variants.

Who are you when storms come? Most of us have been on the receiving end of rejection, a broken dream, or heartbreak. And while this is not an easy space to go through, when we are grounded in the truth, we can endure the tough times. In this powerful book, Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow passionately shares glimpses of his journey staying grounded in the face of disappointment, criticism, and intense media scrutiny. Following an exceptional college football career with the Florida Gators and a promising playoff run with the Denver Broncos, Tebow was traded to the New York Jets. He was released after one season. In Shaken, named the 2017 Christian Book of the Year, Tebow talks about what he's learned along the way, building confidence in his identity in God, not the world. This moving book also features practical wisdom from Scripture and insights gained from others who have impacted Tebow in life-changing ways. Though traveling hard roads is not easy, it's always worth it Your Circumstances do not Define You, Your Identity Does. What do you do when life takes an unplanned detour? When the unexpected happens? When doubt or negativity tries to rise above your faith? Most of us can relate to these questions. Through a dynamic lens of story and insight, Heisman trophy winner Tim Tebow tells what he's learned during the highs and the lows of his journey in the NFL. Shaken also features practical wisdom from the pages of Scripture and moving narratives of individuals--from celebrities to cancer patients--who have impacted Tebow's life. Their inspiring stories will encourage you also to tackle fear, overcome bitterness, and take on the obstacles life throws at you.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jOZFDwAAQBAJ&dq=Shaken&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The English orphans (Chimney corner series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ebsdAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dog in the Dungeon (Animal Ark Hauntings #3)","description":"Skelton Castle has always had a faithful deerhound to protect its family and grounds.

On one hand, they understand all the good things that will come with growth. On the other, they re petrified that growth means change, and change means risk, and risk means death. Nobody wants to screw up and ruin a good thing, so most companies (and individuals) just keep trying to be perfect at the things they ve always done. In 2003, Seth Godin s Purple Cow challenged organizations to become remarkable to drive growth by standing out in a world full of brown cows. It struck a huge chord and stayed on the Business-Week bestseller list for nearly two years. You can hear countless brainstorming meetings where people refer to purple cows and say things like,  That s not good enough. We need to create a big moo!  But how do you create a big moo an insight so astounding that people can t help but remark on it, like digital TV recording (TiVo) or overnight shipping (FedEx), or the world s best vacuum cleaner (Dyson)? Godin worked with thirty-two of the world s smartest thinkers to answer this critical question. And the team with the likes of Tom Peters, Malcolm Gladwell, Guy Kawasaki, Mark Cuban, Robyn Waters, Dave Balter, Red Maxwell, and Randall Rothenberg on board created an incredibly useful book that s fun to read and perfect for groups to share, discuss, and apply. The Big Moo is a simple book in the tradition of Fish and Don t Sweat the Small Stuff. Instead of lecturing you, it tells stories that stick to your ribs and light your fire. It will help you to create a culture that consistently delivers remarkable innovations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8awkqcL91uMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A daughter of the Samurai,","description":"Etsu Inagaki Sugimoto was born into a samurai family in the years following the Meiji Restoration in 1868.

Mikhail Bulgakov and Jean-Baptiste Poquelin more commonly known as Moli re had much in common. The twentieth-century Russian satirist and dramatist and the seventeenth-century French playwright known for Tartuffe and The Misanthrope shared a love for finding material in the shortcomings and follies of the human condition. They both created their art under unpredictable and often repressive regimes Bulgakov under the Bolsheviks and Moli re under King Louis XIV and often saw their work censored or banned. Both were also favored by influential men: King Louis was Moli re s patron, and Stalin, despite his oppressive rule, was a fan of Bulgakov s work. Perhaps it is not surprising that Bulgakov penned such a vibrant, affectionate biography of one of the greatest masters of comedy in the Western canon. Written between 1932 and 1933 and eventually published posthumously in 1963, Bulgakov s portrait of the famed French playwright and actor goes beyond the usual boundaries of biography the two men at times seem to be communicating with each other across the centuries through Bulgakov s lively prose and inspired interpretations of the life of a literary kindred spirit. Sliding delightfully between fiction and meticulous fact, The Life of Monsieur de Moli re is not to be missed.  In its playfulness and hybridity, this book looks forward to contemporary 'faction' that fuses fiction and biography.

Written for researchers and theoreticians alike, it outlines methods and techniques used for simulating on digital computers the functional properties of single neurons from synapses, dendrites, single cells; and small invertebrate networks to large scale neural networks in the mammalian nervous system. The use of new experimental tools such as selective staining methods, membrane patch electrodes, voltage and calcium-dependent dyes, and multielectrode recordings, together with the, advent of universally available powerful computing, makes it possible to construct detailed and realistic models of neuronal systems. Methods in Neuronal Modeling addresses such questions as what can and should be simulated and what techniques should be used; what experimental parameters are crucial for such simulations, and whether these models may be verified experimentally. Chapters cover simulation of passive dendritic trees, compartmental models of single cells including neurons with a number of different ionic channels, calcium current dynamics, simulations of small invertebrate networks, simulations of the mammalian cortex, connectionists' models, and the use of parallel computers in modeling neural networks. Although the chapters were written by several authors, they are uniform in structure and notation. Detailed examples are given to clarify the different approaches. Each chapter concludes with a description of the model discussed and the details of its implementation on the computer. Christof Koch is an Assistant Professor of Computation and Neural Systems at the California Institute of Technology. Idan Segev is a Lecturer in Neurobiology at the Institute of Life Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Methods in Neuronal Modeling inaugurates the new series in Computational Neuroscience, edited by Terrence J. Sejnowski and Tomaso Poggio.

Now, in this unique and timely book, he proposes that Catholicism is not a lifeless set of rules and regulations, but a way of life designed by God to help each person reach his or her full potential. With remarkable insight, Kelly dispels dozens of the myths that surround the practice and rejection of Catholicism today, and provides a profound and practical vision of what will lead the Catholic Church to thrive again in the future. \\"Holiness is to become the-best-version-of-yourself. Francis of Assisi spent his whole life trying to become the best-version-of-himself. Mother Teresa spent her whole life trying to become the-best-version-of-herself. God calls us all to holiness, because God wants each of us to be all we can be.\\" \\"The goal of the Christian life is holiness,\\" Kelly explains, \\"but somewhere along the way this term disappeared from most Catholic's vocabulary. Either because we thought it was an unattainable ideal or because we felt it lacked relevance in the modern context. Maybe we thought the idea of holiness made people feel guilty. Perhaps we just wanted to make it easier for people. Whatever the reason, the disappearance of this goal hasn't made it easier for modern Catholics; it's made it harder for them.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h8MYAAAACAAJ&dq=Rediscovering+Catholicism:+Journeying+Toward+Our+Spiritual+North+Star&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern Multithreading: Implementing, Testing, and Debugging Multithreaded Java and C++/Pthreads/Win32 Programs","description":"Master the essentials of concurrent programming,including testingand debugging This textbook examines languages and libraries for multithreadedprogramming.

Distortions in this complex yet highly iconic code are due to conflicting functional requirements, most commonly introduced into the code through the course of diachronic change. Cross-linguistic variation within each functional domain is highly constrained, and yields a coherent typology of the most natural ways the same communicative function can be performed. The volume covers the syntax of complex clauses, and is organized according to the following plan: Chapter 12:  Noun phrases  Chapter 13:  Verbal complements  Chapter 14:  Voice and de-transitivization  Chapter 15:  Relative clauses  Chapter 16:  Contrastive focus constructions  Chapter 17:  Marked topic constructions  Chapter 18:  Non-declarative speech acts  Chapter 19:  The grammar of interclausal coherence  Chapter 20:  The grammar of referential coherence as mental processing instructions  Chapter 21:  Markedness and iconicity in syntax .","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TVViAAAAMAAJ&dq=Syntax:+A+Functional+Typological+Introduction+(2+Volumes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Supreme Command (United States Army in World War II: The European theater of operations)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EOJTMwEACAAJ&dq=The+Supreme+Command+(United+States+Army+in+World+War+II:+The+European+theater+of+operations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reading German: A Course Book and Reference Grammar","description":"Reading German is a structured reading course designed to take a wide variety of users to an independent reading of authentic German texts.

Choosing to invert the question of what \\"they\\" have done to \\"us,\\" Wall Street Journal reporter Yaroslav Trofimov examines the unprecedented American intrusion in the Muslim heartland and the ripples it has caused far beyond the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. What emerges is a penetrating portrait of people, faith, and countries better known in caricature than reported detail. The ordinary Muslims, influential clerics, warlords, jihadis, intellectuals and heads of state we meet are engaged in conversations that reveal the Muslim world to us from a new, unexpected perspective. In Mali, one of the most successful democracies in Africa, we encounter Ousmane Madani Haidara, an influential cleric who sees Wahhabi extremists, rather than his country's secular government, as the real enemy of the true faith. In Saudi Arabia, we explore the bizarre world of exporting dead bodies from a kingdom that bars the burial of non-Muslims. On a US Navy aircraft carrier floating just off the coast of Pakistan in October 2001, we witness the mechanics of war: the onboard assembly of bombs that, hours later, are seen on T.V. exploding in Kabul. And in Iraq, we accompany Trofimov as he negotiates his escape from an insurgent mob, rides in a Humvee with trigger-happy GIs, and gets lectured by a Shiite holy man on why America is the foe of mankind. Whether exploring the badlands of the Sahara or a snow-covered village of Bosnian mujahedeen, Faith at War helps us understand the hidden relationships and often surprising connections, so crucial to America's future, that link the Islamic world to our own.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RwdpCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exceptionally Gifted Children","description":"Miraca Gross' award-winning 20 year long study of 60 young people of IQ 160+ continues in this revised and updated new edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0Lkvb6WtWicC&dq=Exceptionally+Gifted+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Major Problems in the History of Imperial Russia","description":"Focusing on internal developments in Imperial Russia, this book provides even-handed coverage of the period, with thorough attention to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

The exhibition will consist of twenty-nine color photographs. This is the first time Twombly has exhibited work in this medium.Cy Twombly began experimenting with color photography in the early 1980s. About four years ago he started working with the master printers Michel and Jean-Francois Fresson at the Atelier Fresson in Savigny sur Orge, France. The Fresson technique is a unique photographic printing process carried on exclusively by the Fresson family since 1990. The photographs which result have an unusually rich surface and extraordinary, saturated colors over which the artist is able to maintain exceptional control. Fresson prints are the most permanent photographic color images made today.The subject matter of Twombly's photographs are flowers, trees and ancient Roman sculptures. The majority of the works in the exhibition have been put together by the artist into groups of five or six images. Theirs is similar to the way Twombly has presented his paintings and drawings in the past. While not as abstract as his work in other media, the photographs Twombly will show are close in feeling to his larger scale work and are important to an understanding of his subject matter and working methods.The last exhibition in New York consisting of entirely new work by Cy Twombly was held in 1982. -- Press Release (see link).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HMZLAQAAIAAJ&dq=Cy+Twombly:+Photographs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of the Council of Trent, Volume I: The Struggle for the Council","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Vps2xQEACAAJ&dq=A+History+of+the+Council+of+Trent,+Volume+I:+The+Struggle+for+the+Council&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mine Work","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SqhJAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Song: A New Illuminated Rumi","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Insurgency & Terrorism: Inside Modern Revolutionary Warfare","description":"How did the party of Lincoln become the party of Trump? From an acclaimed political reporter for The New York Times comes the definitive story of the mutiny that shattered American politics.  A bracing account of how the party of Lincoln and Reagan was hijacked by gadflies and grifters who reshaped their movement into becoming an anti-democratic cancer that attacked the U.S. Capitol.  Joe Scarborough Jeremy W. Peters s epic narrative chronicles the fracturing of the Republican Party. Insurgency is a fantasia-like story of a party establishment that believed it could control the dark energy it helped foment right up until it suddenly couldn t. How, Peters asks, did conservative values that Republicans claimed to cherish, like small government, fiscal responsibility, and morality in public service, get completely eroded as an unshakable faith in Donald Trump grew to define the party? The answer is a tale traced across three decades with new reporting and firsthand accounts from the people who were there of populist uprisings that destabilized the party. The signs of conflict were plainly evident for anyone who cared to look. After Barack Obama s election convinced many Republicans that they faced an existential demographics crossroads, many believed the only way to save the party was to create a more inclusive and diverse coalition. But party leaders underestimated the energy and popular appeal of those who would pull the party in the opposite direction. They failed to see how the right-wing media they hailed as truth-telling was warping the reality in which their voters lived. And they did not understand the complicated moral framework by which many conservatives would view Trump, leading evangelicals and one-issue voters to shed Republican orthodoxy if it delivered a Supreme Court that would undo Roe v. Wade. In this sweeping history, Peters details key junctures and episodes to unfurl the story of a revolution from within. Its architects had little interest in the America of the new century but a deep understanding of the iron will of a shrinking minority. With Trump as their polestar, their gamble paid greater dividends than they d ever imagined, extending the life of far-right conservatism in United States domestic policy into the next half century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FyHzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poems of the Hundred Names: Short Introduction to Chinese Poetry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S6haIvyaPPoC&dq=Poems+of+the+Hundred+Names:+Short+Introduction+to+Chinese+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE WORKS OF A.

Despite his outspoken support for Bush s tax cuts and a war with Iraq, and his attacks on everything from National Public Radio to \\"welfare mothers,\\" O Reilly fashions his program, The O Reilly Factor, as \\"without an agenda or any ideological prejudices.\\" Presenting opposing viewpoints and likely to express views that occasionally diverge from the conservative orthodoxy, O Reilly has styled himself as a straight-shooting man of the people, wary of the conservative label with which liberals would tag him.

Factor reflects hundreds of hours of research, fact checking, and analysis of the same evidence O Reilly uses to support his claims. In this concise and compelling analysis of O Reilly s views, Hart underscores this pundit s masked partisanship; adversarial stance toward unions, Blacks, immigrants, and gays and lesbians; and his kid-gloves treatment of the Right. Forming an important corrective, The Oh Really?

Although most theories of interpretation and editing depend on a concept of single authorship, many works are actually developed by more than one author. Stillinger examines case histories from Keats, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Mill, and T.S. Eliot, as well as from American fiction, plays, and films, demonstrating that multiple authorship is a widespread phenomenon. He shows that the reality of how an author produces a work is often more complex than is expressed in the romantic notion of the author as solitary genius. The cumulative evidence revealed in this engaging study indicates that collaboration deserves to be included in any account of authorial achievement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d_yZ-aINRusC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Donna Kooler's Encyclopedia of Needlework (Leisure Arts #15861)(Donna Kooler's Series)","description":"Encyclopedia of Needlework, -This is the complete, authoritative guide to needlepoint, embroidery, and counted thread work. 15 projects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GyUDAAAACAAJ&dq=Donna+Kooler%27s+Encyclopedia+of+Needlework+(Leisure+Arts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","description":"A major backlist sleeper! 130,000 sold-to-date!

Swanton's descriptions are drawn from earlier records including those of DuPratz and Romans and from Choctaw informants. His long association with the Choctaws is evident in the thorough detailing of their customs and way of life and in his sensitivity to the presentation of their native culture. Included are descriptions of such subjects as clans, division of labor between sexes, games, religion, war customs, and burial rites. The Choctaws were, in general, peaceful farmers living in Mississippi and southwestern Alabama until they were moved to Oklahoma in successive waves beginning in 1830, after the treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. This edition includes a new foreword by Kenneth Carleton placing Swanton's work in the context of his times.

This volume provides a range of perspectives on the magnitude of concerns, the sources of problems, how issues might best be addressed, and the future for women in the armed services. It is based on a special issue of the journal Gender Issues, supplemented with additional contributions from leading scholars. Historical and theoretical perspectives are provided by Lorry M. Fenner and Jean Bethke Elshtain. Fenner focuses on the role of women in the military since 1940, and argues for broader inclusion of women as well as other groups that have previously been restricted from full participation. Elshtain analyzes the extraordinary ability of war to draw both women and men into civic life, and observes how it calls forth and establishes a sense of particular identity for both men and women. Critical views are provided by other scholars. Laura L. Miller examines the feminist movement's insistence on full participation in combat units. Former Army chaplain Marie deYoung provides qualitative and quantitative data on military readiness and unit cohesion in mixed gender units. Leading military scholars (Mady W. Segal, David R. Segal, Jerald G. Bachman, Peter Freedman-Doan, and Patrick M. O'Malley) review national surveys comparing male and female high school seniors' responses to surveys conducted on questions about their propensity to enlist. Male-female differences are also addressed by Judith Hicks Steihm, who looks at the opinions each group has about the capabilities and performance of women. She finds differences by rank on questions as to how hard female soldiers work as compared to male soldiers and whether women are ready for combat duty. Historically, the military has provided minorities equal opportunity. Brenda L. Moore and Schulyler C. Webb examine whether or not this is still perceived to be the case in today's Navy. They focus on different perceptions by women and men, and by African American women in particular. Finally, William O'Neill examines whether the post-cold war downsized military will find women soldiers more or less important. Drawing upon social science research, historical data, and contemporary opinion surveys, Women in the Military is a cutting-edge assessment of a major gender issue in the United States. It will be valuable to researchers in women's studies, as well as those teaching courses in sociology, history, and military studies.

But few are as successful as Lindy and Mike Markov, who built a $200-million business together--before Mike took up with a younger woman. Now he's claiming he doesn't owe Lindy a dime since they never married.

Written in an incredibly compressed five-month period, the novel had an electrifying impact upon publication in 1939. Tracing the journey of the Joad family from the dust bowl of Oklahoma to the migrant camps of California, Steinbeck creates an American epic, spacious, impassioned, and pulsating with the rhythms of living speech. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize and has since sold millions of copies worldwide. This text of The Grapes of Wrath has been newly edited based on Steinbeck s manuscript, typescript, and proofs. Many errors have been corrected, and words omitted or misconstrued by his typist have been restored. In addition, The Harvest Gypsies, his 1936 investigative report on migrant workers, which laid the groundwork for the novel, is included as an appendix. The Long Valley (1938) displays Steinbeck s brilliance as a writer of short stories, including such classics as  The Chrysanthemums,   The White Quail,   Flight,  and  The Red Pony.  Set in the Salinas Valley landscape that was Steinbeck s enduring inspiration, the stories explore moments of fear, tenderness, isolation, and violence with poetic intensity. The Log from the Sea of Cortez, an account of the 1940 marine biological expedition in which Steinbeck participated with his close friend Ed Ricketts, is a unique blend of science, philosophy, and adventure, as well as one of Steinbeck s most revealing expositions of his core beliefs. First published in 1941 as part of the collaborative volume Sea of Cortez, Steinbeck s narrative was reissued separately a decade later, augmented by the moving tribute  About Ed Ricketts.  This volume contains a newly researched chronology, notes, and an essay on textual selection. It is the second of four volumes in The Library of America edition of John Steinbeck s writings. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America s best and most significant writing.

Proceeding from their deep political commitment to a new kind of populist grassroots politics, these writers challenge old modes of studying the everyday. As they rework traditional scholarly language, they search for new ways to write about our complex and compelling engagements with the politics and pleasures of popular culture and sketch a new and lively vocabulary for the field of cultural studies. The essays cover a wide and colorful array of subjects including pro wrestling, the computer games Myst and Doom, soap operas, baseball card collecting, the Tour de France, karaoke, lesbian desire in the Wizard of Oz, Internet fandom for the series Babylon 5, and the stress-management industry. Broader themes examined include the origins of popular culture, the aesthetics and politics of performance, and the social and cultural processes by which objects and practices are deemed tasteful or tasteless. The commitment that binds the contributors is to an emergent perspective in cultural studies, one that engages with popular culture as the culture that \\"sticks to the skin,\\" that becomes so much a part of us that it becomes increasingly difficult to examine it from a distance. By refusing to deny or rationalize their own often contradictory identifications with popular culture, the contributors ensure that the volume as a whole reflects the immediacy and vibrancy of its objects of study. Hop on Pop will appeal to those engaged in the study of popular culture, American studies, cultural studies, cinema and visual studies, as well as to the general educated reader. Contributors.

In Nothing Happens, Ivone Margulies presents the first comprehensive study of this influential avant-garde Belgian filmmaker. Margulies grounds her critical analysis in detailed discussions of Akerman's work--from Saute ma ville, a 13-minute black-and-white film made in 1968, through Jeanne Dielman and Je tu il elle to the present. Focusing on the real-time representation of a woman's everyday experience in Jeanne Dielman, Margulies brings the history of social and progressive realism and the filmmaker's work into perspective. Pursuing two different but related lines of inquiry, she investigates an interest in the everyday that stretches from postwar neorealist cinema to the feminist rewriting of women's history in the seventies. She then shows how Akerman's \\"corporeal cinema\\" is informed by both American experiments with performance and duration and the layerings present in works by European modernists Bresson, Rohmer, and Dreyer. This analysis revises the tired opposition between realism and modernism in the cinema, defines Akerman's minimal-hyperrealist aesthetics in contrast to Godard's anti-illusionism, and reveals the inadequacies of popular characterizations of Akerman's films as either simply modernist or feminist. An essential book for students of Chantal Akerman's work, Nothing Happens will also interest international film critics and scholars, filmmakers, art historians, and all readers concerned with feminist film theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZgkHe47h0NEC&dq=Nothing+Happens:+Chantal+Akerman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","description":"In recent years, the grappling arts have proven to be the most effective form of combat in mixed martial arts (MMA) and no-holds-barred (NHB) competitions.

While globalisation has, in part, been driven over the past two decades by the transnational corporations' search for cheap labour in new regions of the South, scholarly research and the mass media have paid remarkably little attention to the consequent changes that are happening in the world of work. This book is the first to deal comprehensively and analytically with labour's response to globalisation. It provides a critical overview of the main challenges facing workers and trade unions worldwide. Its author argues that what may be described as the national period in labour history is decisively over. Now the labour movement is itself acting increasingly in a transnational manner. This holds out the hope of its playing a major role in the social regulation of a global economic system which is largely out of control. The author explains how globalisation is foisting flexibilisation and feminisation on working people, but in the process also making them conscious of their transnational links. The 'old' internationalism of the trade union movement is now showing signs of developing into a 'new' internationalism where workers develop a sense of common interest and new ways of organizing that transcend national boundaries. Drawing his evidence from what is happening to workers and trade unions in a wide range of countries in both the industrialized North and the developing South, Professor Ronaldo Munck suggests that we may be on the brink of a new version of what Karl Polanyi, many years ago, strikingly called 'the great transformation'. The implications for workers, trade unions and their transnational corporate employers could be profound.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vNJtE4lQ0kMC&dq=Java+Programmer%27s+Library&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joe Camp's The phenomenon of Benji","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=medq0d1xD0UC&dq=Joe+Camp%27s+The+phenomenon+of+Benji&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lady Vanishes","description":"Ethel Lina White's thriller classic, featuring the original 'girl on a train' scenario.A special edition of The Lady Vanishes by Ethel Lina White reissued with a bright retro design to celebrate Pan's 70th anniversary.In this nail-bitingly tense thriller, a girl on a train finds herself in a terrifying situation when her travelling companion vanishes suddenly from their compartment whilst she is sleeping.

Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by \\"an enormous thing,\\" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learn in your car SPANISH: The Beginner's Spanish Course for the Car","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0-GEliUjbuYC&dq=Learn+in+your+car+SPANISH:+The+Beginner%27s+Spanish+Course+for+the+Car&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Finest Rooms By America's Great Decorators","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tIo9zgEACAAJ&dq=The+Finest+Rooms+By+America%27s+Great+Decorators&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (Oxford Chemistry Primers)","description":"The renowned Oxford Chemistry Primers series, which provides focused introductions to a range of important topics in chemistry, has been refreshed and updated to suit the needs of today's students, lecturers, and postgraduate researchers.

Focusing particularly on Althusser's writings on art, theatre and literature (as well as those of Althusser's collaborator, Pierre Macherey), Warren Montag traces the contradictory development of Althusser's thought from the early sixties to his autobiography.

Mihkel Mathiesen's passionate struggle to reveal how the truth has become controversial in the modern community. Mathiesen explores the paralyzing effect political correctness has on society and the associated environmental scares the public has accepted as fact for 30 years. Contrasting the exaggerations and glib explanations of politicians, advocacy groups, and bureaucracies, Mathiesen provides a clear and revolutionary account of the actual science behind five major environmental campaigns. As the title indicates, Mathiesen's work culminates in a relentlessly objective analysis of the real causes of the present global warming. Based on the latest scientific findings, Global Warming in a Politically Correct Climate contains densely packed information never before published in a format accessible to the non-scientist. With the forgiving veil of political correctness lifted, the roles of advocacy groups, bureaucracies, politicians, industry, the legal profession, and career-conscious scientists are examined. Mathiesen particularly scrutinizes the media. Global Warming in a Politically Correct Climate is an enlightening look at how the transfer of wealth from an unwitting public is justified by averting non-existent threats, and how greed rather than pure idealism is at work in environmental politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SmBGvlhU_jQC&dq=Global+Warming+in+a+Politically+Correct+Climate:+How+Truth+Became+Controversial&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","description":"A young deaf child who loves to run and jump and play is affectionately described by her older sister.

With a focus on three male protagonists living in very distinct urban areas of Cape Town, this comparative ethnography shows that men s struggles to become invulnerable increase vulnerability. Through an analysis of masculinities as social assemblages, the study shows how affective health problems are tied to modern individualism rather than African  tradition  that has become a clich  in Eurocentric gender studies. Affective health is conceptualized as a balancing act between autonomy and connectivity that after colonialism and apartheid has become compromised through the imperative of self-reliance. This book provides a rare perspective on young men s vulnerability in everyday life that may affect the reader and spark discussion about how masculinities in relationships shape physical and psychological health. Moreover, it shows how men change in the face of distress in ways that may look different than global health and gender-transformative approaches envision. Thick descriptions of actual events over the life course make the study accessible to both graduate and undergraduate students in the social sciences. Contributing to current debates on mental health and masculinity, this volume will be of interest to scholars from various disciplines including anthropology, gender studies, African studies, psychology, and global health.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RODaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stop-Motion Armature Machining: A Construction Manual","description":"Stop-motion puppet animation is one of the most unusual and demanding art forms in the world.

This work, with over 200 photographs and illustrations, demonstrates the construction of armatures for film industry stop-motion puppets and the technical aspects of how to machine metal into the desired shape. It describes in detail the milling machine and the metal lathe, the two main tools used in constructing the armature, other cutting tools, and how the anatomical makeup of the puppet determines the armature design. The book then examines the six main types of joints used in armature construction: the sandwich plate ball-and-socket joint, the ball-and-socket collet joint, the step-block ball-and-socket joint, the swivel joint, the hinge joint, and the universal joint. Also described are the different types of metals used in armature construction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4hclmQtR0rsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Better Test-Taking Skills in 5 Minutes a Day: Fun Activities to Boost Test Scores for Kids and Parents on the Go","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"I Like Mess (Real Kid Readers: Level 1)","description":"Messy Tess cleans up her room to please Mom and Dad","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fq0dPwAACAAJ&dq=I+Like+Mess+(Real+Kid+Readers:+Level+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The hidden life of prayer","description":"Drawing on the experiences of people like Luther, Spurgeon, Muller, Whitefield and Wesley, the author presses the case for a greater commitment to prayer.

The minister of Westminster Chapel, London, was proposing to rebuild a congregation on lines strangely unfamiliar in post-war Britain. The sermons' form- authoritative, expository preaching - and, still more, their content, were against all the prevailing trends. J. I. Packer, one of his younger hearers in the late 1940s, has written: 'I had never heard such preaching and was electrified. All that I know about preaching, I can honestly say, I learned from \\"the Doctor.\\" I have never heard another preacher with so much of God about him'. The content of this volume is its chief warrant for publication. But as a record of Dr. Lloyd-Jones' first extensive series of sermons on any one book of Scripture it also has some special interest. With treatment which is broader and less detailed than normal his hearers were introduced to expository preaching. Now, in this format, his 2 Peter sermons will provide an introduction for other to a type of reading which is able, under God, to strengthen Christians and churches around the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yD1rPQAACAAJ&dq=Expository+Sermons+on+2+Peter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whispers on the Wind (Futuristic Romance)","description":"Most men whisper sweet nothings in a woman's ear, Jon murmured seductive promises in Lenore's mind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N2Sktp_2uHgC&dq=Whispers+on+the+Wind+(Futuristic+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dialogues (Bollingen Series Xlv)","description":"Val ry's dialogues are considered his most important works of imagination in prose.

Desperate times call for desperate measures, which is how she finds herself making a deal with a demon. Freedom from her husband...in return for seven years of service.

This ambitious book presents a new, general neutral theory to explain the origin, maintenance, and loss of biodiversity in a biogeographic context. Until now biogeography (the study of the geographic distribution of species) and biodiversity (the study of species richness and relative species abundance) have had largely disjunct intellectual histories. In this book, Stephen Hubbell develops a formal mathematical theory that unifies these two fields. When a speciation process is incorporated into Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson's now classical theory of island biogeography, the generalized theory predicts the existence of a universal, dimensionless biodiversity number. In the theory, this fundamental biodiversity number, together with the migration or dispersal rate, completely determines the steady-state distribution of species richness and relative species abundance on local to large geographic spatial scales and short-term to evolutionary time scales. Although neutral, Hubbell's theory is nevertheless able to generate many nonobvious, testable, and remarkably accurate quantitative predictions about biodiversity and biogeography. In many ways Hubbell's theory is the ecological analog to the neutral theory of genetic drift in genetics. The unified neutral theory of biogeography and biodiversity should stimulate research in new theoretical and empirical directions by ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and biogeographers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UqDYm24M5lwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Design of Steel Structures","description":"This book is intended for classroom teaching in architectural and civil engineering at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Although it has been developed from lecture notes given in structural steel design, it can be useful to practicing engineers. Many of the examples presented in this book are drawn from the field of design of structures. Design of Steel Structures can be used for one or two semesters of three hours each on the undergraduate level. For a two-semester curriculum, Chapters 1 through 8 can be used during the first semester. Heavy emphasis should be placed on Chapters 1 through 5, giving the student a brief exposure to the consideration of wind and earthquakes in the design of buildings. With the new federal requirements vis a vis wind and earthquake hazards, it is beneficial to the student to have some under standing of the underlying concepts in this field. In addition to the class lectures, the instructor should require the student to submit a term project that includes the complete structural design of a multi-story building using standard design procedures as specified by AISC Specifications. Thus, the use of the AISC Steel Construction Manual is a must in teaching this course. In the second semester, Chapters 9 through 13 should be covered. At the undergraduate level, Chapters 11 through 13 should be used on a limited basis, leaving the student more time to concentrate on composite construction and built-up girders.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qePiBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","description":"The reggae musician's manager provides details of Bob Marley's life and musical career.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qYwbPQAACAAJ&dq=Marley+And+Me:+The+Real+Bob+Marley+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psalms, Part 1, with an Introduction to Cultic Poetry (Fotl) (Forms of the Old Testament Literature)","description":"Psalms, with an Introduction to Cultic Poetry, is Volume XIV of The Forms of the Old Testament Literature, a series that aims to present a form-critical analysis of every book and each unit in the Hebrew Bible. Fundamentally exegetical, the FOTL volumes examine the structure, genre, setting, and intention of the biblical literature in question. They also study the history behind the form-critical discussion of the material, attempt to bring consistency to the terminology for the genres and formulas of the biblical literature, and expose the exegetical process so as to enable students and pastors to engage in their own analysis and interpretation of the Old Testament texts. Erhard Gerstenberger begins this volume with an examination of the nature of cultic poetry, its role in ancient Near Eastern religion, and more specifically its role in the religion of Israel. He goes on to survey the genres of cultic poetry, including lament, complaint, and thanksgiving. He then focuses on the book of Psalms as an example of cultic poetry, first analyzing the book as a whole and then working through Psalms 1-60 unit by unit, discussing structure, genre, setting, and intention. The work is enhanced by extensive bibliographies and a glossary of genres and formulas that offers clear, thorough definitions with examples.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MVVyX_5ZeJMC&dq=Psalms,+Part+1,+with+an+Introduction+to+Cultic+Poetry+(Fotl)+(Forms+of+the+Old+Testament+Literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moses: From the Mysteries of Egypt to the Judges of Israel","description":"Acknowledging his debt to Rudolf Steiner, Bock draws a parallel between spiritual research and ancient texts to reveal the esoteric history of Moses.

From this perspective, benefits of secularizing trends include the separation of church and state, the rule of law, and freedom from organized religion. In the Arab Middle East, however, Islamist intellectuals increasingly cite Western-inspired secularism as the source of the region's social dislocation and political instability. While secularism in the West led to the spread of democratic values, in the Muslim world it has been associated with dictatorship, the violation of human rights, and the abrogation of civil liberties. Islam and Secularism in the Middle East examines the origins and growth of the movement to abolish the secularizing reforms of the past century by creating a political order guided by Shariah law. Contributors explain the Islamic rejection of secularism as a failed Western Christian ideal and also discuss how secularization was pioneered by those who thought Muslims could only advance politically by emulating Western practices, including the renunciation of religion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3qgHikIk2F4C&dq=Islam+and+Secularism+in+the+Middle+East&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Guide to Choosing a Dog","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mere Morality: What God Expects from Ordinary People","description":"Lewis Smedes has written a penetrating study in ethics based on the five \\"moral\\" commandments--those pertaining to honor of parents, lying, stealing, adultery, and murder.

On Competition, Updated and Expanded Edition brings together more than a dozen of Porter's landmark articles from the Harvard Business Review. Five are new to this edition, including the 2008 update to his classic \\"The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy,\\" as well as new work on health care, philanthropy, corporate social responsibility, and CEO leadership. This collection captures Porter's unique ability to bridge theory and practice. Each of the articles has not only shaped thinking, but also redefined the work of practitioners in its respective field. In an insightful new introduction, Porter relates each article to the whole of his thinking about competition and value creation, and traces how that thinking has deepened over time. This collection is organized by topic, allowing the reader easy access to the wide range of Porter's work. Parts I and II present the frameworks for which Porter is best known--frameworks that address how companies, as well as nations and regions, gain and sustain competitive advantage. Part III shows how strategic thinking can address society's most pressing challenges, from environmental sustainability to improving health-care delivery. Part IV explores how both nonprofits and corporations can create value for society more effectively by applying strategy principles to philanthropy. Part V explores the link between strategy and leadership.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NKlIn7hMK1AC&dq=On+Competition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"#1 Casca The Eternal Mercenary","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"House Atreides","description":"A prequel to Frank Herbert's science fiction novel, \\"Dune,\\" journeys back to the planet Arrakis to visit the extraordinary desert world decades before Paul Atreides arrives to change the history of the universe","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nf5aAAAAMAAJ&dq=House+Atreides&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pacific islands","description":"Physical environment, peoples, history, politics, economy, society and culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NWiyAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Pacific+islands&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"License To Love (Harlequin Desire)","description":"Eva has sunk into depression.

Although the trial in Herkimer, New York was front page news throughout the nation in 1906 and millions of words have been written about Dreiser's novel, this book is the first complete account of the fascinating facts behind the fiction. Gillette, a former prep school student and railroad brakeman, was the nephew of the owner of a skirt factory in Cortland, New York, where he met Grace Brown, the daughter of a Chenango County farmer. Soon after Grace discovered she was pregnant with Gillette's child in 1906, they left on a trip to the Adirondacks. Grace thought it was to be a wedding trip, but Gillette was planning murder, not matrimony. At Big Moose Lake in Herkimer County, Gillette rented a boat and took Grace to a deserted section of the lake called Punky Bay. She ended up at the bottom of the lake and Gillette escaped to Inlet, where he was arrested three days later. The spectators at Gillette's trial sobbed when the district attorney read Grace's letters, but Gillette sat quietly and chewed gum until it was his turn to testify. Then he said Grace jumped out of the boat and committed suicide. The jury didn't believe him and he was sentenced to die in the electric chair in Auburn. Gillette's mother waged a campaign that led all the way to the governor's mansion in Albany and a last minute attempt to save her son's life. By the 1980s, the fiction had overpowered the facts and many people accepted Dreiser's novel as the true story. This book sets the record straight. Meticulously researched, it relies on the original courtroom testimony and the 1906-1908 newspaper articles. It contains letters, documents and photographs that have never before been made public. Facts about Gillette's early life and his family are revealed here for the first time anywhere. After 80 years, readers can finally find out what really happened at Big Moose Lake in 1906. The true story of Upstate New York's most famous murder case can finally be told.\\"--Back cover","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dnzaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Big+Moose+Lake+(NY)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","description":"'Breathtaking.'

This beautiful and devastating debut heralds the arrival of a major new voice in fiction. Ephram Jennings has never forgotten the beautiful girl with the long braids running through the piney woods of Liberty, their small East Texas town. Young Ruby Bell,  the kind of pretty it hurt to look at,  has suffered beyond imagining, so as soon as she can, she flees suffocating Liberty for the bright pull of 1950s New York. Ruby quickly winds her way into the ripe center of the city the darkened piano bars and hidden alleyways of the Village all the while hoping for a glimpse of the red hair and green eyes of her mother. When a telegram from her cousin forces her to return home, thirty-year-old Ruby finds herself reliving the devastating violence of her girlhood. With the terrifying realization that she might not be strong enough to fight her way back out again, Ruby struggles to survive her memories of the town s dark past.

[It] is perhaps the most important interdisciplinary account to appear since Zygmunt Bauman s classic work, Modernity and the Holocaust.\\" Stephen Feinstein, Director, Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies \\"Alex Alvarez has written a first-rate propaedeutic on the running sore of genocide. The singular merit of the work is its capacity to integrate a diverse literature in a fair-minded way and to take account of genocides in the post-Holocaust environment ranging from Cambodia to Serbia. The work reveals patterns of authoritarian continuities of repression and rule across cultures that merit serious and widespread public concern.\\" Irving Louis Horowitz, Rutgers University More people have been killed in 20th-century genocides than in all wars and revolutions in the same period. Recent events in countries such as Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia have drawn attention to the fact that genocide is a pressing contemporary problem, one that has involved the United States in varying negotiating and peace-keeping roles. Genocide is increasingly recognized as a threat to national and international security, as well as a source of tremendous human suffering and social devastation. Governments, Citizens, and Genocide views the crime of genocide through the lens of social science. It discusses the problem of defining genocide and then examines it from the levels of the state, the organization, and the individual. Alex Alvarez offers both a skillful synthesis of the existing literature on genocide and important new insights developed from the study of criminal behavior. He shows that governmental policies and institutions in genocidal states are designed to suppress the moral inhibitions of ordinary individuals. By linking different levels of analysis, and comparing a variety of cases, the study provides a much more complex understanding of genocide than have prior studies. Based on lessons drawn from his analysis, Alvarez offers an important discussion of the ways in which genocide might be anticipated and prevented. Alex Alvarez is Associate Professor in the Department of Criminal Justice at Northern Arizona University. His primary research interests are minorities, crime, and criminal justice, as well as collective and interpersonal violence. He is author of articles in Journal of Criminal Justice, Social Science History, and Sociological Imagination and is currently writing a book on patterns of American murder.

It was among the top 10 best sellers in the U.S. in 1916. The story is presented in a series of letters written by Sallie McBride, Judy Abbott's classmate and best friend in Daddy-Long-Legs. Among the recipients of the letters are Judy; Jervis Pendleton, Judy's husband and the president of the orphanage where Sallie is filling in until a new superintendent can be installed; Gordon Hallock, a wealthy Congressman and Sallie's later fianc ; and the orphanage's doctor, embittered Scotsman Robin 'Sandy' MacRae (to whom Sallie addresses her letters: \\"Dear Enemy\\"). Webster employs the epistolary structure to good effect; Sallie's choices of what to recount to each of her correspondents reveal a lot about her relationships with them. The novel is set in rural Dutchess County, New York, early in the 20th century. It examines a number of social issues: how to care for orphans (and for children in general), divorce, and the value of women's work. (The latter is a natural extension of the theme of women's education in Daddy-Long-Legs.) While volunteer work by women is widely accepted, women working in responsible positions for pay is still viewed with some hostility by some characters, such as Gordon Hallock, Sallie's friend and later fianc , and the Honorable Cyrus Wykoff, a trustee of the John Grier Home. The Hon. Cy (as Sallie calls him) objects to the JGH paying a salary to Betsy, Sallie's assistant: \\"She's a woman, and her family ought to support her.\\" Though the Hon. Cy makes it clear that he thinks Sallie is frivolous and unsuited to superintend an orphanage, Sallie is so devoted to the orphan's well-being that she turns even her social life-explicitly criticized by the Hon. Cy-into an opportunity to further her cause, recruiting volunteers, benefactors, and foster parents at dinner parties and afternoon teas. Webster also deals with women's life choices in a more subtle fashion. She contrasts the miserable marriage of Sallie's friend Helen with Sallie's fruitful life as she devotes herself to the demanding and strenuous task of running an orphanage. Sallie considers Judy Abbott, who married soon after completing college, an anomaly for her remarkably successful marriage with Jervis. Divorced from her unsuitable husband, Helen ultimately finds happiness in joining Sallie's cause at the orphanage, applying herself to work for the public good. Socialism applied to charitable causes is an underlying theme; the John Grier Home couldn't survive without the beneficence of the trustees and community. The novel also deals with the evolving ideas about how best to care for orphans at the turn of the century, with the institution-style establishments falling out of favor, in light of the modern 'cottage' approach. Care for the children's emotional and spiritual needs is considered paramount, as Sallie works with Dr. MacRae, Judy, and Jervis to enact her reforms. The reasons these are necessary at the John Grier Home is clearly outlined in the first novel, in Judy's miserable recollections of her old home. Concerns with the hereditary origins of 'feeble-mindedness' and alcoholism are expressed by Dr. MacRae and by Sallie. The doctor's anxieties prove to have an underlying basis in his experience, which is revealed towards the end of the novel.

Louis Althusser is the first major overview of Althusser's work since the publication in French of thousands of pages of essays, books and letters unknown before 1990, and makes a strong case for a radical reconsideration of his work in the light of this new material. Focusing particularly on Althusser's writings on art, theatre and literature (as well as those of Althusser's collaborator, Pierre Macherey), Warren Montag traces the contradictory development of Althusser's thought from the early sixties to his autobiography. Additional material includes an annotated bibliography of texts by and on Althusser, and the book also features a previously untranslated essay by the theorist on Brecht and Marx.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H_lGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swell Holiday","description":"Every day's a holiday in Swellville.

These rivalries were exacerbated particularly in southeastern Europe where Germany dominated the economies and trade arenas of its neighbors in a semi-colonial manner. In A Low Dishonest Decade, Hehn surveys the five Major Powers and all the Eastern European countries from the Baltic to Turkey.

The book is structured in three parts. The introduction explains how the book evolved, defines its relation to other qualitative research, and offers suggestions for how to use the book. The second part consists of eight bilingual teachers' stories that provide a glimpse of them as people, their schools and programs, their successes and struggles, and their solutions and coping mechanisms within their contexts. It concludes with a discussion chapter that looks at the teachers' collective strengths and struggles comparatively, connecting these to broader issues. The final section presents bilingual education resources -- useful information for practitioners. This includes foundation texts on the theories and practices of bilingual education, demographic information, a glossary of bilingual education terms, listings of curricula, tests, and literature mentioned by the teachers, and professional network sources.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v8ZcAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sign of the Calla Lily: Book I","description":"Calla Lily Ponder bursts into life--guided by Moon Lady, a protective feminine force--where she thrives in her small Louisiana town until the end of her first love pushes her to Cresent City, where she discovers she has the power of \\"healing hands\\" to change lives and end pain, including her own.

Georgina Weldon, Louisa Lowe and Susan Willis Fletcher were certified as insane by the Victorian medical establishment and were threatened with incarceration for their eccentric and transgressive behaviour.

In doing this, they contributed to the emerging feminist critique of medicine and science. Each volume is devoted to the work of one of these exceptional women. New introductions by the editors and the late Roy Porter provide context and discussion of the pieces included, pointing to the themes and issues that they raise.

While a student at Harvard in the early years of the twentieth century, T. S. Eliot immersed himself in the verse of Dante, Donne, and the nineteenth-century French poet Jules Laforgue. His study of the relation of thought and feeling in these poets led Eliot, as a poet and critic living in London, to formulate an original theory of the poetry generally termed  metaphysical  philosophical and intellectual poetry that revels in startlingly unconventional imagery. Eliot came to perceive a gradual  disintegration of the intellect  following three  metaphysical moments  of European civilization the thirteenth, seventeenth, and nineteenth centuries. The theory is at once a provocative prism through which to view Western intellectual and literary history and an exceptional insight into Eliot s own intellectual development. This annotated edition includes the eight Clark Lectures on metaphysical poetry that Eliot delivered at Trinity College in Cambridge in 1926, and their revision and extension for his three Turnbull Lectures at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1933. They reveal in great depth the historical currents of poetry and philosophy that shaped Eliot s own metaphysical moment in the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mtkPAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Effective Horsemanship","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aBE9AAAAYAAJ&dq=Effective+Horsemanship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Qs-9000 Registration and Implementation (Quality and Reliability)","description":"Focuses on the improvement of quality, customer satisfaction and profitability.

In most aof these texts Gog and Magog are persons or nations opposing God's people in the endtime-tribulations.Sverre Boe focuses on John's use of various Gog and Magog traditions in Revelation 19,17-20,10. He assembles all these traditions and also refers to several hundreds of scholarly works on these many texts. He further contributes to the ongoing discussions about the inter-textual relationship between Revelation and the Old Testament. He argues that John used Ezekiel 38-39 extensively, and that there are structural analogies beween Rev. 19,11-22,5 and Ezek. 36-48. Although Sverre Boe does not raise the fundamental questions about the co-called millennium in Rev. 20 as such, he givesmany implications for that issue also. Finally he concludes that Revelation does not see Gog and Magog as Israel's enemies in an ethnic sense, since John seems to universalize his pre-texts to fit the New Testament notion of God's people as comprising Christians of all nations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vettpBoVOX4C&dq=Gog&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Childhood Cancer: A Parent's Guide to Solid Tumor Cancers, 2nd Edition","description":"Revision of: Childhood cancer / Honna Janes-Hodder & Nancy Keene. 2002. 2nd ed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sOgBjwEACAAJ&dq=Childhood+Cancer:+A+Parent%27s+Guide+to+Solid+Tumor+Cancers,+2nd+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roadside geology of the Yellowstone country (Roadside geology series)","description":"An introductory chapter briefly reviews Yellowstone's geology followed by a series of road guides with the local particulars.

Modern depictions often imply that certain concerns can be resolved through excessive domesticity, reflecting some of the complicated and unfinished issues of second-wave feminism. Home Sweat Home: Perspectives on Housework and Modern Relationships reveals how widespread the cultural image of  perfect  housewives and the invisibility of household labor were in the past and remain today. In this collection of essays, contributors explore the construction of women as homemakers and the erasure of household labor from the middle-class home in popular representations of housework. They concentrate on such matters as the impact of second-wave feminism on families and gender relations; of popular culture especially in film, television, magazines, and advertising on our views of what constitutes home life and gender relations; and of changing views of sexuality and masculinity within the domestic sphere.

Entertainment Weekly Centuries before the events of A Game of Thrones, House Targaryen the only family of dragonlords to survive the Doom of Valyria took up residence on Dragonstone. Fire & Blood begins their tale with the legendary Aegon the Conqueror, creator of the Iron Throne, and goes on to recount the generations of Targaryens who fought to hold that iconic seat, all the way up to the civil war that nearly tore their dynasty apart. What really happened during the Dance of the Dragons? Why was it so deadly to visit Valyria after the Doom? What were Maegor the Cruel s worst crimes? What was it like in Westeros when dragons ruled the skies? These are but a few of the questions answered in this essential chronicle, as related by a learned maester of the Citadel and featuring more than eighty black-and-white illustrations by artist Doug Wheatley. Readers have glimpsed small parts of this narrative in such volumes as The World of Ice & Fire, but now, for the first time, the full tapestry of Targaryen history is revealed.

Rather than add to these volumes, The Epic of America paints a sweeping picture of the diverse past that has created America's national story. In this important narrative, James Truslow Adams reviews how the ordinary American has matured over time in outlook, character, and opinion. Adams grew increasingly conscious of how different an American is now from the man or woman of any other advanced nation. He is equally interested in the whole of American history, how it began, and what it represented in the first half of the twentieth century. Adams traces the historical origins of the American concept of \\"bigger and better,\\" attitudes toward business, the American Dream, and other characteristics generally considered \\"typically American.\\" Ever since America became an independent nation, each generation has seen an uprising of its citizens to save the American Dream from forces seeking to overwhelm and dispel it.

Like many men of that era who returned home with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), he was never the same. Christal's father spent much of her childhood locked in his room, gravitating between the deepest depression and unspeakable rage, unable to participate in holidays or birthdays. At a very young age, Christal learned to walk on eggshells, doing anything and everything not to provoke him, but this dance caused her to become a profoundly disturbed little girl. She acted out at school, engaged in self-mutilation, and couldn't make friends. At the age of eighteen, Christal left home and didn't look back. She barely spoke to her father for the next thirteen years. To any outsider, Christal appeared to be doing well: she earned a BA and a master's, got married, and traveled to India. But despite all these accomplishments, Christal still hadn't faced her biggest challenge her relationship with her father. In 2009, something changed. Christal decided it was time to begin the healing process, and she extended an olive branch. She came up with what she called \\"The Thirty Day Project,\\" a month's worth of conversations during which she would finally ask her father difficult questions about Vietnam. Thirty Days with My Father is a gritty yet heartwarming story of those thirty days of a daughter and father reconnecting in a way that will inspire us all to seek the truth, even from life's most difficult relationships. This beautifully realized memoir shares how one woman and her father discovered profound lessons about their own strength and will to survive, shedding an inspiring light on generational PTSD.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8tkfAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wallace Stevens: The Plain Sense of Things","description":"Most readers of Wallace Stevens wonder at his 'double life'; the poet and the lawyer who worked in the insurance business. But Longenbach argues that Stevens lived no such double life. By examining a full range of Stevens' writing in the context of American political and intellectual history, Longenbach's book reveals for the first time a poet who was not only aware of events taking place around him but whose work was often inspired by those events. While the focus is on Stevens, and the historical events and ideological debates around him, poets like Eliot, Williams, Marianne Moore, and Burke are also examined.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t3M8DwAAQBAJ&dq=Wallace+Stevens:+The+Plain+Sense+of+Things&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Landscapes of Privilege: The Politics of the Aesthetic in an American Suburb","description":"James and Nancy Duncan look at how the aesthetics of physical landscapes are fully enmeshed in producing the American class system.

Under the leadership of Jim Whittaker, they and their teammates had spent 67 days on the mountain, nearly all of them above 18,000 feet, where the stresses of high-altitude living, of monotonous food, of confinement in tiny tents for day after day of frustrating storms had worn them down to the core. The Last Step is Rick Ridgeway's inside story of this extraordinary expedition. It's about the people who, battered by the mountain and their isolation, overcame their individual fears, desire, and disappointments to work together to get somebody?anybody?to the top of K2.

Two-fifths of all employed Americans work mostly during evenings, nights, weekends, or on rotating shifts outside the traditional 9-to-5 work day. The pervasiveness of nonstandard work schedules has become a significant social phenomenon, with important implications for the health and well-being of workers and their families. In Working in a 24/7 Economy, Harriet Presser looks at the effects of nonstandard work schedules on family functioning and shows how these schedules disrupt marriages and force families to cobble together complex child-care arrangements that should concern us all. The number of hours Americans work has received ample attention, but the issue of which hours or days Americans work has received much less scrutiny. Working in a 24/7 Economy provides a comprehensive overview of who works nonstandard schedules and why. Presser argues that the growth in women's employment, technological change, and other demographic changes over the past thirty years gave rise to the growing demand for late-shift and weekend employment in the service sector. She also demonstrates that most people who work these hours do so primarily because it is a job requirement, rather than a choice based on personal considerations. Presser shows that the consequences of working nonstandard schedules often differ for men and women since housework and child-rearing remain assigned primarily to women even when both spouses are employed. As with many other social problems, the burden of these schedules disproportionately affects the working poor, reflecting their lack of options in the workplace and adding to their disadvantage. Presser also documents how such work arrangements have created a new rhythm of daily life within many American families, including those with two earners and absent fathers. With spouses often not at home together in the evenings or nights, and parents often not at home with their children at such times, the relatively new concept of \\"home-time\\" has emerged as primary concern for families across the nation. Employing a wealth of empirical data, Working in a 24/7 Economy shows that nonstandard work schedules are both highly prevalent among American families and generate a level of complexity in family functioning that demands greater public attention. Presser makes a convincing case for expanded research and meaningful policy initiatives to address this growing social phenomenon.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ugWGAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cloud","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LnAwzwEACAAJ&dq=The+Cloud&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Woman's Place","description":"Discover the trailblazing women who changed the world from their kitchens.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Thomas H. Burgoyne, an astrologer and founder of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, was born April 14, 1855, and grew up in his native Scotland. Spontaneously psychic, he claimed that as a child he came into contact with the Brotherhood of Light, a group of discarnate, advanced beings who attempt to guide the destiny of humankind. Today that group continues as the Church of Light. At a later date he met a M. Theon, purported to be an earthly representative of the brotherhood who taught Burgoyne about the Brotherhood. Burgoyne moved to the United States around 1880 and soon afterward his writings began to appear in various periodicals. He was brought into contact with Norman Astley of Carmel, California, who also claimed to be in contact with the Brotherhood of Light. Astley suggested that Burgoyne write a set of lessons to introduce the brotherhood's teachings to the public, and Burgoyne accepted Astley's hospitality at Carmel while he worked on the lessons. They were published in 1889 as \\"The Light of Egypt.\\" The writing of the lessons occasioned the establishment of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor as an esoteric occult order and outer expression of the Brotherhood of Light. The Hermetic Brotherhood was structured with three leaders, a seer, a scribe/secretary, and an astrologer. Burgoyne became the scribe. As Burgoyne understood it, the Brotherhood of Light was an occult order formed to oppose the dominant religious powers of the day in ancient Egypt. As the members died, they continued the brotherhood from their new plane of being.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vo5vngEACAAJ&dq=The+Light+of+Egypt,+or+the+Science+of+the+Soul+and+the+Stars+Vol+I&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introductory Structural Analysis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wniAQgAACAAJ&dq=Introductory+Structural+Analysis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Five Rings, Six Crises, Seven Dwarfs, and 38 Ways To Win An Argument: Numerical Lists You Never Knew","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Oceans of Venus: The third Space Ranger novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KEmkHAAACAAJ&dq=Oceans+of+Venus:+The+third+Space+Ranger+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cracking the Golden State Exams: Geometry (Princeton Review: Cracking the Golden State Geometry)","description":"PROVEN TECHNIQUES FOR SCORING HIGHER FROM THE WORLD'S #1 TEST-PREP COMPANY We Know the Golden State Geometry Exam The experts at The Princeton Review study the Golden State Exams to make sure you get the most up-to-date, thoroughly researched book possible.

In Healthcare.com: RX for Reform, Dr. David Friend, trained in both medicine and business, delineates the symptoms of our ailing healthcare system and offers a vision for the future. Even with the enormous turmoil our health care system has undergone - from the proliferation managed care to the closing of hospitals - large numbers of people continue to receive sub-optimal care. The author discusses several symptoms including: increasing costs uncertain quality of care eroding trust in health care vendors increasing prospect of shareholder liability declining access to providers unclear impact on employee productivity It is time to discard the old, traditional way of thinking about healthcare and take a fresh look at its issues and challenges. To tackle these challenges we must strike a balance between the seemingly dissimilar disciplines of economics, medicine, technology, and politics. Dr. Friend proposes that we tear down the brick and mortar delivery model and replace it with a Virtual Health Care System. This new model changes the roles of everyone involved in the healthcare system, from the patient to the healthcare provider. It utilizes technology to redesign health care so that it can be delivered with higher quality and greater efficiency.

Extranets use the Interent to connect remote offices and sites as well as business partners.

Implementing Extranets directly addresses the great extranet controversy by providing practical examples and advice about overcoming the present limitations of extranets.

Case studies from nine African countries where female genital cutting (FGC) is traditionally and currently performed evaluate the impact of international efforts to eliminate the practice. A focus on local reactions to external involvement underscores that the myriad programs fashioned to effect changes in FGC ritual and procedure must be initiated and supported by indigenous communities if they are to be lasting and effective.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wXFIzwEACAAJ&dq=Female+%22Circumcision%22+in+Africa:+Culture,+Controversy,+and+Change+(Directions+in+Applied+Anthropology:+Adaptations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death Valley SUV trails: A guide to 46 four-wheeling excursions in the backcountry in and around Death Valley National Park (Great Basin SUV trail series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s_01AQAAIAAJ&dq=Death+Valley+SUV+trails:+A+guide+to+46+four-wheeling+excursions+in+the+backcountry+in+and+around+Death+Valley+National+Park+(Great+Basin+SUV+trail+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intimate Issues: 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex","description":"Offers advice about the mechanics of sex, developing and maintaining a sexual relationship within a marriage, and how to overcome past sexual issues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rCGODQAAQBAJ&dq=Intimate+Issues:+21+Questions+Christian+Women+Ask+About+Sex&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"College Is Only the Beginning: A Student Guide to Higher Education","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NKjINQAACAAJ&dq=College+Is+Only+the+Beginning:+A+Student+Guide+to+Higher+Education&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Out our way","description":"Out Our Way first saw the light of day as a single-panel cartoon March 20, 1922.

On 7 August 1985, Nevill and June Bamber, their daughter Sheila and her two young sons Nicholas and Daniel were discovered shot to death at White House Farm in Essex. The murder weapon was found on Sheila's body, a bible lay at her side. All the windows and doors of the farmhouse were secure, and the Bambers' son, 24-year-old Jeremy, had alerted police after apparently receiving a phone call from his father, who told him Sheila had 'gone berserk' with the gun. It seemed a straightforward case of murder-suicide, but a dramatic turn of events was to disprove the police's theory. In October 1986, Jeremy Bamber was convicted of killing his entire family in order to inherit his parents' substantial estates. He has always maintained his innocence. Drawing on interviews and correspondence with many of those closely connected to the events  including Jeremy Bamber  and a wealth of previously unpublished documentation, Carol Ann Lee brings astonishing clarity to a complex and emotive case. She describes the years of rising tension in the family that culminated in the murders, and provides clear insight into the background of each individual and their relationships within the family unit. Scrupulously fair in its analysis, The Murders at White House Farm is an absorbing portrait of a family, a time and a place, and a gripping account of one of Britain's most notorious crimes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rj14BwAAQBAJ&dq=Murder+at+White+House+Farm:+The+Story+of+Jeremy+Bamber&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cast with style: Nineteenth century cast-iron stoves from the Albany area","description":"Introduction to the influential cast-iron stoves manufactured in Albany and Troy in the nineteenth century","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cC-Pjr1ChXYC&dq=Cast+with+style:+Nineteenth+century+cast-iron+stoves+from+the+Albany+area&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Appeal In Favor Of That Class Of Americans Called Africans","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-QITAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dialogue - A Socratic Dialogue On The Art Of Writing Dialogue In Fiction","description":"Learn how to utilize dialogue to dramatize conflict, the most effective balance between dialogue and other story elements, and the difference between effective dialogue and real speech.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0zomAQAAMAAJ&dq=Dialogue+-+A+Socratic+Dialogue+On+The+Art+Of+Writing+Dialogue+In+Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Home Cooking","description":"Weaving together memories, recipes, and wild tales of years spent in the kitchen, Home Cooking is Laurie Colwin s cookbook manifesto on the joys of sharing food and entertaining.

NASA has been challenged with crafting a program that continues to produce meaningful science within the constraints of the available budget. Still, pound for pound, small spacecraft are not precisely inexpensive, given the effects of complexity, launch costs, and a greater degree of risk. Historically, science spacecraft have demonstrated increasing reliability, but this trend might not continue, given the shift to managed risk. There is generally less money available to smaller programs to test spacecraft functions and operational procedures prior to launch. Small spacecraft are also generally less robust. Efforts to reduce failure potentials through the application of more reliable components, better testing, and advanced design techniques should receive greater attention. Despite the risks, however, small spacecraft fulfill important roles in earth science, astrophysics, space physics, and planetary science. NASA's current generation of small spacecraft is capable of impressive levels of performance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gJNTAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Cosmos+on+a+Shoestring:+Small+Spacecraft+for+Earth+and+Space+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Spawn, Book 1","description":"Featuring remastered cover art from creator TODD McFARLANE, SPAWN: ORIGINS, VOL. 1 reprints the stories and artwork that laid the groundwork for the most successful independent comic book ever published, including the introduction Spawn himself, and a number of other memorable and menacing characters.

Theologians have either ignored this challenge or have sought to meet it in a variety of ways. Throughout his theological career, Walter Kasper (1933-) has maintained that theology has the mutual tasks of exposition of the Christian faith and of responding to contemporary challenges to this faith. In his seminal work The God of Jesus Christ (1982), he argues that the proper Christian response to modern atheism is the confession of the Trinity. In making this response, Kasper begins to chart a course for all future Christian apologetics, for all efforts to give an account of Christian hope (1 Peter 3:15).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2FsjkfV9VL4C&dq=Theism,+Atheism+and+the+Doctrine+of+the+Trinity:+The+Trinitarian+Theologies+of+Karl+Barth+and+Jurgen+Moltmann+in+Response+to+Protest+Atheism+(American+Academy+of+Religion,+Academy+Series+No.+53)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Griffith's 5-Minute Clinical Consult, 2006 (The 5-Minute Consult Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b6kZAAAACAAJ&dq=Griffith%27s+5-Minute+Clinical+Consult,+2006+(The+5-Minute+Consult+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret Agent","description":"One of the great detective novels of all time, \\"The Secret Agent\\", written in 1903, is a magisterial thriller of terrorists and police in London in the early years of the 20th century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V8vrXfAiPRUC&dq=The+Secret+Agent&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sonnets of David, Book I: A Poetic Paraphrase of Psalms 1-41","description":"If you love the Psalms and you like English-language poetry, then this is the book for you.

The first (chapters i-xi) contains the trial of Jesus based upon Luke 23. The second part (xii-xvi) regards the Resurrection. In it, Leucius and Charinus, the two souls raised from the dead after the Crucifixion, relate to the Sanhedrin the circumstances of the descent of Christ to Limbo.

It was \\"hailed as the only scrupulous, nonpartisan, and adequate book on the subject\\". And in recent years it has received equally high praise in the Soviet Union, where it is now considered the authority on the period, and has been serialized in Neva, one of their leading periodicals. Of course, when the author wrote the original volume two decades ago, he relied heavily on unofficial sources. Now, with the advent of glasnost, an avalanche of new material is available, and he has mined this enormous cache to write a substantially new edition of his classic work. It is remarkable how many of the most disturbing conclusions have born up under the light of fresh evidence. But the author has added enormously to the detail, including hitherto secret information on the three great \\"Moscow Trials,\\" on the fate of the executed generals, on the methods of obtaining confessions, on the purge of writers and other members of the intelligentsia, on life in the labor camps, and many other key matters. Both a leading Sovietologist and a highly respected poet, the author blends research with prose, providing not only an authoritative account of Stalin's purges, but also a compelling chronicle of one of this century's most tragic events.

Yet belief in other worldly phenomena, from poltergeists to telepathy, remains strong, as Gillian Bennett's research shows. Especially common is belief in continuing contact with, or the continuing presence of, dead family members. Bennett interviewed women in Manchester, England, asking them questions about ghosts and other aspects of the supernatural. (Her discussion of how her research methods and interview techniques evolved is in itself valuable.) She first published the results of the study in the well-received Traditions of Belief: Women and the Supernatural, which has been widely used in folklore and women's studies courses. \\"Alas, Poor Ghost!\\" extensively revises and expands that work. In addition to a fuller presentation and analysis of the original field research and other added material, the author, assisted by Kate Bennett, a gerontological psychologist, presents and discusses new research with a group of women in Leicester, England. Bennett is interested in more than measuring the extent of belief in other worldly manifestations. Her work explores the relationship between narrative and belief. She anticipated that her questions would elicit from her interviewees not just yes or no replies but stories about their experiences that confirmed or denied notions of the supernatural. The more controversial the subject matter, the more likely individuals were to tell stories, especially if their answers to questions of belief were positive. These were most commonly individualized narratives of personal experience, but they contained many of the traditional motifs and other content, including belief in the supernatural, of legends. Bennett calls them memorates and discusses the cultural processes, including ideas of what is a \\"proper\\" experience of the supernatural and a \\"proper\\" telling of the story, that make them communal as well as individual. These memorates provide direct and vivid examples of what the storytellers actually believe and disbelieve. In a final section, Bennett places her work in historical context through a discussion of case studies in the history of supernatural belief.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V_rDlgEACAAJ&dq=Alas,+Poor+Ghost:+Traditions+of+Belief+in+Story+and+Discourse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Talking to Your Kids About Sex: A Go Parents!

Between 1939 and 1974 he wrote the autobiography and eight novels now collected by The Library of America in an authoritative three-volume set, earning a place as one of the greatest writers of America, his beloved adopted home. The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, the first novel Nabokov wrote in English, is a tantalizing literary mystery in which a writer's half brother searches to unravel the enigma of the life of the famous author of Albinos in Black, The Back of the Moon, and The Doubtful Asphodel. Bend Sinister (1947), Nabokov's most explicitly political novel, is the haunting, dreamlike story of Adam Krug, a quiet philosophy professor caught up in the bureaucratic bungling of a totalitarian police state. Speak, Memory: An Autobiography Revisited (1951; revised 1966), Nabokov's dazzling memoir of his childhood in imperial Russia and exile in Europe, is central to an understanding of his art. The texts of this volume incorporate Nabokov's penciled corrections in his own copies of his works and correct long-standing errors. They are the most authoritative versions available and have been prepared with the assistance of Dmitri Nabokov, the novelist's son, and Brian Boyd, Nabokov's award-winning biographer, who has also contributed notes and a detailed chronology of the author's life based on new research.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2htbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Vladimir+Nabokov+:+Novels+and+Memoirs+1941-1951+:+The+Real+Life+of+Sebastian+Knight,+Bend+Sinister,+Speak,+Memory+(Library+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Still The One (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","description":"Ex-lovers are reunited by a terrible tragedy and must face their broken hearts head on in this classic tale originally published as Freefall in 2003 by New York Times bestselling author RaeAnne Thayne Ten years ago, Sophie Beaumont had watched as her twin sister, Shelly, had chosen to marry a Canfield man, bear his children and be mistress of his manor.

This work investigates Fonda s activities in North Vietnam and argues that she could have been indicted for treason, that there would have been enough evidence to take the case to a jury, that she could have been convicted, and that a conviction probably would have been upheld on appeal. It also considers Fonda s early life and the effect it had on her behavior and beliefs in her later years, her audience of American POWs who were forced by the Vietnamese to listen to her broadcasts condemning them as war criminals, her arrival in Vietnam and how it was viewed by American servicemen and civilians, the crime of treason throughout history, and the only Congressional inquiry into her actions, which resulted in the government s decision to take no legal action against her. Texts of Fonda s radio broadcasts to American servicemen comprise the appendix.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OA1eCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Testament Challenge Volume 2: Stepping Out in Faith: Life-Changing Examples from the History of Israel","description":"Discover the Life-Changing Relevance of the Old Testament Pursuing Spiritual Authenticity The words of the prophets cut through the millennia, grab us by our shoulders, and shake us from our slumber.

Rocky Mountain News Award-winning author Mark Kurlansky tells the remarkable story of New York by following the trajectory of one of its most fascinating inhabitantsthe oyster. For centuries New York was famous for this particular shellfish, which until the early 1900s played such a dominant a role in the city s life that the abundant bivalves were Gotham s most celebrated export, a staple food for all classes, and a natural filtration system for the city s congested waterways. Filled with cultural, historical, and culinary insightalong with historic recipes, maps, drawings, and photosthis dynamic narrative sweeps readers from the seventeenth-century founding of New York to the death of its oyster beds and the rise of America s environmentalist movement, from the oyster cellars of the rough-and-tumble Five Points slums to Manhattan s Gilded Age dining chambers. With The Big Oyster, Mark Kurlansky serves up history at its most engrossing, entertaining, and delicious.  Suffused with [Kurlansky s] pleasure in exploring the city across ground that hasn t already been covered with other writers  footprints.  Los Angeles Times Book Review  Fascinating stuff . . .

Contrasting the incomparable beauty and complexity of the Lakes and the poetry, folklore, and citizen action they have inspired with the disasters that short-sighted human folly has inflicted on the ecosystem, Dempsey makes this history both engaging and relevant to today's debates and decisions.Underlying the neglectful treatment of the Lakes are two irreconcilable and faulty human assumptions: that the Lakes are a system so big that human beings cannot do it great harm, and that the Lakes are a resource that can be bent to the will of humankind. Dempsey finds evidence that, despite great changes in the laws governing the Lakes and public attitudes toward them in the last fifty years, government policy and institutions are still dominated by these dangerous attitudes.A central theme of On the Brinkis that citizens, who have displayed an increasing sense of commitment to the Lakes and a growing sense of place, must challenge their leaders to reform Great Lakes institutions. Dempsey shows that it is necessary to create a governing system that reflects the realities of life on the ground in communities and that taps into the passion and determination of citizens to protect these treasures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nd7aAAAAMAAJ&dq=On+the+Brink:+The+Great+Lakes+in+the+21st+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","description":"When it was published in 1932, this revolutionary first fiction redefined the art of the novel with its black humor, its nihilism, and its irreverent, explosive writing style, and made Louis-Ferdinand Celine one of France's--and literature's--most important 20th-century writers. The picaresque adventures of Bardamu, the sarcastic and brilliant antihero of Journey to the End of the Night move from the battlefields of World War I (complete with buffoonish officers and cowardly soldiers), to French West Africa, the United States, and back to France in a style of prose that's lyrical, hallucinatory, and hilariously scathing toward nearly everybody and everything. Yet, beneath it all one can detect a gentle core of idealism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZL_BQgAACAAJ&dq=Journey+to+the+End+of+the+Night&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Peek into My Church","description":"This is a charming introduction for Catholic kids into the rituals of their religion and the physical properties of the churches where they will worship.

Like many men of that era who returned home with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), he was never the same. Christal's father spent much of her childhood locked in his room, gravitating between the deepest depression and unspeakable rage, unable to participate in holidays or birthdays. At a very young age, Christal learned to walk on eggshells, doing anything and everything not to provoke him, but this dance caused her to become a profoundly disturbed little girl. She acted out at school, engaged in self-mutilation, and couldn't make friends. At the age of eighteen, Christal left home and didn't look back. She barely spoke to her father for the next thirteen years. To any outsider, Christal appeared to be doing well: she earned a BA and a master's, got married, and traveled to India. But despite all these accomplishments, Christal still hadn't faced her biggest challenge her relationship with her father. In 2009, something changed. Christal decided it was time to begin the healing process, and she extended an olive branch. She came up with what she called \\"The Thirty Day Project,\\" a month's worth of conversations during which she would finally ask her father difficult questions about Vietnam. Thirty Days with My Father is a gritty yet heartwarming story of those thirty days of a daughter and father reconnecting in a way that will inspire us all to seek the truth, even from life's most difficult relationships. This beautifully realized memoir shares how one woman and her father discovered profound lessons about their own strength and will to survive, shedding an inspiring light on generational PTSD.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8tkfAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Make a Killing (Blacklist)","description":"Join me on my first tour of duty in the Navy - what went on in Boot camp, the schools I attended, what life was really like on board an aircraft carrier that was better known for fires than anything else! Come with me on a haze gray and underway misadventure on a guided missile destroyer that had trouble shooting its own missiles (let alone torpedoes) and all of the unimaginable things that happened to me...the people I met and what I witnessed in between. Telling things as they happened, it's a hilarious, serious, yet very straightforward look at life as a Radioman in the U.S. Navy during the Cold War period (1980-1984).

What do all these people have in common? Fame, of course, and undeniable talent. But most of all, they were cool. Birth of the Cool is a stunningly illustrated, brilliantly written cultural history of the American avant-garde in the 1940s and 1950s -- the decades in which cool was born. From intimate interviews with cool icons like poet Allen Ginsberg, bop saxophonist Jackie McLean, and Living Theatre cofounder Judith Malina, award-winning journalist and poet Lewis MacAdams extracts the essence of cool. Taking us inside the most influential and experimental art movements of the twentieth century -- from the Harlem jazz joints where Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker invented bebop to the back room at Max's Kansas City when Andy Warhol was holding court to backstage at the Newport Folk Festival the night Bob Dylan went electric, from Surrealism to the Black Mountain School to Zen -- MacAdams traces the evolution of cool from the very fringes of society to the mainstream. Born of World War II, raised on atomic-age paranoia, cast out of the culture by the realities of racism and the insanity of the Cold War, cool is now, perversely, as conventional as you can get. Allen Ginsberg suited up for Gap ads. Volvo appropriated a phrase from Jack Kerouac's On the Road for its TV commercials. How one became the other is a terrific story, and it is presented here in a gorgeous package, rich with the coolest photographs of the black-and-white era from Robert Doisneau, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Man Ray, and many others. Drawing a direct line between Lester Young wearing his pork-pie hat and his crepe-sole shoes staring out his hotel window at Birdland to the author's three-year-old daughter saying \\"cool\\" while watching a Scooby-Doo cartoon at the cusp of a new millennium, Birth of the Cool is a cool book about a hot subject...maybe even the coolest book ever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gkm3R7_bmfUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aberration of Starlight","description":"Set at a boardinghouse in rural New Jersey in the summer of 1939, this novel revolves around four people who experience the comedies, torments and rare pleasures of family, romance and sex while on vacation from Brooklyn and the Depression. Billy Recco, an eager ten-year-old in search of a father . . . Marie nee McGrath, an attractive divorcee caught between her son and father, without a life of her own . . . John McGrath, dignified in manner yet brutally soured by life, insanely fearful of his daughter's restlessness . . . Tom Thebus, a rakish salesman who precipitates the conflict between Marie's hopes and her father's wrath. We follow these individuals through the events of thirty-six hours, culminating in Tom's disastrous near seduction of Marie. As the novel's perspective shifts to each of these characters, four discrete stories take form, stories that Sorrentino further enriches by using a variety of literary methods--fantasies, letters, a narrative question-and-answer, fragments of dialogue and memory. Strong and unforgettable, each voice is compelling in itself, yet in the end is only part of a complex, painful pattern in which dreams go unfulfilled and efforts unrewarded. What emerges is a sure understanding of four people who are occasionally ridiculous, but whose integrity and good intentions are consistently, and tragically, frustrated. Combining humor and feeling, balancing the details and the rhythms of experience, Aberration of Starlight re-creates a time and a place as it captures the sadness and value of four lives. First published by Random House in 1980, it is widely considered one of Sorrentino's finest novels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fmggAQAAIAAJ&dq=Aberration+of+Starlight&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dinners and Nightmares","description":"Last Gasp proud to bring back this early.

Before it all plays out, men will be murdered, jailed, tarred and feathered or worse, and while everyone in the Fargo clan would kill for the family deeds, God might just end up with them instead.

Preserved on innumerable studio and live recordings, the art of Maria Callas has also enthralled the generation of opera fans who did not experience her on stage. And her fairy-tale biography-glamorous, but not without tragedy-is no less captivating. This volume, containing photographs of her stage appearances, portraits, press photos, and private snapshots, is an attempt to understand in pictures and in words a unique figure of the opera world and stardom. It was not conceived as a biography of the artist in the traditional sense but rather as a study of an incomparable musical genius and her relations with both her artistic and non-artistic friends and associates. Photographers from all over the world have contributed to this unusual pictorial documentation, dedicated to the legendary artist and woman, Maria Callas. The images testify to her overpowering stage presence and her out-standing acting abilities. This volume includes an introduction by the Munich musicologist and publicist Attila Csampai and a complete chronology of Maria Callas' stage appearances. On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Maria Callas' death on September 16, 2007, we are publishing the original 1995 volume in an unchanged reprint.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TCq5PAAACAAJ&dq=Callas:+Images+of+a+Legend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Party and Other Stories: The Tales of Chekhov (Short Stories)","description":"\\"The Party and Other Stories is the fourth volume of the Tales of Chekhov series by Russian author Anton Chekhov.
