I got this book along with the Ultimate Grow DVD. Since then I've quit my job, been to Costa Rica a few times, hiked through Europe. And for the first time in my life I'm flying first class. There is no need to get any other \\"how-to-grow\\" manuals, as this is enough. If you enjoy reading, gardening and rolling around in money, do yourself a favor and buy this book. I would also suggest getting the DVD, as it's helpful to see the instructions in action."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, but if you are looking for basic step by step directions.

The layout is great, the sections are color-coded on the edge of the pages, which makes it easy to find the section I am looking for, and the colors chosen to represent each section make perfect sense (Blue for Hydroponic Gardening, Green for Vegetative Growth, Pink for Flowering, Yellow for Lights, Brown fro Seeds & Seedlings, etc.) Its packed with relevant information, with beautiful glossy photos and/or charts on every page There is a reason this is the \\"Indoor Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible.\\" In my opinion, this Grower's Manual is the only one worthy of holding the \\"Bible\\" title. Highly detailed information on any technique you are looking for, for ANY part of your Grow, is here in one book, and if you want to know why or how your plants or the equipment you need to help them thrive does what it does and why, this is the book to go for. The detail in which subjects are explained truly exceeded my expectations, and this is the first Grow Manual that has succeeded in doing so. If I was suggesting a book to a first-time grower, I would suggest a different book (only because the book I have in mind is very simple to understand), but once you read that simple book, you'll be armed with questions and most likely want to explore and understand a broader depth of information, and this is the Book you want to have ready when you get to that place. I have had great success employing the techniques I learned in this book, and I recommend it as a necessity in any Grower's Library.p.s. I especially appreciate the information relevant to the Medical Marijuana Community, and the fact that it is demonstrated how therapeutic tending to the garden is for those of us who are ill, and need our Gardens for Medical Use. I also appreciate that this book is set up in such a respectful way that, when reading the book, you actually do get the sense that Jorge understands his audience (the Medical Marijuana Community), because Respect is all we want."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"this book is thorough and a blessing to anyone who is involoved in the production of great herb."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"This is the most comprehensive guide that I have seen on growing cannabis.

( My Pharm Meds are $1200... but my insurance Co. pays that scam! ). The Cannabis works ALLOT better!I want to grow 1 plant every 3 months, like 99% of the legit patients. I would destroy any excess I overproduced... personally.Obviously, this Author is beyond expert and is an authority on the subject. I would love a Medical Growers Bible for your \\"PERSONAL\\" Med crop. With a strict recommendation for personal use only. If you sell ANY, you are just a dealer... so, keep it clean... is the book \\" I \\" want.

After reading it front to back, I can tell you this book is practically useless. First off, Jorge Cervantes is a terrible writer. I thought it may be due to the fact that the book has been reprinted like 20 times, but after reading some articles of his I realized it is simply his writing. His writing is choppy, inconsistent, and overall hard to follow, like a dyslexic 7th grader. There are very few facts in this book, nothing he says is backed up with science or research, simply his opinion. Rather than answering a beginners questions, this book leaves the beginner bewildered and with a hundred more questions. The book opens the door into several topics, but contains very little substance in it's 400 pages. Also, almost all his information is geared towards a giant operation, using multiple high power lights and other expensive equipment. There is nothing in here for someone trying to start something in a 3x3 closet or a rebuilt dresser. I am confused as to why so few people seem aware of the inconsistencies of the book, and why so many praise it as the \\"Grow Bible.\\" Overall I do NOT recommend this book to anyone for any reason. Look into Ed Rosenthal, who is much more well informed, and far more capable of writing things in an easy to understand, grammatically correct manner. The only thing I liked about this book was the high quality photos of really nice looking flowers."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"I bought this today and i am quite stoked on the reviews. 5 stars on the reviews beeeyotch"},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"This book I recently bought, was very well rounded in all aspects of horticulture. They did a great job in providing facts in so many categories. I am glad I bought this book. It showed me alot facts I needed to know that I didn't. I would recommend it for beginners. The reason is because with each topic they focused on, was a general overall prospective. I was hoping it would have been a little more detailed, but with all the topics the book covered it would have been split into a couple books. I rated it a perfect book from my perspective.

The color coded sections are great and are a must for fast referencing. It can take the beginner grower from deciding what to grow, where to grow and how to grow all in one book. For the oldtimers and the super advanced growers this book will teach you a lot of new money saving ideas, also help you to improve your yields, and keep you upto date on the new ever changing grow technology.For all the people who think that they can learn no more, this book is for you. I guarantee that everybody can learn something new. There is no other book on the market that can compare. All the other book's are very outdated and are just like smoking 70's weed, old and past there time."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"Yesterday, I sent out e-mail to people from 8 different countries that I had sent books to. They have an opinion that I value and I requested a short review. At the end of 48 hours, 25 glowing reviews came back.== 01 ==\\"Fun, informative, illustrative, hands-on and authoritative. Whether for approved medical use patients or prohibition pragmatists, Marijuana Horticulture unravels the mini mysteries and places responsible individuals firmly on the path to self-sufficiency.\\" Allen St. Pierre, Executive Director, NORML, Washington. DC, USA.== 02 ==\\"World famous cannabis cultivator Jorge Cervantes strikes back with a new edition of his green bible, and what a book it has become. Cervantes knows what he is talking about, and he has the skill to put it on paper. What a book this is. With more than 500 pages and over 1100 full colour images it is a true and valuable encyclopaedia for the modern cannabis cultivator. This is a must read.\\" Rob Tuinstra, Chief Editor Highlife magazine, Holland.== 03 ==\\"I have been writing a garden column every week for 30 years and I have had a lot of questions about growing Cannabis, and lately medical marijuana. I never knew where to send these people for answers. I do now! Putting aside any legal and moral judgements one may have about marijuana, this is one hell of a book, quite stunning, actually. It has more useful, color pictures and diagrams than I have ever seen in ANY horticultural how-to, and I have seen them all. Sound too strong? Just thumb through a few pages and tell me I am wrong...you lose. The photos are fascinating, including some exceptional close-ups and magnified shots; those of plant infections and insect-caused inflictions illustrate common gardening diseases and pests better than I have ever seen. Call me a liar, until you check them out. Clearly, if it was legal to grow marijuana, this would be THE Bible to have to learn how to grow and prepare it.\\" - Jeff Lowenfels, America's Longest Running garden columnist, Fellow and Hall of Fame member, GWA, America's dirtiest lawyer, USA.== 04 ==\\"Jorge's Bible is truly a collector's item.

With this most recent edition of his Bible, Jorge proves once again he remains far ahead of the pack.\\" Steven Hager, Cannabis Cup Founder, USA/Holland.== 07 ==\\"I love the Bible - it's packed with authorities and highly practical information on about every aspect of cannabis and it's even very funny at times. Graphics are outstanding and it's very well structured. It makes for a compelling read, and within only a few days I have been through it completely, not even skipping topics that were absolutely of no immediate practical interest, such as mounting a guerrilla grow show in the mountains; started reading the night after the Highlife Trade Fair (January 2006) when I was too exhausted to even see and ended up being absorbed for two straight hours. I immediately bought some copies to hand out to friends. &iexcl;Una obra estupenda!\\" Jan Sennema, Dutch Cannabis Journalist, Soft Secrets and Highlife magazines, Holland.== 08 ==\\"As an expert witness in court, I spend a lot of time talking about average yields of cannabis. Cervantes' book, Marijuana Horticulture, is a valuable resource for people who want to rise above the average and produce excellent crops, but it also helps people solve the problems that plague any grower, from the novice to the most experienced.\\" Chris Conrad, USA.== 09 ==\\"This is the most complete and up-to-date manual for growers. Colourful and useful at the same time, Medical Grower's Bible is simply essential.\\" Daniele Levi, Chief Editor of Spannabis magazine, Spain.== 10 ==\\"The new Bible is a winner - a great new addition with lots of new information and a wonderfully easy reference system!\\" Mila, The Pollinator/Hemp Hotel, Amsterdam, Holland== 11 ==\\"Jorge Cervantes has done it again, and pushed it further.

Marijuana Horticulture is a mountain of crucial info, using excellent photographic images to give the reader a picture-perfect look at all the successful ways to grow great weed. It is also a great directory for all your necessary components for a great garden. Its color-coded chapters make using it easy. In my book, it's an A+, read.\\" Soma, Soma Seeds, Amsterdam, Holland.== 14 ==\\"Calling it the Bible is right! Jorge Cervantes tackles the subject of marijuana cultivation with the same fervor as a religious zealot. No stone is left unturned in this must have for those on the path to cannabis cultivation enlightenment.\\" David Strange, Editor in Chief, Skunk magazine, Canada.== 15 ==\\"While I'm not quite sure whether the Bible really gives answers to all questions on human life, I definitely think that this grower's bible will answer all your questions on marijuana plant life, and even a damn lot more.

This fine indoor/outdoor Medical Grower's Bible is just that.Although I have read many cannabis books, and even written one, I learned much from this enjoyable read. In Bonanza of Green I show an easy method for new growers that tries to pursuade new growers to give it a try.My simple method works well for a low initial investment but Jorge provided information on many methods. I highly recommend that this book be read right after mine. ;)The two books compliment each other and the beauty of Jorges book will make it one of your most treasured possessions. It certainly is one of mine. So thanks Jorge for making this available to everyone at such a great price.Unbelievable that Jorges book has 1120 color images and 512 full color pages. This book is a \\"10\\" and a must read for all serious growers or anyone who wants to learn more. BOG :)"},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"Over the years Jorge's Marijuana Horticulture books have been very well known for their high quality Cannabis cultivation information. I expect to see this newest book join it's predecessors fetching high prices on the secondary markets in the not so distant future. It is a beautiful and worthy addition to my personal collection of marijuana books."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"Jorge Cervantes has been one of the most reliable vendors of horticultural advice since I first encountered his work over twenty years ago. Call him \\"a head\\" of his time. He doesn't hold back. When he has new information, he shares it. Because of his awesome contacts internationally, he's always at the forefront of new techniques and myth busting. When I see new books claiming to be better than this one, I usually figure it's someone who has learned from Jorge and wants a piece of his action, which is not to say there's nothing new to be learned from others--but rarely enough to justify the cost. When someone recommends another book as better, I can be pretty sure he hasn't read Jorge's classy tome carefully. Of course, the proof of that is to buy a copy of each, read them all closely, and discover for yourself what a treasure this book is."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"this is by far the most informative book I have read. if you know about Jorge Cervantes I don't need to say anymore. if you buy one book this is the one it has EVERYTHING. happy growing"},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"This is packed with information. If you have no experience in growing anything you will be over whelmed and the book will be clear as mud, but keep reading and it will all become clear.

My only complaint is the information could be a little bit better organized."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"Very informative book, definitely focuses in on the preparations needed to grow.

This book has everything in it from starting seeds or clones, to hydro to aeuroponics(air-o-ponics). The only thing it doesn't show is a step by step instruction on how to build a room from the ground up. Hopefully that book is out there somewhere. All in all this book was definetly worth the money. It's an excellent book that has all the new ways of growing and it even shows you a little about making your own breed or strain of marijuana. Good luck everyone.

I thought about purchasing other books, but after reading about this one and the reviews it received, I was sold. Now that I own it I couldn't be more pleased with the wealth of information it provides as well as it's straight forward nature. If you are a novice or expert I would recommend this book as a guideline for all to follow. The layout is great, and the book progresses from building a grow room, to picking seeds, through the vegitative and flowering stages of plants.My only complaint and recommended fix is that when the book mentions a word or acronym - it neglects to explain it's meaning immediately. For example, it mentions TDS ( total dissolved solids) and EC (electrical conductivity) without telling us what these mean - other then saying it will be explained later on. It would help if they provided a sidenote of the definition so the reader doesn't have to flip through the rest of the book to learn what they mean.Great book and I would highly reccomend it to anyone interested in learning togrow."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"Ok, this book is right there where I needed it.

The language is very direct with some explanation, but a lot needs to be left to interpretation. In addition, to read the book, it takes some effort. It has moments that are really interesting and easy to read, but it also has moments where there is not much going on and it is rather dull to read. Although, the ideas are very relevant to today's society and views of the workplace. In the following, I am going to give a few axamples and ideas about how this ancient work can be used today.Though, the Sun Tzu wrote the Art of War many, many, years ago, about strategies for wartime, the theories are very relative in today's world. Though it requires a great deal of interpretation, the ideas of planning, strategies, leadership, and troop management can be employed in modern workplaces. Ideas range from ensuring that troops are well taken care of to what a commander of an army needs to do to make sure there is a win. If troops are taken care of, then they are more willing to complete their job successfully. In a workplace, if employees feel they are &quot;taken care of&quot; and their needs are fulfilled, they will be more willing to complete their assignments to the best of their abilities. Additionally, if the commander maintains proper leadership, it will allow for a greater chance to win. In other words, if the manager in a workplace maintains ethical and proper leadership, the company will go further then if not. Another part of the novel explains the role a commander must take in order to maintain the resect of the troops. This includes the commander not acting higher and better, but doing just what the troops are doing. This way, if the troops feel that the commander would do what they are doing, then they will feel better about what they are doing in the army. In modern business, this can be thought of as a manager or boss in a company who does not do what they are telling their employees to do. This then makes the employees not really take pride in their work, let alone, it makes them not really want to complete their jobs. We have all been in postions at work, where we have really considered quitting because of our boss or manager and their treatment towards us. On the other hand, we have all been in jobs where the job is not that fabulous and the pay is not that great, but because the manager is good at being a manager, we stay in our position. The Art of War outlines many aspects that leaders should follow in order to gain the respect of the &quot;army&quot; or people who are listening to their command.Overall, The Art of War offers many suggestions and ideas that are very relevant to todays workplace. If applied correctly, it can really help in making a more successful place of employment in any field."},{"Title":"Sunzi: Sun Bin: The Art of War","review":"Honestly, this book was rather difficult to read.

I find the examples given are very practical, with tips given at appropriate places when needed.I enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"EMDR and the Relational Imperative: The Therapeutic Relationship in EMDR Treatment","review":"This is a fascinating book, describing the interface between EMDR, an evidence based psychotherapy, and its practice from a relational/humanistic viewpoint.This book reflects the deep understanding of a master EMDR clinician, Mark Dworkin, who has been schooled in a variety of physiotherapeutic models which he has successfully integrated into his way of thinking about and working with his clients. Dworkin goes well beyond the boundaries of any one specific type of psychotherapy filling his book with frankly presented clinical cases and vignettes showing both his successes and failures. Indeed his honesty is remarkable. Dworkin has developed many strategies of self care that the general psychotherapist can adapt to help within the parameters of the system of therapy practiced. He beautifully describes what a great system of thought EMDR is and deftly illustrates how he has learned from counter transferential mistakes. Woven within the fabric of an EMDR session, this book provides an extremely helpful clinical framework for practicing a highly effective psychotherapy. I found reading it extremely useful and believe that this gem of a book should be on every practicing clinician's bookshelf."},{"Title":"EMDR and the Relational Imperative: The Therapeutic Relationship in EMDR Treatment","review":"Dworkin does an excellent job of presenting EMDR as a comprehensive method of doing therapy and not a simple technique. He clearly shows how, as in all approaches to psychotherapy, the quality of the relationship between client and therapist is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, when EMDR is viewed as a mechanical technique, this essential component of therapy may be forgotton.The book will be useful to therapists who have just taken the training, but also to practitioners who have used EMDR for awhile. For the novice it can help him or her integrate EMDR into whatever methods were used prior to taking the training. And, for the experienced EMDR clincian, a lot of useful ideas are given for mastering the advanced and subtle aspects of treatment.Overall, a well written, engaging book with numerous case examples that hold the reader's attention."},{"Title":"EMDR and the Relational Imperative: The Therapeutic Relationship in EMDR Treatment","review":"Mark Dworkin has written what for me, as a relatively new EMDR therapist, is the most helpful book on EMDR I have read. He writes that the client-therapist relationship is so important you can't really do effective EMDR work without it. In the process of making his argument for the importance of relationship, he ends up very effectively explaining how to integrate EMDR into an existing practice and how to both stay out of the way and stay attuned to the client. He describes the process of tending to the working alliance with a client through the eight phases of EMDR treatment. Finally, Dworkin describes how when EMDR seems not to work, it's possible to use a relationship focus to identify and overcome the obstacles. By describing his own work with clients, the author does a great job of describing how varied and creative EMDR work can be, despite its formal, structured protocols."},{"Title":"EMDR and the Relational Imperative: The Therapeutic Relationship in EMDR Treatment","review":"An important subject, covered in depth. Mark Dworkin presents his material in a readily accessable manner for the professional.The book is brilliantly edited by Margot Silk Forrest whose work will be remembered from \\"EMDR-The Breakthrough Therapy for Overcoming Anxiety, Stress and Trauma\\".\\"EMDR and the Relational Imperative\\" is a long awaited volume and belongs on every therapist's shelf."},{"Title":"EMDR and the Relational Imperative: The Therapeutic Relationship in EMDR Treatment","review":"This is a must have book for those using EMDR, particularly if you are new at the process. This would be the second book to buy after the basic text. It helps the new therapist see and appreciate how the therapeutic relationship is central to the use of eyemovement. It is well written and makes much clear."},{"Title":"The Christian Family Toolbox: 52 Benedictine Activities for the Home","review":"I had just finished writing &quot;The Christian Family Toolbox&quot; the day the earthquake hit. We don't take earthquakes casually in our coastal village. Our beach town is highly vulnerable to earthquakes and tidal waves. Our beachfront grade school is located just a few feet above sea level, and has the distinction of being the most vulnerable school in the nation to the threat of a tsunami. My children grew up in that school.The day the earthquake hit, one son was in Middle School (10 miles away), one in High School (12 miles away) and one in college (90 miles away). My wife called to discuss what we should do. &quot;They're in God's hands&quot;, I said, trying to sound reassuring. We've always believed our children belonged to God first. I found myself fighting away feelings of fear, wondering what we would do if it were a real emergency, with a 30-foot wave crashing into our village resulting from an offshore earthquake.I've always been amazed at how many thoughts can crash through our brains in a few short moments: Have we adequately prepared our children for facing emergencies? Have we spent enough time with them? Did we love them enough? Have we successfully given them a solid foundation of faith in Jesus Christ? What could we have done better as parents?The only waves to break over our coastal village that day were waves of panic and then relief when we heard the &quot;all clear!&quot; signal on the emergency loudspeakers in town. The earthquake was an inland quake, centered 100 miles away. Though the earthquake did cost over $2 billion dollars in damage to buildings and property in the northwest, no tsunami hit our town that day.That night at dinner, our family joined hands in a circle and prayed together, thanking God for protecting us and watching over our lives even when the earth shook under our feet. Then we talked practically about what we would do in the event of a major earthquake and tsunami.&quot;The Christian Family Toolbox&quot; provides parents with the type of guidance and encouragement we discussed at our family dinner the night of that earthquake: spiritual foundations and practical tools for building stronger families, families equipped to face times when the foundations begin to shake."},{"Title":"The Good Housekeeping Cookbook","review":"I have the 1963 edition of this book. It was given to me by a family friend, but it was already \\"old\\" when I got it (in 1973). Yhe recipes are good basic recipes for somebody just learning how to cook. I especially liked \\"Bert's Brioche\\" and find I refer to that recipe frequently.There is information on the definition of various food ingredients, such as heavy cream, light creamas well as \\"instant powdered cream\\" which I have never heard of or seen. Various leavening agents are defined, as well as various types of flour.This is quite a find for those of you who like to cook, who might be looking for Grandma's spice cake recipe or perhaps Mom's dinner rolls. I do feel I have to comment that though my copy is 43 years old, the book is well put togehter and I don't have any loose pages falling out. Not quite sure what happened to the other reviewer's book, but this one has stood the test of time better than some of my more recently published cookbooks.Buy it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"The Good Housekeeping Cookbook","review":"This book has recipes for everything imaginable.

There is the all time great banana bread recipe. I bought this for my daughter who is a junior in college...the tradition continues!Also there is a section in the back on etiquette, how to set tables, host teas etc. It is a riot!

After very little use, the binding fell apart and all the pages fell out. I wrote the publisher in NY, but they never replied. So I threw out the book and bought a second copy. Unfortunately, it promptly disintegrated too. I still have the book -- as a collection of loose pages (not a single page remains in the binding) -- and refer to it when I need a recipe for a \\"standard\\" food.The low rating is not for the content -- which is good, but rather the poor workmanship and the lack of customer service.

Bob Wayne is a washed up loser who is still somewhat anxious to achieve something with his life. He abandons financial and personal problems at home by escaping to Belize. The jungles and beaches of the Caribbean paradise provide a spectacular backdrop for a series of nail-biting escapades. Grady's characters are complex and believable, his plot is engaging and his descriptions completely mesmerizing. He skillfully weaves Belize's rich history into the plot's twists and turns. Jade Head is a great tale and well worth a read."},{"Title":"MSMQ From Scratch (From Scratch)","review":"This is for beginners only. Examples and explainations are very simplistic and do not provide the detail necessary for creating a real world messaging application. Much effort is expended providing information on using the Visual Basic IDE and on creating a UI. The code examples also demonstrate poor programming practices.

We've allowed half truths and propaganda to replace good scientific analysis in public policy, creating programs spending billions of dollars that might save one life in the next 20 years versus efforts that could save thousands now. Just yesterday (April 3rd, 2004), the San Jose Mercury news reported on the rescue of some bird eggs that would not survive in the wild due to thin egg shells because of DDT - a myth that has become a commonly held 'fact' that is refuted in Dini's book (with many others...). Be informed - know both sides of the issues - read this book!"},{"Title":"Challenging Environmental Mythology: Wrestling Zeus","review":"This \\"author\\" is a salesman selling junk pseudo-science to right wing reactionaries who can't think for themselves.The above review by the \\"scientific\\" director of The Heartland Institute is laughable. This \\"institute\\" has received funds from the petroleum industry and seems to provide a pseudo-scientific front.Buyer beware."},{"Title":"Challenging Environmental Mythology: Wrestling Zeus","review":"Jack Dini, author of Challenging Environmental Mythology, is every bit the environmentalist. He loves animals and scenic parks. He thinks clean air and water are critically important. And within the pages of this book he offers an amazingly lucid, accurate, and common-sense criticism of the environmental movement in its current state.Dini remembers the bright scientists that set the country on an appropriate path of environmental protection more than 35 years ago. He laments the hijacking of the movement by those who care less about the environment and more about expanding government power and reducing individual freedom.Radical environmentalists increasingly assert that the mere ability to detect the trace presence of a chemical is enough to prove we need massive and unnecessary environmental regulation and remediation. They warn about chemicals measured in parts per trillion, which is the same ratio as one second in 32,000 years.Unjustified RadicalismWhile many people implicitly understand the unjustified radicalism of such environmental extremists, most of us do not have the ability to debate such extremists effectively or educate our friends who know no better. Dini gives us the tools to fight misinformation, whether spread maliciously or out of innocent ignorance.Dini analyzes the foundation of every major environmental issue that is now clouded with political rhetoric. At a time when the public can be thoroughly confused between fact and fiction regarding our environment, Dini unravels our problems with the precision of a brilliant physicist and the unusual ability to communicate with simple, jargon-free language we can all understand.The 32 brief essays that compose the book (see sidebar) accurately describe the human risk, or lack thereof, from countless headlined environmental scares that have stricken fear into the hearts and minds of the great majority of the public, who do not have access to sound scientific data.When you reach the end of this book, you will be enriched by the wonderful science you have learned from this modern-day Mr. Wizard and elated by the lifting of the weight of pessimism from your shoulders.Challenging Environmental Myths is deeply discounted on Amazon.com. You can afford to buy a dozen copies of this book and give them to friends who are willing to meet you halfway with an open mind on the key environmental issues of the day.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jay Lehr, Ph.D. (lehr@heartland.org) is science director for The Heartland Institute."},{"Title":"Acts of Passion: Sexuality, Gender, and Performance","review":"This fascinating book is about the various ways lesbians and bisexual women express themselves through the arts. It contains many personal essays about how lesbians have used poetry, performance art, and dance to liberate themselves. If you're a creative person, or have wanted to be creative but were afraid of what people might think of your efforts, this book should inspire you. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Acts of Passion: Sexuality, Gender, and Performance","review":"Acts of Passion is inspiring in its diversity,intelligence and depth. The acts of passion itdescribes are often acts of courage for the artistsinvolved, given the uniqueness of their voices.I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested inperformance and sexuality."},{"Title":"Ancient Wisdom and Secret Sects (Mysteries of the Unknown)","review":"The reason I own a copy of this book is despite the fact it was not written by someone within the tradition, any person could follow the story line (with the aid of the pictures and reproduced plates) well enough to obtain a working knowledge of the history of the events leading and influencing the Western Tradition making it what is today. Thus gaining an understanding of what it is to be a part of this fabulous tradition.This book will be of interest especially to students and initiates of the Golden Dawn and Rosicrucians (from any of the various schools) and Freemasons. This book is almost a primer, giving a good and fairly comprehensive overview and alot of places where the reader could research further much more easily with the knowledge obtained of the different authors.What really sets this book apart is the use of pictures. These make the story much easier to follow and much much more interesting. This takes the feeling of a history lesson right out of it! This is replaced by paintings, photographs, reproduced plates from alchemical texts and things like that. One thing that should be noted is that for every increment of fun, an equal amount of sholarly feel is removed. Then one should say this book is alot of fun.I would own this book just to have a picture of Westcott in full G.D. regalia, fire wand and all. There are numerous things like this through out the book with an average of two or three of these pictures per page.The material in this book starts of with initiation, and moves through Mithras, Isis and cults of old. Then Masonry covering prominent figures (George Washington, Sir Christopher Wren, Pike) and is very nicely done. The Templars and Shriners are in there, but for me the book really gets interesting examining the &quot;Fama&quot; and the various alchemists (Boehme, Maier) and Rosicrucians. H. Spencer Lewis and the AMORC is pictured but Max Heindel is only mentioned unfortunatly. As I said before there are pictures of all the founding fathers of the Golden Dawn, and I am now able to put names on the faces of the pictures on the website. The theosophical society is covered once again with pictures and reproduced plates. Next is the chapter on the beast himself. Aleister Crowley has an entire chapter devoted to a very one sided veiw of his career. The dates are correct and the pictures are outstanding but his masonic and buhddist history is downplayed if mentioned at all, painting an eccentric picture of the man in a somewhat unkind light. To be taken with a grain of salt.The one thing that could have been added to this book is a little more on doctrine. This is why i recomend it as use in the way of a starter or primer. The knowledge here is based mainly historically, in other words the tree of life, the middle pillar, and the columns are not to be found in this book. It will be usefull to anyone trying to simplify and explain the history and what it means to be a member. Scholar wise, despite the obviously well done research, it is highschool book report material at best.Plus if your just into learning about nifty secret societies that everyday people, senators, and even modern day presidents belong to, this book can show you with pictures to boot. That might take some of the mystery out of it, but its still really cool don't you think?"},{"Title":"Ancient Wisdom and Secret Sects (Mysteries of the Unknown)","review":"This was a really interesting read. I found it thought provoking and clever. The stories were written with a cross between the academic and analytical. However it could have conveyed the ideas of skeptics and scientific investigation more than the whimsy of a good ghost story that leans more toward the supernatural."},{"Title":"Strangers at the Bedside: A History of How Law and Bioethics Transformed Medical Decision-Making","review":"What do you do with a book that in spite of disagree with the vantage point of the author, you have to admit that the points he raises and the stand he takes has some validity? That an author can cause the reader to stop and think about firmly held belief systems, is indicative of a good writer in my opinion.The author of this bioethical treatise is not a physician. He is a sociologist, and he is giving the historical background to the immense changes in how the American public views its medical establishment. In the process of becoming involved in ethics in the medical world, Rothman had to come in close contact with those he was writing about...physicians. I get the feeling that he was and to a point still in awe of the great men and the great minds he has been exposed to. Occasionally, the book seemed to be biased in favor of the physicians. A book such as this cannot be written without showing the author's own biases; author's can only admit that they harbor particular biases towards those they are writing about.In many issues Rothman comes down solidly on behalf of the physicians, whether or not they brought about the changes in the public's attitudes towards those who work in medicine. Rothman bemoans the fact that the public has involved lawyers, bioethicists, and politicians in what used to be the private domain of physicians. Yet he writes and explains the history behind this lowering of pedestals for doctors and medical researchers...all the while trying to explain why physicians felt their patients should rely 'on those who know and understand' (read that to mean physicians think most patients and families are too stupid to understand basic concepts).This book actually gives a good and vitally important background into the movements for individual rights and the exposure of unethical experimentation and medical treatment which led to the creation of new standards for medical care and research, as well as the installment of Internal Research Boards (IRBs) which are suppose to act as brakes on over-ambitious and unethical practices. Unfortunately, it is all too clear in recent media reports that even IRBs in universities and hospitals are not enough to protect the American public from research by those not interested in protecting the patients and alleviating pain, but rather shows more concern for keeping the grant money coming, fame, and doing science merely for the sake of doing science ('because we can!) John Hopkins obviously hasn't changed its attitudes over 30 some odd years towards the rights of the individual, since they are continuing to attract attention and controversy because of unethical research.This book is definitely a must-read for anyone interested in bioethics. Even if the reader does not agree with the author, the book provides a different, and somewhat valid reflection of the medical establishment's views towards the infringement of their previously existing rights in determining patient care and the moral standards of research.

It is comprehensive technical reference of core web technologies.Specifically, HTML, Javascript, HTTP, CSS, and the like. As a reference, it is very thorough in each topic, covering every single element, every single object, every single response header, and every single style (at the time it was written, anyway). However, it is also very succinct. This book is NOT FOR LEARNING. It's a REFERENCE for professionals.Of all the technical books I've ever owned, this book is without any doubt the one I use the most.

I was able to cite the solution of the a problem involving a propagating electromagnetic wave along a transmission line for an important Engineering course project. For such a problem, Lebedev offers a far more detailed and precise solution with given Special Functions than anything I have ever seen in other books of the same nature with the possible exception of a specialized treatise by an MIT EE faculty member on applied electromagnetism. He also comes across as meticulous in derivations of solutions to problems worked out compared to many other authors whose works I have read. This is because he hardly ever skips an important step in deriving a solution for any given problem by leaving it out for the reader's imagination. Yet we know Lebedev as perhaps a mathematician who may not be realistically expected to come up with such complete and exhaustive solutions to practical or real-world problems, worked out with clarity as well as precision and depth. There are numerous other examples which he worked out for different applications (e.g, Legendre's and Laguerre's functions) invariably after he took pains to delineate the various mathematical properties of the Special Functions utilized to obtain the closed-form solutions. He also covers various mathematical functions which may not be as familiar to many engineering practitioners but nonetheless have an important place in applied mathematical analysis. In a sense, he saves them for occasions when we as readers may need to probe further into unfamiliar territory.So if you are looking for depth and precision in analysis of physical problems in Engineering and Science, or are trying to cope with reaearch problems in Applied Mathematics, try out this book by Lebedev. It can initially come across as difficult to understand, but Lebedev expects the reader to follow along through diligence. It is almost one of a kind, being that it is very clear and lucid without noticeable loss in depth and mathematical rigor. I highly recommend it because I believe that few other books can even come close in offering good examples in solutions to real-world problems and, at the same time, demonstrate the power of Special Functions in applications. Of course, it is also very inexpensive."},{"Title":"Special functions and their applications (Selected Russian publications in the mathematical sciences)","review":"Bessel's, harmonics, normal CDF, gamma, hypergeometrics, orthogonal polynomials, etc. The most important functions in engineering, (except for elementary stuff on our calculators, of course).Very good coverage.

Conveniently sized paperback."},{"Title":"Special functions and their applications (Selected Russian publications in the mathematical sciences)","review":"Yet another excellect translation by Silverman. I've only been in possession of this book for a few days but it's already becoming a favorite mathematics text. Not a pure mathematics text but certainly a very thorough, lucid and most certainly enjoyable discussion of applied mathematics with a particularly engaging discussion of the solution of partial differential equations (Laplacian, Poisson etc.) by means of separation of variables and integral transforms. Along the way it develops the theoretical essentials of gamma functions, exponential integrals, orthogonal polynomials, Bessel functions, spherical harmonics among others. Clearly written with an emphasis on explaining the process of discovering solutions rather than merely presenting particular solutions (though it does have enlightening examples). IMO, well worth the price."},{"Title":"Special functions and their applications (Selected Russian publications in the mathematical sciences)","review":"As the title indicates, the book is designed with the goal of application front and center. That said, it is also important to note that the theoretical background is developed with full mathematical rigor. You can easily see this from the fact that whenever an infinite series is differentiated, its uniform convergence in the region of interest is always established beforehand. And this is just one example.Now, given the fact that special functions is a vast subject, and the fact that the book is barely 300 pages long, it is obvious that the theoretical coverage, though rigorous, has to be reined in. By this I refer to the fact that most functions are developed from the point of view of series solutions to differential equations, while solution by contour integrals in the plane is basically absent. But then again, it doesn't matter how you develop the functions, the key is to know their properties and be able to apply them. The book will show you just how to do that. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.For a more broad-based theoretical coverage, I recommend Whittaker and Watson (but of course), and the book \\"Special Functions\\" by X. Z. Wang. These two books complement each other like lovers."},{"Title":"Special functions and their applications (Selected Russian publications in the mathematical sciences)","review":"Of course this book cannot be compared to &quot; A course of modern analysis &quot;, but as a book in special functions, it have served its purpose.

Estes.It is an introduction to the wisdom literature of the Old Testament: Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.This is not a full verse-by-verse commentary. Instead, it covers the kind of material that is normally covered in the beginning of a full commentary. That is, Estes discusses the authorship, date, genre, structure, etc. of each book. Additionally, each section has a \\"History of Interpretation\\" for each book, which is especially helpful for Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs.Traveling through Psalms in only 71 pages may seem to be a disservice to the text. However, the purpose is to give the \\"big picture\\" of the book in an exciting and fresh manner that invites the reader to go further in study.In dicussion on Proverbs, Estes groups the verses under 12 themes. I took this same approach when preaching through Proverbs in the past, and definitely think this is the preferred approach for preaching through the book, at least chapters 10-31.Regarding the Song of Songs, he rejects the allegorical interpretations in favor of: \\"...it extols the richness of human erotic love as a gift from God\\" (401)If any of you have had the joy of sitting under the teaching of Old Testament professor Daniel Block, you know of his deep love for the Scriptures. Dr. Block gives the following recommendation for Estes' book:\\"This introduction to the biblical books on godly piety and wisdom represents a model of balanced and judicious tudy. While taking advantage of the most recent scholarship on the Psalms and the wisdom writings, Estes is able to distill this information and present it in a form that is accessible to laypersons and helpful to any involved in the serious study of Scripture.

Yes, they've known each other for a long time and yes, they've kissed and noticed an attraction, but they go from finally getting together after three years of avoidance to a hastily crafted sex scene. I didn't feel much of a connection to Verity once she became sober. Michael had about as much emotion as a stick. The use of a ghost works when he first appears, but then it becomes obvious that he's just there to shove the book along. You read his words and think - oh, please, give me a break.

After her husband Sam's death, Verity began an onward spiral of neglect until the ghost-like appearance of her husband Sam. Though apparitions are rather unconventional in romantic suspense, Sam adds a lighter touch enabling Verity to pull her life back together again. ...Though the discussion of terrorists and middle-eastern politics seems a little too detailed at times, it is a necessity in forming the foundation on which this novel is built. Further enhancing the element of mystery are the discussions that Michael and Verity have as they piece together the puzzle of the traitor's identity and try to discover the motives behind the crimes committed.

Apparently deep cover operative Michael Straight has learned that a new player in the area, the Kashmir Freedom Party, has been receiving weapons with the help of someone in the State Department. Verity is to meet her childhood friend Kahlid Mohammed who will only tell her insider information but he is assassinated before the information is exchanged. With only Michael to depend on, Verity tries to get out alive while insuring hundreds maybe thousands do not die in a terrorist cause.Fans who enjoy an exciting romantic international thriller that never slows down once Jasmine Cresswell takes her audience to Asia will want to read THE CONSPIRACY. The story line is loaded with action that provides an engaging look into life in battle scarred Kashmir. Verity is a heroine struggling with the death of her husband and her feelings towards Michael that adds guilt to her grief, but the romance though warm takes a back seat to the suspense and tour of this part of the world. Sub-genre fans will fully relish that wild ride that feels so genuine with all the news of the India-Pakistan dispute, especially over Kashmir.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Conspiracy","review":"Reading this story after 9/11 makes you believe that this kind of standoff could happen.

This slim little novel, however, shows that his talents in prose have been underappreciated. ALFRED AND GUINEVERE is a hilarious little story--told entirely through dialogue, letters, and Guinevere's diary--of two very precocious children sent to live in the country with their uncle and grandmother for reasons initially unclear to them. Their attempts to piece together the larger adult world (which may comprise adultery, death, disappointment, and loneliness) are very funny and poignant, and though Alfred and Guienevere often get on each others' nerves their mutual devotion still rings quite true. This is a fast read, and its high quality may still not justify the exorbitant cover price. (NYRB has been charging too much for its editions, which are beautiful and spectacularly chosen, but often run to novella-length rather than to full novel-length). But I was glad I had bought--and read--this little-known jewel."},{"Title":"Alfred & Guinevere","review":"Out of print for nearly 50 years, New York Review Books has happily reprinted this slim, charming, nearly forgotten classic by Schuyler, best known as a poet. Told entirely through the dialogue, letters, and diary entries of two very precocious children -- Alfred and Guinevere, sent to live in the country with their uncle and grandmother for reasons not entirely clear to them -- Schuyler brilliantly and hilariously portrays their attempts to piece together the larger, enigmatic adult world around them. Beneath the book's apparently guileless surface, there also lies a sophisticated awareness of the complicated ways in which words work to define the boundaries between fantasy and reality, innocence and knowledge. Thoroughly delightful, Alfred and Guinevere will move you with both beauty and poignancy."},{"Title":"Alfred & Guinevere","review":"I worked with children for 14 years, and Alfred and Guinevere is one of the few books that seems to \\"get\\" kids. The brother and sister in A&G; seem like real kids you might know. The book is rich and psychologically penetrating.(Another great book about children: Nicholson Baker'sThe Everlasting Story of Nory)"},{"Title":"Alfred & Guinevere","review":"This slender novel consists primarily of the bantering of two children as imagined by a childless poet. Alfred is maybe six (too young to read) and Guinevere is maybe ten (just beginning to focus on fashion). The two live in a world with adults otherwise occupied and are thus largely depend on each other. While we can sense the devotion and shared bond between them the book primarily provides us with the surface blather back and forth between the two, But the language is idealized and imaginative. It reads like an idealized version of childhood. Not better, simply skewed by adult imagination.\\"They had no operated before you could say scat to a cat with a rat\\" perfectly works as language, as poetry. But as the dialog of a six year old? No. Same with \\"Uncle Saul found marbles in his humidor.\\" And \\"completely taken in by the clever girl's faultless imitation.\\" It is fun to read, but there is no depth behind the well-crafted words. There is also a general lack of character study. Uncle father, grandmother, mother all serve the same purpose in the novel. Each is a variation on the loving Adult, the Other that is generally well meaning but extremely obtuse about kids. Pretty language bantered about by pseudo-kids living in a world of cardboard adults doesn't make for a very satisfying, or successful, novel."},{"Title":"Alfred & Guinevere","review":"The plot of this short novel--if it can be said to have a plot--is exactly what the cover says: \\"...Alfred and Guinevere are two children who have been sent by their parents to spend the summer at their grandmother's house in the country.\\" Simple enough--and I've wanted to read it for a long time. I don't remember what I expected; perhaps children discovering nature in the countryside and poignant relationships with the elderly. But what a horrible surprise in a wonderful way, for this novel has truly pulled me in opposing directions: frustrating and perfect at the same time. Alfred and Guinevere was published in 1958, well before the wide-spread academic interest in subtext, in the effects of consumerism, as well as deconstruction theory, and social science theories of human development. Alfred is about 10 years old (4th grade, perhaps) and Guinevere about 12; and it becomes obvious to the reader looking for subtext that both children are products of the 1950s, offspring of well-to-do Anglo-American parents. Heaven knows what the author Schuyler intended, but right up front, he has Guinevere scribbling in her diary (in 3rd person) about her hoped-for adulthood: \\"She is one of the leading women spenders of her day and her example has done much to further the cause of women\\" (4). Even at 12 or 13 (remember this is 1958), she desires lots of shopping, and the \\"cause of women\\" is appropriately vague and immaterial.An unintended topic of this novella must surely be how a certain economic class of white, sub-urban children start on their way to shaping themselves as upper middle-class consumers. For that reason--if that's what you're reading for--the novel is shocking: how little has changed in fifty years of childhood. And their dialogues--written like courtroom transcriptions--are dismaying and saddening; these comfortable white children are natural anarchists or nihilists, dominators, manipulators, deconstructionists without theory or method, button-pressing and provoking, natural lawyers or rhetoricians who can argue any point in any direction. In short, these children believe in nothing. Their lives are based on nothing, with no trajectory except satisfying the moment (well, except for future fame and profit, as G.G. plans).The timing for reading a novel can be crucial to what we bring to it. For example, I noticed that Alfred and Guinevere are uncannily like the children I encounter when a school district substitute--rich or poor kids. Alfred's need for attention is insatiable; his primary activity is to show his sister things like how he learned to \\"spit through my teeth\\" (67). Guinevere's efforts to find friends with two other children are surely some of the most painful scenes I've ever read involving children. Chapter 12 reads like a telling expose of adult domestic roles through the surface perceptions of two twelve-year-old girls, a dialogue as though transcribed right from \\"reality\\" as the girls prepare themselves for debutant balls, expensive women's colleges, marriage to high-society doctors and CEOs. What comes through in this novel is how horribly vulnerable children are to the advertising around them. The paradox is that given the post-World War II development of a middle-class (in hindsight), Guinevere does seem to be a well-adjusted girl--well on her way to \\"making it\\" in the U.S. of A. One hopes that they will become hippies, and Alfred a draft dodger.But there is more to this novel. I concluded that, stylistically--in a \\"post-modern\\" way--Alfred and Guinevere is an anti-novel: a primer on how to make one's characters remain the same while advancing the \\"plot\\" through the device of moving them around, from the town to the country, then to a ship to Europe (paid for by their father, to join him there). What was the \\"problem\\" with this novel? I asked myself. It had occurred to me that this story has no story; it's too raw a transcript of reality. And, surely, I thought, this depressing-undressed meaning I'm making of this novel was not intended by Schuyler.If you've read this far, here's the lagniappe mystery gift that I got from this novel: when James Schuyler decided to give us child characters, he wrote them as they see themselves, not as we adults wish to see them. This is the absolutely miraculous thing Schuyler brings to literature: The adults in the novel suddenly appear on the page from an oblique angle, without warning, without narrative--just as they do in real life--right out of the immediate perceptions of a child, unclear images of adults who are rather ominous in a world which children know is controlled by them.A sociologist with a literary bent or humanities expert with knowledge of the intersection of society and the craft of writing would have fun with this novel. Michel Foucault would have loved it."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"Outlaw of Gor is the second novel in John Norman's cult classic Gorean Saga. After languishing on Earth for seven years, Tarl Cabot is finally returned to the Counter-Earth where he hopes to find his father and the woman he loves. Instead, he finds that things are not at all as he left them. After a bit of roaming, he winds up in a city he's never been to before and gets tangled up in a battle of the sexes.Tarl Cabot is a bit like Richard Rahl -- effortlessly subduing evil, fighting oppression, and spreading nobility wherever he goes. He loves and serves his fellow man (\\"How could I be free when others are bound?\\"). He spends a lot of time talking about how he reveres women and hates those Gorean cultures which capture women and consider them useful only as pleasure slaves.Yet, for all of Tarl's assurances that he's a feminist, it's a bit hard to swallow when his only descriptions of the women he meets are their stunning beauty and how he admires their spirit. (Spirit is shown by a woman saying things like \\"No, never!\\" to men who want to subdue her.)And the reader knows it's just a matter of time before one of these beautiful and spirited women, with her dress ripped to shreds, will be on her knees with her arms raised and wrists crossed and begging Tarl to enslave her. Even women who were previously powerful are anxious to know if Tarl finds them beautiful and pleasing and when he insists that he doesn't want to purchase them, they pout. He buys one of them as \\"an act of sentiment\\"! (There is no sex of any sort in these books so far, by the way.)This is all fine for a little bit of fun and fantasy roleplay, but when Tarl suggests that women don't really want freedom, but actually want to be men's full-time pleasure slaves.... that's a little much for me. One ruling woman says that slave girls have it better because their skimpy clothes are easier to walk around in. Okay, I'll give her that point, but when she says that being chained is the only way that many women can learn to love...? And that she really would rather be a slave than to take up her former ruling position?... yeah, right.Tarl goes on to explain why matriarchies don't work: men lose their self-respect and then the women lose respect for the self-loathing men and \\"hating their men, they hate themselves.\\" This is a point I'm willing to consider, but he goes too far with his next point: \\"I have wondered sometimes if a man to be a man must not master a woman. And if a woman, to be a woman, must not know herself mastered.\\" Unfortunately, \\"mastered\\" seems to mean that men are free and ruling and women are collared, leashed, scantily clad, and serving and dancing for men. How can Tarl Cabot, the feminist, justify this? Easily: the women say they like it this way.But for all of this, I must admit that I've got a strange fascination with this series and I plan to read the next book. However I think that it wouldn't work for me if I was reading it in print instead of listening to it on audio. I believe that it's the reader, Ralph Lister, who manages to \\"fix\\" what otherwise I'd read as just plain sexist masculine fantasy. Lister gives Tarl a voice that's innocent and enthusiastic enough to deceive me into believing that he's not really as shallow as he demonstrates that he is."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"A good read for fans of John Norman and his protagonist, Tarl Cabot. Altough Mr. Norman is sometimes given to overly-detailed technical descriptions and the occasional bit of turgid prose, this is a fine read for those interested in the World of Gor and provides more insight into the mind and make-up of Tarl Cabot and of the customs, history, and people of Counter-Earth.I strongly recommend it for those who enjoyed the first novel in the Gorean saga, \\"The Tarnsman of Gor.\\" I enjoyed this book as much as the first novel."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"In this, the second book of the Tarl Cabot Saga, Tarl returns to Gor only to find that he is now considered to be an outlaw, his lovely city of Koroba has been destroyed and the homestone carried away, his beloved Talena is missing, the citizens of Koroba have been spread throughout all of Gor, and he blames the Priest Kings for all these troubles. What do THEY have in store for him now? On a scale from one to ten, I would have to rate this book a seven. It is a somewhat poorly written story, but the adventure it takes you on more than makes up for it. It is packed full of one adventure after another, as Tarl Cabot goes in search of all those he grew to love in &amp;quot;Tarnsman of Gor.&amp;quot; Will he ever find any of his friends, his father, or the woman he has waited seven long years on Earth to get back to? You will have to read the book for yourself to find out."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"I thought this book was very sad.

I recommend the series to people who are interested in this type of book."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"Tarl Cabot's long exile was over. Again he was back on Gor, the strange world of Counter-Earth, where he had once been the proudest warrior and mightiest tarnsman of that savage planet. But nothing was as it had been. His home city of Ko-ro-ba was destroyed, razed until not one stone remained standing. His beautiful mate, Talena was dead or vanished. His family and friends were scattered across the globe. And Cabot was now declared an outlaw, with all men ordered to kill him on sight. His only chance was to find the strange Priest-Kings who ruled Hor and to submit himself to them. But Tarl was not about to submit!"},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"This book starts harsh and gives us an insight into the inhuman qualities of the priest-kings. However the general sense of adventure vs. an overindulgence in male dominance philosophy in the later books continues.Tarl is searching for his family/friends and Talena and ends up in the city of Tharna. At first the female dominated society which is just not working seems a shallow tool to hide the author's disdain for female dominance, but after finishing the book it works out rather nicely. The escape from the silver mines was particularly well accomplished.Some have critisized Norman's writing: there is a scene here which I thought proved the opposite. When Tarl and Thorn are fighting in the throne room and their reflections are in the water of a pool, their shadows fighting with them and all this is reflected in the golden mask of the girl watching them, I thought this brought the scene to life well."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"This book is a little better than the first one. Tarl Cabot had been sent home to Earth, and several years have passed while he has lived there.He again ends up in Gor, and finds out that many things have changed. The city where he used to live now no longer exists, which, politically makes him clanless, or an outlaw.Outlaws of course get involved in violence and adventure."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"Book 2 of the Gor series.Plot Kernel - At the end of Tarnsman of Gor, Tarl Cabot had fallen in love and married the High Caste woman Talena, daughter of Marlenus of Ar, and then, to his great sorrow, was returned to Earth by the mysterious and powerful Priest-Kings of Gor. Now, seven years later, Tarl is allowed to return to Gor. [Details of how these two manuscripts written by Cabot have come available for publication are accounted for in the beginning of this book.] But Gor has changed. In accordance with the incomprehensible will and power of the never seen Priest-Kings, who are said to dwell high in the Sardar Mountains, the City of Ko-ro-ba, Tarl's city, has been utterly destroyed, and its people scattered. His father and his beloved Talena are gone [and do not appear in this novel except as brief memories]. Seeking an explanation for the destruction of Ko-ro-ba, and clothed and accoutered as an Outlaw of Gor, rather than bearing the insignia of a city, Tarl sets out for the Sardar Mountains, and spends the night in Tharna, the one city of Gor ruled by women. Falsely implicated in a plot to overtake Lara the Tatrix of Tharna, Tarl is thrown into slavery upon her command. He leads a revolt and is once again free. As he continues his travels to Sardar he encounters slavers and buys a girl, not yet branded, to free her. [Here, after Tarl's slavery has shown us how male slaves are treated in Tharna, are two chapters, 200 pages into the novel, where the Gorean institution of female slavery is given some attention by the author.] Tarl's purchase turns out to be Lara, who had been usurped as Tatrix of Tharna and turned over to slavers. Before continuing to Sardar, Tarl intends to return Lara to Tharna that she might once again rule as Tatrix, with her now admitted appreciation for male dominance."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"In his second Gor book, Outlaws of Gor, John Norman seem to have improved somewhat over his first book. There are far fewer extreme coincidences to stretch credibility. In the second book our hero, Tarl, is returned to Gor by the space alien Priest-Kings after spending an intervening 7 years back on Earth. Upon his return he discovers that his city has been destroyed by the Priest-Kings. Since Gor is a land of city states, and Tarl now has no city, he is therefore an outlaw. In order to find out why his city was destroyed, or to exact revenge, he begins a journey to the home of the Priest-Kings in the northern mountains of Gor. Along the way he passes through Tharna, a city ruled by dominant feminist females. In what is obviously a philosophical slam at feminist rule, everything about Tharna is dysfunctional and devoid of even simple pleasure. After several adventures in Tharna, our hero restores manly confidence to its men and restores natural order to the city. All the former feminist men-hating females are forced to become either wives or slaves of men, and the natural order and satisfaction of both men and women is restored. The parallels with many feminist inspired laws and politically correct silencing of subjugated men on Earth over the past several decades are many and obvious. Norman uses the Gor series to explain and promote the natural dominance of men and submissive nature of females. It also shows how females and the whole human race thrive with strong manly control over females, but how we fall into all manner of despair when females are allowed to become controlling. Its a good read with built in wisdom for men and females."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"I love the Gor adventures and read all of the available books years ago. I drive a lot and this passes the time nicely."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"This is not a review of the Gor series. I read many of them when I was younger and was completely enchanted by them, they are a good read. The problem is, now that hard cover editions of the Gor series are being released we can not buy the series on Kindle in the United States. I recommend you go to your local half price book store and look for them. I was going to buy and reread all the books on Kindle but now I think I will be boycotting them completely. The publisher's need to know we are the ones that make their living for them, and they need to have a little respect for the fans of the books they publish."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"I loved it, it's a great, great book. I was kind of confused at first because I haven't read the first one. What is it? I really want to know."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"I read the Gor series as a boy in the 70's and early 80's. IMHO the series is most appealing to teenage boys. I recently pulled \\"Assassins of Gor\\" off the shelf one night while bored, and re-read it. I was shocked that there was no real sex, and only a handful of pages of philosophy and psychology that I had to skip over. The book was really excellent, although in a straight forward, uncomplicated sort of way. These are escapist novels, richly detailed, which immerse you in an exotic world, not real thinkers. My enduring memories were of the later books in the series, which were almost unreadable because whole chapters were devoted to philosophy and psychology.I am not offended by the idea that it is natural and enjoyable for women to be submissive to men. Although I recognize it as wish fulfillment fantasy, still I consider it harmless, especially in such an obviously fictitious setting. I even found it mildly interesting the first time it was mentioned. It is the umpteenth repetition that I find boring. I just turn those pages, skipping ahead to the next action sequence. Speaking of wish fulfillment, I wish someone would edit the series, and re-publish it without these parts. Maybe Eric Flint could do it? He likes to edit, according to his afterword to \\"1633\\" and he's good at it. Of course, if you take the sex out of Gor you get Barsoom, and that story has already been written.I looked on Amazon to see if there was anything new going on with the series, and there was. It is being reprinted, starting at the beginning, and at least 2 new books seem to be published, or at least in the works. I was disappointed though that Amazon didn't have the whole series listed under one easy to find heading. I guess there are, after all, millions of books and only so many Amazon employees. So I'm listing the series, in order, along with some brief info. Some of these books I haven't read, as noted.1.) Tarnsman of Gor - 1966. Earthman, Tarl Cabot, goes to another planet, hidden on the opposite side of our sun, and becomes a master swordsman and Warrior. This is the book that is most like \\"Princess of Mars\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which I highly recommend. Note - the 1966 copyright is held by John Lange, the author's real name.2.) Outlaw... - 1967. Tarl Cabot returns to Gor, to find he's been outlawed.3.) Priest-Kings... - 1968. Tarl Cabot goes to lair of Priest-Kings to clear his name.4.) Nomads... - 1969. Tarl Cabot goes to Southern Plains, and meets Mongol type nomads.5.) Assassin... - 1970. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar, greatest city-state on Gor. Note - this is the first copy I have by Del Rey books, and it has cover art by Boris. I may not like reading about the Gorean philosophy on sexual roles for men and women, but I can't get enough of Boris' artwork depicting it.6.) Raiders... - 1971. Tarl Cabot goes to Port Kar, pirate capitol of scum and villainy, and learns the meaning of shame. More Boris art on the cover of the Del Rey edition.7.) Captive... - 1972. A new character, Elinor Brinton, is captured on Earth and becomes a slave girl on Gor. The first time this is done, it may be slightly creative and a little interesting, but it is a radical departure from the earlier books and I consider it to be the beginning of the end. At least Tarl Cabot has a few pages at the end, to tie this book into the rest of the series. This is also the last book published by Ballantine books, which I think is significant in the content and direction of the rest of the series.8.) Hunters... - 1974. Tarl Cabot goes to the Northern Forest and meets amazon type women. This seems to be the first time there was a break in John Norman's writing, undoubtedly related to his switch to Daw books as a publisher.9.) Marauders... - 1975. Tarl Cabot goes to the land of the Norsemen and meets Viking type Marauders.10.) Tribesmen... - 1976. Tarl Cabot goes to the Tahari desert.11.) Slave Girl... - 1977. Earth girl Judy Thornton enslaved on Gor. Again. No Tarl Cabot at all.12.) Beasts... - 1978. Tarl Cabot goes to the Arctic ice pack and meets Eskimo type people.13.) Explorers... - 1979. Tarl Cabot goes to the equatorial rain forests.14.) Fighting Slave... - 1980. Earthman Jason Marshall is enslaved and forced to fight in a pit on Gor.15.) Rogue... - 1981. Jason Marshall wanders free on Gor.16.) Guardsman... - 1981. Jason Marshall earns a homeland.17.) Savages... - 1982. Tarl Cabot goes to the great plains and meets American Indian type savages. Note - If you like this, John Norman also wrote \\"Ghost Dance\\" in 1970, a similar type story about real American Indians. I'm impressed that he kept the writing schedule he did on the Gor novels, and still wrote other books on the side. He also wrote \\"Time Slave\\" in 1975.18.) Blood Brothers... - 1982. Savages and Blood Brothers are a two-part set. Just recently read this conclusion to Savages. Brings closure to Ubar of the Skies.19.) Kajira... - unread. Another Slave girl story.20.) Players... - 1984. Tarl Cabot joins the Carnival. Cos goes to war with Ar.21.) Mercenaries... - 1985. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar again to try to save it.22.) Dancer... - unread. Another Slave Girl novel? This is where I stopped even looking in the bookstore.23.) Vagabonds... - unread.24.) Magicians... - 1988, unread.25.) Witness... - 2002, unread. I read on amazon that this is a story about Marlenus with amnesia, told by a slave girl.26.) Prize... - unread. This is not yet published."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"The first novel in John Norman's Counter-Earth Series, \\"Tarnsman of Gor,\\" owed a debt to \\"A Princess of Mars,\\" the first John Carter novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Both of the second novels in these series begin the same way, with the hero finally able to return to the distant planet where they can begin to search for the great love of their life. But after the beginning of \\"Outlaw of Gor\\" Norman abandons the parallels to Burroughs and starts to build on the elements introduced in the first novel to create his own unique world.\\"Outlaw of Gor\\" offers a radical reintroduction to the world of Gor.

An Initiate, one of those who serves the Priest-Kings, orders Cabot to submit to their will, but he refuses, and heads off across Gor for the Sardar Mountains, the legendary home of the Priest-Kings. Along the way he walks into Tharna, a town ruled by women. The head woman is called the Tatrix and the ruling class of women wear silver masks. The society is sterile and unproductive and although they try to break Cabot to their will, they are not going to have any more success than the Priest-Kings.For me \\"Outlaw of Gor\\" is the weakest of the early Counter-Earth novels, mainly because Cabot's adventures in Tharna are a detour on his war to the Sardar Mountains. My best advice is to have the third novel, \\"The Priest-Kings of Gor\\" on hand so that as soon as you finish this one you can start the next book, especially since this is one of the rare times in the Gor series that the next novel pretty much picks up right where the previous one leaves off. For me these second and third novels are essentially one giant story.However, from the perspective of the Gorean philosophy (i.e., way of life) developed by Norman (the pseudonym of philosophy professor John Lange), \\"Outlaw of Gor\\" is clearly the most important of the early novels. The novel was written in 1967, a time when the feminist movement was beginning to take shape, and it is easy to read \\"Outlaw of Gor\\" as something of a response to the times that were a-changin'. A city run by women is seen as being unnatural, and Norman begins to expand on some of the key elements of the Gorean philosophy: the concept of honor and the importance of the Home Stone, the dangers of technology versus respect for the environment, and the independence of men and the \\"truth\\" of female slavery. At this point in the series Norman is clearly courting controversy.Of course, for many potential readers of this series, this is a make-or-break proposition. I preferred the adventure aspects of the Gor novels and abandoned the series in the early 1980s when I found myself flipping through the long discussions on \\"slavery\\" that were becoming omni-present in the books. I was also dismayed that other characters besides Tarl Cabot were becoming the focus of the book and the giant story arc regarding the Priest-Kings was becoming increasingly prolonged (and often ignored). But in terms of sword and sorcery novels, Norman's first half-dozen Gor novels create a unique barbaric world and his characterization of supporting characters improves with every outing If you start the series, at least make it through \\"Assassins of Gor,\\" which I consider the apex of the series."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"I have read almost all of the Gorean Series. One thing that I liked about all albeit too little in some was his idea of honor, the rigidity of it at times, but the necessity of it all the time. I liked his hero at his stoic best when he was against tremendous odds. I liked the humanity of his character at times yet overall I feel he missed the mark by focusing on the man/woman - master/slave thing. He beats a dead horse into mush. If Norman had stayed true to the warrior code and the action novel I feel he could be what David Gemmell is today - One of the best of the Sword and Fantasy genre. I wish I could sit own with Mr. Norman and tell him what I liked or disliked about each book. He has the seeds of greatness like Burroughs, but seems to have fallen down a shute from which he is not willing or able to escape."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"In this, the 2nd installment of the Counter-Earth saga, Cabot is finally returned to Gor after being exiled to planet Earth for reasons unknown.This novel, which follows &quot;Tarnsman of Gor&quot; picks up with Cabot back on Earth in New York city.

We get a peek at Cabot's persona, and how unfit he is for life on Earth after his exposure to life on Gor.Upon his return to Gor, Cabot learns that the mysterious Priest-Kings of Gor have destroyed Ko-Ro-Ba, and decreed that no two men of that city may stand together without risking the wrath of the Priest-Kings.Cabot sets forth to enter the forbidding Sardar mountains where legend says that the rulers of Gor reside, and demand an accounting of the Priest-Kings as to why his city was destroyed and its inhabitants forced to scatter before the winds.

Either his writing improved over the two years, or I'm just used to it now. In either case, it flowed much better. Plus, the story is better than Tarnsman. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Tarnsman, even it was quite simple. However, Outlaw is a much better overall story. Still simple, but a little more complex than Tarnsman. The main character is given a little more depth. There is plenty of action sequences and his \\"luck\\" remains true from the first book.

However, he once again tries to deal with the issue of women in Gor. He paints the picture of female leadership somewhat harshly. But again we are forced to consider all of this within a fictional context and be prepared to suspend our own contrary assumptions for the sake of perhaps broadening our own capacity for acceptance.Worth reading as a means to get to Priest Kings of Gor, and excellent work."},{"Title":"Outlaw of Gor (Strange History of Counter-Earth, Vol. 2)","review":"Outlaw of Gor is not as good as Tarnsman was but still light years ahead of anything that came after book #18 in Norman's Gor series.Outlaw has Tarl Cabot returning to Gor.

Anyway, in Outlaw, we have his return to Gor, to find his city destroyed.

Structurally, these include:-Incorrectly and confusingly illustrated figures-Broken link to the web site which supposedly contains errata and corrections, but does not apparently exist-Incorrect page numbers in the index.In addition, the book would have benefitted from a discussion of these items:-A discussion of the notion of &quot;publishing&quot; in the active directory-More information on the trade-offs between native and mixed mode-I would have appreciated references to the Microsoft documentation and white papers that he discusses, but does not include their titles or where to find them-There is no discussion of the hazards of multi-value updates and how to avoid them-No discussion of fault tolerance and backup-restore -- how do you restore an AD node, and how does this affect the other DC's, as well as the GC? Note in particular, if one of the operations masters goes down and can't come back up -- especially important for the RID master.-There should be a bigger discussion of migration, especially the different scenarios, such as in-place, parallel, hybrid, etc.In general, this book suffered from a serious lack of clarity that rendered simple concepts complicated and left complicated concepts completely opaque. In short, I'd say this book does more harm than good."},{"Title":"Windows 2000(r) Active Directory Survival Guide: Planning and Implementation","review":"Everything said here about the editing, graphics and errors is true. It's pretty bad. You shouldn't write a book on Active Directory if you can't even describe NT trusts accurately.

My first book on the subject, and by the eighth or ninth chapter, I felt that I knew more about the subject than this books author. Very odd, considering I knew nothing about AD going into the book.I'm amazed that I gleaned as much useful information from this book as I did, considering how bad it is.

This book, by Schwartz, was by far the least useful of the four.The book is filled with mistakes including many editing oversights. For example, while discussing the differing requirement of intrasite replication versus intersite replication, the book repeatedly uses &quot;intra&quot; where &quot;inter&quot; should have been used.Diagrams that are necessary to illustrate the various architectures possible with Active Directory are poorly drawn and communicate poorly.The book does have a useful glossary and a CD with the complete text in PDF format, which would be handy if the book could in any way be considered an authoritative reference.Given the wide variety of books available, you do not have to put up with this one."},{"Title":"Windows 2000(r) Active Directory Survival Guide: Planning and Implementation","review":"This book is a complete waste of time.

Ah, the Southern life style sure sounds appetizing. Just reading the vividly described moments in time and imagining the smells of foods added pounds to my ever expanding rear compartment. Imagining the toasty kitchen, hearing the sounds of bacon frying and the smell of breads baking took me back to my Grandma's little log cabin in the hills of West Virginia. The recipes are simple and easy to prepare in contrast to other recipe books that require one to travel to foreign lands to search for unusual spices or where one has to take out a second mortgage to afford the ingredients. The Country Gourmet is a MUST HAVE for those cooks who just want to serve a good UNCOMPLICATED and appealing meal for their family and friends while making memories that last a lifetime! T. Y.

From its paperback form to its wonderful stories this is a great novel. This is the type of book that you curl up with. You read and cry; read and drool. This book isn't just about great food; but it is also about a family that experienced the wonderful South and lived to write about it. These people were happy with their cornbread dressing and gumbo. They didn't need fancy foods to be happy. This book makes you think of your own experiences in life and helps you to remember what a wonderful thing food is. I recently made Cornbread Dressing and Sweet Potatoe Suffle and got many compliments on it. There wasn't enough they could say about it. I enjoyed just curling up with this heart-warming book of memories and great food."},{"Title":"The Country Gourmet, Easy Country Recipes & Memories of Mama","review":"\\"The Country Gourmet\\" is a textbook for the Culinary Artist whose heart has never left mama's kitchen. Any cookbook would be a rare find, indeed, if it can lure me away from my 48 oz, yellow and blue Bisquick box, send me scrambling through fridge and cupboard for scratch ingredients, many of which are in boxes, layered with the dust of disuse -all this for the promise of a true country biscuit. They took me about 10 minutes longer to prepare, but hey! I give that up to the Zen-like experience of its preparation. In fact, for all us in this fast-food, microwaveable, just-add-water-and-bake generation, an enterprising author should write a book called \\"Zen and the Art of Biscuit Making.\\" The theme would be \\"slow down and enjoy the process.\\"But wait! Someone has! Margie Robinson-Toone (the name itself suggests a Zen koan) with her \\"The Country Gourmet\\" has written the definitive cookbook whose theme could easily be: \\"Tomorrow, of itself, will come... so today, enjoy the moment. Savor the food on the plate before you. Whether you prepared it, or someone prepared it for you... it was prepared with love.\\"At the risk of being anti-climactic there is more: While the bacon is sizzling in the cast iron skillet, and the eggs are a-scrambling, what better to do while occasionally glancing at the biscuits' progress than read one or two of the anecdotal yarns that are peppered throughout this delightful cookbook. And what better one to read while watching the oven than a tale about what some mischievous children, years ago, did with some uncooked biscuits and some old boots. No, I won't spoil the punch-line, but I will tell you it will leave you chuckling long after your last biscuit has sopped up what's left of the gravy on your plate.Above all, remember that life is short. So enjoy the experience of it."},{"Title":"The Country Gourmet, Easy Country Recipes & Memories of Mama","review":"The recipes in &quot;The Country Gourmet&quot; spin a tale of comfort as well as good eats.

It has been proven that nano-thermite was used to destroy WTC1, 2, and 7. This was a false flag attack used to manipulate and scare the American people.

Such a plot had not been carried out anywhere in the world in more than 30 years, and never in the United States. As news of the hijackings filtered through the FAA and the airlines, it does not seem to have occurred to their leadership that they needed to alert other aircraft in the air that they too might be at risk.\\" (Pg. 10)About Flight 93, they wrote, \\"The hijackers remained at the controls but must have judged that the passengers were only seconds from overcoming them... Jarrah's objective was to crash his airliner into symbols of the American Republic, the Capitol or the White House. He was defeated by the alerted, unarmed passengers of United 93.\\" (Pg. 14)They observed, \\"Congress had a distinct tendency to push questions of emerging national security threats off its own plate, leaving them for others to consider. Congress asked outside commissions to do the work that arguably was at the heart of its own oversight responsibilities... these commissions made scores of recommendations to address terrorism and homeland security but drew little attention from Congress. Most of theIR impact came after 9/11.\\" (Pg. 107)It states soberly, \\"It was in Kandahar that perhaps the last, and most likely the best, opportunity arose for targeting bin Ladin with cruise missiles before 9/11. In May 1999... no one at the Pentagon or the CIA ... thought it was a bad gamble...\\" (Pg. 140)They summarize, \\"While by no means as threatening as Japan's act of war, the 9/11 attack was in some ways more devastating. It was carried out by a tiny group of people, not enough to fill a full platoon. Measured on a governmental scale, the resources behind it were trivial. The group itself was dispatched by an organization based in one of the poorest, most remote, and least industrialized countries on earth. The organization recruited a mixture of young fanatics and highly educated zealots who could not find suitable places in their home societies or were driven from them.\\" (Pg. 339-340)The official report is essential reading for anyone interested in the 9/11 attacks, and their aftermath."},{"Title":"NetWare 5 CNE: Core Technologies Study Guide","review":"This book, like NW5 Admin. and Design, does manage to covermost of the material on the two tests.

The book also tends to focus on subject material differently than the tests covered.

Also, it is well written and well organized. But the real CNE exam is much harder than the practice questions in this books, and the book gives a wrong idea that the exam questions are all multiple choice. Some parts such as the hard disks section are a bit dated, as is giving Token Ring and Ethernet equal importance and having more discussion of Bridges than of switching hubs, but I guess that is consistent with Novell's tests.

It's a truely inspiring novel, and full of surprises. If you've ever enjoyed any of Kingsolver's later works, you must visit this one as well.As she always seems to do, Kingsolver wraps what you or I would consider normal everyday Americans with 'underdogs' of many sorts and weaves them together with an issue that is greatly ignored by the American media and public.

It could not hold my interest for ten minutes. It is a plot-less book that follows the main character, Taylor, through post high school life. She leaves Kentucky for Arizona for a better life, but what it really did was make the book boring. The theme, or themes that I found, were family and political. The family has Taylor and Lou Anne trying to run a complete family, or household. It states that you don not have to be related to be family. The characters in this story were always changing. Taylor, who did not want a kid in the beginning, accepted one anyway. Lou Anne, another main character, her personality was constantly changing. Turtle, the kid, progressed in all aspects just by growing older. Barbara Kingsolver seems to want to exaggerate alot. Her characters seem close to real, but not quite. For example, when Taylor found Turtle in her car, anyone else would have attempted to give her back or away. Taylor just drove off with her.

I resent being \\"preached\\" to, and that's what Kingsolver does in this novel, but she does it in a way that is not even entertaining or well-written.The author uses every opportunity to put cutsie rural sayings in the mouths of the characters. It's overkill. The ad nauseum \\"rural wisdom\\" dispensed by the protagonist is annoying rather than endearing. Kingsolver has created characters and dialogue here that manifest what she THINKS is authentic and what people who have never lived in the south expect and believe is \\"authentic\\" but really isn't (btw, I grew up down south).Beyond all that, the plot is ridiculous: Let's get this straight---a young woman who, disdainful of the girls in her small town who get pregnant and stay stagnant, decides to take off cross country in a clunker of a Volkswagon Beetle (no cliche there, right?). Outside of a bar one night, a strange woman drops a baby in the protagonists' car. Now, what would you imagine such a girl would do? Call the police? Even go into the bar and tell the owners what just happened to find out if they know the woman? Oh, no---she KEEPS THE BABY!

The story was poorly written and strenuous to read. The characters were underdeveloped and were hard to follow due to frequent name changes. Ms. Kingsolver's use of anecdotal notes were distracting and inappropriate for this particular story. The topics that were dealt with are inappropriate for school assigned reading. The sexual denotations would not be suitable for students to read. The end came full circle to the situations presented in the beginning.

There are several other characters that could have been ommited completely, and the basic, boring, plot wouldnt have changed at all.The \\"challenges\\" the characters faced in the book were all brought upon by themselves.

I am sure there are far worse books out there, but this one is bad enough. It gives girls a less than wholesome view of what these jaded women think of men and what men are like. Maybe the scum of the earth is like those men, but not good upstanding christian men.The only point that was remotely good about this book was the way it pointed out diversity and how people can be prejudicial because of social standing or race.

The Bean Trees is about her journey away from home, and the people she meets and befriends along the way.I liked the Bean Trees because it was a good realistic view on how people live their lives. It had things out of a real person's life: loss, gain, problems, and resolutions. It also had enough going on so that I wasn't bored and waiting for things to happen.I found the story line to be similar to the Adam Sandler movie &quot;Big Daddy&quot;. A kid gets dropped off to a free spirited type of person and is expected to take care of the child, then they end up falling in love with the child, and don't want to give them up. The difference is that Taylor is a female, and it takes place in the southwest and not New York.I like the fact that Taylor is a strong willed woman. I think that is what makes her really intersting and fun to follow.

Her locations have life so her characters can have real experiences there. You can smell the air on a hot night in Arizona just before the rain comes. You can feel the humidity in Kentucky and the aridity in the desert. Best of all, though, is that Kingsolver is a great story teller.

Kingsolver perfectly shows how a family does not have to be biological to be a true family. Taylor, Turtle, and Lou Ann have family ties and love greater than some of the biological ones. The reality and the down-to-earth events and reactions of the characters in the novel really include the reader; you can relate to what Turtle and Lou Ann are feeling, even if you have not gone through the exact same thing, you probably have experienced something similar.

The honesty and integrity of Ms Kingslover's writing is, as always, flawless. Most of us have dreamed of throwing caution (and everthing else) to the wind and heading out on a random road trip and never looking back. This is what pulled me into this novel, but the characters and adventures along the way, their spiritual and emotional growth all kept me reading until the end.

At first I felt disappointed that the writing was not as poetic and lyrical as in PRODIGAL SUMMER, but then realized that that type of writing would not have fit this story.

It is a non-traditional family tale about a woman finding her way...including a move from Kentucky to Arizona, the \\"adoption\\" or a child, and the forming of new roots. It is told in a simple but lovely prose. I tend to pick slightly more \\"literary\\" novels but this is a reliable, easy read that always warms the insides."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I picked up The Bean Trees on a whim. I remembered some vague references to Barbara Kingsolver being a good writer and I thought I would give it a shot. While it probably wouldn't be my first choice of books under different circumstances and given a wider selection of material, I am now convinced of her ability to tell a story.Perhaps this is sacrilege, but I found The Bean Trees to be in the same vein as Steel Magnolias or Fried Green Tomatoes. Kingsolver introduces a cast of characters whose lives become woven together through a series of misfortunes, misadventures, and random happenstance. The story centers on Missy, a Kentucky teen who sets out in search of a new life.Missy, who decides that she is better suited for the name Taylor, sets off to find a new place to settle down. After a short stop in Oklahoma, where Taylor somehow ends up the caretaker of a mysterious toddler dubbed Turtle, she ultimately decides to settle down in New Mexico. Without giving away too much of the story, Taylor takes up a job at Jesus is Lord Used Tires and works to build a makeshift family with newly acquired companion Lou Ann and her son Dwayne Ray.The book relays an odd series of emotional twists and turns, but manages to do so in a light and humorous way. The journey through Kingsolver's story is difficult at times as each of the characters struggle with their own forms of loss or their own needs for acceptance. The Bean Trees explores the concept of family outside of the traditional context and tells a remarkable story about the importance of friendship in times of need.As I said before, books like The Bean Trees normally wouldn't make my top picks, but Kingsolver has a very engaging form of writing that makes a wide depth of emotional experiences captivating. The story explores concepts of friendship and family that are far outside the norm, but are in many ways similar to the ways that we experience them. I would definitely recommend the title."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The principal characters in this novel are two young women, born into working class families in Kentucky just \\"two counties apart\\",and who both ended up in Tucson, Arizona. Their story is told in alternate chapters. One, in the first person, is that of the feisty Taylor Greer who, when passing through an Indian reservation in Oklahoma on her way out of Kentucky, found a two or three year old Cherokee baby girl, who can hardly speak as yet, dumped in her jalopy by a woman who then drove off. Taylor can't abandon the baby, whom she names Turtle and pretty well adopts. When she gets to Tucson, she takes a job in a car-repair place run by a splendid woman called Mattie. Above the shop Mattie provides shelter for illegal refugee immigrants from Latin American countries who have to pass through Arizona on the way to states where they are safer.Opposite the garage lives Lou Ann, whose story is told in the third person. She had landed up in that town with her Mexican husband Angel Ruiz; but he had recently left her, shortly before she gave birth to a baby called Dwayne Ray, now just a few months old. Taylor and Turtle move in with Lou Ann and Dwayne Ray. Lou Ann is diffident, has very low self-esteem and sees danger to health and safety all around her; but the two women become close friends.For more than half the book there is very little plot apart from that; but it makes pleasant reading: the Arizona landscape, weather and vegetation (that last of endless fascination for Turtle) are beautifully evoked; conversations are folksy, vivid and funny. There are delightful descriptions of an assortment of small-town neighbours, but nothing of any great moment seems to be happening.Then comes the first sign of anything out of the ordinary, when Taylor learns that the Guatemalan couple whom Mattie is sheltering have had a traumatic past compared with which the hardships of herself and Lou Ann pale into insignificance. Soon there is another dramatic event: Taylor is told that she cannot keep Turtle just like that: she will either have to surrender her as a ward of the state of Arizona or to get written consent from Turtle's parents and naming Taylor as guardian. So she drives off with Turtle for Oklahoma, determined somehow to find the parents, and at the same time she smuggles her Guatemalan friends across to a safe house in Oklahoma which Mattie knew about. It would be a spoiler to reveal the ending, but it is very moving.Now for the sequel: Pigs in Heaven"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book has well-written characters that you really feel invested in seeing succeed. You are invited inside the hearts of very realistic women and examine their very feminine (not necessarily feminist) issues. While a quick, fun read, it helps you reflect about more than fluff."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"\\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" and \\"Prodigal Summer\\" are both excellent books by Barbara Kingsolver. She is a writer with a wonderful voice, instilling personality and life into all of her characters. \\"The Bean Trees\\" was no different; her portrayal of Taylor Greer was captivating.Being a relatively short novel in the voice of a country girl from Tennessee, it was a quick and easy read. Taylor's voice was realistic and her concern about raising Turtle almost palpable. Her smart remarks kept the lightness of the novel, even through the dark, emotional chapters. Everyone else, Lou Ann, Mattie, Estevan, Virgie, etc, each had their own little quirks that prevented the novel from drowning in seriousness.The back cover is a bit misleading, though, I must say. I expected that once Taylor got to Tucson, she'd be placed in the middle of danger, helping out with refugees and hiding from the law. That's not exactly what happened, and though I still enjoyed the book, it was a bit of a let-down that she was more on the edge of the danger instead of in the midst. Mattie, the woman in charge of the refugees, didn't even ever directly tell Taylor what was going on in the back of her tire shop.One of the things I absolutely loved about this book, and her other books as well, was that she could take a description and be so creative with it. Instead of saying \\"the trees are green\\", she can take that simple sentence and paint a picture in your head using the character's own words. Taylor would use adages that her mother would say or truisms from Tennessee to describe the scene before her. It really helped to connect to the character and disassociate her from the author.There was a bit of an amateur quality about this book, though I can't really judge too much since I don't even have one novel published, but you can tell that she wrote this during her early writing period. \\"Poisonwood\\" and \\"Prodigal\\" are better and more thought-provoking, but don't discount \\"The Bean Trees\\" because of it. It's still a worthy contender."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was shipped to me quickly, mailing package in good shape and the book was a very interesting read.

Well done as usual, love the way Kingsolver writes. Reminds us to be much more considerate of others."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"On the cover, this looks like your typical grandma-recommended-it book. Which is why you should never judge a book by it's cover, or even by it's synopsis.And even my summary might make it sound boring.It's anything but.Taylor Greer is scard to death of exploading tires, and so crossing America by car is a daunting prospect. Nonetheless, she drives from her home in rural Kentucky to Tuscon, Arizona. Along the way, she picks up an indian toddler named Turtle who suffered from sexual abuse in her former home.In Tuscon, they move in with Lou Ann Ruiz, recently devorced, chronically worried about her son Dwayne Ray, and suffering from low self-esteem. Taylor then gets a job at a place called Jesus Is Lord Used Tires, after the owner Mattie convinces her that they won't explode.It is small details like that that make this book so amazing. Each and every character has a destinct personality, history and life- they're not your normal secondary-character drones found in other stories. I only found two characters where you didn't know aything about their lives- Ccynthia the social worker and Virgie Mae Parsons.Through Mattie, Taylor meets Estevan and Esperanza, illegal immigrints from Guatemala that had to run after their daughter was taken by the police; their punishment for their involvement in the teachers union. and slowly, Taylor starts to learn about the fate of people outside our boarders.And child protective services has realized that Taylor doesn't have a legal claim to turtle. Apparently, being given the child by a relative doesn't give you custody.This book is amazing. Truely amazing. Kingsolver is a brilliant writer."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A novel centering upon young and naive women encroaching upon the insurmountable task of child rearing makes the readers glisten with gaiety as the off-the-cuff witticisms and honest-to-goodness reactions make their \\"life's adventure\\" a success - even if mildly impoverished.Swathed among loving and caring friends, the two lower middle class women are beyond all concepts of wealth. Their children receive the bounty with the care and concern by those around them. And, Turtle, the daughter of protagonist Taylor Greer, is the greatest beneficiary of the friends of the adopted family.Adoption is a major concept within this book. Thrown into Taylor's Plymouth, Turtle (a Cherokee) comes from the Indian nation to America like our forefathers -except they came to Plymouth, not into a Plymouth, as Taylor remarks. The just-out-of-highschool (and thankfully not pregnant) Taylor determines her karma included a child at a young age, but apparently without impregnation.Needing a place to stay after taking a road trip to the farthest point her heap would take her away from home, Taylor meets peer and fellow single mother: Lou Ann. Lou Ann, rearing a child of her own (son Dwayne Ray) after her husband deserted the two of them, is the yang to Taylor's ying. They become the young female odd couple, with a couple more. And, the older women of the area love to watch and witness the young mothers and their children as they do what most mothers of firstborns do: learn by trial and error.The fatalistic novel seems best recited in one passage by Taylor: \\" I threw out a rocker arm on my car and I got Turtle. I drove over broken glass on an off ramp, and found Mattie (employer of Taylor at tire store). . . I spent the first half of my life avoiding motherhood and tires, and now I am counting them as blessings.\\"Although all is not perfect, and there is no prince charming for most everyone in this novel, the everyday people of this book about everyday events is cosmically absorbing. Love triumphs, and good will come to good people.Having never read any Kingsolver novel before, I believed she reminded me most of Alice Hoffman. I surfed the internet to discover that I am not alone. Maybe a little less verbose, and definitely not as bizarre as Hoffman, Kingsolver bites more with reality than the surreal. But, this book about single women with children fits perfectly in the Hoffman template, and I could easily see lovers of one author liking the other."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees is one of the few books included in my school's curriculum that I've enjoyed and related to. Taylor is an amazing main charachter because she makes mistakes and admits she's ignorant, and still doesn't realize how mature and generous she is in the meantime. The dealings with abuse, depression, illegal immigrants, racism and sexism are powerful throughout the story. While I address many of the bad reviews on Amazon, there may be several spoilers ahead:This may not be one of the best books of all time, but it definetly is not some of the things a few of the reviewers here are calling it. Barbara Kingsolver is not being 'preachy', is not 'anti-men', does not support illegal immigrant escape or kidnapping. The reviewers that have written this have not fully understood the book or picked up on the underlying motifs and symbols. Lou Ann is not cut out of the book- in fact, after the first three chapters, Lou Ann and Taylor meet and she ends up being even more important and major in the story. Taylor knows that Turtle's relatives do not want her and goes to make sure of that, and is definetly not 'kidnapping her'. Turtle was sexually abused-who in their right mind would return a molested child back to the potential molester? As for Taylor helping Estevan and Esperanza-we all say that illegal immigrants should return back to their country, etc etc, but when you really know somebody, and have faces that match the name of 'illegal immigrant' it is a much different story. Taylor was doing what she thought was right, and it was, in fact, true and heroic. If Taylor had returned Turtle to her relatives and gave up Esperanza and Estevan, as some reviewer has suggested, the book would be disturbing, immoral, and cruel. And lastly, while Taylor first had a bad impression of men, Estevan helped dispell her fear. And by letting go of Estevan, Taylor stayed true to Esperanza.For the people who are discouraged by reading all the bad reviews for The Bean Trees, I hope you will be able to differentiate the real reviews from the reviews that have been written by readers that do not truly understand the message of The Bean Trees."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"\\"The Bean Trees\\", a novel written by Barbara Kingsolver, is an interesting and exciting story of a young woman who leaves Pittman County to start a new life without worries.Halfway through her trip, she finds herself an instant mother of an infant who is thrust into her arms at a bar. In Arizona, she works at a burger joint and encounters illegal immigrants and a blind woman.Marietta, who decides to be known as Taylor, does all this and more in Kingsolver's compelling tale of self-discovery and independence.The book deals with many topical problems, for example young motherhood, the weight of friendship and family and describes the tumultious life of women who are \\"forced\\" to live without men.Taylor's life begins anew, as she wanted, since she now must care for the abused, mute child she affectionately names Turtle. She also befriends the owner of a tire shop and bonds with another single mother. After years of feeling isolated, she suddenly has a sense of belonging as she reaches Arizona.Kingsolver brings her characters to life with vivid descriptions and alarming imagery. Taylor, who narrates the story, tells her tale in a lively Kentucky dialect, which adds incredible depth and reality to the novel.We are five students from Germany who were supposed to read the book for our English lessons. We have to admit that for foreign pupils it might be a bit difficult to read this novel because there are a few unknown words and the conversation is partly written in colloquial speech.All in all there are situations that opened our eyes to historical events we never understood, including the Central American immigration and the differences between various regions of theUnited States. We highly recommend \\"The Bean Trees\\", and we are happy to have had the pleasure of reading it. Especially for people who are interested in the American history, the development of very strong characters and the fates of some very poor people, this novel is a great reading adventure."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver is a book rich in metaphors and similes. It is a story about a young girl who escapes her small town, where most young people drop out of school, and the girls get pregnant. For Missy, these are not options. She buys herself a car and heads out for maturing experiences. Her first decision is that since she is starting a new life, she needs a new name, so she calls herself &quot;Taylor.&quot; As she is driving, she tells herself she will stop and live in the city in which her car breaks down. This doesn't happen because along the way, she picks up a passenger, a little Native American baby. Now she has herself and the baby to worry about. She stops in Arizona and loves it. So, she decides to stay. It is in this town, she discovers friendship, love, responsibility, maturity, and the true meaning of family.The physical descriptions in the book, while at times, may seem over done, are truely what make the book a vivid, potent journey. Before Taylors journey begins, she is working in a hospital and one of the girls she went to school with, but got pregnant and married, is brought into the hospital covered in blood, and Missy says she was, &quot;...like a butcher holding down a calf on its way to becoming a cut of meat&quot; (10). She also witnesses a tire blowing up and says, &quot;... Newt Hardbine's daddy flying up into the air, in slow motion, like a fish flinging sideways out of the water. And Newt laid out like a hooked bass&quot; (15). Then when she gets to Arizona, she see rocks that were &quot;...stacked on top of one another like piles of copulating potato bugs&quot; (47). These are just a few of the similies that enrich the story. She also uses metaphors in abundance to create a picture.She compares driving in traffic during a hail storm as ...moving about the speed of a government check&quot; (49). Kingsolver uses metaphors to compare some of the characters' lives. Taylor says &quot;...but I had to give her credit, considering that life had delivered Sandi a truckload of manure with no return address&quot; (89). In comparing a park she loves to visit, Taylor says, &quot;Constellations of gum-wrapper foil twinkled around the trash barrels&quot; (148). The best description comes in the combination of metaphor and simile in the description of the night-blooming cereus: &quot;The petals stood out in starry rays, and in the center of each flower there was a complicated contruction of silvery threads shaped like a pair of cupped hands catching moonlight. A fairy boat, ready to be launched into the darkness&quot; (249). The pictures are that vivid.If you need a book that is rich in description using similies and metaphors, read The Bean Trees."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The story of how Taylor Greer got her name has nearly passed into literary lore.

In short order, she is given a baby she names Turtle, makes it to Tucson, rents a house near Jesus Is Lord Used Tires, makes some interesting friends including a battered divorcee with a pissed-off ex and a little girl of her own, faces motherhood issues - and somehow does it all with whimsical humor.The Bean Trees spawned an entity called Barbara Kingsolver, a gift to readers and other writers.

The author's style is delightfully unpretentious and weaves a wonderful tapestry of Taylor's adventurous life on the road, and every-day common events. I couldn't wait to find the meaning of the book's title and yelped when I did. The young adoptee, Turtle, looked at wisteria vines that buzzed with bees and said they were 'bean trees' because long green pods hung down from the branches. 'They looked as much like beans as anything you'd ever care to eat.' We don't usually adopt a child after it has been dropped in blankets on our car seat, but of all the adoption books I've read (including the one I wrote myself!) I haven't seen as charming a way of telling a young child about her adoption as in The Bean Trees. Never mind it's fiction. Taylor says: 'I let Turtle see the adoption certificate and she looked at it for a very long time, considering that there were no pictures on it. \`That means you're my kid,' I explained, \`and I'm your mother, and nobody can say it isn't so.'' The author didn't use the word 'adoption' or became preachy or defensive. No wonder little Turtle looked out the car window as though things out there were a lot more interesting than what she had just heard. Then she entertained her mother with her vegetable-soup song that included, among the beans and potatoes, the people she loved. To top it off, Taylor's mother said: 'I don't think blood's the only way kids come by things honest.'Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In rural Kentucky, a remarkable teenage girl named Missy Greer grew up.

Missy bought an old car and drove halfway across the country to Tuscon, Arizona- where with a new name (Taylor) and a new addition to her small family (an abandoned child named Turtle), Taylor started a new life.The Bean Trees is an amazing novel. It follows Taylor's growth from a tough-girl-on-the-outside-but-really-afraid-inside girl to a responsible young mother. With the help of some new friends and Turtle, who really is an extrodinary girl, Taylor begins to realize that the world isn't as perfect as she used to think it was.

It was the Fall of 1990 and the class was &quot;Landscape and Literature&quot;. (And the professor was Martha Ackman, and she was great!) It was an interesting class, but I really enjoyed the reading material. At this point, Bean Trees had been around for a couple of years, but I had never heard of it, nor had I heard of Barbara Kingsolver. This novel was so absorbing, I didn't feel it was an assignment at all. I spent a great, warm October weekend sitting on my parents porch and reading this book.I also think that this book has one of the best opening paragraphs in contemporary fiction. I won't give it away, but do yourself a favor and look for it at any bookstore. This novel is funny, sad, and touching. It was my introduction to Kingsolver, and I am glad I got a head start on her before many others did. This is a book that you'll ant to hold onto, to give to friends, to discuss...Taylor Greer is one of the most engaging heroines in literature, and her unconventional story is infused with a real contemporary feel. What does that mean? I just mean that Kingsolver disucsses issues and people that many authors don't in popular american fiction (native american issues, central american politics, refugees, mixed marriages and Protestantism and catholicism all merge in one novel), and as a result, Kingsolver holds up a mirror of our world where we can see ourselves and society much clearer than before. I know that I sure did. Ten years later, I still can remember this book so vividly, it's never left me."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"THE BEAN TREES is a novel about a young woman, Taylor Greer, who leaves her home state of Kentucky to find a life outside of what she knew - growing up to become barefoot and pregnant. She wanted more than that, but she did not really know what she wanted.She finally arrives in Tucson and meets a woman who wants to give Taylor a 3 year old child. Taylor promises to take care of the little girl. Whether the woman is the child's mother, we never do find out. But Taylor does find out right away that something is not right with the child. Turtle, the name Taylor gives the child, does not talk. Taylor also finds bruises over the child's body while giving her a bath. Maybe Taylor has saved this child from a horrible life, but now she is responsible for the welfare of this little Indian american girl.But now what to do? No money and no job, and she's got a kid she never planned on having.Taylor and Turtle end up in a small town in Arizona and after meeting several nice people who help them out, they end up living with a gal named Lou Ann, who has her own story to tell. The book is intertwined with the stories of both women so we get to know them both very well.Along the way they meet and get involved with a hispanic couple, Estevan and Esperanza. They are from central America, and their story is a mystery, except we know Esperanza knows very little English, and Estevan was an English teacher in his home land. The four of them, along with little Turtle, become good friends, and soon Turtle is responding to the love she is getting from her new family. But there is still the mystery of what really happened to little Turtle....THE BEAN TREES is the 2nd Barbara Kingsolver novel I have read, THE POISONWOOD BIBLE being the other one. This second novel reads quite differently than POISONWOOD BIBLE did, and I guess one reason is that THE BEAN TREES was written over a decade before. Ms. Kingsolver's skills as a story teller greatly improved between these two novels, but that does not mean THE BEAN TREES is a poorly written book. On the contrary, I found it very well written and enjoyable to read.The feel of both books is very different. While POISONWOOD had the feel of an epic, THE BEAN TREES was a much more simpler novel (being a much shorter novel helped!) I can't say whether one book was better than the other. I liked both equally. What I'm finding I really like about Ms Kingsolver's books is that she is very good at character developement. She knows how to paint a character well enough that I was able to picture right away what these characters were all about. They were not shallow one dimensional people, but people I could care about.Obviously, I am giving THE BEAN TREES a glowing recommendation. It was probably one of the better books I read in 2001."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has struck gold in writing this book, The Bean Trees. It is a wonderful story of life, love, and challenges along the way. Taylor Greer is bored of her life in a tiny town in Kentucky. After a man she knows is killed in a tractor accident, Taylor purchases a '55 Volkswagen and drives off down the road. When she stops for a bite to eat, an Indian woman gives her a baby girl. &quot;Just take it,&quot; she says, and disappears without an explanation. Taylor names the baby TurtleA bit further down Taylor's Road of Life, she meets Lou Ann Ruiz. Lou Ann is a worrier with a baby, and her husband has left her. Together, Lou Ann and Taylor get through a lot of things, whether it's figuring out Turtle's real name, or helping two Guatemalan refugees live safely on a Cherokee reserve. Through babies, vegetables and cars, Taylor's story is a wonderfully real story. It feels very much unlike fiction to read this book, because it could really happen. I recommend this book to anyone ages 12 and older."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees, by Barbara Kingsolver is literary fiction of the first order. Not only is it well-written, an interesting plot, and superbly characterized, it posesses a heartfelt moral vision of America and what America stands for, and should stand for. This book should be required reading for all Americans and Earthlings. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Ms. Kingsolver's politics (I agree) one must admit that a moral vision is presented in this book without being preachy or self righteous or &quot;whiny&quot; as much as that is hated these days. The Bean Trees is about the fact that what we've been brought up to believe is not necessarily true for others or for ourselves. It is a novel of compassion, hope, family, and the fact that the cult of &quot;American individualism&quot; is not only a lie, but is unnatural and wrong and unhealthy for human beings; we all need to help and be helped. Your life will be richer for reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I had to read this book for a school assignment and at first didn't care to much for it. But Barbara Kingsolver really shows as one of the best. The plot is about a young woman by the name of Marietta. She doesn't like life in her hometown of Pittman, Kentucky. So she buys a car and heads west for a new life. She changes her name to Taylor and hopes for a great start, but as soon as she gets going she runs into to trouble. Taylor is given a baby girl who she names Turtle. All Taylor knows about Turtle is that no one cares about her and she had been abused. Taylor then takes on a life filled with many ups and downs. This book is full of vivid and clearly made characters that are so human that they will pull you in their world. This book becomes very attaching and gets very hard to put down. Once you get in to this book, you won't stop until it is over. And when it is over it leaves you imagination wondering for answers. Barbara Kingsolver had the perfect recipe for creating this book and it shows throughout the entire novel."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees is an excellent book in my opinion. I read it for my 10th grade English class and really enjoyed it. It's about a young woman who leaves her Kentucky home to escape becoming pregnant at an early age and to see what else is out there. When she gets to Oklahoma, a woman puts a baby in her car and says take her. Taylor, the young woman, now had the burden of this young child. The rest of the the book deals with her learning to become a mother, fitting in, and realizing the hard decisions you have to make as an adult. There are many themes in The Bean Trees. One of the main ones, in my opinion, is family. Throughout the story, Taylor has to learn how to be part of a family. Her father had left her and her mother when she was young so she doesn't know what a complete family feels like. When she reaches Arizona, her final destination, she meets Lou Ann. She becomes her new roomate.Lu Ann also has a child named Dwayne Ray. She and her husband, Angel, have gotten a divorce and he had left them so Lou Ann is also searching for a &quot;family.&quot; So, this novel also deals with Taylor, Turtle (her baby), Lou Ann and Dwayne Ray learning how to become a family. Taylor, who's original name was Missy, is a very independent, outspoken person. She's never needed help from anyone before so when she gets Turtle, she has to learn how to get help from other people and become more interdependent rather than independent. Turtle is a small child about the age of three. When Taylor first got her she thought she was two but later in the book she finds out otherwise. Turtle is indian and was abused sexually by her aunt's boyfriend. You find out more about that in the book. She is a very quiet person and clings. She got the name Turtle because she would grab on to something and not let go. Just like a mud turtle. She learns how to open up throughout the story. Lou Ann was a very insecure person. She had an extremely low self-esteem and didn't try to do anything with herself. Taylor helps her to open up and not be so critical. She also has another trait. She is terrified that any little thing could kill Dwayne Ray or Turtle. Eventually she becomes less paranoid and relaxes a little. Barbara Kingsolver has a unique style that adds interest to the book. She uses a lot of similies to help us better understand what she's talking about. For example, &quot;Edna was so sweet we just hoped she would cancel out Virgie's sour, like the honey and vinegar in my famous Chinese recipe.&quot; Kingsolver also uses symbolism. One of her most common is birds. She uses other symbols but these appear the most. Again, for example, when Taylor takes Turtle to the doctor to get checked out for her abuse earlier in life, she looks out the window while the doctor is telling her all the horrible things that had happened and she sees a mother bird making a nest within a cactus. The bird doesn't seem to realize it's danger as it zooms past the spines, it is only concerned with making a safe haven for it's family. So as you can see, The Bean Trees is a very inspirational novel and it's fascinating how Kingsolver ties everything in at the end. I recommend it for all and hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Clear-eyed and spirited, Taylor Greer grew up poor in rural Kentucky with the goals of avoiding pregnancy and getting away from her home town. But when she heads west with high hopes and a barely-functional car, she meets the human condition head-on. By the time Taylor arrives in Tucson, Arizona, she has taken responsibility for a three-year-old American Indian girl named Turtle, and must somehow come to terms with both motherhood and the necessity for putting down roots. Hers is a story about love and friendship, abandonment and belonging, and the discovery of surprising resources in apparently empty places.&quot;The Bean Trees,&quot; by Barbara Kingsolver, gives readers something that's increasingly hard to find today -- a character to believe in, laugh with and admire. Talyor Greer is a feisty woman who readers love to relate to. Kingsolver uses character development by showing Taylor's compassion and determined spirit when she encounters new-found Central American refugees. The simple use of dialogue shows the feelings of the characters. From the use of dialogue, the reader experiences the human condition through Taylor's eyes."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"For a long time I have been intending to pick up Kingsolver and give her a read. When I worked at a bookstore as a youngster I remember often being amazed that if we were to sell only a handful of copies of a popular book, even a few years after being published, that this would be a pretty good track record. And the bookstore I worked at was a pretty big deal. So when I constantly found myself repacking the shelf with slews of newly re-ordered Kingsolver books, I would wonder why she was perhaps one of the best selling author in the store. Now I know. \`The Bean Trees' is a very well crafted tale.The story here in \`Bean Trees' is at its heart one of the most simple plot structures you will ever come across. It is as old as the hills and authors have been using this story line to tell stories in one way or another as far back in time as I have read. This is a coming of age tale wrapped around the charismatic character Taylor. What makes this book so unique is that primarily it is filled with side winding tales that spin the imagination off onto engaging tangents. I think that this might be Kingsolver's first book if I read her bio correctly. If it is, this is a very remarkable achievement. Few authors that I have read wrote a more impacting first novel, and those would be luminaries such as Updike, Mailer, Heller, and Salinger.My only beef with this story is that it does not really hit any true depths of emotion. It churns along on the surface of positively. I think that it plays a little too easily with the heartstrings. I was a little mad with Kingsolver in that she made everything a little too easy while attempting to offer a world of depravity cascading around the edges. This is part of the point of the book in a way... but still, it felt too clean... too calculated.I am entirely looking forwards to reading the rest of Kingsolver's work. I will look forwards to seeing how she develops as an author. And I would %100 recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I just finished reading this book for my comp. lit. class ,and it's absolutely one of the best novels I've ever read. I found that Barbara Kingsolver's style of writing in &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; is very much like the style she used in &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; (also a book I recommend). She becomes her characters, in a way, and makes everything she writes about seem so real. You feel involved in the story, as if you're there with the characters. I'm sure many people could relate to the way her characters talk and think, the things they talk about, and the experiences they have. These elements are what make Barbara Kingsolver's novels such engaging page-turners.&quot;The Bean Trees&quot; is about a spunky, spirited, Kentucky born girl named Taylor Greer. She was raised by her mother in a poor, rural Kentucky town--- a place she desperately wanted to leave. She manages to leave Kentucky in her early twenties and heads for the open road. She's not sure where she's going, but figures that almost anywhere is better than Kentucky. She travels in a beat-up '55 Volkswagen that requires a push to get moving.She ends up in Tucson, Arizona with a three year old American Indian girl she names Turtle, given to her by an Indian woman who told Taylor to &quot;just take it&quot; (referring to Turtle). Realizing that she's now a parent, Taylor knows she has to be more responsible. She takes a job at &quot;Jesus Is Lord Used Tires&quot; in Tucson, which also happens to be a sanctuary for Central American refugees, and finds a roommate, with whom she becomes good friends.The story follows her new life in Arizona and different relationships Taylor forms, most importantly, the one she comes to have with Turtle.This book is so touching and real, yet it maintains a wry sense of humor. You get to know the characters and become attached to them. Toward the end of the book, I came close to tears, as Taylor had to say goodbye to two good friends. Despite this, the ending leaves you with hope."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Through the wisdom of a poor young Kentucky girl, Taylor Greer, the reader is educated to a life well-lived if not always in opulence, and lessons well learned if not always easy. At age 22, give or take, Taylor begins a migration in a beat-up Volkswagon Bug to find her destiny.....her destiny being a 3 year old child named Turtle, thrust upon her by a Cherokee Indian woman in Oklahoma, and a a tire store in Tuscon, Arizona. Turtle is nearly catatonic when Taylor receives her, and the story of Turtle's and Taylor's developement in Arizona is the crux of this page-turning read. A cast of eccentric, but loveable characters enter their lives, surrounding them with color and flavor. Much more humorous and light than &quot;Posionwood Bible,&quot; Barbara Kingsolver proves herself a most versitile writer with a penchant for grabbing her audience and not letting go. I laughed; I cried; I emoted varied emotions and fell deeply in like with this misfit cast of characters. A wonderful, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have fallen in love with two books in my life, The Grapes of Wrath and The Bean Trees. This book was required reading my sophmore year of high school and I have read it more than a few times. If nothing else, Barbara Kingsolver is an incredible storyteller and has earned my respect. Since The Bean Trees, I have read two more of her books and have enjoyed them both."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The theme of the Bean Trees has to be strength in my estimation. Marietta, later Taylor, receives a gift of self-esteem from her Mother which from the very beginning shapes Marietta. Her strength has a way of delivering the right decisions at the right time. Marietta has memories of being a &quot;nutter&quot; during her high school days. A nutter is someone who picks up walnuts from the ground and lays them on the road for cars to crack the shells for easier access to the meat inside. Consequently, her fingers become blackened by this work. She becomes an outcast along with other nutters, but they provide each other with strength as a group. She has to keep Turtle, because like her she was an outcast and also needs someone that cares for her and to keep her safe. This reflects back to her Mother who, throughout her formative years as well as high school, gave her the ability to deal with almost anything. An excellent book about relationships and love without restrictions."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Overall, I thought that The Bean Trees was a good book. It touched on family themes and political themes. At some times, though it did need to me more exciting and often trailed off leaving the reader wondering why the part the author was telling was relevant. The way the author explains the story and uses the themes of the story most often people can relate their own lives to the lives of the characters and get something from the book. The basic plot of the story is a young woman whose name is Taylor, which is the main character, sets off to live on her own. She does not know where she is heading to but she just begins to drive. She stops at a bar for food and just before she leaves a woman comes up to her car and places a young child in her car. Taylor is not sure what to do but she just keeps on driving. The book goes on to tell about the troubles she faces, the people she meets, and what happens between Taylor and the child, which is later named Turtle. The book has two basic themes, family and political. The book has a strong sense of family throughout it. When Taylor ends up in Arizona she meets Lou Ann and stays with her. Lou Ann also has a young child and they become more like a family. They look out for each other and care for each other financially and emotionally. The book also has a political theme. While living with Lou Ann in Arizona, she meets her neighbors who are refugees. The book tells how they were forced to move to the United States and how their government was after them. The reader begins to think that we have it easy in the United Stated and that other people in other countries have it very rough. They have to move from place to place and they always have to hide from their government. Later in the book, the time presents itself when they have to move and Taylor takes the risk of helping them. The author gives detailed descriptions of the characters and often uses symbolism to describe the characters. Taylor named the child Turtle mainly because she noticed that the child always loved to cling onto things. In addition, Turtle was described as a song sparrow trapped in the house. She described this as her being scared, no one would help her, and the bird is not singing because it is trapped and scared. Taylor was described as a hard worker and strong willed because she never gave up and when she needed a job, she stuck to it to provide for Turtle. She wants a future for herself and she is looking for adventure. Lou Ann was another character that was well descried in the story. She was very lonely and she was looking for a friend or roommate. Lou Ann has a negative self-image of herself and her marriage failed. She also gained a lot of weight after her pregnancy that contributed to her low self-esteem. The author's style changes throughout the story. She uses metaphors and similes to describe certain characters and situations. In the book, Turtle was described as a singing sparrow because she was scared and no one was helping her. It also described her as being trapped and that Taylor is trying to help her but she does not know how. Another comparison is the cereus that the author explains in the story. This plant is a flower that only blooms one time a year. This symbolizes that there is only one chance for Taylor to do something right in Turtles life and that is going to Oklahoma and try to get custody over Turtle. In the book Taylor becomes very independent and begins to care for herself. She takes off away from everything she knows and starts her own life. This young child is thrown into her life and some way she manages to survive. She gets her own job and begins to take care of Taylor and provide for herself, while meeting knew people and building relationships with them. Turtle also changes throughout the story. In the beginning she is very quite and does not talk. Eventually she begins to talk and communicate with others. After she is almost kidnapped in the park, she starts to become quit again. In time though she returns to her own self and begins to bond with Taylor. In conclusion, I thought that the book was good. It touched on many topics and when the book was not traveling off it kept the reader wanting more. Some people could relate their lives to this book and how Taylor had to struggle through so much but still got through all the difficulties."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Marietta Greer hits the road one day to escape the fate that seems to befall all young girls in her hometown of Pittman, Kentucky: pregnancy, early marriage, and a quietly ordinary life. She changes her name to Taylor Greer after her car runs down in Taylorville and happily embarks on a new life. But things don't usually work out the way you plan them to, and while driving through Oklahoma Taylor suddenly finds herself with a toddler shoved into her passenger seat and no idea how to get the little girl home. At first she doesn't want to keep the girl, but after discovering multiple bruises on her little body she becomes too protective of her to let her go. She calls her Turtle until she can discover an appropriate name for her and the two eventually settle down in Tucson, Arizona. There they forge a deep bond with each other and with the quirky band of locals and immigrants that they meet. Taylor, a fiercely independent woman, learns to appreciate her newfound family and embraces the life that has found its way to her. But when child protective services threatens to take Turtle away unless Taylor can prove legal guardianship, and a Guatemalan couple living illegally in the U.S. becomes endangered, Taylor must find a way to keep things right.I came to this book after reading Kingsolver's masterfulThe Poisonwood Bible: A Novel (Perennial Classics), and was not disappointed. \\"Poisonwood\\" is a hard act to follow, but with its down-home charms and genial disposition \\"The Bean Trees\\" is up to the task.

I found the characters very boring and self-indulging. It is a good example of liturature that doesn't present the opposing views of life that make reading meaningful to me.I almost made it half way before I said I don't have to read anymore of this book and exchanged it at the library."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I'm being a little hard on Kingsolver with just two stars, but that's partly because I have also read her amazing POISONWOOD BIBLE, a work of gratifying emotional and psychological complexity. BEAN TREES, by contrast, seems simplistic and shallow. For example, the characters in BEAN TREES divide up neatly into the not just good but positively heroic gals (Taylor, her employer, her neighbors, her roommate) and the bad guys (INS, various ex-husbands and boyfriends). Notice that these categories also divide up neatly by gender. For whatever reason, Kingsolver doesn't address the male point of view at all, except to use men as cardboard villains creating the problems that the women have to deal with. This may be a point of view worth addressing, but I'm dismayed to find it the only point of view, period.(Estevan is a woman's mind in a man's character). The result is that BEAN TREES reads more like a light fantasy than a challenging novel. In POISONWOOD BIBLE, Kingsolver dealt skillfully and realistically with the personal and political tragedies. But in BEAN TREES, all the loose ends are wrapped up neatly and unconvincingly in no time at all. The ending in particular seemed contrived to make things work out a particular way. As a reader, I grant the author complete suspension of my disbelief in establishing the premises of a novel, but then I expect the writer to follow the implications of those premises to their logical ends, for better or worse. POISONWOOD BIBLE satisfied me in this respect, but BEAN TREES did not. On the other hand, I greatly admired the characterization of the Taylor character, especially the little &quot;Kentucky-ism's&quot; she threw into the dialogue. In this respect Kingsolver reminds me of Larry McMurtry, whose Texas characters' colorful speech keep even his lesser productions highly entertaining. As long as Taylor and also Lou Ann were speaking out loud, I enjoyed the book a great deal. When the preaching about American policy toward illegal aliens kicked in, I skipped ahead to the next part which actually dealt with her characters. I think Kingsolver is really on to something with this sort of character, grounded in Appalachian Kentucky, and I'd like to see the author explore her possibilities in novels more ambitious than this one."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It's not Kingsolver's biggest seller, but this is one of my all-time favorites - one of those books that capture what I love about reading as well as what I value in life. More focused than her \\"bigger\\" works like Poisonwood Bible, Bean Trees is the story of a young woman's emergence from an impoverished small-town childhood as she starts a new life for herself in Arizona. Taylor ventures out with near to nothing in the way of belongings, education or job skills (even her first name isn't worth enough to keep). With what she does have -- quiet wit, cautious friendliness, determination -- she builds a modest but bountiful life. Kingsolver has unflinching compassion for her characters: Taylor's voice is so true and unaffected, it's like hearing a beloved and brutally honest friend tell her life story. Her words convey a hilarious humility but her actions show silent and tremendous courage.I first read this when I was Taylor's age and was moved to realize how MUCH I had to start out in life - college textbooks, restaurant dinners paid for by parents, a closet full of clothes. Take it all away, and would I have a fraction of Taylor's character? Twenty years later, her mistakes and successes still speak to me. This is a gem of a book, a diamond. This book is like the wisteria of the title: common and tenacious, startlingly gorgeous and transcendent when blossoming - and how it bears fruit, beans or otherwise - that is Taylor's story that you must read for yourself."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees is a novel about a girl growing up and struggling to make a life for herself. She deals with being alone for the first time, is responsible for the life of another person, (her daughter Turtle) and most importantly, learns about love. Taylor Greer leaves small town Pittman, Kentucky to see what the world has to offer her and encounters many adventures on the way. The title is most likely called The Bean Trees because Taylor's \\"daughter\\", Turtle's first word is beans. She also points out a bean tree that no one has ever seen before later in the book. Turtle is a very important character in the book and she has an impact on the life of Taylor, making the things that she said about beans and bean trees important also. Being that the bean tree had never been seen before, it can represent something new, like Taylor and Turtle's life together. I think the title was a smart choice in those ways, even though it may throw one off upon first glance. The most interesting part to me was the ending, where Taylor has Estevan and Esperanza (the immigrants that she had met) pose/say that Turtle is their daughter, and that they want to give custody of her to Taylor. This way Taylor will not have to worry about being caught with a daughter that is not actually hers. She adopts Turtle and Estevan and Esperanza are taken to a safe home. I enjoyed this part because it finally gives Taylor closure and something that she has wanted the whole book. It shows her character's growth throughout the novel, as Taylor left her hometown to be on her own and escape having any children or family. She by the end of the book has found all of that. Though she does not have a husband, Turtle is her family and the people that she has met in Tucson, Arizona are also her \\"family\\". This is mainly why i enjoy the ending, everything ends up happy/works out for Taylor and the rest of her friends. The Bean Trees is very much a realist novel. It accurately shows the lives of common everyday people by creating images throughout the book that provoke feelings. It's easy to know exactly how the character is feeling. She also includes some light humor throughout her book The Bean Trees, which makes for a nice blend. I would say the audience is mostly for young adults and teenagers. The topics aren't heavy, but it might not be the best book for a younger audience. Overall, i enjoyed the novel."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Although I thought it somewhat flawed by overplotting, especially in the last third, &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; is a gorgeously written novel with a delightfully human tone.

I find that some of her references to thoughts and feelings, or even her metaphors follow my own train of though, however strange it seemed to me before.The mother and child bond, and Taylor's freidnship with Lou Ann made the whole book. In addition, Kingsolver addressed a national issue in her spare time."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book when I was in seventh grade.

Kingsolver portrays the strength of women throuhgout her entire book. The relationship that Taylor and Turtle develop shows many experiences that single mothers can overcome. This book is easy reading and can easily pull you inside to feel as if you are one of the characters. Kingsolver does a great job on developing her characters to make them as if they were real people. I really like this book because it shows that women can do anything and should not be looked down upon in our society compared to men. I recommend this book to anyone but I think women will enjoy the book more than men. The book is a perfect example of a well developed buildingsroman. The changes and experiences Taylor goes through develops her strenght and pcharacter as a person. Kingsolver is a great wirter and I found this book very enjoyable to read.

It moved me. It was so descriptive. It was so perfect the way that Barbara Kingsolver put the events and everything together. This book was funny, sad and nerve-wracking.

And I'm glad I did. This novel was so wonderfully written from beginning till end that I didn't want it to end. The description of the Arizona landscape and atmosphere made me want to go move or visit there. This book made me laugh so many times it was great.

She has no goal or final destination in mind. What she learns in her travels is that everything in life has a support network. This book is trying to say that people help each other along in life, and fate plays a role in the choices we end up making for ourselves and our loved ones. This book is a great read. I found it much easier to digest than &quot;The Poisonwood Bible,&quot; although I loved that book as well. I suppose, that in &quot;The Bean Trees,&quot; we see a younger Kingsolver developing her craft that will become more complex in Poisonwood, and I also assume, &quot;The Prodigal Summer.&quot; I haven't read the latter, but am looking forward to it now.The characters in The Bean Trees are dear, and the story is a delight."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I, Erica an 18 year old college student, read The Bean Trees, as a junior in high school, and now as a freshman in college, it still sticks out in my mind as the best novel I have read. The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver, is a magnificent novel. As Kingsolver's first novel, it takes you on a trip trough Taylor Greer's personal and political growth and experiences. It is a journey through the life of a young rebellious girl from Kentucky, who leaves all she knows for a life in the deserts of Tucson, Arizona. The book grabs the reader and drags them into this mystical journey. When you read this novel, you feel as though you are part of the novel. You feel the emotions of Taylor Greer as you read along. You feel love, confusion, defeat, anger and many painful experiences. Taylor is a young girl, who takes this journey, with out any inkling of a clue to what was coming her way. She started as a nave girl who was unaware of the vast impact of the world outside her Kentucky home. She develops into a woman of vision and insight after life changing experiences flood her view of the \\"real\\" world. You may find that she still remains nave about certain situations, but her growth is obvious. Taylor is also a character that pretends to be wise above her years though, but she realizes what part of her is wise, and not just cocky. When reading this story, you will find it hard to put down. I finished it in 3 days. It was a novel I, personally, could not put down, and did not want to put down. I wanted to live the story of Taylor Greer, because in a make-believe way, after reading this story, I felt like I had lived her life. That is what is so amazing about this novel. It is real for anyone of any age. It has something in it that everyone can relate to. This is a must read for sure."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was very interesting. It constantly brings up the death-rebirth-life cycle, and reminds the reader that one cannot grow up without someone to care for. It was interesting because the unexpected seemed to happen. I don't really want to tell more to give it away, but it was an excellent book. I had to read this for my English II Honors class at my school, and some students, didn't like it, mostly because they dislike books that they are pretty much 'forced' to read. But if you were to just say 'I'm going to read a book to day' out of the blue, pick this one, it's relatively short, I read it in a few hours, and it's satisfying to the mind."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Taylor is a young woman growing up in Kentucky.

The Bean Trees is an excellent book about growing up and finding the right place for yourself."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I think it is one of Barbra Kingsolver's best. I like the fact there were lives waiting to be pulled together, and Barbra followed them all.

It will be worth your time."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read &#34;Prodigal Summer&#34; by Barbara Kingsolver and enjoyed it so much I searched for other novels written by her.

Blood and acquired. Marietta Greer spent her entire rural Kentucky life swearing she would not get pregnant like all the other girls in her town. She saves up enough money to by a '55 VW and heads West to see what life has to offer. At a road-side bar in Cherokee Nation, a toddler wrapped in dirty blankets is thrust upon her by a Native American woman. The woman says the child's mother is dead and the child will be harmed if she stays with her. The mysterious woman puts little Turtle into the backseat and takes off. Now, Marietta has a child - the very thing she was looking to avoid - and must find a place to call home. She takes on a new name of Taylor and heads to Arizona where she meets the most unlikely bunch of people.Now I don't do this book justice with my late night review of it, because it is truly a piece of work. I believe this was Ms. Kingsolver's debut novel and it is incredible. She has an incredible knack for visualizing beauty with words. For creating deep-down depth, you love her characters to the point of tears. It is rare to find an author who can master fluidity as she can.I've yet to read The Poisonwood Bible, which I know is the main book people swoon over - nevertheless, I am enamored with her awe-inspiring delicate touch of Native American culture and life in the Southwest. The only thing that confused me was that I didn't know there was a sequel to the book (Pigs in Heaven). They are not listed as such in the jackets of either book, nor on her website. Only on Goodreads(and here on Amazon, I believe) are they put together and thank goodness for that. If you read Pigs in Heaven prior, there'd be no point in reading The Bean Trees. You would also miss the huge character build and emotional tie-in if you skip the prequel."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is one of my favorite writers; yet, I'd not read this before.

It is a wonderful story of life, love, and challenges along the way. Taylor Greer is bored of her life in a tiny town in Kentucky. After a man she knows is killed in a tractor accident, Taylor purchases a '55 Volkswagen and drives off down the road. When she stops for a bite to eat, an Indian woman gives her a baby girl. &quot;Just take it,&quot; she says, and disappears without an explanation. Taylor names the baby Turtle.Meanwhile, Lou Ann Ruiz sits at home. She worries about many things, but especially her baby's birthday. Her husband lost his leg on Christmas, and she doesn't want the baby to have his birthday on Christmas Day. Angel, her husband, left her on Halloween. A bit further down Taylor's Road of Life, she meets Lou Ann. Together, Lou Ann and Taylor get through a lot of things, whether it's figuring out Turtle's real name, or helping two Guatemalan refugees live safely on a Cherokee reserve.Through babies, vegetables and cars, Taylor's story is a wonderfully real story. It feels very much unlike fiction to read this book, because it could really happen. I recommend this book to anyone ages 12 and older."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees followed a young woman's journey through life. Missy, a poor Kentuckian, learns the hard way that lifes adventure comes at a price when she is given an abused child to raise. Together, they must survive. The author, Barabara Kingsolver, writes of the joys and pains of life. The plot was quite complex, but it can also be summed up in one word: life. There are many themes to this book, one of which is the political. It tells of the ignorace of Americans and their inability to care for the crimes and injustice of the world. The characters spanned a great spectrum, from the one legged Rodeo Rider, to the immagrant smuggling used tire salesman. I must give this book 3 stars because I am into genres other than sci-fi. Her style was great and The Bean Trees was good."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The bean tree may be the most touching and relaxing books I have ever read. This inspiring book brings you from state to state and meeting so many other people. The main character is probably one of those characters you would never forget. She has a very unique personality and style.

If you are emtional and sensitive, you would fall in love with &quot;The Bean Tree&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As a male, I found the message of The Bean Trees a bit harsh. With exception of one (Angelic) man, the rest of the men in the story are simply bastards, who abuse little children, and walk out on women. Thus, I found the novel to be offensive in that aspect. Yet, if you are a woman, the chances are you will enjoy the book, as it offers inspiring, detailed and tear-jerking material, with a wonderfully realistic heroine, regardless if you are a man or a woman"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I can never say enough good things about Barbara Kingsolver's writing.

Does it sound too corny to say it changed my life?"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book for a book club and I didn't think it was that great. First of all the beginning was kind of slow. It started to get interesting by the end of the book but it wouldn't be a book I would recommend.

Anyways wouldn't read it again."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Taylor Greer encounters many obstacles in her journey headed to nowhere. She leaves her hometown looking to start a new, when a lady puts a child in the front seat of her Volkswagen and walks off. Taylor has no choice, but to take care of the child at least for a little while. But Taylor ends up loving the child more and more each day. Along her journey she meets many interesting people; Maggie- a woman that fixes cars for a living , Lou Ann- an overprotective mother and Mrs. Parsons- an old, blind woman that babysits small children. Taylor picks up a few jobs here and there, until she meets Lou Ann and moves in with her. Taylor's mission in this book is to find the child's relative's, but she never does. That's why I gave it two stars. I don't really like how the book ends, because it leaves you wondering. This book is slow paced and easy to read, if your looking for something simple it's nice."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I thought this was an entertaining book, but I was disappointed in the lack of emotion expressed by the main character, Taylor. She reiterated throughout the story that she was so determined not to be like the other girls in her high school that got pregnant so young and saddled with children. Yet she readily accepts a young, abused American Indian child that is handed to her at a roadside cafe. I found this a bit of a stretch considering she never discussed the overwhelming feelings she seemed to be experiencing. And the references to the abuse the child had suffered were also downplayed. I understand the author's intended subtlty, but the lack of emotion seemed oddly cold. This was such an emotional story, yet I finished it feeling let down. Excellent story, nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Barbra Kingsolver author of The Bean Trees truly keeps this story alive with her excellent style and the strong theme that is evident throughout this book. Her weaknesses in this book are her character developments and a weak plot. Overall this was an enjoyable book to read that kept me entertained. The story started out very catching with a story of a girl named Taylor preparing to start out on her own with very little money right after high school. After that Kingsolver keeps it interesting by combining the story of Lou Ann with the story of Taylor so that eventually their paths cross. Kingsolver throws many things into the story that both Lou Ann and Taylor have to deal with such as a abandoned baby, a one-legged rodeo husband, and illegal refugees that affect everyone's lives. The story keeps you entertained and is a joy to read. Kingsolver uses a strong family theme throughout the story and adapts it to fit with the characters. The theme of family isn't the normal one, it shows that you don't have to be related to people to love and care for them and consider them your family. She uses two examples of this type of family in her story first of all we learn of Lou Ann, Taylor, Duwayne Ray, and Turtle. They all love and depend on one another and consider themselves to be a family. Also we learn of Mattie, Esperanza, Estevan, and all the other illegal refugees who live in Mattie's apartment. They care for one another and take care of each other just like a normal family would. The author's uses great style and keeps the story entertaining and upbeat. She keeps the story flowing and easy to read. Kingsolver uses realistic dialect to make the characters come alive and to make them seem real. She also uses figurative language like similies and extended metaphors to indirectly help understand what is going on. She also uses symbolism to represent certain parts of the story that she finds important. She uses the song sparrow to represent Turtle and to show what developments she might make throughout the course of the book. Her style is her best feature through the course of the book. Most of the main characters go through major changes throughout the course of the story. Lou Ann changes from having very low self-esteem to being more confident and believing in herself. Taylor a major character in this book develops a sense of independence and develops feelings of love to her new family. Turtle is maybe the most dynamic character in this story. She goes from being completely untalkative to being like a normal little kid. Over all the characters seemed real and true. This story was entertaining and an interesting story to read. Barbra Kingsolver keeps this story going with a great sense of style throughout the book. Overall I reccommend it."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Much better than the sequel, Pigs in Heaven, this is a beautiful written story with engaging characters and an important social message. Taylor Greer, a young woman from rural Kentucky, becomes a mother when she is handed an Indian child at a bar. By taking on the additional unexpected responsibility, she learns about herself."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It all depends on what kind of books you are interested in reading. In my case I personally was not interested while reading this novel. If you are one, not to be able to follow books if not interested in the reading I wouldn't recommend \\"The Bean Trees\\".The character Marietta Greer whom is called Missy describes in the beginning of the novel how she was raised with out a father. She mentions that she was part Cherokee Indian from her great grandfather who was Cherokee. Missy decides to leave her home town in a beat in up 55' Volkswagen Bug. She decided she would travel west until her car broke down. At one point she ended up in Taylorville where she decided to change her name to Taylor Greer.Taylor ended up with a child in which she did not know the name. She eventually named the child turtle due to the fact she wouldn't let go of objects. Taylor then entered Tucson Arizona where she had two flat tires and had to stay for a while to come up with the money to fix it. Here in Tucson she ran into another lady named Lou Ann.Lou Ann had it rough well that's what I believe. About 3 years ago her husband lost his leg and just hung around the house. She would do everything for him. She put him before herself. He eventually left her and she placed an, add for a room mate.

Now as a senior at a different school, I was again required to read The Beans Trees for a novel project. I had no problem reading it twice, it was an okay book and an easy A! This novel is a journey of a young woman named Taylor Greer. It is a book about love, friendship, growing up fast, finding who you really are, and belonging in the world. This was one of the most easiest books I have ever read, and I would recommend it for people who like happy, upbeat books. The only problem I had with this book is that some of the chapters were boring and you just wanted to get through them. But if you look past that, it gets the readers attention and you just want to find out what happens between Taylor and Turtle (the child she was left with) at the end. If you want an easy book, this is it!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's novel of the importance of love and family made the experience of reading it enjoyable.

But after I began reading it I found out that I liked it a lot. Taylor and little Turtle were great characters. I found it special to be in their lives for a while.

Barbara Kingsolver reminds us that sometimes we have to let go of things that we love the most to recieve even more in return. A great summer read that was purchased simply because it was a recommended book at my local bookstore."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was truly significant in that Kingsolver, showed us the many struggles, people, friends, and dangers that came with little Turtle. Without humor, trust, and faith in each other it would have been truly impossible to survive the problems that Lou Ann, Dwayne Ray, Taylor, and Turtle face. With Taylor's determination to find the real mother, she finds herself lying to the law. In this compelling story about love, friendship, and hope, we all learn that some people do not have such luxurious offers as many do. We realize that Taylor comes from a foreign background living in Kentucky, and she is truly making the best out of what she has. Everyday, she looks toward hope, and she knows she will someday find what Turtle wants and needs. Without humor in the heart, the family would be not!P.S.

Though most of the characters are likeable, the book has an almost to perfect and happy ending. (But that all changes in the sequel, Pigs In Heaven) The Bean Trees is not the Kingsolves' best book (see the Posinwood Bible).

Even so, I could not find a lot to like about this novel. I gave it three stars for the good prose and attempt to unfold the characters' lives without giving tons and tons of details.I believe Kingsolver might think she is subtle and not \\"preachy\\" in her political/social beliefs--but The Bean Trees is terribly obvious. The immigration issues run much deeper than a goodhearted couple that just wants to be accepted. NOnetheless, it is a light read, interesting in some parts, but predictable and mildly preachy."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The only memory I have of reading this novel 20 years ago is chasing my roommate around the apartment reading aloud, while she covered her ears and screamed for me to stop. Yeah, the prose is that stilted, hackneyed, predictable, and plain old lazy.The characters are flat. The situation is reworked from hundreds of other novels.

Taylor Greer is a genuine hero because she travels through life with the grace that her mother gave to her, and that has nothing to do with money or anything else that is remotely materialistic.I'll never look at &quot;bean trees&quot; the same way again."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees was a book that surprised me greatly. When I first started reading I felt as though this would not be a book that kept my interest at all. I did not like the laid-back southern Kentucky setting. I felt as though the book would be boring and not have much point to it. Although, I really started to like it after finishing the first two chapters.The Bean Trees was kind of a compliment to woman; giving you the feeling that if woman came together they could conquer life, and happiness. The main character in the novel, &quot;Taylor&quot; Greer, was one of my favorites. She was smart, opinionated, and independent. She became sick of living her same life so she packed up and headed out to wherever her car broke down. Taylor ended up in Tuscon, Arizona where she was given a baby by a random woman while stopping to eat at a restaurant. Taylor was able to fix her own problems by finding a house, getting a job, making new friends, and raising a child that was not even hers. Instead of giving up with her fears and depressions of being alone and unstable, Taylor rose above and proved nothing could beat her down.This book gave you the feeling of no matter where you are, you'll always find family. It produced a comforting mood showing how Taylor interacted with new found friends that helped her raise her child. Taylor also became the legal guardian by driving all the way out to Oklahoma to produce adoption papers.I found that The Bean Trees had great elements of foreshadowing. Throughout the book there are mentionings of a garden in one of Taylor's friend's backyards. Even though they are in Arizona, in the desert, with hardly any trees or plant life many beautifully colored flowers bloomed through the dry desert. This goes to show that even when you are in an ugly place in your life there are always ways to build hope, and life. Just as Taylor was put in a sticky situation, being left a child, she made it work out for the best and learned to love her.There weren't very many parts of this novel that I didn't enoy except that it seemed a little far fetched. In my current understanding of life I dont see how a girl could venture out on her own leaving everything she had behind, including her family. On top of trying to find somewhere to go, and somehow to survive she was basically forced to raise a small child. She didn't have any connections with anyone so she walked into a town, started conversing with people, and ended up with a job and a roomate in a very short period of time. Unless you found somewhere extremely giving I just don't think that would happen. Although, the theme of this book is the power to succeed in any situation I think this situation requires an incredible individual in real life circumstances.In conclusion, I think The Bean Trees was a well-written novel, and I would recommend it to readers. As a warning I would say if you're not up for seeing how well things can work out in the worst of situations then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was able to get through this book okay, but found it a little boring. It jumped around a lot.Taylor Greer is an eighteen year old girl striving for independence in her life.

The mother takes off and leaves. So Taylor has no choice but to love it and calls her Turtle for the way she grabs onto things.As the book continues, other strange characters enter the scene, and the story line skips around quite a bit. This is what I didn't like about the story as a whole; otherwise it would have been good."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is the story of a young woman named Taylor Greer who grew up in Kentucky trying to avoid ending up like everyone else in a small town life. She wanted a life outside of Kentucky,she wanted to get away.Taylor Greer heads west in a &quot;55&quot; volkswagon she buys. On her way she stops at an auto repair shop in Tucson,Arizona. Here she finds that all the people there are refugees from Central America. She takes in a little three year old girl named Turtle. This little girl brings a big change to Taylors life because she was looking for a bigger and better life when she left Kentucky. Had this been what she was set to go out and look for? Taylor was taking care of this poor inocent girl who didn't really know what was going on. She was abandoned and all alone with no family. She was trying to survive until Taylor came and saved her from what her life could have been, kind of like Taylor who didn't want to end up a nothing.I think that this novel was well written because it's based on reality and there was really refugees from Central America, from every where and there was abandoned kids without familys. This novel shows that there was that hope for them and someone to look after them. I reccomend this book to anyone that understands what these people went through and that like to read &quot;touching&quot; and based on reality storys."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Unique in that the narrator and heroine, Taylor/Marietta isn't the typical flawed protagonist who learns self-confidence by getting a makeover or landing her dream man. In this book, Taylor already has a self-confidence that borders on cockiness and is full of spunk. She's a sweet, straight-talking narrator the reader grows to love. Her frankness is something readers will aspire to. Taylor travels to Tucson, takes charge of a young Native American girl, befriends and encourages an insecure new mother named Lou Ann, and meets Estevan and Esperanza, a couple from Guatamala living illegally in the states. The novel has a feminist slant, and is empowering that way. I got a bit bored with the subplot featuring Estevan and Esperanza, but for the most part was captivated. Told in the voice of Taylor, the novel is humorous and uplifting. The conversations are realistic and familiar, very real. Brimming with advice and inspiration."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Meet Taylor Greer. Clear-eyed and spirited, she grew up poor in rural Kentucky with two goals: to avoid pregnancy and to get away. She succeeds on both counts when she buys a '55 Bug and heads out west. But when our plucky if unlikely heroine pulls up on the outskirts of Tuscon and arrives at the Jesus is Lord Used Tire Center with an \\"inherited\\" three year old Indian girl named Turtle it's time to meet the human condition head on.Taylor, after an amusing search, finally finds a roommate and settles down to start a new life with Turtle. However. Some of her assumptions about her new daughter prove to be in error and she finds she has a greater task than she bargained for on her hands.What I most like about The Bean Tress is the sense of connection you have with the characters and their no nonsense approach to life. These are people on the edge of society trying to work within the rules doing the best they can with what they have without regret, remorse or any sense of victimizationThis is a novel of love and friendship, abandonment and belonging and the discovery of surprising spiritual resources arising from apparently empty spaces, The Bean Trees is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"\\"I have been afraid of putting air in a tire ever since I saw a tractor tire blow up and throw Newt Hardbine's father over the top of the Standard Oil sign.\\" Suddenly you're right smack-dab in the middle of Taylor Greer's life, and from page one, you're loving it. Or, maybe I should say you're loving her. You know those books where it's as if the narrator is really talking to you? The Bean Trees is a perfect example. Taylor's voice is easy and conversational, with a definite southern twang, and when you're reading the book, you can just picture yourselves sitting on someone's front porch, drinking iced tea and talking through sunset until the stars come out.Taylor's life is no picnic, though. During the course of the book, she leaves behind her nondescript future in Kentucky, and travels to Arizona, gaining an unlooked-for toddler named Turtle on the way. In Arizona she meets people she normally wouldn't, and learns a lot about life and hardship in the process. She finally gains the courage to put air in a tire after an old woman named Mattie, gives her a job at Jesus is Lord Used Tires. She meets Lou Ann Ruiz, who was emotionally abused and later abandoned by her husband. And she meets Esperanza and Estevan, a married couple, former teachers in Guatemala, whose daughter was taken from them, and who illegally escaped government persecutionThe book was incredibly real. (...) a lot of stories will give you this happily-ever-after ending, gift-wrapped, with all the lose ends tied up neatly in a bow. But not The Bean Trees. Its reality is one of the reasons it is such a wonderful book. But despite its almost harsh truth, it leaves you with a sense of the beauty of the world, and a belief in the underlying goodness of the human race."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Bean Trees, &#65533;BT&#65533;, is the only book that captured my heart from the start. It is a heartwarming story about a young woman who tries to escape the plague of her hometown, which is becoming pregnant too soon. Ironically after escaping her Kentucky hell, &#65533;Taylor&#65533; finds herself in the position she tired to escape when she finds a small Native American child in her car with no parents in sight. The sad part is that not only was the baby abandoned, but also she seems to have endured some physical abuse in her short life. Taylor decides she can&#65533;t dump the child off like its parents did so she instead takes care of the child herself. Taylor and Turtle (the child) end up in Tucson were they make a fresh start and try to make it on their own. Taylor finds a roommate named Lou Ann who is also having baby problems because she is faced with an unplanned pregnancy. Taylor becomes very over protective about the children in the house as if they were a fragile glass trinkets that could be broken at the slightest touch.In BT, there is a lot of themes of feminism since Taylor is trying to make it on her own without a man in her life. Men in this story aren&#65533;t particularly portrayed in a typical family man way. These women want to be strong and independent, something that a stereotypical woman is not. The &#65533;girl power&#65533; is perhaps too much for the male audience and is more of a dis than a complement to the gender.I loved this book because of its strong descriptive nature, its strong characters and the messages it sent about being a strong, independent woman. It really reminded me of a &#65533;Lifetime Movie&#65533; but without the psycho husband or the twisted plot. It was heartwarming because the choices Taylor made and how those choices made her grow as a person. She took on a whole new out look on life and matured gracefully over the course of the story. It was extremely realistic. So realistic that I cried and I laughed right along with the characters. The characters were easy to relate to and the dialect Kingslover added showed the origin of the characters and added to their personality. I really would recommend this book to anyone and I would definitely read it again myself."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"With the diversity of the charactors and a story that touches the soul, this book was an amazing read. Each charactor can be identified with and each relasionship that the book describes is easily understood. This book is neither too short nor too long. My first Kingsolver book, but, guaranteed, not my last."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Stories of women overcoming adversity are becoming more common. There's more than a little justice achieved by these tales. Many of them, particularly this work, show how women use their power of community to manage their lives successfully. These stories need to be told, and Kingsolver has given us a superlative example. The community theme is superbly demonstrated in Estevan's recital of heaven and hell - hell is peopled with those who cannot reach out to others, starving in a kitchen full of food.Lou Ann and &quot;Taylor&quot; are fellow Kentuckian exiles living in Tucson. The relocation has bought unexpected challenges to their lives. Not the least of these is the additional burden of infants: Lou Ann's by an unwanted pregnancy and Taylor's by an abandonment. What does it say about women that Taylor makes no attempt to off-load Turtle to a state agency, but keeps her to raise. Kingsolver evokes the reader's sympathy for both Taylor and Lou Ann, although both are in situations of their own making. Mattie, too, might have been given greater role, particularly since she provides so many fundamental changes in Taylor's life.Kingsolver's character development makes wonderful reading. Occasionally, her descriptive powers overcome her characterization and Taylor waxes rather more eloquent than her background and education [which is almost entirely self-taught] would warrant. It's easy to forgive these lapses in light of how well she relates the story. Throughout the book i wondered why only Taylor speaks in the first person. A dual viewpoint of characters and events might have given this story more depth.Estevan and his wife, Esperanza, are Guatemalan refugees. Kingsolver's use of these characters to point up America's support of the oppressive regime is depicted with skill. Taylor's growing awareness of conditions there represents that of the average American -it's visible only by direct confrontation. Unfortunately, Taylor lives where sympathy for refugees from oppressive regimes is minimal. The place is called the United States, symbolized, interestingly enough, by a woman standing in a harbour offering sanctuary to the oppressed.There is a disturbing element in this and similar stories by and of today's women. Men here are universally portrayed without a redeeming feature. There are no &quot;neutral&quot; males who provide any form of support or reinforcement. Angel Ruiz could just as easily have lost more than a leg in his rodeo accident. Instead, he must be portrayed as a deserting husband. Kingsolver, however, has him appearing in cameos which only reinforce his role as the uncaring male. We are returned here to the early days of feminism in declaring males superfluous to the community of women. It's not a healthy indication for the future. If the atmosphere of &quot;us versus them&quot; intensifies, there will be greater backlash than is currently the case. If men have truly failed women over all these millennia, then it's reconciliation that's required, not intensifying of resentments. That only builds mutually reinforcing resentment."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The book started off a bit vague, lacking something necessary to hold my attention. Once past the second chapter the characters lives picked up and the plot became more interesting, the chapters had a tendency to skip between two characters toward the begining, this left me confused where these characters would later coralate in the book when finally as the climax came their paths crossed, and I found the book to be quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I bought this book for my daughter's summer reading, and it turned out to be a simply delightful and encouraging story of a young woman's trip from youth to adulthood. Taylor Greer used to be Marietta Greer, but like her life, she changes her name, determined to leave her Kentucky childhood behind and get away from a certain future of pregnancy and bare feet. With a few fix-it lessons from her mother on old cars, Taylor takes her beat up 55 Volkswagon with no windows, no back seat and no starter, and begins a trip across the Great Plains, determined to drive as far west as she can until the car won't run anymore. Taylor hadn't counted on a lot of things, but mainly she hadn't counted on her rocker arm breaking down and having to use half her money to fix it. She also hadn't counted on being given a baby to raise. Her quick wit and strong heart take her further than she ever dreamed possible. You will adore the people she meets, the life she lives, and her incredible courage as she begins to find perhaps not the life she had envisioned, but a life full of good friends, warm lessons, and a special kind of love . A story to capture your heart."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I started this book with a few qualms.

Being from the South myself, I could really relate to the language of the story from Taylor's and Lou Ann's point of view. The main story is set in Arizona though, so don't go thinking this is just for Southern gals. You learn about the lives of some people that have had a bit of a rough time of it, but they are struggling through, and their lives don't seem to be quite as bleak as they think.

Barbara Kingsolver's novel highlights some of the perks good friends can bring to a less than perfect world and uses a less than perfect lead character to tell us about it.Taylor takes us with her as she leaves her small town in Kentucky and settles into a new home in Arizona, all the while keeping us reading with her playful, chatty voice.We get her details of the exotic scenery, for example, when she crosses the Arizona state line she admits to thinking that &quot;the whole scene looked too goofy to be real,&quot; what with the clouds that were &quot;pink and hilarious-looking, like the hippo ballerinas in a Disney movie.&quot;We get to go to work at the Burger Derby with her and learn about Sandi, her &quot;horse-crazy&quot; co-worker. There's Lou-Ann who would have won all the &quot;enthusiastic-employee awards&quot; for her new job at the Red Hot Mama's salsa factory. And Mattie, owner of Jesus is Lord Used Tires, brings in a few new friends from Guatemala, the names of which Taylor has &quot;not yet gotten straight:Es-something and Es-something.&quot;All in all it's quite an eclectic, eccentric, and exciting group of friends, thanks to the polish of Kingsolver's language and her ability to create a narrative that is both endearing and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It is about a girl (Taylor) that leaves her hometown Kentucky on a road trip to find her a better life, on the way she stopped at a restaurant and got told by someone that she needed to take this kid (Turtle) because she was in danger.

So towards the end of the story Taylor went to go find the Aunt of Turtle so she could adopt her.

It had an interesting topic that a teenager may be very interested in. That is, that it is about a girl, Marietta Greer, who decides she is ready to leave the town she was raised in, get away, and start her own life. She purchases an old car, and decides to drive until it breaks down, which will be where she starts her knew life.This book had a good topic and plot, and was well written. The topic was good because it discussed a topic that most teenagers think about, and it did so using a girl with a good head on her shoulders. Barbara Kingsolver came up with a good plot for this book because it gave the book a good twist, the events that she went through with Turtle. This kept the book interesting after it seemed the book was becoming predictable. This book was written well, it was easy to read, and there was too much pointless detail. Kingsolver also gave depict and interesting characteristics and feelings to the characters. She made them seem very real, as if you were watching what was going on. She made them have real feelings and attitudes. All together she did a good job putting this book together.If I had any problems with the book, it would be that I felt the book was intended more for a female audience. There were certain parts of the book that didn't mean anything to me, parts that I didn't really want to read and parts that I couldn't associate with. This didn't take away from how good the book was, it just seemed more appropriate for a girl to read the book rather than a guy."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is a wonderful novelist, honest and truthful in her observations and compassionate in the treatment of her subjects. She is also extremely funny and had me doubled up in stitches at the most unexpected moments. When she writes about social injustice, colonial prejudice or racial discrimination as she does in &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; (&quot;BT&quot;), she is disarmingly understated and all the more slyly suggestive and powerful in her delivery. BT, her debut novel, is a beautifully conceived little gem that will warm the cockles of your heart. As soon as Taylor drives off in her weatherbeaten car in search of a life and headed for nowhere, she find herself landed with an abandoned child of Indian (native) origin whom she names Turtle and with her in tow embarks on a journey of self discovery. As she travels in search of work and accommodation, she strikes up a friendship with a group of people including the bighearted Mattie, the mousy worrier and some time single mother Lou Ann, and the troubled Cherokee Indian couple, Estevan and Esperanza, who has lost their child. Not surprisingly, Turtle becomes a natural catalyst for the emotional catharsis they will each experience as their lives entwine, separate and unfold. In their own ways, they are transformed and healed by their friendship which has taught them what it means to be human. As the plot unrevels, you realize that there are just no stereotypes to humanity, the motto being &quot;we should always be ready to be surprised&quot;. How else would you explain the role reversal in the positions of the confident Taylor and the insecure Lou Ann by the end of the novel ? Kingsolver's multiple name identities for her characters (eg, Estevan/Steven, Esperanza/Hope, Marietta/Taylor, etc) is also a subconcious metaphor for the myriad realities of life. I loved Kingsolver's balanced and finely judged prose, which has a steady clarity and lucidity about it that reaches its peak in the chapter about nature and the elements, preceding the telling of the terrible incident that set Turtle's recovery back. Kingsolver is obviously knowledgeable about botany and vegetation because she uses her expert knowledge to great effect. BT is serious, yet incredibly funny and life affirming in its values. I found reading it a thoroughly entertaining and uplifting experience and I highly recommend it to anybody who loves excellent and unpretentious writing."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees was an intresting novel.I liked how they took real life situations and put them into story.I like the way their opinions were about different situations that occured in the boook.I also liked the very strong descriptive literature.How ever I thought Taylor was very conceited.She didn't think anything was good .She never was happy.I would change the way Turtle act.No one should be that quiet.I recommend this book to my friend in Paris ,France she loves books.I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Think of a book with no central challenge. Think of a well written book. Think of a book that puts you to sleep. Combine all of those books and you get The Bean Trees. The Bean Trees is a story of a woman's struggle through the beginning of her adulthood. She fights the stereotype of her town and leaves for the West. She has a child thrust into her care and she soon grows to love that child and to call the child her own. This book is good yet bad. You will love it and hate it. It is amazing and boring. Read it if you like, but I must warn you that it is a few hundred pages of boredom."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read the novel The Bean Trees for my high school english class. I found the book to be very well written. It was enjoyable, making it easy and fun to read. The story begins in a town in Kentucky with a girl named Missy. Missy she wants a change and decides to take a road trip. She owns a junker of a car that has no starter or windows. She is going to get in her car and drive until it will take her no farther. Where ever she stops will be her new home. She ends up in Tuscon, Arizona with a new name, Taylor. By this time, a child has been thrust into her arms. Not knowing what to do she takes the child. There are many people in Tuscon that offer Taylor guidance, comfort, and support. She is offered a job from Mattie and a place to live with Lou Ann. She comes to terms with reality and finds that she wants to keep Turtle ownly she does not know how. Taylor is faced with a tough problem. The main theme of the story is the theme of family. In the book many people come together to form families. Most of the characters have only known each other for a short time but over that period of time they have grown in love and respect for the others. Taylor and Turtle, the child abruptly thrusted into Taylor's arms, were welcomed into Lou Ann and Dwayne Ray's home. At first it was lead your own lives, i will not bother you if you do not bother me arrangement. However, after time they had grown into a caring loving family that helped each other out. There was also the family of Mattie, Esperanza, Estevan, and the illegal refugees. They all lived together and took care of each other. The last family was Edna and Virgie. They both relied on each other. Missy was the main character in the story. Her mother was supportive. She would tell Taylor she was just as good as anyone and made sure Taylor was self-sufficient. Taylor was Native American, hard-headed and determined. She loved her mother but was very independent. She was brave, impulsive, and free spitited. We also encountered Lou Ann. She was friendly but self-conscious. She had low self-esteem but it grew over time. She eventually developed a sense of humor. The author's style of the book was for the most part was straight forward. Kingsolver offered realistic dialect for her characters. She had common enelevated diction. She offered political and family themes. She used figurative language, but not much imagery. She offered lots of symbolism and related it to nature, such as bird, cactus, song sparrow, cereus, rhizobia, vegetables, and turtle. She had integration along with realism."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was wonderful. What an adventure.

If your into books about indians it would be good.If your into interesting books, read something else."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver was a fair attempt at a political novel. The only reason I gave this novel one star is that zero stars was not an option. Despite the fact that the plot was interesting and the storyline controversial, I found this novel to be difficult to become involved in. Perhaps the reason is that I believe a novel with strong political viewpoints such as this should not be in school curriculums, or perhaps it just did not appeal to me. Kingsolver's indirect statements about refugees and asylees and the American population's viewpoints intrigued me, because she basically stated outright that North American people are completely oblivious of the rest of the world, which is an untrue extreme generalization. The plot also failed to excite me. In my eyes, what should have been the climax was merely a smaller part at the wrong place in the story. This was Turtle's attempted kidnapping, an event that was over before it started. The official climax, if you would call it a climax, was what should have been the resolution. Another part of the story that bothered me was Angel's constant presence. Angel never actually posed any real threat, for it was completely Lou Ann's choice whether or not to go back to him, and she never did anyways, so Angel's repeated returns were unnecessary. Also, Kingsolver's portrayal of Virgie as being a stereotypical American was nonsensical, at best. She was a flaming racist and was not afraid to speak her mind to any immigrant that happened by. This is obviously not true, because only a small percent of us feel in such a way, let alone would have the audacity to be outward and open about those feelings. Kingsolver's theme of family and immigration viewpoints is a weak one, and I found this story to be uninteresting. Overall, this novel was a politically biased attempt at imposing extreme viewpoints of feminism and liberalism upon its readers."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Before I start I have to say I read this book for an English class, but regardlessly it is still terrible. There are so many incredible events in this book that it seems fake. The characters are uninteresting. The author depicts male horribly. In short, if you don't have to read this book DON'T."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A huge portion of the impact this book makes on the reader depends on the person's age and life experiences. The book's main character, Taylor Greer is a young lady who grows up determined not to become a mother and suddenly finds herself in possession of a baby girl. This book might be more or less appealing to a reader who has more or less things in common with the main character. I, personally, have not had much experience in child care which,influenced my decision to give this novel a three star rating. The book is averagely written, lacking emotional power in some areas. For instance, when Taylor is suddenly left with a child, her reactions are not appropriately dramatic. In fact, they are rather simple as Taylor asks the child's keeper, &quot;Is... this your kid?&quot; A good thing about this novel is its setting. The fact that Taylor has grown up in Kentucky powerfully influences the plot. Young women in Kentucky are far more likely to get pregnant than those in elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book because it was assigned to my daughter for summer reading. Although I did find some of the situations humorous, I never could figure out why Taylor decided to keep Mattie. Her relationships with other people were more fully developed than with Mattie, and I kept waiting for some evidence that she was beginning to love the little girl, but all of a sudden she decides to keep her and goes to great lengths to do so. Some of the other situations in the book didn't ring true either. Overall the book was less then satisfying, but an easy afternoon's read if you want something to do."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was forced to read this boring book and i am trying to find advice on this book for a thesis centered essay due soon, i really hated this book and i fell asleep throughout most of the book b/c i thought it was very boring. thankfully my teacher who thought, &quot;it is a wonderful book&quot; but truthfully, it was a boring book. Please do yourself a favor and DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"During the first 3/4 of the book, someone could have snatched the book away and I wouldn't have blinked an eye, although the characters were well-drawn and the the dialog was full-bodied.

The book sang of spirit and hope, no wonder it is required reading for the students in Arizona."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"That word sums up the entire book...I had to read it for my English class, but regardless, it's an awfully dull book.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes emotionally stimulating books"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It's a great read, and well worth the time! It's a quirky, inspiring book that will make you laugh, cry and cheer.Briefly, it's about a young, poor Kentucky woman who heads west on her own in a dilapidated car. By the time she has arrived in Tucson, she has been entrusted with a 3 year old abandoned Indian child, Turtle.The author switches between 1st and 3rd person narration during the first few chapters, giving a more complete view of the main character, Taylor Greer. I loved the rural Kentucky dialect and colorful expressions.Yes, it is (in a way) a &quot;chick book&quot;--it presents feminist views and strong, independent women. Themes include survival, family values, and relationships. Male readers shouldn't rule it out!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has a way of telling stories about people's everyday lives which causes the reader to become very interested and involved with the characters. In this book, young Taylor Greer has spent her adolescence in a rural area of Kentucky with her main objectives being to keep from getting pregnant and to complete high school. This accomplished, she decides after working in a local hospital for awhile that she needs to go to another place to live. On her way to her eventual destination, she is given a young Indian child by someone she meets on the way. Not sure of where she'll end up or what she will do with the young child, she continues her journey and manages to find a job, a place to live, and some friends. Another feature of Kingsolver books is that the reader is lulled with everyday occurances until something very monumental and sometimes unexpected happens. This book is true to form and a lurking background of dysfunction gives way to a promising future."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book for school, and from the first page, I knew this book would be different from any I've read. It's extremely insightful and passionate and the story is written so well.

She meets new people, unexpectedly receives an abused child, and learns from mistakes and decisions for herself. From this she grows and experiences, and gains a new respect for life, love, and why she ended up where she is. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to read a great book."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This novel was very innovating and moving. Barbara Kingsolver's usage of language and imagery made me feel like I myself was actually on this journey to Arizona. This novel was simply about a girl who leaves her small hometown to seek a new and different life. Yet, during her journey, she is given the responsibilty of being a mother to an abandoned Indian child. The two move to Arizona where they settle in, make new friends, and find themselves in some dangerous situations. I gave it 4 stars because of how touching and remarkable a book it was.

I picked it up yesterday and instantly regretted that it had sat unread for so long!Taylor Greer is a wonderful example of how people who are brought up with love and compassion easily are able to pass that to those who need it most. Seeing the world outside of her small Kentucky hometown is a real awakening for her. It awakens a beautiful strong young woman who finds the strength to do what is right not only for herself but for so many others who come into her life.There are so many layers to Taylor and Kingsolver allows the reader to truly experience them right along wither her.A short read, it is hard to put down but well worth the lack of sleep!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this novel about ten years ago, and it was the first Kingsolver novel I ever read.

This time the issues addressed had to do with child care, immigration bureaucracy, the irresponsibility of American white men, and the need for strong women to make up for that. Most of her points were well taken, and I mostly agreed with her. (However, she could have used a man to tell her the difference between a rocker arm and a tie rod.) The book is heart warming story about a little 3 year old abused Native American girl (named Turtle), and the tough young single woman who finds her, loves her and starts her on the road to having a life. This is my third Kingsolver book. I liked them all. She is a gifted writer.

I read the Bean Trees. It was so great that I have gone on to read Pigs in Heaven, and Animal Dreams, and will soon go on to read The Poisonwood Bible. And I am not a person who reads novels at all! I read practical things like psychology, spirituality, self-help and the like..Maybe sometimes biography, or something of historical or political interest. Well, I'm sold on Barbara Kingsolver. I'm not going to go into the plot here. Simply that her use of local language and feelings for people that makes them humorous and alive is extraordinary.. How many novels have you read that made you laugh out loud time and time again, even when the story itself wasn't funny? So far, every novel(of the 3 mentioned) had something to do with poor people in the usa and elsewhere, American Indians, immigration, alienation and community. Real people, flawed people, unique people, and a sense of humor.. Teenagers have a place, neurosis as well as tragedy are part of everyone's life and yet everything is infused with color and a kind of joy that makes it all sensible if not tactile.

I found this particularly interesting and I quickly became attached to this topic in the story. This book tells about everything in this world. Including many different topics during the lady's travels, are in this story. I think this book shows many different topics during the ladies travel.

She was left wanting more, which is always a good sign.\\"The Bean Trees\\" is a gem of a book that shows that love can transcend blood and home *is* where the heart is."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Bean Trees is about helping others and the possibility of a loving family even if the people are not related. Taylor, the main character, is a young girl from southern Kentucky that bravely leaves her hometown to make a life for herself. She works at a hospital for five years and saves as much money as possible and then buys herself a Volkswagen bug. She decides to take her car and drive west until her car dies in Tuscan, Arizona. Along the way a woman leaves Taylor with Turtle, a little Indian child, to care for. Lou Ann and her baby Duane Ray are Taylor's roommates and family away from home. Lou Ann's husband, Angel, leaves her and her new born baby, Duane Ray, and moves to Montana. Esperanza and Estevan are Taylor and Mattie's friends that are foreigners to the U.S. and are striving to make a new life for them selves. Edna Poppy and Mrs. Parsons are the neighbors of Lou Ann and Taylor that watch over the children whenever needed. Each of the main characters runs into his or her own set of problems and struggles that everyone goes through in life. Their adventures consist of leaving home, traveling, and protecting each other from harm. My favorite character is Taylor because she has such a good heart, possesses a strong personality, and is her own person, unlike anyone else.I can really relate to Taylor because she needed to find herself and leave her hometown. I have had my own struggles with finding my purpose in life and needing to leave my home to start a life for myself. I think many times throughout the novel Taylor feels alone just as I have many times. She realizes, like I have, that there are so many others that are less fortunate, and the people I love are right before me. All I have to do is open my eyes and see that every thing I need is right before me. I can also relate to Turtle because I was adopted just like her. I understand, just as she does, that just because your family is not blood related it does not mean that you are not loved and don't have a family.I really enjoyed reading this book because it was adventurous. Even though it was fiction, it still could have been a true story. My favorite part of the book is when Lou Ann finally decides not to go back with her husband, Angel, because I really did not want her and Taylor to go their separate ways. Also, Lou Ann finally realizes that she doesn't need a man in her life to feel secure, and she can be secure with just herself. I did not like the part when Estevan and Esperanza went their separate ways because I was really hoping that Taylor would be able to have Estevan in her life; he really made her happy. I wanted to Taylor to fall in love at some point, and she did, with Estevan, but nothing happened. I really wouldn't change anything in the book because it had a good ending and it was realistic the way everything fell into place.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone to read for enjoyment. This would be a good book for any age group. Particularly, anyone who enjoys realistic adventures would like this book. All the love and excitement the book has makes it an exceptionally good novel."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Beans Trees is one big metaphor. It compares the beans trees which takes over everything to the people who took over the Mayans. The Mayans were a vast group of different peoples and languages. It was taken over by evil people. We did some research for my grade 10 class. We learned about those people who took over the Mayans and how they made the people move over and over. We learned from the book that they were tortured very badly. I loved the book but it was pitiful for Estevan and Esperanza"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"If you got a little tired reading the Poisonwood Bible, as I did, you'll be pleasantly surprised by this book. Don't get me wrong-- I really enjoyed Poisonwood, with its mix of engaging female narrators and insight into a foreign culture and history... this book has some of the same elements. Taylor, formerly known as Marietta, is a tough, smart, brash Southern gal with a great turn of phrase. She leaves Kentucky in a beat-up old car, driving West, and along the way, is literally handed a small Indian girl. She ends up caring for the girl, and settling in Tucson. There she moves in with another displaced Kentuckian (like Poisonwood, we get a few chapters from another character's pov, but unlike that book, most of the time we stay with Taylor) and finds a job in a bodyshop. There she meets some Guatamalan refugees...without giving any more away I will say that I had never given any thought to the plight of Guatamalan refugees, but the way Kingsolver drew them into the plot, quietly and gently, I ended up in tears more than once. There is a scene towards the end that truly had me bawling.I really enjoyed this book-- it was a fast read, hard to put down-- but it had substance, too. It wasn't just another light, fun, &quot;Southern woman finds herself&quot; sort of novel-- it had real depth, addressing issues of motherhood, family and connections-- as well as the specific issue of refugees (how can a person be &quot;illegal&quot; a person can be good or bad, but illegal? is typical of Taylor's thoughts-- and it made me stop and think, too). Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"What begins as a book about what seems to be a podunk small-town girl turns out to be an extradorindary tale of a woman's strength and the beauty of true love between parents and their children and between true friends."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"All of Kingsolver's books are great, but Bean Trees is really her best work.

Taylor really didn't want to have a baby because she was single woman and didn't think that she would be able to take care of her.Well later she found out that Turtle had been sexually abused and that she was a baby who needed a lot of attention.Taylor and Turtle made their home in Tucson Arizona.While they were living there they met a nice couple from Guatemala and they left Guatemala City so they would not be killed. Their names were Esperanza and Estevan.Turtle said her first word and it was bean. She was so glad that Turtle finally was opening up to the world and not scared anymore.After an incident in the park. Social Services came and told Taylor that she needed to go through the proper adopting procedures to be able to keep Turtle. She then went to the Cherokee Indian Reservation to see if she could find Turtles Aunt so that she could have permission to adopt her. She couldn't find her Aunt though. So she went to the adoption center and Esperanza and Estevan posed as her parents.

I would say Barbara Kingsolver falls into the latter category. She simply has a way with words but there is little in the way of suspense or even really a plot, for that matter, in her books. I don't think she tries to write page-turners; I think she tries to write books that make you think and appreciate the good things in life. You have to keep that in mind or you won't appreciate her books.The Bean Trees is a story of a young woman named Taylor who is intent on getting out of a hopeless situation in Kentucky. She decides to drive West until her car won't drive anymore to start a new life. Along the way she has a three-year-old American Indian girl basically thrust on to her. The girl has had a tough life and no future so she takes her with her and names her Turtle. They finally end up in Tucson, Arizona and now Taylor not only has to start anew but has to learn how to be a mother. In Tucson, Taylor and Turtle are taken in by some of neighborhood women and become a family.Nearly all of the primary characters in this book are women. They are quirky and flawed, but at the same time feisty and strong-willed. They each have their own personal demons to overcome and they help each other along the way. That is basically the premise of the book. I quickly discovered that I was reading a book about women for women. I don't think I am in the author's target audience (not that she has one) but I can appreciate Kingsolver's use of analogies and her allegorical writing style. It's hard to say that I really enjoyed the book, but Kingsolver has a way of writing paragraphs and even sentences that make you sit back and say, \\"that was pretty cool\\". That's the sign of a good author. I plan on reading the sequel, Pigs in Heaven."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"\\"Mama always said barefoot and pregnant was not my style.

With the many responsibilities that raising a child have on a single \\"mother\\", will Taylor cave in under the pressure?Barbara Kingsolver's THE BEAN TREES is filled with captivating, rich details that will entice even the least experienced readers.

She has no adoption papers, little money, and no idea of what's to come.She ends up in a Tucson, Arizona when her junker of a car finally gives up for good. After several failed attempts she lands herself a job working in a tire shop. She would never accept such a job because of her fear of exploding tires had it not been for the fact that she befriended the owner. She moves into a house with a new roommate and friend. Ironically it's right across the street from the tire shop.This book is about a young mother's struggles in life and the people who helped her through it all. It has a timeless quality that everyone can enjoy. The author's, Barbara Kingsolver's, descriptions make you feel like you are there witnessing the whole thing. She writes in an understandable, realistic way that makes you feel like Taylor is just an ordinary person that lives down the street.I really enjoyed this book and am currently reading the sequel, Pigs in Heaven.

The stranger makes it clear that either Taylor takes the baby, who \\"has no people,\\" or the baby will be in mortal danger. Taylor, a single woman who wants, more than anything on earth, to have no ties, accepts the little bundle, whom, for reasons explained in the book, she names \\"Turtle.\\"The rest of the story is absolutely quintessential Kingsolver: car trips through the Southwest in a ramshackle half-dead Volkswagon Beetle; a stranger than strange assortment of characters, male and female, who defy description; and at the heart, the growing love between the homeless little toddler Turtle and her reluctant \\"mother\\" Taylor.I cannot say enough about Kingsolver herself as an author, or about this book in particular.

When she ventured out with great ambition and a barely-working, cantankerous car, life took a whole different turn. Some woman at the Oklahoma Cherokee nation abandoned three-year-old, American Indian girl Turtle and Taylor, for the first time, met the complication of life. Upon arriving in Tucson, Arizona, Taylor realized she must come to terms with motherhood and settling down. She was hired by Mattie who owned the Jesus is Lord Tires Company and became roommates with Lou Ann, a woman divorced by her husband Angel. Taylor spent the first half of her life avoiding motherhood and tires, and later she counted them as blessings. The Bean Trees is a book of determination, compassion, and love. It's a quick read that will warm your heart and make you sniffle. Through raising Turtle, Taylor learned that she could never protect the child from the world. What would be interesting, maybe even in the long run, is to share her life with the kid and give Turtle her best effort. The Bean Trees is the first book I read written by Barbara Kingsolver.

I was commuting into NYC at that time, and I noticed that when I read this and laughed OUT LOUD on the subway, no one asked me for money. So, aside from being one of the best books I've ever read (read it seven times since), it also came in handy as a panhandler-deterrent.In fact, I loved this story so much, I was compelled to write to Barbara Kingsolver and- amazing- she wrote back to me. I still have the letter, tucked away into my like-new, shiny hardcover anniversary edition. The original paperback is falling apart, but I refuse to throw it out. I just fell in love with Taylor and Turtle, not to mention the supporting characters, such as Mattie and Taylor's mom. The story is just paced so well, and the characters become people you know and love. Anyone who knows me knows how much I love to read, and they often ask for reading suggestions. This book is ALWAYS on the top of the list. Some others that have since become favorites are Charms for the Easy Life by Kaye Gibbons (it's &quot;swell&quot;), Plainsong by Kent Haruf, and Animal Dreams, also by Kingsolver. All are simple but intense studies of what it means to love and be human. Classic &quot;stranded on a desert island&quot; kind of stories."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"When I looked at the book jacket for \\"The Bean Trees,\\" it gushed about how the novel has become must-reading in colleges and high schools. S ince I have a kid in high school, I thought I'd check it out.My response is: What's the big deal about this book? Who decided that it's great?It's okay, but it's hardly memorable. The plot is standard-issue stuff, and it's even a little preposterous for the type of novel that's clearly aiming to feel \\"real.\\" I mean, you've got a girl from rural Kentucky who's not smarter than anyone else but somehow figures out how to not get pregnant as a high schooler and to leave her hometown as a teen, with her mother's blessing, just to find her way in the world. She winds up a few weeks later in Tucson, AZ, with a mute Indian child. And there she befriends both a woman who helps illegal immigrants find haven in the US and another another single mother from the next county in Kentucky. The rest of the book chronicles their daily/weekly lives together as they build bonds, find jobs, and basically muddle through life. They face minimal truamas that are essentially solved in a few minutes or days, and things turn out reasonably well in the end.There are great books that have lesser plots, but they are written much more beautifully and evocatively. There are great books that have much better plots, but aren't written much better. But this book doesn't rise to the occasion on either angle. Furthermore, unlike realist novels by Upton Sinclair or John Steinbeck or even Ayn Rand (none of whom is really known for turning a phrase), for example, this book lacks real \\"ooomph\\" in its treatment of society's ills. That's why I ask why it's a big deal.Sadly, the book actually gets worse as it moves along. The protagonist's early experiences are much more interesting than her life in Tuscon. In Tucson, many of her encounters read literally like an informational pamphlet, such as the conversations with attorneys about how to adopt a kid. The book really feels like it's trying to educate high schoolers about stuff like immigrants, adoption, and pregnancy ---- as if they haven't heard this stuff on TV or in their classes.So, kids, if you're assigned the book, don't worry. You'll \\"get\\" its obvious points very easy. And adults, if you a \\"modern classic\\" to buzz through, go ahead and read this.

Our protagonist refuses to succumb to this future, and finds work in a hospital, saving up enough money to buy a broken-down VW bug that has no windows and requires a special procedure to start. She decides to leave her dump town and drive across the United States without ever looking back.In central Oklahoma her car breaks down, prompting Taylor to stop at a shabby diner. On her way out, the most curious thing happens to her: she's given a Native American baby.Stuck in the middle of nowhere with a baby that isn't hers, Taylor has no choice but to take the child and keep on moving. Taylor and Turtle, as she eventually names the baby, end up in Tuscon, Arizona, where they meet Mattie, owner of a tire/repair garage that functions as a front for a modern-day Underground Railroad, and Lou Ann, a young mother with troubles of her own.Usually I'm not the biggest fan of vernacular or writers who write first-person and give their characters all sorts of cute, homey, country-ish slang and drawls. It just wears on me and I get tired of it. However Kingsolver made Taylor, the book's narrator, refreshing and easy to read for even myself, and instead of getting annoyed at Taylor, I enjoyed her voice.The Bean Trees might seem to be just another \\"journey-to-find-yourself\\" book what with Taylor's drive across America and meeting of new friends, but it also deals with some serious subjects. Something happened to Turtle a long time ago, something bad and unspeakable, and contributes to the child's dead, staring eyes and inability to make contact or respond to normal human interaction in the first few weeks that Taylor has her. In Arizona, Taylor meets Estevan and Esperanza, two refugees who barely escaped from their native Guatemala to Mattie's safe house.I have read The Poisonwood Bible before and know that Kingsolver is a pretty big name in modern American literature, but I had no idea The Bean Trees was her first novel until after I finished reading it. Good one to start out with."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees is such a beautiful story. It is both elegant and engaging, and when I finished, I felt richer for having read it. The story itself is interesting, and the characters--most notably Taylor Greer and her de facto daughter Turtle--are round and real. The opening lines are memorable for their unexpected humor: \\"I have been afraid of putting air in a tire ever since I saw a tractor tire blow up and throw Newt Hardbine's father over the top of the Standard Oil Sign. I'm not lying. He got stuck up there.\\"Marietta Greer leaves small town, Kentucky to escape the possibility of ending up like all her classmates: barefoot, pregnant, and trapped. She promises herself that she won't end up with a baby and that she'll make something of herself. She will be independent. Well, she ends up with someone else's baby, and the baby makes something of her. And she doesn't quite make independent; she has to learn that she has to depend on others sometimes, and she has to learn whom to depend on.Marietta starts off by getting in her jalopy and heading west. On the trip, she changes her name to Taylor, after the town where she finally runs out of gas. Taylorville is also where she picks up Turtle, her baby. A Cherokee woman hands the girl to Taylor; the woman says that the child is in danger and has already been hurt, and she can't care for her. So Taylor takes the baby--a responsibility she has no idea how to deal with--and continues on her trip.Taylor and her newly acquired daughter finally light in Tucson. There, Taylor faces lessons she set out to escape: how to be a mother, how to be friends and accept friendship, how to be a family, and the importance of putting down roots. Taylor finds friends in unexpected places, including a local used tire shop, where serendipity leads her not only to new tires but to a job and a friend and mentor in the owner, Mattie. She also finds support and friendship in her roommate Lou Ann, another new mother struggling to find her role in the world. When Taylor learns that she'll have to fight to keep Turtle--for whom she now feels like a true mother--Mattie, Lou Ann, and the others she's befriended in Tucson are by her side.The Bean Trees grabbed me from the first page, and kept me intrigued until the end. I loved the language, the people, and the story. It was definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Kingsolver's earliest, and one more jewel in her sparkling crown. I know I can pick up anything she's written and get high-quality writing and crystal clear characters. This meets those expectations well. Taylor grows up in small town Kentucky, and escapes to Tucson where her shabby vehicle ends up forcing her to stay. Along the way, she takes infant Turtle into her life in a very unexpected way. Once in Tucson, she is fortunate enough to find Mattie and Lou Ann and several others who come to matter greatly in her life. As a character, Taylor is real, clear, wonderfully written, and easy to relate to. Even the secondary characters are well developed. Mattie is a treasure, Lou Ann, an invaluable peer, sister-like. In Kingsolver's sure hand, even little Turtle is believably and lucidly drawn. The down-home aphorisms and expressions are priceless in several characters' mouths. A treat and a pleasure. I was glad I read it and think you will be, too."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was assigned this book in my college English class.

It is well written with dialogue that is perfect for the characters portrayed. I enjoyed the snappy repartee and colloquialisms; they reminded me of some of my grandmother's sayings. The characters are rich and memorable. However, with that said, there just isn't enough of either the dialogue or characters to carry the story. The plot is very thin.There is certainly a slight agenda with this book, but the way it is written into the story allows for it without it becoming the story itself.I have also read Animal Dreams and I know that Kingsolver gets better as her writings continued. I will continue to read more or her works."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Not a bad read, but kind of pointless. Good characters, but it left me feeling like I wanted more of a story..."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Barbara Kingsolver became a household name with her publication of the Oprah book club bestseller The Poisonwood Bible. Yet Kingsolver had been writing and authoring great novels long before she was discovered by Oprah. The Bean Tree is one of many works by Kingsolver that highlight her talent for dialogue, emotion, and plot. In this story, she puts a twist on the coming-of-age tale of a young girl heading out her own to find her own way.The Bean Tree also tackles racism, classism, immigration, and love. Romantic love, yes, but also the love women feel for each other. The love of a mother for a child. The love of a woman for humanity. Kingsolver approaches these issues under the veil of an ordinary life. As her characters simply go about their day-to-day lives, they experience the profundities of existence. And as we read about her characters and their lives, we also realize how profound our own ordinary lives might also be."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I enjoyed this book. I thought it was a fun read while also displaying some skilled plot structure and thematic development. Kingsolver's characters are like people you know, and you find yourself truly wanting them to be happy. I thought that Taylor's getting saddled with Turtle so early in her quest to escape teenage motherhood made an interesting statement about how people cannot change who they are, despite their efforts to run away from their lives. That, and that chance attachments are often the most important of our lives.Pretty funny, pretty touching, pretty good read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is the first time an author has grabbed my interest in such an emotional way that I'm almost impatient for her next book.

And light was what I got with this book. This is the sort of novel that takes no more than two hours to read, and once you finish it, it will probably be cast totally from your reading memory. It is nothing highly special or new, yet it is a fun and attention capturing read, but hardly material you would think to return to. It reminded me of Oprah's now famous 'Where the Heart is', although I prefered this one significantly more. It, like Where the Heart, is the story of a Southern American women, highly uneducated, somewhat lumped with a child, travelling and eventually finding a place to call home. An educated man, driven from society takes both character's interest, with differed results of the success of the character's wooing abilities. I felt that where this novel was a success was the writing ability of the author, and the compassion that seeped into what could have been, a totally simplistic and stale story. Yet, Kingsolver, a writer with immense potential, made this story hugely heart warming, the characters naive, but innocently so, as opposed to annoyingly stupid. Perhaps a better book for young adult readers, but still interesting for the majority."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"About a year ago, I read _The Bean Trees_ in a few short hours and was left amazed. In so many ways I found myself sticking up for Taylor, when I wasn't identifying with her. She is a strong woman without being some sort of overly symbolic feminist stereotype for the 90s. LouAnn was absolutely hysterical in that neurotic, Woman's Day-reading, cellulite cream-buying, housewife way, even if her character was a bit overdone. I especially loved the subplot involving Esteban &amp; Esperanza. I wanted to hold that frail little woman in my arms and sing her lullabies in Spanish, yet I found myself jumping on Taylor's bandwagon, wanting to hurt silently and subtly along with her in her little crush on Esteban. I could go on and on, but I'll be nice and refrain from doing so. All in all, I think this is a beautiful story, and I love that it's assigned to classes to read!So many people slam Barbara Kingsolver for being unrealistic, feminist, overly political and boring. It's their loss, I guess. I'm not a feminist, nor am I over political or boring. So maybe I'm a little unrealistic - where's the harm in that?

I am Frrrr"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees is an excellent book to read just because it shows what life is really like in this crazy world. I was expecting this book to be one of those long, boring, have-to-do for English class books, but the Bean Trees was just the opposite of that. The first part of the book was not the usual describe everything at once beginning that most people expect. The Bean Trees was interesting because not everyone was decirbed at first through the normal means, showing the character's appearance, but was described by telling an event in a character's life.The plot was first started with main character, and then it switched to the main supporting character. By the author switching back and forth between the two characters you can get a sense that their paths will cross at some time in the story. The paths of these two have changed greatly by the time that they do meet each other. At the beginning, you expect some thing to happen later in the story, which is true but it is changed just a little from your prediction.Throughout the story the themes of family, and a the political theme continue to mix many time sin the story. The family theme in this book is the main one by showing that strangers can become family. The political theme is showing us, the ignorant, know nothing of the happenings in foreign countries like the Guatemalan killings.The main character, Taylor Greer, is a poor girl from Kentucky at gets away from her little town in Kentucky. She is naturally independent by the way that her single mother raised her. When Taylor bought a car, she had been taught by her mother to fix a car if she ever needed to do so. The main supporting character is Lou Ann. She is not very confident in herself and has a low self-esteem. Lou Ann is this way because of the way her husband treated her after they were married, and moved to Arizona to live. Lou Ann becomes more independent after she and Taylor meet. These two when they meet have children; Lou Ann has Dwayne Ray, her son, and Taylor has Turtle, her adopted daughter. Taylor got Turtle by some lady in a bar giving Turtle to her there.The author's style is not the normal style of the most of the books I have read, like Tale of Two Cities. The story is not what keeps you attracted to the story it is the extended metaphors and similes, and the other various ways to describe some thing."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Shipping was average, which is a good thing.

Later on Taylor finds out the girl was physically abused and named the child Turtle after the way she clings on to everything like a snapping turtle. Taylor ends up in Tucson, Arizona where she meets up with a tough strange lady named Mattie who deals with illegal immigrants, a paranoid and self conscious mother Lou Ann who thinks there is nothing safe in the world, and Esparza and Esperanza, a Guatemalan couple, that help Taylor find out who she really is.

On her way to her new adventure Taylor is given a 3 year old child, who she names Turtle, and has no other option but including her into her life. This heartfelt novel tells the story of Taylor and Turtle as they grow and evolve their lives over time in a tire shop located in Tuscon, Arizona. Reading this book made me both tear and smile from its unexpected turns and captivating adventures. As piece of literature for all age groups to relate to, it is impossible to put it down. I recommend this novel to anyone in search of an entertaining story."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"An early offering, Bean Trees is an often overlooked Kingsolver work but, like her other novels, it is peopled with unforgettable characters that stay with you long after you have replaced the book on the shelf."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Kingsolver's \\"Bean Trees\\" presents the story of a young woman, Taylor, who is hellbent on getting out of Appalachia and making something of her life. All her life she had staved off the \\"disease\\" that affected her peers, teenage pregnancy, but soon finds herself the default caretaker of a neglected and abused Indian (errr, Native American) girl. Throughout the novel, the trials and tribulations of this reluctant mother and the other cast of characters is explored.Undoubtedly, one of Kingsolver's main motivations was to elicit sympathy for illegal immigrants, as Estevan and Esperanaza are portrayed sympathetically (and justifiably so) as recent (illegal) immigrants from a war-torn Guatamala. Mattie, a tire store owner in Tucson who helps illegals to find sanctuary, is portrayed as the hero. It is she who helps Taylor when she first arrives in Tucson with child in hand. It is she who helps to run illegals between different sanctuaries, and it is she who is portrayed as the most knowledgeable and compassionate of all the characters. However, Kingsolver does not come with a \\"holier than thou\\" approach toward illegals, for she doesn't condemn those who are against illegals as cold-hearted but merely portrays them as ignorant. It seems to follow that if they knew some of their true stories, then they would change their ways.Of course, those illegals that Mattie does help are actually refugees. I can't say how many of the illegals in the 1980s, when this book was written, were refugees, but certainly today the lion share of the illegals are those looking for work to earn money and not escaping from persecution back home. Furthermore, unlike her portrayal in the book, most of the illegals today are victims of the unscrupulous \\"coyotes\\" who view them as dispensable human cargo. Although I may disagree with Kingsolver's premise about illegals, I will say that I do have sympathy toward them and certainly do understand their desire to live a better life, if not for them then for their children.Kingsolver also explores the roles of women in their family, particularly single mothers, namely Taylor and her Kentucky counterpart, LuAnn. Their life is not glamorized, and are shown in their gritty, raw form. LuAnn, the constant worrier and the classic example of low self-esteem after her husband leaves her, makes a perfect complement to Taylor. Through trials and determination they eventually succeed in carving out a content life for themselves.Overall, \\"Bean Trees\\" is an insightful, interesting story and keeps one's interest. I certainly wasn't in the target demographic, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Although you may disagree with Kingsolver's central premise, it is a well-written and entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I loved this book.

The Bean Trees deals with issues of race and motherhood when a young white woman takes in an Indian child as her own. The main characters in this story are, Taylor a spirited young woman. Turtle a neglected little Indian baby. Lou Ann, Taylor's best friend. Maddie, Taylor's employer, she also houses illegal immigrants. Esparanza and Estavon, two of Maddie's \\"friends.\\"The main characters are all fighting for freedom and ownership. They all form bonds along the way, thus they help each other by whatever means possible. The characters are always running into problems along the way. For instance, trying to get away with breaking the law, working odd jobs, and just trying to maintain a decent life. Not only do they run into problems, they share many adventures of the perfect life. They do lots of traveling and meet new people along the way, some they always remember and others they will want to forget.I have two favorite characters. The first is Taylor. I like her because she is a young and unpredictable woman trying to raise a little girl all on her own. My second favorite character is Turtle. I like her because she is quiet and mesmerizing. On a personal basis I feel that I relate to these characters through their emotions. I did enjoy the book very much. I found it to be very entertaining, always full of excitement. My favorite part of the book was when Taylor legally adopted Turtle. It was such a long and anticipated wait, and when it finely came, I was overjoyed. The only thing I would change is the beginning because it starts off kind of slow. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read because readers will get a lot out of it.

It was sort of patronizing, promoting a stereotype that Indians are alcoholics who don't pay attention to their kids, and that those kids are better off with someone else.

The Bean Trees is a disturbing look at the daily life of poor southern people. It paints the perfect picture of the stereotype of the urban hillbilly. This fades away when the main character decides to leave for a new life, she changes her name, is handed a baby, and makes fun of native americans and old sick people. When she finally arrives in New Mexico, the feminist side of the book begins to shine. Taylor houses with a woman who compared her ex-husband's amputed leg to the male genetalia(I think you know what I mean). During her stay, the next-door neighbor, an old woman stuck in her ways, makes fun of illegal immigrants. Nice lady, really she was. Anyway Taylor wants to have an affair and they all end up going someplace, I won't tell you where, but it ends poorly and is not nearly brought together like it could have been.

Now, I can't say I have read a ton of books, but I have read enough to say that you'd be better off not reading this one. That is, of course, unless you like being bored.One thing I did not like about the novel was it's depiction of Tucson. The author makes it out to be a nice place, where I, a native Tucsonian, whould describe it as a barren wasteland. Even though the auther lives in Tucson also, I would still have to disagree with her perception.Also, I found the author's fascination with a certain part of the male anatomy (I'm not sure if it would be appropriate to name it) particularly insulting. Almost every other object in the book had to do with either that or sexual intercourse. She even compared a man's amputated leg to that body part.Another one of the things I found boring about this novel was that there were too many insignificant characters and scenes. If I summarized the book into the important parts, about five characters (out of about 23 that I can remember) and one scene in Tucson, the main setting of the book, would show up. Besides, one of those characters only says names of vegetables. Even Lou Ann, one of the main characters, does not have much purpose in the novel as a whole.In my opinion, it was basicly a slugish book following the main character as she hopped over some minor hurdles in life. It has no entertainment value whatsoever, and you get nothing out of it. However, it was short and easy to read for class.

He then shows her x-rays where the child has had multiple fractures from abuse. The book has no wisdom, except for the proper English spoken by the Mayan teacher and what does Taylor do, but thinks she's in love with him, when his wife is along with him. This was just sad. This Kentucky hillbilly character is sarcastic and rude, and too lazy to get a starter in her car, so she doesn't have to push it.

If she even had considered giving the child to the proper authorities I might have found it somewhat believable. If this did appear in the book it was soo brief to have escaped my notice. This issue somehow permeated my thoughts while reading the book and for that reason I couldn't involve myself to the greatest extent.Her writing style is interesting and poetic but give me a break.

Through her experiences with her new child and the people she encounters in Tuscon, Taylor grows as a person and begins to have a better understanding of the way life works. The symbolism and prosaic style of writing that Kingsolver utilizes in her novel make it a book that's hard to put down and easy to fall in love with. Her witty characters and realistic situations make her writing easy to relate to, and give the reader a sense of connection with the novel's characters. It is a truly excellent novel about growing up and finding yourself, and accepting what you find."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I feel that The Bean Trees is a very interesting and well written book. The plot was pretty good and very realistic. Although the theme didn't appeal to me. Possibly because I'm not into politics and I don't pay attention to the government. The characters in the story were extremely realistic and made the story a whole lot better. Another high point in the story is the authors style. Barbara Kingsolver did a nice job working her style, using similes, hyperboles, and metaphors, into the book. With all the things the author uses put together it makes the story a lot more interesting. The idea of a young lady trying to make it on her own then getting basically stuck with a child was a good plot for this story. Taylor wanted to be independent and she left her hometown in Kansas to go on her own. It was hard enough by herself, but when she got stuck with a kid it made things harder on her. After she received Turtle she had to find ways to support them and people to take care of Turtle. Taylor has no choice really but to be cheap and take her daughter to a day care in the mall for people shopping. While she is at work. After you have read this story, you can think of how realistic this plot is. People struggle everyday taking care of kids and this book shows the problems people face in that situation in a very realistic way. Their are two themes brought up in the story. The family theme in the story, is the way Taylor and Lou Ann work together as a unit to get through their everyday problems they face. Lou Ann would stay home during the day and watch the kids while Taylor would work and then she would come home and make dinner. Another theme is the political theme brought up, which is the idea of refugees coming over from Guatemala and the way Americans help them to survive in our country. I didn't care too much for this theme, basically because I am uneducated about political topics. So it did not appeal to my liking. The way Kingsolver described the characters made the story a lot better. The characters were realistic and were described very well. Taylor is a hard worker, she was also very determined. She wouldn't give up Turtle to the government; she refused to let them take her. She was also looking for adventure. She took off from home in a beat up old volkswagon that barely runs and have to push to get started. Another main character was Lou Ann. She was very dependent, and she showed that by the way she couldn't really function correctly without angel around. Lou Ann also counted on Taylor for support. Towards the end of the story though Lou Ann changes by the way she gains more self-esteem. She likes herself more, and she even gets a new boyfriend. Mattie was is also a character that Kingsolver described well. Mattie is very helpful and loving. She helps the refugees and gets them to safety and food. She hired Taylor who was poor and gave her a new start. The authors style plays a big part in the way the story is looked at by people who read it. She uses her style by using metaphors, similes, and hyperboles. Barbara Kingsolver is an extremely good at putting little comparisons in the story. She uses a song sparrow to compare to Turtle. How it is little and weak and the bird clings to the screen; it is able to escape from the house. Turtle is like it because she clings to things and is small, but the comparison shows good things are to come when it escapes for it and Turtle. Another comparison is made when they see the cereus plant bloom. It shows good to come for all the characters Lou Ann and Taylor. Eventually good does come. Taylor finds a way to get Turtle to be her own legal daughter. Lou Ann also gets her life straight and is not depressed any more. A simile that is used in the story is when Taylor is describing her old high school. \\"Believe me in those days girls were dropping by the wayside like seeds off a poppy seed bun and you learned to look at everyday as a prize. At the end I felt that this book was really good, and had a great story line to it and I would recommend you read it. The plot, theme, characters, and authors style it made the story very good."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees is about a women who has lived all her life in a small town in KY and finally gets fed up and heads west. IN OK she finds a surprise that now completely will alter her life. Taylor(Missy) had spent her life avioding pergnancy and now she had a kid and was all alone. This book is a must read. It brings up political issues that divid the nation.

Everyone in the extended family created by chance learns something new, and grows in some way. Kingsolver uses the pervasive metaphor of the bean trees and other plants to strongly develop the theme. Especially delightful is Turtle, who begins life as an abused child in a practically catatonic state, but ends the book as a vibrant child who thrives on the love of her family. This book raises many moral and ethical questions, centering around the painful experiences of Estevan and Esperenza (Spanish for hope), the illegal immigrants, who fled tyrany in their native country. Overwhelmingly positive, Kingsolver uses lush description and has a good grasp of everyday life for her characters. She is a brillia"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Not sure what to expect from this book (I knew nothing about it), I was pleasantly surprised. Well-written, like Jackson McCrae's THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD and yet earthy like Steinbeck's EAST OF EDEN, this first novel by Kingsolver came highly recommended by a friend of mine whose book club read it. I won't go into the story here as others have done that already, but suffice it to say that you won't be disappointed in this tale. It wasn't that fast-moving at first, but it picked up steam as I read and by the end I was thoroughly hooked!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Wow. Some of you out there may have only been introduced to Kingsolver with the Poisonwood Bible. An important book, but not a happy one. I like my fiction to have some happiness in it. If I wanted absolute misery, I'd turn on the news. That's why I love this book. I'm not one to give away the plot, but let's just say that our protagonist is presented with a number of challenges. Her biggest challenge is doing something selfless to help somebody else. If you want to renew your faith in humanity, I strongly suggest this book. I'd also suggest Prodigal Summer (also Kingsolver), We are in Love (Harry Connick, Jr.), Practical Magic (Alice Hoffman), any of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels (because if you can have her life and still be upbeat, that's spirit), a web musician named Anna Madorsky, and The Absence of Nectar (I've forgotten the author's name, but it's an amazing book)."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Barbara Kingsolver writes a touching story about an abandoned and abused Indian girl who finds a mother in a young Kentucky native named Taylor. A tale that descriptively depicts the hardships of a young mother and her struggle to connect with the daughter. The author does an incredible job of piecing together the story with ingenious themes and symbols. It is a novel to remember for its wonderful descriptions and genuine emotion. Through sacrifices and love, Taylor is able to nurture Turtle into a lively child that is like a bean tree with rhizobia. As Taylor says &quot;The wisteria vines on their own would just barely get by, but put them together with rhizobia and they make miracles&quot; (228)"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This a pleasant story, told with warmth, humor, and humanity. I found it far from gripping, but enjoyed it well enough, and appreciated the clever ending. In reading other reviews (especially those at Amazon), I'm struck by the extremes of opinion -- some loved it, while others clearly loathed it. Among readers of the latter category are students who were required to read it in 6th and 7th grade English classes. In my view, this is not a book for children; they lack the maturity to appreciate the adult themes. Others seem to object to the strong female characters, and the sympathy given to the illegal Guatamalan immigrants. To my mind, those were positive attributes of the book. C'est la vie"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's women are never dull -- they are rich, multi-faceted, conflicted people with strong character and deep feeling. They also usually face seemingly impossible situations that are, nonetheless, entirely believable. These are the records of days that make up the lives of real women, but somehow when Kingsolver writes of them, they become something more than a chronicle of common lives. She is a magical storyteller.I absolutely loved this book, in part because I spent years working in tribal offices in southwestern Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, eastern Arizona, and western Oklahoma. Anyone who finds the story of Turtle unbelievable just has no clue what life is really like for our First Peoples. The romanticized pablum served up by dances with various animals and riding the plains, etc. is just a fairy tale like Hansel and Gretel or Snow White. Actually, it's probably MUCH more cruel because people don't believe the Grimm tales, but the First Peoples movie- and TV-myths are accepted without critical thought. I wonder why?!At any rate, I was entranced by the stories of Taylor and Turtle, LouAnn and Dwayne Ray, Poppie and Edna, Esteban and Esperanza, and the myriad fragile souls all trying to live the best way they know how -- even Angel, the broken cowboy of LouAnn's dreams is sympathetic despite his desertion of her and his infant son. Nobody has it easy, and everyone is trying to find their right place in a hard, harsh world.The moments of beauty in the novel are amazing, and they truly underscore the moments of beauty and grace in life -- the night blooming cereus, the meteor shower that wasn't, Hope's happiness, Turtle's laugh, purple beans, Lake of the Ozarks.Kingsolver reminds us that there are moments of transcendent happiness even in moments of the bleakest pain, and life IS worth living even if it is hard, cruel, tough, or just ordinary. It's the small moments of great joy that make it all worth it."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees is a poignant and gripping story about belonging, motherhood and the creation of family in unexpected places. It all begins when Marietta Greer, the feisty protagonist and narrator, leaves her rural Kentucky town in search of a better life. She spends what little money she has on a rickety 1955 VW Beetle and heads west on her own, leaving everything behind, including her name. After the old rattletrap runs out of gas in Taylorville, Illinois, she becomes Taylor.A chance encounter at a roadside diner in Oklahoma's Cherokee Nation alters Taylor's life forever. She is about to head back onto the highway when a distressed woman taps on her windshield and places a bundled infant into the passenger seat. Without fully realizing the implications of what is happening, Taylor agrees to take the woman's dead sister's child, a Cherokee toddler whose age is described as \\"somewhere between a baby and a person.\\" Since there is no paperwork documenting the child, no record of her name, age or parents, the only clues into her past are the extensive bruises that seem to indicate prior sexual and physical abuse. Taylor now finds herself facing the prospect of a complicated single motherhood without a job, housing, family or friends. She names the girl Turtle because of her strong grip, for \\"if a mud turtle bites you, it won't let go till it thunders.\\"None of the people Taylor meets along her journey are related to her biologically. Yet the support they provide and the extent of their interdependence are not unlike the functions performed in the traditional nuclear family concept. Taylor discovers that individualism and independence turn out to be ideals that must be tempered with collectivism and shared responsibility. In order to make ends meet, she and her rommate Lou Ann share living expenses and childcare duties. Their neighbor, Virgie Mae Parsons, helps to take care of a blind woman named Edna Poppy who in turn provides occasional childcare for Turtle. Taylor works at the tire shop owned by Mattie, who provides a sanctuary for Central American refugees including Estevan and Esperanza, who both end up playing indispensable roles in the story's outcome.I simply loved this book. The writing was evocative, the characters were complex and the themes were layered and nuanced. Although the book certainly has strong sociological, political and feminist undertones, you don't have be a liberal, a social worker or an immigration activist to appreciate the beauty of the story. The Bean Trees is not driven by a narrow ideological agenda or cause. People from a variety of political viewpoints should be able to see their values reflected in its pages: responsibility, family, justice, advocacy, compassion and faith. The central character of Taylor is a heroine of universal appeal. She is free-spirited, self-aware, vulnerable and witty all at the same time. Her courage, determination, adaptability and sense of humor are all qualities I found inspirational and uplifting.Kingsolver does not allow her readers to settle for simplistic explanations of complex situations. Many of her character defy labels and stereotypes. Taylor's young single motherhood was not the result of irresponsible sexual behavior; it was her choice to accept a baby as it was given to her. Lou Ann's abusive husband, Angel, is not a psychotic villain, but an ordinary man struggling to get back on his feet after a debilitating accident. Mattie, a the woman who owns \`Jesus Is Lord Tires,' is not a fundamentalist fanatic, but a devoted advocate for human rights in the sanctuary movement. As undocumented immigrants, Estevan and Esperanza are not delinquents or threats to society; they are sophisticated agents of reconciliation and empowerment.Kingsolver's cast of characters confirms my belief in social interconnectedness where a seemingly insignificant choice made by one person can have a ripple effect that indirectly enhances or threatens the well-being of another person or group of people in another part of the world. No one is an island and no one is truly \\"self-made.\\" An honest look at the human condition should reveal that people do not succeed in complete isolation from others. In contrast to the surrounding culture of individualism, competition and personal recognition, the world of Taylor and Turtle is a place where no one can \\"make it\\" purely on their own. When one member of the community rejoices, it is a victory for the whole group. When one member is suffering, the others are affected too. Mutuality and interdependence are what make the difference between thriving and just getting by."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am going into Freshman Advanced Language Arts next year and one of the required books to read is The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver. I have read this book this semester instead of over the summer. I liked the book, but not a whole lot. Kingsolver is a wonderful author who is very descriptive in her writing. The book had an overall great theme with a good story to tell. However, maybe it was just my eighth grade mind not understanding the work, it was really hard to follow. There were some adult themes that were hard to understand, and at one point in the book two different stories are being told on alternate chapters. Not helping to it being hard to follow, was the fact that there was so much detail. It was unbelievable! A great author has just enough detail to paint the good image in your mind. Kingsolver has, dare I say it, too much detail. It made it very hard to remember what was going on in the first place during the book. Overall, it was an ok book that I'm sure kids would hate and adults would enjoy.Rating: C+"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The novel The Bean Trees Is an excellent story written by a very capable author.

I also read a review saying this book is too sexual, well let me tell you this right now if this book was too profane on sex for that person they must get offended very easily. The author seemed to show great dislike in pornography. Several times in this book she makes negative remarks on a local porn shop by the main characters job. This story is a wonderful tale of a young, explorious women who leaves her small town for adventure.

Friends couldn't understand why I hadn't already discovered the loving quality of her writing, but I'm hooked now. Last weekend I had to do some travelling, so took along &quot;Bean Trees&quot; for the flights. I laughed and laughed and rolled my eyes and just marvelled at her gentle, but probing, irony, her insight into those large and little cruelties that all of us share in life, and her straight-on, look-you-in-the-eye attitude about just how you have to deal with the next day. This is an easy read but is in no way a small book. I was there with Taylor in Oklahoma, I wept for her for the burden of the abandoned child that she so lovingly accepted, I wanted to meet Mattie right then(!), and I missed the desert that I loved, just because she reminded me of its power just as if she'd been talking next to me. If you don't know, or aren't sure about Kingsolver, borrow a copy of her &quot;Animal Dreams&quot;. Read the two pages that make up the chapter &quot;The Flood&quot;.

This novel is about a girl named Taylor who grew up poor with goals of graduating without getting pregnant and getting out of Kentucky. Once she heads west, she ends up with a 3-year-old baby, who she later names Turtle. From the fear of getting pregnant, Taylor still ends up with a baby and has to manage taking care of herself and Turtle. Along the way in Arizona, Taylor meets Mattie who helps her settle down and lets her get a job in a tire company and also meets Lou Ann who takes Taylor and Turtle into her home with her baby Dwayne Ray. I would recommend this book to all people that like to read fiction or that would like to read about a girls struggle and how she learned along the way.One strength of the book is its plot. It is written in a way that you would have questions but wouldn't be answered until the end of the book. It wouldn't want to let you put down the book. You would want to keep reading until you find your answers. The book is telling new stories every time and it gets interesting every time.Another reason why is because the language and great imagery. It is written in the 70s and 80s style. It's understandable because it's like the way we talk.\\"All of the baby's clothes were too big, with sleeves rolled up and shirt tails wrapped around, and everything wet as mud boots and as hard to get off. There was a bruise twice the size of my thumb on its inner arm. I threw the soggy shirt in the sink to soak...I hadn't any sooner gotten the hands pried loose from my fingers before they grabbed onto my shirtsleeves and my hair. When I pulled off the pants and the diapers there were more bruises.\\"This is a piece from the book. It's one of my favorite quote from the book. It explains when Taylor gets Turtle and she is taking Turtle a shower and Taylor experienced that Turtle was beaten by her former family, which was her aunt and uncle.Its theme is its o.k. to try new things even though you didn't want them at first. It might turn out good. There are lots of things that happen but they always turn out good at the end. Don't ever doubt what you do because it could be a good thing at the end and through the process, you'll learn new things that could help you in life.The Bean Trees was a very good novel. I would recommend this book to all who like to read love stories, mysterious novels, and those who love to read fictional novels."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees is a superbly crafted story of a young woman raised in a small Kentucky town. Upon finishing high school, Taylor sets out on a cross-country journey that lands her in Arizona. In route, she stops at a bar and encounters a woman who abandons her daughter on the seat of Taylor's car. Once in Arizona, Taylor is befriended by a woman who owns a tire repair shop that doubles as a safe haven for persecuted refugees. As Taylor searches out a life for herself and newly acquired daughter, she meets a host of people who serve as mentor, family and friend. She also begins to see the world from a perspective beyond that provided in small-town Kentucky. Through this lens, Taylor is able to see that people are connected by common experiences - different magnitudes, but common none the less - and that this commonality is the glue that keeps us connected.Kingsolver has created a set of characters that give life and credibility to the novel. Her story telling ability is as creative as her writing. A master of the metaphor and a skilled technician with language, Kingsolver has written a coming-of-age story that differentiates itself with a focused critique of human rights violations and Immigration policy. A mature novel filled with wisdom and compassion; nature and nurture. After reading The Poisonwood Bible, I didn't think that any of her other work would measure up. The Bean Trees did.

As a matter of fact so many people have told me to read her and she has been on so many reading lists that I did not want to read her. But I yesterday I found THE BEAN TREES on the bargain table and figured what the heck, it was really inexpensive.I am so happy now that I have read this book. Kingsolver tells a wonderful story about love. About the love a person feels for friends, family and children even when the children are not biologically their own.Taylor Greer is a woman who has taken her life into her own hands. She managed to escape the fate of most of her contemporaries in her rural, Kentucky town. She was able to reach adulthood without becoming barefoot and pregnant. She saved money, bought a car and headed west. Free at last. Then fate stepped in a two year old girl was left in the front seat of her car.I am actually glad that I waited so long to pick up a book by Kingsolver because now I have so many books of hers to look forward to reading."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I must say that before I even opened up to the first page of this book, I already had thought that it would be another incredibly boring novel that I couldn't relate too. Later my opinion was swayed after I found myself more and more involved in it. One of the most positive things about reading a story for and English Class it that you discuss and scrutinize the novel with other classmates and there fore understand more about the author's style and ideas. A short summary of the book reveals that a main character, Missy, later known as Taylor, is not satisfied with her current life style in Kentucky. She leaves there and sets out to go as far as her 1955 Beetle can take her. On her journey she unexpectedly had a small baby thrust upon her. While all this is taking place, another main character, Lou Ann, is having her own troubles. Her and her husband have fallen apart while Lou Ann is pregnant with her first child. From there the two characters develop as the book transpires. If you do choose to read this book you will get to find out about many of the other characters that they meet on the way and how they affect each other's lives. What many people might over look is that Kingsolver's novels also have political ideas in the theme that surface throughout the book. When picking up on these messages you often find yourself thinking about your life and the environment that surrounds you. She uses her books to stress key political problems and to help us pick up on ideas we wouldn't ordinarily think about. As far as character's go Lou Ann starts off with a low self-esteem and very unsure of herself. But later on she takes a dramatic turn with her new job. Taylor on the other hand is very determined, she knows what she doesn't want but doesn't know what she wants. She is very direct and doesn't beat around the bush. Kingsolver has a very unique style to her writing. She doesn't go into long paragraphs describing the setting and scenery. She lets the image come to you through dialogue and short descriptions. She is very realistic and writes everything how it would be in reality. This is good because it is easier to relate too. She also uses extended metaphors and similes to help better understand the story and which all ties in with the whole political idea. Quotes from her book helps us better understand the setting. &quot;We crossed Arizona State line at sunup. The clouds were pink and fat and hilarious-looking like the hippo ballerinas in a Disney movie.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Being one that loves gardening, I must admit, that the cover first caught my eye. There, at the bottom, peeking shyly from the rows of beans is a small child with wide eyes. How can these two aspects come together to make sense of this title??I suppose that is not why most people want to buy books and read them, but for me I felt motivated to solve the puzzle of the lost looking wide eyed black haired youngster.Right away, I was intrigued by &quot;Missy&quot;, from Kentucky. She has by no means had an easy life, but she has had a mom who loved her (forget about the dad) and knew enough to look around her in high school to see all her girl friends having unexpected pregnancies, and vowed to herself that she would get out of town with her uterus non-gravid. A sad goal, but a goal non-the-less, and with the help of a beaten up barely drive-able car she makes her escape to somewhere else, or rather to as far as the car can make it without breaking down. That in, and of itself, seemed like a novel worth checking out. I appreciated the humor and the spirit of this young girl. She kissed her Mama goodbye, (after her Mama made her demonstrate how to change tires--which by the way is her number one fear of all time. You see, she saw a guy get blown up and away after trying to change a truck tire, and that vision never left her.) Anyway, off she goes to the next town, oh, and she decides to rename herself too. Depending on the town she breaks down in.Within no time, she ends up in an out of the way town where she goes into a down and out bar type cafe, well, bar. Hoping to get something to eat, or coffee, she looks around and sees a woman huddled in a back dark booth with a blanket around her. The place is dark and mysterious, she checks out some postcards and learns she is near or on an Indian Reservation. Leaving the bar, she gets into the car and is confronted by the woman sitting in the bar. What she takes out of the blanket and plops down on the passenger seat will change her life forever. The woman begs her to take the toddler. The woman looks haggard, the situation in bigarre, this has to be a joke, but suddenly, the woman spins away, the lights are turned off, the two trucks fly out of the parking lot, and she is staring into the helpless eyes of a physically, sexually and mentally abused baby.Oh, what to do. Well, what would you do? I don't know what I would do, but I can tell you that it was pretty interesting to see what newly named Taylor (alias Missy) did. She is spunky, idealistic, naive. But, you have to give her credit. She's got alot of heart, and the people she meets in the following town make it bloom just like the garden she begins to work in behind, you didn't guess it, her next job, in a tire store.Enjoy, I did.

For another interesting read, I would recommend the negative reviews included on this site. Though there are well spoken people with interesting observations, there also seem to be some disgruntled English students out there, who amidst variable levels of grammatical competency have vented their frustrations.

A novel written by Barbara Kingslover. During this book review I will be discussing the plot, theme, character analysis, and author's style. The story tells about a young girl named Taylor Greer. She takes a '55 volkswagon bug and sees where it will take her. On the way to her unknown destination, she recieves a baby by a mysterious woman. She takes the baby with out really knowing what she is doing. She ends up moving to Tucson. She winds up living in a house with another woman whose husband has just left her and she had a baby of her own, Dwayne Ray. Taylor ends up working in Jesus is Lord Tires with Mattie as her bus. Mattie has a sanctuary above her buisness. Esperanza and Estevan are two people running from their government of Guatamala. Later in the story Tayloe decides to take Esperanza and Estevan to a safe place and on the way she decides she is going to try to find Turtle's aunt so she can give Turtle to her legally. She doesn't fine them so Esperanza and Estevan act like her parents and let Taylor adapt her from them. At the end of the story Taylor and Lou Ann figure out that they are a family. The author use many themes in her story and one major theme is family. Everything that happens in this story had something to do with family. Taylor and Lou Ann become a family through out the story and figure it out that they are at the end. Lou Ann describes family as knowing everything about each other good and bad sides. The politcal theme is very strong also. It also plays an important role in the story by using the immigrants form Guatamala. The main characters in the story are Lou Ann, Taylor, Turtle, Mattie, Esperanza, and Estevan. Lou Ann started out with a low self esteem to being confident and sticking up for herself. Taylor was strong willed and confiednt from the begining and became more sensitive through the story. Mattie likes to help people through hard times. Turtle was extremly quiet but then became rather talkative through the story. Esperanza was extremly emotional and quiet. Estevan was brilliant and strong. The author's style was brillant and well put together. She used a lot of figuaritive language. She knew when and where to put in the politcal points and she explained everything in detail. She used a strong theme and stuck to that one through out the book. I thought that this book was pretty good and overall I gave it four stars. This story took people from entirely different worlds and meshed them together. They discover each other and help them discover themselves."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I had to buy this book for class and I'm glad it was so cheap because I would never choose this book to read for leisure.

She takes a job in Tucson where she meets some illegal Mexicans and some other weird characters who become her family.

Sometimes, I'd be in my bed, trying to go to sleep... and that's when I feel the dark shadowy presence of Turtle, just watching me, breathing heavily.

As seems to often be the case, the first 100 pages or so were delightful and then after that things got a little choppy and heavy handed. My overall reaction is that this feels very much like a first novel, as it hasn't quite achieved the full potential in terms of character development and nuance.Things I liked: the set-up (young woman, Taylor Greer, traveling cross-country improbably aquires a toddler ), the Tuscon setting (including some lovely descriptions of the desert), the sense of community and alternative families.What I didn't like: the book at times ceases to be a narrative and starts to feel like a political treatise. There is also a half-baked relationship between the protagonist and a married man which didn't entirely make sense to me. It seemed to come out of no-where and disappear just as quickly. In addition, I found the friendship between Lou Ann and Taylor to be a little too ideal. Would this really happen? I have my doubts. There are things that happen at the end that seem to strain credibility to me on several levels. In fact, the entire book has a slightly kooky premise.Don't let my criticism fool you: I did like the book. That said, I'm in no rush to read its sequel, \\"Pigs in Heaven.\\" Based on this, I'd say Barbara Kingsolver is one of those authors I'm happy to read every five years or so."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is a story about a Taylor - a young woman who leaves her small Kentucky town and heads west - hoping to make something of her life.

When there's no trace of this child's parents, Taylor takes on the role, and by the time the two land in a small town outside Tuscon, Arizona, for all intents and purposes, Taylor is the child's mother.Written in wise and lyrical prose, this story is about loyalty in love and friendship, and about discovering how far in life these treasures can take you."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Strong-willed Marietta Greer has no particular destination in mind when she drives out of Kentucky in her beat-up old Volkswagen Bug, leaving the blue grass behind her without looking back. Her only goal is to escape early marriage, a brood of children, and a life she sees as restrictive. She wants more out of life and, while she's not sure exactly what it is she's looking for, she knows she won't find it in Kentucky.Her new life begins in Taylorville, Illinois, where she decides to adopt the city's name as her own. It continues in Oklahoma, where an exhausted but insistent Cherokee woman hands her a baby girl outside a run-down bar and begs her to keep the child. The child is silent, big-eyed, and bruised. Taylor's new life takes a solid shape when she agrees to take the child, fondly nicknaming her Turtle because of her clinging grip and huge, staring eyes.Taylor and Turtle end up in Tucson, Arizona, rolling in on two flat tires. Luckily, they roll to a stop right in front of Jesus is Lord Used Tires, and after meeting Jesus is Lord's proprietor Mattie (whose shop is a way-station for illegal immigrants on a modern Underground Railrod, each searching for his or her own American Dream), Taylor decides to stay. She and Turtle settle into an apartment with the pregnant Lou Ann (a Southeastern transplant like Taylor herself), and she begins working for Mattie at the garage. Thus, it is in the heat-drenched dust of Tucson, Arizona, that Taylor officially creates a new life for herself and her unexpected charge.Like many other reviewers here, I came to THE BEAN TREES by way of THE POISONWOOD BIBLE and A PRODIGAL SUMMER. And I have to say I that, while I preferred both of those novels to this one, I really liked Barbara Kingsolver's debut novel. THE BEAN TREES is a sweet, endearing book about family and friendship, about finding yourself in unexpected places, in both senses of the phrase. The overarching theme of new motherhood is expertly handled, although I do wish more emphasis would have been placed on Taylor's relationship with her own mother.Like in her later works, Kingsolver excels at character development in THE BEAN TREES. Her characters are quirky and charming; you just can't help but fall in love with Taylor, Lou Ann, Mattie, Esperanza, and Estevan -- and ESPECIALLY with the loveable little Turtle. Even though the child rarely speaks, Kingsolver's masterful prose reveals a sweet and sparkling personality. And Taylor is a wonderful, somehow innocent heroine; while her narrative is simple, it's also incredibly insightful, and watching her grow from a young woman craving independence to a nurturing mother figure is incredibly endearing. The bright and colorful characters are given a setting that's equally as vibrant, and Kingsolver excels at bringing the Southwest to life with her rich, luscious description. \\"The whole Tucson Valley lay in front of us, resting in its cradle of mountains,\\" she writes in a passage that gave me goosebumps. \\"The sloped desert plain that lay between us and the city was like a palm stretched out for a fortuneteller to read, with its mounds and hillocks, its life lines and heart lines of dry stream beds.\\"THE BEAN TREES is a novel that successfully balances the magical and the ordinary, the heartbreaking and the euphoric. What a wonderful debut novel by one of America's finest literary voices!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Just moving away from home after high school is a girl named Taylor Greer.

As Taylor starts her long journey she is accompanied by a new friend she makes along the way named Lou Ann and her son Dwayne Ray. Her opinions and morals soon change once she gets a taste of how life really is.Coming into this book was a little slow but it is definitely worth the wait. As you go along reading there are many things in Taylor's life that I'm sure a lot of you could relate to. The struggles that she goes through with her new child, makes you think twice about what goes on in this world right underneath our noses.This book leaves you wanting more and is a great book for high school kids on up. I would not recommend for any younger as it would not appeal to their ages because it is a difficult book to understand at those younger ages. But for adults and teens it is great because we get the themes and messages throughout the book, and this book does have some really insightful things to bring to the table as well."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver is an exceptional novel.

In the middle of Oklahoma, she is left with an American Indian child, around three years old, who she names Turtle. Taylor is thrown into the role of being a mother while still trying to figure out where to go. She ends up deciding to stay in Tucson, Arizona, where she and Turtle make many new friends, including another new mother and her son, a used tire store owner, and two illegal immigrants from Latin America. This book is about Taylor and how all of her friends and family affect her life.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. The first sentence had me hooked because of its peculiarity. It starts, \\"I have been afraid of putting air in a tire ever since I saw a tractor tire blow up an throw Newt Hardbine's father over the top of the Standard Oil sign.\\" How many books start out like that? I laughed aloud at that point and many others through out the book. Taylor is not afraid to speak her mind and she has a lot to say. However, it is also a very touching story about Taylor growing into the role of being a mother and learning that life isn't always as simple as it seemed in Kentucky. It had me laughing and crying until the end. I recommend this book to all to read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After thoroughly enjoying Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible, I picked up her book, The Bean Trees. While without the power and emotion of Poisonwood, The Bean Trees is a charming novel nonetheless.Taylor Greer comes from a small town in rural Kentucky. Pittman is decades behind the rest of the country, and the only thing for teenage girls to do is to become pregnant. Knowing she has to escape this environment, Taylor packs her things into a ramshackle car, and decides that she will travel until her car breaks down. While on her journey, a Cherokee woman literally drops a baby into her car, and Taylor must now think of what's best not only for herself, but also this little girl. She finally ends up in Tucson, and makes a life for herself there.Taylor is not brilliant, but she overflows with good old common sense. She is also inquisitive and open minded-two traits that endear her to those around her. Once she lands in Tucson, she is befriended by a number of people (who each possess as kind a heart as Taylor) and she creates a substitute family. Also, while Taylor does not seem like a religious person, she is a spiritual one and can see God's presence all around here.While The Bean Trees does not have a riveting plot, it is very rich in imagery. Kingsolver was a biologist before she became an author, and some of her descriptions are priceless. I especially enjoyed the first rain in the desert, and the blooming of the night cereus. So for a charming and heartwarming story, you can't go wrong with The Bean Trees."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"\\"The Bean Trees\\" by Barbara Kingsolver is a story of determination, love, motherhood and responsibility. In this truly touching and uplifting story of exploration and growth, a wayward spirit finds her path, and learns to live and let live. Although at first I was skeptical as to the subject of the story, thinking it was just another girly book, I came to very much enjoy the way in which this book was written, with deeper meaning around every corner and description in that down-to -earth, no-nonsense manner that really made me pay attention. The female-empowerment tone to this book makes it an even more attractive read to women, and talks the reader through difficult, shocking and amazing challenges.Not content with her life in Pittman County, a small town in Kentucky, fiery Marietta Greer breaks free from those low expectations and travels away from home looking for herself,not knowing where she is going or when she will get there. Her somewhat slow start to life swiftly accelerates as she comes upon a baby girl, meets amazing people and forges her path in life. This marvelous novel's pace accelerates until it reaches a dramatic close, a close leaving me satisfied...but still wanting more. The pain of a small-town existence as well and the vastness of the world outside are expressed in harsh relief in this truly excellent book. Kingsolver's storytelling made my heart go out to little Turtle, my pity to Lou Ann, and my contempt to Angel. I really connected with these characters, as I, the reader fell into the story, submerged in the rich adventures, only able to extract myself at the climactic finish. This book is also a harsh exposure to the horrors of immigration. I found myself horrified by the depth of abuse Esperanza and Esteven endure, as I connected with such dynamic characters as Mattie. As I read this book, I found myself questioning my morals the whole way, my eyes opening to a bigger scheme of things, a place where beans grow on trees and tire shops are named Jesus Is Lord.\\"The Bean Trees\\" is so choc-full of emotion it will leave you dizzy as you are caught up in the whirlwind of life that is Miss Taylor Greer's.I recommend this book very much; it is a captivating and interesting read, a joy to experience."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"First let me just say this novel is superb in every way. Dialogue, prose, everything is just beautiful. However, it is in writing characters that Kingsolver really shines. Taylor Greer is one of my favorite characters of all time. She has all the qualities one wants in a heroine-wit, intelligence, courage-with enough flaws to make her realistic and interesting. This woman is right up there with Scout Finch, Spyder Baxter, Thursday Next, and Death(Sandman version) on my list of great female characters. Read this book, if only to meet Taylor Greer."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is set in The Southwest during the 1970s-1980s. It tells of a young woman's journey from indifference within her society and her need to elevate herself from what was inspected of her life in a small town: grow up, go to high school, get pregnant and married, remain in town until death. Taylor (Missy) Greer has avoided the stereotypical expectations by graduating from high school, getting a job as a hospital aide, saving money to buy herself a broken-down relic of a car, and leaving Pittman County, Kentucky, forever.Taylor decides to leave her small town and begin her search for her own independence and identity. Whereas she begins her travels with carefree attitude of \\"no strings attached,\\" she is quickly elevated to the position of surrogate mother to a small Indian child who is given to Taylor in a moment of panic. Little Turtle is three years old, has been physically and sexually abused, and cannot speak aside from guttural sounds.

Definitely a book to read"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I just finished Barbara Kingsolver's charming first novel--18 years after she wrote it and about five years after I read and loved one of her other novels, the amazing \\"Poisonwood Bible\\". Kingsolver's biography says she grew up in Kentucky and lives near Tucson, Arizona. Her knowledge of both places shines through. But what carries \\"The Bean Trees\\" is not so much knowledge as heart--the heart of the protagonist Taylor Greer, a bored young woman from Kentucky looking to make her own identity elsewhere, and the heart of her young charge Turtle, an abused Cherokee Indian child she comes to care for and love. Kingsolver is particularly effective at describing both the horticulture (young Turtle is a vegetablist, if there is such a thing) and humanity of Arizona, as we also get a look at a modern day underground railroad that protects so-called \\"illegals\\" in the US. As an effort to explore the search for identity in a multicultural world, \\"The Bean Trees\\" far exceeds another more recent attempt, Anne Tyler's annoying \\"Digging to America.\\""},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has an uncanny understanding of human nature. The characters in this novel are by no way perfect, and if you knew them personally, you would be able to list off exactly what makes them drive you crazy. That is what I love about them. The symbolism is beautiful, and her language is brilliant. I find myself speaking like I'm from Kentucky if I read for too long (this is quite a feat, being from prairie Manitoba). I very strongly recommend this book to those who have felt trapped in their surroundings, and who long for a community of friends with an ounce of analysis, conviction and honor. If you have ever been convinced that every person around you is nuts, this book will help you find humour and empathy in your situation, rather than fear. I find I can relate to these characters on a more personal level than in her equally, if not more brilliant, \\"Poisonwood Bible\\". That book, based on her literary skill alone, was one of the greatest works I've ever read, but it tore out my heart. But I'm finding \\"Bean Trees\\" to be a story I would share with my children. To sum it up: this book will make you smile.The reason I gave the book 4 stars is because I would have appreciated a more positive male influence in the novel. However, I understand that the lack thereof is due to the main character's overwhelming exposure to men who are not worth any effort of personal association. For that, Kingsolver is forgiven.Next on my list: Pigs in Heaven.This book was my first purchase based on my newly developed customer review technique: when I can't decide whether I want to purchase a book or not, I read the lowest ratings first. If the reviewers are illiterate, inarticulate knobs, then I can conclude with relative certainty that the book will be worth reading. If the lowest reviews are prepared with thought and careful analysis by mature readers, then I hesitate on my purchase until I can find a copy of the book and page through it myself. To frequent Amazon shoppers: this technique works! Unless, of course, you are one of the illiterate inarticulate knobs mentioned previously. Then I don't recommend you follow my example."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I first read Kingsolver's &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; which I thought was a great book. &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; is her first, and although not as layered and thematic as &quot;...Poisonwood&quot;, it still stands on it's own feet as a quiet, solid, well written story of a woman named Taylor Greer and the three year old American Indian girl named Turtle who comes into her life. Kingsolver manages to make the most simple moments full of wonder and heart felt honesty. Admittedly the book has the feel of a &quot;chick book&quot;, and alot of guys would probably be turned off by it. Yet the themes of parenting, and belonging, love and personal growth to me ultimately transcends gender, and speaks of what it is to be human."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This story of Taylor Greer, a young woman looking to get out of her backwater town and make something of her life, who finds an abandoned Native American child she names Turtle, is touching and well-written.Some moments sizzle with humor, and some are rich in description. Kingsolver's writing got a tad repetitious, but overall this was a compelling novel. The dark, important themes - abandonment, abuse, etc - are underscored by irony and humor, and the action is colored by interesting characters (Mattie, who owns Jesus Is Lord Tires, Lou Ann, the nesting, worrisome, recently abandoned mother, and many others.) Still, at times the book does tend to go off on tangents (when Taylor works at a burger place for a few days, when she's searching for an apartment and roommates and interviews with some drugged out hippies) and it's cluttered with too many subplots to count. But, whatever plot problems the story has, Kingsolver covers with style and good writing.This is actually my favorite Kingsolver novel, personally, as I feel it's the most light-hearted (though it's still very meaningful) of her books."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A friend encouraged me to read this book, as a &quot;change of pace&quot; from my usual choice of reading material. I have to say, it was an enchanting book. Kingsolver's style is very readable. Her use of dialect creates characters that are both three dimensional and enjoyable. Her attention to the small details of environment instill a strong sense of visual reality to what she describes and elicit an emotional commitment from the reader with a success that many authors fail to acheive. The journey of Tayler, nee Mariette, Greer is one not only through the landscape or even through time, but through life's experiences. She seems to grow in depth as she takes on each new challenge. Her involvement with others and their dependence on her show a strength that many of us would like to claim as our own. A very companionable book."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After reading The Prodigal Summer and The Poisonwood Bible, I was disappointed in this effort by Kingsolver. The story is sweet, but does not move me to change my life or views on the world and Kingsolver's other books have. Some plot lines seem a little unfinished and rough. Also, the author is a little too blatant at times in sharing her political views, and the book reads more like a political pamphlet than a novel. Nevertheless, the author's overall storytelling ability makes the book a plesant and easy read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As a librarian I'm asked daily for recommendations for &quot;a good read.&quot; BEAN TREES is one of the very few books that immediately pop into my mind for almost any age or ethnic group. I tend to judge fiction by how long I remember its characters. Taylor has become real to me. I would know her in an instant if I saw her walking down the street."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read The Bean Trees, as a junior in high school, and now as a freshman in college, it still sticks out in my mind as the best novel I have read. The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver, is a magnificent novel. As Kingsolver's first novel, it takes you on a trip trough Taylor Greer's personal and political growth and experiences. It is a journey through the life of a young rebellious girl from Kentucky, who leaves all she knows for a life in the deserts of Tucson, Arizona. The book grabs the reader and drags them into this mystical journey. When you read this novel, you feel as though you are part of the novel. You feel the emotions of Taylor Greer as you read along. You feel love, confusion, defeat, anger and many painful experiences. Taylor is a young girl, who takes this journey, with out any inkling of a clue to what was coming her way. She started as a nave girl who was unaware of the vast impact of the world outside her Kentucky home. She develops into a woman of vision and insight after life changing experiences flood her view of the \\"real\\" world. You may find that she still remains nave about certain situations, but her growth is obvious. Taylor is also a character that pretends to be wise above her years though, but she realizes what part of her is wise, and not just cocky. When reading this story, you will find it hard to put down. I finished it in 3 days. It was a novel I, personally, could not put down, and did not want to put down. I wanted to live the story of Taylor Greer, because in a make-believe way, after reading this story, I felt like I had lived her life. That is what is so amazing about this novel. It is real for anyone of any age. It has something in it that everyone can relate to. This is a must read for sure."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After successfully graduating high school without succumbing to pregnancy like most of her classmates, the last thing Taylor Greer wants is to raise a child. But, thanks to a chance encounter, she suddenly finds herself the foster mother of a Cherokee toddler named Turtle.Despite Taylor's initial reluctance, her heart softens when she finds out how horribly Turtle was abused as a baby. Together, the two set off in a new life in Arizona, where they live on Taylor's minimum-wage earnings and wit.Then Taylor meets Lou Ann, another transplanted Southerner. Having recently become a mother herself, Lou Ann's been abandoned by her husband and is now seeking a housemate to split the rent. Taylor takes her up on the offer, and discovers that family can be found in the least expected of places...If you enjoy this book, be sure to read \\"Pigs in Heaven,\\" which continues Taylor's and Turtle's story."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have read many of Kingsolver's novels but this amusing story is my favorite. The story is rather simple, a girl decides to leave home and heads west but along the way she has a baby dropped in her lap, and settles in a Arizona town (where her car breaks down). Taylor (the main character)learns that this baby (she names Turtle), who has been horribly abused and is withdrawn, is now a part of her life and wants nothing more then to become its real mother. A side story includes the boss of the Tire company in which Taylor works is hiding refugees that Taylor befriends and helps out in their struggle to live free. Kingsolver is a very easy to read novelist that always includes characters that evolve and mature, topics that are controversial (such as abuse and war), and a lot of humor and warmth in her characters and their situations. This story is a very light read and very different then Kingsolver's recent novels such as the Poisonwood Bible which I believed to be very heavy."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Thank goodness somebody wrote it.

Lou Ann discovers confidence in herself and accepts and cherishes her life as a single mom, with Taylor at her side.

Although her books are full of meat, her characters are never full of bologna. Taylor shines with courage and resolve. Kingsolver's rendering of the setting in Arizona has sparked an interest in me. The intelligence and thoughtfulness of this blue collar woman is refreshing to American women's novels. As part Cherokee indian myself, I found her use of the Cherokee culture and the dillemmas facing it sensitive and profound. The fact is Taylor and Turtle are two of my favorite Kingsolver creations. I highly recommend this book and its sequel."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Great summer read.

IT shows a true mother-to-daughter relationship, the way no other book does.

My advice is: read this book first to learn to be a good mother"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"If you like self-discovery novels, you'll love Barbara Kingsolver's The Bean Trees. The imagery and plot of this novel are fascinating. This novel is one that young women everywhere can relate to on many levels. Taylor Greer takes a road trip from her hometown in Kentucky to find out where she belongs in the world. Along the way she picks up an orphan child that she's stuck with. She's broke, doesn't have a job, and she has a kid she doesn't know how to take care of. She ends up in Arizona, where she meets many interesting people and a few unexpected twists and turns. While reading this book, I found that I couldn't put it down. I was captivated by Taylor's life, on the edge of my seat so to speak anticipating what would happen to her next. I loved this book and one day I expect I will be reading it again."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book as a senior in high school. After reading many novels in my high school career I would have to say that Barbara Kingsolver does an outstanding job in portraying the struggles of a single mother on her own. Taylor the main character of the novel starts off by leaving her home in Kentucky to head west to try and start a new life of her own. On her journey out west she has many lifetime experiences that most people would not like to have. Although she did have these experiences she took them head on and never regreted the decisions that she had to make. The biggest experience for her and will last her the rest of her life was when someone gave her a baby girl because they could not take care of it anymore. Traveling with her and the new acquired passenger Turtle the two go through the good times and the bad times of life together in becoming an inseperable mother daughter combination in the end. This book was extremly touching and would not only appeal to single mothers but to all kinds, with problems they endure in life, as the different problems in life seem to always present themselves through out the novel but are solved with the love of someone or something in the end."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Barbara has done it again she is one of the few writers that can be described as barrierless in the sense that its not easy to tell her colour,age or status from her writing.with this book she has not been any different a trully great writer"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I think most people start reading Kingsolver with The Poisonwood Bible.....I liked it, but it wasn't something I'd rave about.

I definitly recomend!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Setting: From a small southern town where everybody knows everybody else's business to the bustle of Arizona's Tucson with a road trip in between.Characters: Taylor Greer- a young woman trying to find out who she is by traveling as far as she can go. Mattie - the heart of an unseen world with a heart the size of the world. Lou Ann - A step between laughter and heartbreak. She has a child and a failed marriage. Turtle - soft spoken child of the world finds herself in a loving home while clinging to the past in ways that no one can understand.Plot: Not to get pregnant out of high school was Taylor's first goal. Successful with that, as soon as she could she left town to see how far she could go. On the way a child was given to he and her life changed. When her tire lost its usefulness she stopped at Jesus is Lord Used Tires to get it fixed. There she met Mattie. Tucson became the place where Taylor hung her hat. Mattie was successful in enchanting her with a job, so Taylor had to find a place to live. After many attempts she found herself in the house of Lou Ann. The two of them had an uncanny similarity in their pasts and became fast friends. The three women mixed in the charms of the Wild West and childcare, all pull together for the best of humanity.Techniques: Kingslover uses the chapters to flash between the lives of Taylor and Lou Ann. She shows what happens to people whose separate lives become one. Irony is the last player in the book tying together the bond between Taylor and Turtle.Themes: Kingsolver's characters are bold. They each have a presence that seems over bearing on it's own, but subtle together. It is the common kindness that people have that runs through this book. The strength and the frailty that each human has, and the love that will go way out of ones way to help another person is the beauty of the human existence.Quotes:Taylor -The wisteria vines on their own would just barely get by, is how I explained it to Turtle, but put them together with rhizobia and they make miraclesTaylor -There would come a time when she would just wave at the sight of passing grave stones and quietly say, \\"Bye, bye.\\""},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was phenomenal. Barbara Kingsolver had an incredible sensitivity in writing this book. The plot and the characters were beautiful and realistic. Kingsolver thoughtfully approached the issue of importance--is the little child whom no one wants, is abandoned, and sexually abused as important as the person who &quot;has their life together&quot;? I would strongly recommend this book. Please read it with an open heart, and over look your prejudices."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Barbara Kingsolver wrote this novel over 20 years ago, and it has now become a school assignment, which seems to invariably precipitate numerous mindless 1-star reviews from those \\"forced\\" to read it. The novel has a certain charm, featuring individuals struggling against either the \\"system,\\" or their own \\"fate,\\" against long odds, and winning, producing a warm feeling as the last page is turned. It features a young woman from the Appalachian area of Kentucky, determined to escape her \\"fate\\" of becoming pregnant in high school. She escapes entirely, push-starting an old VW across the country, and in the process, acquires a new name, Taylor, as well as an Indian child, who is offered to her in Oklahoma, by a relative eager that the child not experience further abuse. Taylor ends her journey at the \\"Jesus is Lord Used Tire\\" shop in Tucson, AZ, and proceeds to acquire like-minded friends, usually in distressed economic circumstances. I found it intrinsically interesting how Kingsolver moved the novel forward, as well as her style, which contained some original descriptive passages, such as her description of the Indian child, nicknamed, Turtle: \\"her body, her face, and her eyes were all round. She was someone you could have drawn a picture of by tracing around dimes and quarter and jar tops.\\" Or comparing her philosophy about men to the instructions for replacing the flapper ball (hum!) in a toilet: \\"Parts are included for all installations, but no installation requires all of the parts.\\"The novel addresses two central political and/or social issues, child abuse and, depending on your political outlook, \\"undocumented migrants\\" or \\"illegal immigration.\\" At one time, neither issue was discussed; now they seem to be in the news literally every day. Twenty years ago Kingsolver may have been at some sort of mid-point. As a \\"morality play\\" though, the novel simply did not work for me. The characters are cardboard, two-dimensional types. The women are heroic types, fighting assorted threats from males, or their indifference. The only appealing male character is Estevan, an native Indian from Guatemala, who speaks better English than all the American females in the book, and who, along with his wife, has fled almost certain execution in his own country, and entered the United States illegally, supporting himself by washing dishes at a Chinese restaurant.The Indian child, \\"Turtle\\" is only 3 years old, and has been molested and abused, so severely that bones have been broken. There is another attempt on her in a park in Tucson. Sexually abuse of infants does occur, but it is extremely rare. Kingsolver includes the astonishing claim \\"...that maybe one out of every four little girls is sexually abused by a family member. Maybe more.\\" (p 182) No mention of the abuse of little boys, but a reasonable person might conclude this seemingly upbeat novel by praying for a nuclear war that would wipe out the entire human species if they believed this claim. The number of \\"pervs\\" among us, as a percentage of the human population, probably has not changed over the last 50 years. There is an immense downside to constantly hyping a real, but slender threat: teaching all children to constantly be freighten of strangers, not to mention the \\"wet blanket\\" effect this has on any normal male. Why should he be involved as any sort of role model for youth, be it an athletic coach, or a Boy Scout leader, when the only \\"real\\" reason must be a perverted one?Likewise with the issue of immigration, particularly from Latin America. Might not Estevan, and his wife have had a safe, secure, and enjoyable life if the CIA had not overthrown the democratically elected leader of Guatemala, Jacobo Guzman, in 1954? How many Americans, and not just Wall Street types, openly enjoy a system of having 12-20 million poor people within our borders, without legal rights, who clean our homes, care for our children, wash the dishes in our restaurants, or construct our homes? None of this is mentioned. The people from \\"south of the border\\" come here not so much to escape death from goon squads as to improve their lives economically, often at the expense of workers from Taylor's home town in eastern Kentucky.Each issue is quite real, but they deserve much better treatment than in this particular \\"morality play.\\" I may be stretching it a bit to grant 3-stars, but I understand from very reliable reviews that \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is that much more complex and nuanced novel, and so I'll applaud the evolution in presentation."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees attempts to address so many vital issues: adoption, class and race, youth, feminism, yet these remain a shallow, new-age background.

The writing seems to be episodic. The author thinks of the most unlikely thing to have happen and then makes it happen. Although I know this is fiction, I always expect a certain amount of credibility, so why does a young woman who has been employed for several years and who is supposed to be quite intelligent have only enough money saved to buy a car that won't start and leave town for destinations unknown? And how can she arrange an adoption in one afternoon with a sleazy lawyer? I know that this is meant to include single mothers, independent women, helping the great unwashed, the plight of refugees, Native Americans, abandoned children, and domestic abuse, but it seems pasted together and the characters fail to make me care about them."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is a story of Taylor Greer.

She can gather idiosyncrasies, cultures, ethnicities, languages, philosophies, and interweave them in a story with no seams. And it works! A common flaw that I find in contemporary novels is that sometimes the author brings in situations or characters, deals with them for one and a half pages, and never brings them back for the rest of the book. BK develops characters and plots deeply, and does readers like me a big favor by not leaving us with more questions than it is necessary.This is a beautiful book, and a good introduction to the works of BK. I enjoy the presence of nature throughout the pages (BK has a background in Biology/Botany, and nature is a common focus point in her books). She is also very concerned about those less fortunate than us, and makes her point clear with the characters of Esteban and Esperanza, the Guatemalan refugees.The sequel to this book, Pigs in Heaven, is my least favorite of her books, and I found it miles away from this one."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees is a charming little story with quirky characters.

She succeeded in escaping her fate as a young, dropout, Kentucky mother only to find herself with a child that has no one but her. Her resilience throughout this situation is amazing and inspiring.The characters in this story all lean on each other and help one another out in a way most people could only hope to experience.

This story is a touching one of friendship, determination, and unconditional love. The thing that is most memorable about this book, though, is it's many philosophical ideas that Taylor receives from other characters in the story. For example, one character tells Taylor, &quot;Whatever you want the most,it's going to be the worst thing for you.&quot; Kingsolver has cleverly interwined deep ideas to create a more meaningful story. This book is a good read for a rainy day if you have a few hours. If you are interested in this story, there is also a companion book to it called Pigs in Heaven, also a very good book."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bean Trees was a very uplifting story. It was about a young woman named Taylor who decides to move from her small town home in Kentucky, out west. On her journey she stops in Oklahoma when something goes wrong with her car and a woman stops her and insists she take a small baby with her because no one wants it anymore. Taylor takes the baby and names her Turtle because she clings on to everything she can get her little hands on. The two make it out to Arizona and meet a lady named Mattie who owns a tire shop called \\"Jesus is the Lord Used Tires.\\" Mattie and Taylor develop a bond and Taylor learns that Mattie helps immigrants from Guatemala escape their deaths. She has a \\"sanctuary\\" for them above her shop. Taylor moves in and develops a close relationship with a single mother named Lou Ann, whose husband walked out on her and their son. While in Arizona Taylor learns that she does not have any claim over Turtle and that she would need to adopt her.I can relate to Taylor the most because we share the same view about some things. We both believe that this world is in fact an awful place. People are proud to pick on those who can't defend themselves, such as the poor and the weak. Some people have it in their minds that everyone should be like alike and if you're different, you are something to be feared, and we deal with fear by being defensive. Taylor and I both think that people need to learn to love others' differences instead of considering differences as undesirable.I fully enjoyed this book. I wish I had read it in high school because I had a hard time with cruel people. Girls would make fun of me because I was smarter than they, or they called me ugly when they had no one else to say it to. I choose not to judge others because I hate being judged myself. My life was made so much harder because I was surrounded by little-minded people who put others down to try and make themselves feel better. I am still wondering if this actually solves their problems. I wish I didn't have to see the world as it really is, and instead I could be naive and view it as I would like to.I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. There were many times when tears would fill my eyes with the heart-felt things that Taylor would say. Sometimes I thought it was myself talking. I believe that everyone was put here for at least one reason: for others to love. I know my parents and many other people love me and often times that is all that keeps me going. Everyone deserves to be cared about and helped. Someone who has been teased or taunted and wishes the people in this world had something better to do than put others down would enjoy this book the most. But I would also like to recommend it to those who are the \\"teasers\\" and tell those people to grow up and learn to be kind."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"When I began reading The Bean Trees I was rather bored. The book didn't seem interesting and the plot started out slow. As I proceeded to read on I became more intrigued. The plot slowly started to unfold more in the story. The characters became a little bit more clear. Eventually I got to the point where I didn't want to put the book down.Each character was well defined and had their own personality. There were no two personalities a like in this novel. The characters seem to change as the story goes on, and they eventually grew on you. My favorite character was Taylor.Taylor like myself was an ordinary girl. Her main goal in life was to not become like every other girl where she lived. She wanted more to life, but like in everyone's life she had struggles to. This book represented life and the transitions you go through throughout your life. I know personally I am going through a transition in my life so I could relate to Taylor and what she was going through to a certain point. I think the main focus of the book was Taylor, but it was more based upon learning to accept life.Taylor really opened up my eyes and showed me there is more to life then just myself. By the end of the story I had felt like I had learned a lesson from Taylor's experiences. The Bean Trees was a wonderful book that anyone could fall in love with. It's not a story that takes you on a wild adventure, but it is a story that takes you through life. You can't run away from life, and it can never be perfect. You can however accept what you have and realize that you are happy with where you are."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I first want to say that Barbara Kingsolver is my favorite author. The first book I read of hers was Animal Dreams and I've been captivated by her ever since. I truly enjoy everything that she writes and look forward to every book I get of hers.Bean Trees is my favorite book by Barbara as this book pulls at my heartstrings. I cried the first couple of times I read it. Her use of imagery and her descriptions of places makes me feel like I am right there with the characters and seeing what they see. I like that it's not a complex book that requires all my brain cells to read. It's a wonderful book and I can read it no matter what mood I am in.I would highly recommend this book to anyone.

I think it's an interesting book. I am not a big fan of reading, but this book caught my interest. The story of Taylor and Turtle has great characters. It must have taken a lot for Taylor to just get up and leave her small town that she had always lived in. Then, when she found Turtle, most people wouldn't have taken care of a baby like that.

But, it was the equivalent of a &quot;chick-flick&quot; for books. All the emotions running rampant throughout the novel sometimes got a little old. If your not into subtle love stories and rather emotional subjects (e.g. motherhood), then I wouldn't recommend it. But, depsite these minor quibbles, I found the story to be somewhat intriguing with the interactions of the characters and the down-to-earth voice of the novel. Kingsolver can grab your attention and keep it with alarming frequency, and often you will have two or three chapters before you even realize how much time has passed. I found following the lives and interactions of the main characters was interesting as well. But, the emotional content of the book wasn't high on my &quot;must read&quot; list, even though it was still a good read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was a good story with lots of appropriate insights into the human conditions and behaviors.

The plot seemed sketchy at first, but it turned out to be so meaningful and completely changes ideas about motherhood, families, and friendship. It uses a simple, blunt tone, which highlights the honest voice and deeper meaning beneath the words. It's a great modern classic and the character development is prodigious. The metaphors are superb. I truly loved this book, my only complaint is that it ended too quickly for my tastes. This novel was also very different from what I'm used to, so this book is probably mostly suited for people with a high level reading/inferring ability, to enjoy it, but pretty much anyone can understand it.

Besides she didn't even want one. Turtle symbolizes hope and sorrow. The part where everything begins is when Turtle is given to Taylor. It was a LIKE a gift given to Taylor, although the gift wasn't wanted at first. Taylor came to realize that Turtle had been through tougher times than herself. Consequently Taylor becomes an ideal mother to Turtle and that little unwanted and abused girl is filled with love and security.I hope you read this book.

I laughed and cried on every other page.She begins her story headed west in a VW bug that has no starter (so she always has to park on a hill), and in some ways, she never arrives. The Bean Trees is partially about that emotional sense free-falling we all experience at one time or another, and a remarkable woman's ability to roll with it and find beautiful love in many less-than-perfect people.The narrative is clean, simple and perfect (I'm thinking of Salinger here).

This approach has created the technological world in which we live, but the very same mind set has created a culture in which man feels cut off from the world, isolated in the eternal 'I', lonely and at odds with those around us. \\"You are not me\\", we say. But in this book Watts wants to teach us a different way of looking at the problem. Things do not exist in separate categories of, for example, 'right' and wrong. Rather the world is a set of continuums and polarities which are basic to our understanding. Right and wrong are interdependent and we can't understand one without knowledge of the other. Also, we are not divided off from the world, but intimately linked to the environment. In a witty scenario Watts explores the inter-relationship between an ant in a hole in the ground and you, via your own kitchen. You and I share certain qualities, though of course we may have different degrees of them.This book is, at its heart, Watts' take on the philosophy of Indian, Verdic (Hindu) literature. As usual it is very accessible reading and is filled with witty descriptions and arguments that lead you to think more deeply about life. I read the book several months ago and am still taking on board some of his apparently simple arguments. I found, however, that I agreed with Watts through his long chains of arguments only to balk at his final conclusion. This happened repeatedly. Specifically I cannot agree that man is a total microcosm of the macrocosm, that we are a unique, yet complete, expression of Brahma, God, Absolute Meaning, or whatever you choose to describe the ultimate 'It' as. This is just too much metaphysics and theology for me. It must be remembered that Watts is an ex-Anglican minister and I think his background shows here. I also wished that Watts had spent much more time defining modern man's current predicament as I feel that this is where he is at his very best. For example I loved the first half of his earlier bookThe Wisdom of Insecurityfor that very reason. Of course your understanding of the world may be very different to mine, so you may like the book better than I did. I certainly didn't dislike it, but I do not feel that it is his best."},{"Title":"Network Administration Survival Guide","review":"This book has a lot of information that I can use to manage my network and my employees who use the network.

Perhaps this sum speaks to the greedy little capitalist in me. At the same time, my higher brain functions always kick in, and always being skeptical and somewhat leery of such tomes, I have to ask aloud, \\"OK, where's the gank (scam) here?\\"As it turns out, there is no catch, no scam in Darvas's delightful and entertaining little book on how he, by himself, stumbled upon an oft-tried (and somewhat true) trading strategy through admittedly much trial and much more error. Nowadays, I believe those in the know refer to it as momentum investing, but Darvas is arguably the first person who put the basic method on paper for the lay person to follow. Since he first published his book, there have been many imitators and would-be pretenders to the throne, such asGet Your Share: A Guide to Striking It Rich in the Stock Market, but none of these challengers has written a book as entertaining, accessible and straight-forward as this one.Withhout giving too much away, the book presents a method that pursues capital gain and relies heavily on the use of automatic buy and sell orders as a kind of insurance policy against catastrophic losses. As a precursor for using the method, one has to look for rising trends in a given stock, both in its price and trading volume. Truthfully, I found the narrative surrounding how he stumbled upon this simple and straight-forward (but difficult to successfully execute!) method more interesting and enlightening than the method itself.Potential readers and careful, thoughtful students of the market should take note of the following merits and demerits of the text. First, those of us who are fans of fundamental analysis are out of luck here; Darvas dismisses this pursuit as fool-hardy. Second, those of you who are fans of technical analysis (you FOOLS- shows where my bias resides, doesn't it?) will find precious little vindication within its pages. Darvas also basically dismisses technical analysis out of hand. Indeed, Darvas does not have very many kind words for securities analysts of all stripes- be they technicians or fundamentalists, and through carefully recorded experiences as his technique slowly evolved, he gradually develops a well-deserved contempt for hot tips (and the tipsters), the advisory rags, brokers and the casual musings of insiders and the so-called 'knowledge-able people' in business on where to invest. Finally, perhaps of greatest importance to those looking to use this method and maybe tweaking or modifying it is this: it apparently misses more often than it hits. Given the very real and crushing effects of transaction costs and taxes, one's grubstake can potentially suffer 'death by a thousand cuts'- a total capital loss inflicted by numerous small losses along the way. I heartily encourage non-believers to grab a copy of the book, and see for yourselves.Admittedly, trading costs and capital gains taxes were much greater in his day, but then, trading volumes were smaller and volatility, as measured among individual shares and by the broader market, was much more muted. Basically, after reviewing his trading record, one can clearly see that it relies on a few big hits to cover up many small misses. Plus, according to him, it requires hours of poring through lots of boring stock tables filled with numbers, making lots of charts, and most unpleasant for me, daily communication with one's broker. It all sounds like a lot of activity for maybe, possibly a big score, over and above the demands of your day job (which in his case was the ever-strenuous professional dancing at night).In sum, I found the author's remarks on the markets very amusing. Moreover, I deemed quite a few of his hard-won and independently derived (but by no means original) insights very worthwhile. Many of the latter have support from no less than super-investors like Gerald Loeb, author ofThe Battle For Investment Survival, John Train, author ofThe Craft of Investing: Growth and Value Stocks * Emerging Markets * Funds * Retirement and Estate Planningand the various writings of Warren Buffett. This book deserves to be read, and the author gets my respect partly for its candor (he presents the full record of his trades, good and bad, in all their painful glory), partly for its wit and borderline uber-jaded sarcasm with regard to markets and brokers, but mostly because the author did the hard work of thinking and learning independently, doing things on his own, taking his lumps with honesty, clarity and grace, and best of all, admitting his basic humanity (laying bare his foibles, his misguided arrogance in the face of the market and his fool-hardy notions). As such, he has about him the glimmerings of an unabashed, unrepentant contrarian."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This is a great book for technical investing strategies.

I try to read it at least once every few months. Nick Darvas showed everyone you don't have to babysit your stocks. He was written up in Time magazine about his documented success.According to Darvas, you only need to find the best handful of stocks with all time highs. After carefully you screen all stocks for a few important characteristics then you begin to track them to watch their pattern. When the pattern is established per rules you set a stop buy to buy them at a certain price level per the rules. You use stops to keep your losses less than 10% per stock if the upward trend has a substantial correction. If you diversify into 3 stocks your risk is less than 4% of your principal.I don't agree with his use of margin esp. for people with less than 2 years experience with these rules and framework.Get this book. Read this book and heed his advice. If you are not disciplined, want to get rick quick, don't or won't follow rules because you know better, or want to stare at a computer screen every hour to check your gains/losses this is not the method for you."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Excellent book. It is a must read for traders & investors. Mr. Darvas discusses many of the pitfalls that spell the demise of new & experienced traders alike, e.g., emotions, lack of money management, complacency, failure to use stop losses, noise (media information overload), lack of planning and sticking to a plan, not developing a custom-made methodology, following advisors, etc. He did not discuss how he would handle shorting stocks. His technique was well-documented & probably works best in a strong, well-established bull market. It also takes bodacious, patient mettle with no deviation from a fastidious, quantitative style. His artistic intuition was a plus.

It's very readable.The author describes his investing style as a narrative. It takes you through his investing evolution step-by-step, detailing his actual experiences. This made it very easy to follow, and also more real.2. It emphasizes both technical and fundamental criteria.This is critical to good investing. Both areas tell a story. This is the best book I've seen that details an investors journey through to discover that both matter, and integrate the two pictures.3. It makes for a better system, in some ways, than Investor's Business Daily.I noticed other reviews that noted the similarity between IBD and Darvas. While they are similar styles, there are some key differences. First, Darvas looks for companies that have a good high-growth STORY, but does not necessarily require the company to have high-growth earnings. He doesn't look at ROI, earnings growth rate, etc. (at least not in this book)The potential advantage of this approach over IBD is that sometimes stock prices reflect earnings potential BEFORE actual earnings show up. Alternatively, sometimes stock prices reflect perceived earnings declines BEFORE the actual decline in earnings.4. His system makes sense from a technical standpoint, but is actually harder to do than you might think.I like his system because it's technically sound. For example, it emphasizes taking small losses and being patient for large gains (among many other things).Don't be fooled, however . . . it's trickier to follow that you think. Not because his system doesn't work, but because it requires a lot more discipline that you might imagine.In his main year of gains, he records investing in only a few stocks. Also, he waits for a bull market. How many of us are really patient enough to do these two things. In reality, not many. It's just very difficult in practice.Also, he keeps an investing journal, something which I still struggle to do, but which is essential for growth. Most people can't do this on a daily basis.In all, it's a great book for the average investor to read and reread. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"How did a world-famous dancer with no knowledge of the stock market, or of finance in general, make 2 million dollars in the stock market in 18 months starting with only $10,000? Well, first, he used margin.Second, he was a genius! Lucky thing is, YOU don't have to be one to read this highly entertaining, readable book and use the techniques which Darvas intuited, pioneered and refined.This is the book that stopped me from being terrified of the stock market. The method it uses is so sound and so brilliant that it reduces the risk of loss to an almost negligible level. And despite what some say, it works even in a bear market; in fact, Darvas made most of his money in a period that was historically considered to be a \\"baby bear\\" market. The difference is that, during a bull market, Darvas-worthy stocks show up ten times a week. During a bear market, one of these stocks may take six or eight months to show up.Why do I say it works? I've tried it. The almost shameful secret here is that it's like being an Inside Trader without an inside trader's information. You can still cash in, though. Darvas's system catches stocks that are - in most cases inexplicably and with no accompanying news - suddenly experiencing heavy buying, driving them up powerfully to challenge and break through previous highs.And why are these stocks doing this? Nobody knows. Why does a pharmaceutical company in business 13 years which has never been able to bring a drug to market, never made a profit, and is predicting worse earnings to come suddenly have people buying it more and more each day, its price running up steadily and strong, with absolutely no news out of the company? Who CARES? In fact, one of Darvas&#65533;s rules was to read absolutely NONE OF THE NEWS about the stock! The Darvas system just spots the stock as it climbs. If it breaks through that previous high, you will buy it along with all these other people you don't know. And when the stock continues to climb...in three weeks, and THEN the company announces it has just released an FDA-approved drug which is the strongest anti-influenza drug to ever hit the market and already has a distribution deal with Johnson & Johnson, you might understand. You might understand that a LOT of people knew something. They just weren't telling. Luckily, you didn't have to be one of them, nor did you have to be to enjoy the further $10-in-one-day jump it experienced the day the news broke. And if you followed Darvas' trailing stop-loss requirement, you automatically sold when it fell back down.This happened to me, and I've done it DOZENS of more times, though the climbs weren&#65533;t always that dramatic. Usually, you never find out what caused the surge. You just profit from it. Darvas himself likened it to being a &#65533;silent partner&#65533; with all those people in the know.One warning: you either understand what the system is by the way it's explained here, or you don't. To me it was as simple as pie, and with the Internet screening techniques available today (which Darvas didn't have in his early days - further proof of his true genius was his ability to make \\"mental charts\\" without looking at physical ones - abstract thinking characteristic of a very high IQ) these stocks can be found if they exist. But more people DON'T grasp the system than do. This is especially clear in the remarkably funny Q&A; section at the end of the book where you find that people are entirely missing his concepts and he is almost at a total loss to explain what seems so obvious to him.This is not day trading. But neither is it long-term buy and hold. I think it hypocritical of Darvas to claim he was a long term investor - he was long term only as LONG as the stock stayed in its \\"box\\" or moved up into a new one. If it moved down, he was OUT OF THERE. That's NOT long term investing. It's smart investing. And Nicolas Darvas is my investing hero.He made all the mistakes that all of us make, and you&#65533;ll chuckle a lot as you watch him plod through all the mistakes you&#65533;ve already made or may be about to make. Then he hits on his system, makes a lot of money, gets very humanly egotistical and even arrogant about it, and almost loses it all as he gives in to overconfidence and the other very human emotions which are an investor&#65533;s worst enemy. Finally he learns to separate emotion out and leave discipline in. It is the only way to make this system work.Also, don&#65533;t forget that this is a combination of technical AND fundamental investing &#65533; stocks are located by technical signals, but are further analyzed fundamentally (if only to a minimal degree) before being considered as buy candidates.This book reads like a highly entertaining novel &#65533; it&#65533;s hysterical when news of his success leaks out and TIME magazine sends three different sets of editors down to interview him and study his system before they finally decide he is for real and end up printing his story and putting him on the front cover. Which is what eventually lead to the demand for this must-have, must-read classic.Darvas is legendary, and with good reason. Find out why.P.S. Buying this book with How To Make Money In Stocks by William J. O'Neil is a perfect combination, as O'Neil, the founder of Investor's Business Daily, helps clarify, and builds on, Darvas's techniques, although - shame, shame - he doesn't give him credit."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Nicolas Darvas wrote \\"How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market\\" in 1960, shortly after he had made over $2,000,000 trading stocks in a little over 18 months. But the story starts in 1952, when Darvas, a ballroom dancer by profession, acquired his first stock in a Canadian mining company almost inadvertently. He sold it at a profit, and he was hooked. But Darvas knew nothing about the stock market. He learned everything the hard way, and that's what makes this book interesting. Darvas is a colorful, overbearing, but frank character, and he takes us through his quest to figure out how to make money in the stock market step by painful step.Darvas divides his learning experience into 4 parts. At first he was \\"The Gambler\\", acting on tips and impulses. That failed. Then he got serious and became \\"The Fundamentalist\\", reading annual reports, listening to analysts, and investing accordingly. That failed. So he became \\"The Technician\\", developing his own method of anticipating a rise in stock price, which he called \\"box theory\\". He wasn't losing much money, but he wasn't making much either. Finally Darvas devised a method of predicting stock price movement that incorporated all of his hard-learned lessons. He became \\"The Techno-Fundamentalist\\". He selected stocks based on earning prospects for their sector, but bought the leaders in their sector only when price movement looked promising according to his box theory.Nicolas Darvas comes to the same conclusions in \\"How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market\\" that many other books on trading or short term investment have for nearly a century. He's a short term investor, not a trader, who advises you to: follow the trend in price movement, buy in pyramid fashion, cut losses quickly, never buy on tips or advice, and never try to sell at the top. He may as well be Gerald Loeb or Bernard Baruch in the 1930s. But a few things make this book interesting: Darvas failed a lot while he went through various investment philosophies that many aspiring investors can identify with. He created his \\"box theory\\" from scratch, which yields much the same information as tracking support and resistance on a candlestick chart. Best of all, his story is unusually entertaining. Darvas made most of his money while on a 2-year world tour with his dance act. He received stock information daily by telegram, in code, and communicated his orders to his brokers while on the move. His mysterious cables often aroused suspicions of espionage in foreign telegraph offices. I found the whole thing hilarious.\\"How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market\\" is only 129 pages long. Some additional material is included at the end of the book: Darvas tells the story of his 1959 interview with a \\"New York Times\\" reporter. There is a section containing examples, with comments, of the cables Darvas sent from far flung locations around the world. There are candlestick charts for the stocks from which Darvas profited the most. And there is a Q&A; section in which Darvas answers the questions most commonly asked by his readers. The paper the book is printed on is super-cheap, and the text isn't centered properly on the pages. Not a quality publication, but it's readable."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"I am somewhat puzzled about how THIS book became a \\"classic\\". Mr. Darvas, \\"world famous dancer\\" with no training in stock trading starts out with a $3,000 investment in 1952 that would turn into a $2,250,000 fortune by July of 1959. All this was done via telegraphs from Saigon through Paris to New York to wherever else he was invited to perform. This process included some weird technicality called \\"stock-right bonus purchase option\\"; a desperate over-the-counter buying frenzy of a trade-suspended stock when short sellers made a bad call and some other exotic stories. Also, it should be noted that the author traded using various margins that significantly increased his leverage. (By the end he had more than $500k working capital along with a $3,500/week \\"regular\\" income.)It is a hilarious, amusing story and you enjoy reading it till the very end, when you suddenly come to realize you must have had missed something. This book gives you very little factual knowledge about the Darvas system. In fact, the author had to attach an explanatory appendix to the end of the book, trying to clarify some quite fuzzy concepts (AND referring to his second book!). Reading the rest of the reviews here reveals that many reviewers read this second book from the author that attempted to further clarify the method.But what is the method? Volume action? Price action? It is a \\"techno-fundamentalist approach\\", without any further explanation of what fundamentals are actually considered. (He refers a lot to reading this and that in Barron's...but what?) What is an \\"Expensive-but-cheap, high velocity stock\\"? And what is really \\"techno\\" about it? His \\"boxes\\"? You never figure out how he picked the successful stocks to begin with (\\"It began to emerge from the swamp of sinking stocks like a beacon...I was watching another stock whose action was fascinating to me...\\") Then, let's not forget that the author never fully explained his so called \\"feel\\" for some stocks and his \\"mental charting\\" technic. Well, try to emulate that one! A little additional clarification of this instead of the 10 pages of (worthless) telegraph copies and those 7 extra, empty pages could have gone a long way.Overall, this book is an entertaining read. And yes, the author was a real person, 39 years old at the time of his interview in the May 25, 1959 issue of Time Magazine. As far as classic, that title I would reserve for a book like \\"Winning on Wall Street\\" from Martin Zweig."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This is probably my favorite book on maneuvering in the stock market. If you read William O'neill's &quot;How to make Money in Stocks&quot;, which is also excellent, you will find he uses and expands upon many of Darvas' principles. O'neill also lists it as one of his top ten must reads on the stock market. Darvas' rules for cutting losses have helped me to limit my losses from 2 to 5 percent on average. I have avoided some serious losses from time to time(some up to 75 percent) by using Darvas' principles and cutting my losses quickly and have avoided avery market downturn in the last two years. While everyone was in distress about the '98 bear market, I was comfortably on the sidelines with my funds in cash thanks to this wonderful book. If more stars were available to rate this book, I surely would have given them. By the way, they're out of print, but if you can get Darvas' other books, &quot;Wall Street-The Other Las Vegas&quot; and &quot;You Can Still Make it the Market&quot;, these are other followups that are just as good as &quot;How I Made $2,000,000&quot; and will really drive the points of his methods home."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"From reading the cover, this book sounds like the very key to winning a fortune in the financial markets. The Holy Grail maybe? I would not count on that.Let's look at two of the book's principal tactics:1. Very tight stops (a fraction of a point)Mr. Darvas acknowledges that his method will stop you out very frequently. In fact, a reader sends in a comment (back of the book) that this tactic will stop you out more than 90% of the time. The reader calls it \\"useless\\"2. Stocks must be trading at an all-time high and be growth stocks that have suddenly made an \\"unusual\\" move.Mr. Darvas acknowledges that this eliminates more than 90% of all stocks as trading candidates.Let's look at how Nicolas Darvas turned $36,000 into $2,000,000:Jones & Laughlin: Bet the farm on this stock, plus used margin. After two weeks sold out at a loss of 25% of his account. It took Darvas TWO YEARS to recoup his 25% loss. Not good.E.L. Bruce: Bet the farm on this stock and used margin. This stock rose 250% in a couple of months. $300K profitUniversal Products: Bet half of his trading capital on this stock and used margin. Held for a few months. Stock rose 300%. $400k profitThiokol Chemical: Bet half of his trading capital on this stock and used margin. Held for a few months. Stock rose 300%. $900K profit.As you can see, Nicolas Darvas was betting the farm on his trades and using margin to the hilt. The VAST MAJORITY of his $2 million profit came from just the above three winning trades. But he made hundreds of trades during this time. There is surely an element of luck here...Darvas had read up on the stock market extensively and had years of experience by the time he hit his three big winners. He was not trading on ignorance at this point. The market was at the tail end of a bear market when he figured out that the volatile growth stocks are bound to rocket early in the recovery. He acted on this and it worked this one time.Does the Darvas method sound like the answer to making a speculating fortune? Well, at least it sounds simple enough. Pick stocks that are gonna rise 300% in just a few months and then shoot the works. That's all! You'll either make a killing or be killed."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This book is recommended by William J. O'Neil and other authors of Investor's Business Daily...I thoroughly enjoyed Darvas' explanation of how he went through the process of learning to invest. Many features of his strategy are embodied in the method popularized by O'Neil in How To Make Money In Stocks. Darvas' gives the investor a way to decided when to buy or sell stocks without getting bogged down in a bunch of technical indicators. The old adage of \\"buy low, sell high\\" is greatly misused and misunderstood. The danger of following this idea is buying a stock when the company founders because the stock's price is low, usually having dropped 20-80% and having a low PE. Darvas didn't follow this strategy. He always checked out the financial strength of a company then waited for the stock price to move from a lower \\"box\\" (as defined by Darvas) to a higher box. This is similar to O'Neil's strategy of buying when a stock hits a new high, shucking weak investors. Darvas would hold a stock as long as it remained in the box or moved into a higher one. When the stock price faltered and began descending into the next lower box, he sold out.One very special feature of Darvas' book that makes it so valuable is the recapitulation of each stock he bought on his way to making $2 million (and investor today would have to make at least 10 times as much to match Darvas). He shows his wins and losses and what he did to improve his technique.Successfuly investing is not based on the nearly mindless, lazy approach of \\"buy and hold.\\" One could have bought a Dow Blue Chip darling of Bethlehem Steel near its peak of $23 3/8 in Jan '94 and held it until today at $4, or worse bought it in 1983 near $30 and watched it meander down and up with lower lows and lower highs to the present. Clearly, buy and hold is not a good strategy unless one constantly reviews the fundamentals of the company.Darvas' strategy is clearly a winning method that kept him in strong performing stocks and got him out of losers that other people hung onto for years, e.g., Coca Cola."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"I rarely give 5 star reviews but this book was truly an enjoyable read that taught me alot. Here are the key lessons:1). ALWAYS have a stop loss order in place when you buy stocks, about $1.50 to $2.00 under your purchase price, this safeguards you against the huge losses people experience in a bear market.2). Watch unexpected volume surges in stocks that push the price up, this is a sign that other investors know something that you do not.You can partner with insiders and people in the know with out knowing what is really driving the price.3). Never sell a stock that is rising in price.Only sell on declines.4). Watch price boxes that develop in stocks, if a stock is trading at $66 to $70 for 6 months then suddenly goes to $72 it is likely the sign of a new price range box, buy at break outs.5). Take emotion out of tading set your rules and follow them.6). Stay away from the rumors and mob mentality of Wall Street, get your information from Barron's weekly and daily quotes, everything else just leads to confusion.7). Watch stock prices and go with the patterns you watch develop.8). Look for the break away stocks that will make you rich, trade the stocks that are at their 52 week high if they are growth stocks and if they appear to be breaking new highs.Darvas has an entertaining writing style and gets to the point. 5 strong stars, this is great information to tie in with what can be learned from Warren Buffet, Benjamin Graham, Philip Fisher, William O'Neal and Jim Cramer."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Back in 1980, I came across a copy of the original version of this book in a used book store. I can't begin to tell you how much I enjoyed it. I had been floundering around in the stock market for a year or two, and suddenly, after reading this book, I knew what I was up against, and why it was so hard.This book is one of my favorite books of all time, on any subject. It's an absolute must read for anyone interested in stock trading. William O'Neill's methods as used in Investors Business Daily, is mostly based on Darvas' method, and Jesse Livermore's.I'm not going to repeat all the details that can be found in other reviews, but I would like to add a few things.The first one is this quote by Darvas, that was the culmination of all the trials and tribulations that had gone on before:\\"The only sound reason for my buying a stock is that it is rising in price. If that is happening, no other reason is necessary. If that is not happening, no other reason is worth considering.\\"I point this out because anybody who has ever bought an IBD 100 stock knows that all of the stocks at the top of the list are stocks that have been rising in the immediate past. I also point this quote out, because of my next point.Two, the Darvas method, like the IBD method ONLY works in rising markets. In sideways or down markets, you can get creamed. In my 30+ years of trading, I've tended to use this method MUCH LESS than other methods, for the simple reason that it doesn't work year in and year out, and that one tends to buy stocks at the top so that you're forced to keep selling stocks you just boought.Sure, when it works, man is it great. I guess if a person only used it at the right times it would be wonderful, but year in and year out you are constantly faced with times when it doesn't work very well.Even Darvas lost huge amounts of money after writing this book, and the next one in 1964. By time he wrote \\"You can still make millions in the market\\" in 1977 you could tell he was a beaten man when he ventured back into the market.C.C. Hazard (pseudonymn), in his book \\"Confessions of a Wall Street Insider\\" {1972} talks about how no method really works all that well over time. As a life long stock broker, he saw it all. One time (around the time of the writing of his book) he had a broker friend of his check on Darvas' account balance. He wasn't surprised to find that Darvas had lost most of his money that he made in the 60s.Also, I was amazed to see that Darvas' estate (or whoever owns the rights to the story) has published so many other books recently. Why would they need to do that? I would think they would be using his method to make millions in the stock market, wouldn't you?So, BEWARE of this method and the IBD method. Over the long run you will find that they work less often than they don't."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Nearly everything has a crude origin and, as time passes, becomes refined and developed. Mankind didn't start communicating by beaming an email to the other side of the country in a matter of seconds, rather, we used horse-bound messengers and slow-moving trains to make contact with others in distant places. Mankind didn't begin by driving to a restaurant and ordering a steak but rather, by going out and growing or hunting down food and cooking it over an open fire. Likewise, investors did not begin trading by typing a ticker symbol into a software program and picking a buy point on a bar chart based on well-established technical analysis patterns, rather, they bought stocks based solely on fundamental analysis.After years of losing money in the market by taking others' advice and by using fundamental analysis as his sources for picking stocks, Nicolas Darvas developed technical analysis theories based on volume and price movement. Thanks to people like Darvas, who use their creative thoughts to question well-established principles when they believe them to be incorrect, traders now have a greater understanding of how to use technical analysis to make money.In How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market, Darvas describes how he would follow stocks and watch them bounce inside \\"boxes\\" of various shapes and sizes. Darvas would buy stocks as they were moving out of the top of their box and he would sell stocks if they fell out of the bottom of their box. Some of the other major lessons that Darvas learned during his journey to success include:Only buy stocks that are in a consolidation, or better yet, focus only on stocks that are breaking out of a consolidation area.Always place stop-loss orders just under the bottom of the consolidation area and use trailing stops to lock in swiftly made profits.Develop your own successful system based on principles you know to be true and which you have confidence in.When you find a system that you believe in and which is successful you should not allow others to influence you. Stick to your proven, successful plan and don't be influenced by others.Traders should focus on only a few stocks. Darvas traded no more than 3 stocks at a time and his account was well over $1 million.Volume spikes on up days indicate that there is a large interest in the company and that future advances are likely.How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market by Nicolas Darvas is an entertaining and thought-provoking book about how a man with no background in business (Davis was a professional ballroom dancer) used his own trading system based on technical analysis to turn $10,000 into more than $2 million by focusing on price action. This book is a great read for students of trading or for people who enjoy the burst of hope that often accompanies reading about the success of others."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This is the best book I have read on trading. I read the whole thing in one day. Darvas's story is facinating. He slowly became successful at trading while persuing a profession traveling the world as a ballroom dancer. I love the fact that while he was isolated from the market, traveling around the world he could trade successfully via telegrams. Once Darvas got back to New York he set up an office in a brokerage to get \\"serious\\". What he found was, he was affected by all the market \\"noise\\" (daily market fluctuations, peoples opinions in the office, etc.) and immediately started losing money.Luckily he was smart and intentionally isolated himself from the market \\"noise\\" again, and began making money again. $2,000,000.Also, I highly recommend William O'Neil's \\"How to Make Money In Stocks\\"."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This is a wonderful book and an easy read. The book is not written from a technical standpoint but is written as a story. Mr. Darvas talks about his box theory which some people call trading in a range. He talks about his emotion and how he left his emotions out of the stockmarket. He talks about how he made money on the stockmarket while traveling the world using the newspaper and his box theory to decide on purchases. He talks about how information such as stock tips almost ruined him. Not because it was bad information but because no one can truly predict the stockmarket. He even shows you his actual figures on some of the purchases he made and backs it up with copys of transaction receipts. This book will leave you inspired with a smile on your face. Highly recommended especially for the price."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"The three reasons why this 40 year old book is still the most exciting stock market story ever told are: 1) Mr. Darvas's innate storytelling acumen, 2) his honesty about his hubris and gullibility, and 3) the happy ending, in which he hits the jackpot. Best of all, he wins because of his determination, not a fairy godmother. This book is a must-read for individuals considering managing their own money, but investors and speculators should beware that it was written strictly for your entertainment; Mr. Darvas makes no attempt to teach the reader how to achieve his enviable profits. For those who wish to try, do so at your own risk (I must confess: I am trying. Wish me luck!)"},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This is the most down to earth book i ever read, David ryan(market wizard top trader) is right.the book look corny to read but once you start to read it, you can't drop it..it's fun and you can learn a ton...... any more book similar to this that you can recommend... drop me a note.."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This book was interesting to read as a success story, however when it comes to points on how to invest in the stock market - it's almost useless. It seems that the guy was almost lucky to pick the stocks that skyrocketed. He describes the events very carefully, but when it comes to details on HOW he actually picked the stocks he fails to give up the most important information."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"I found myself rereading several times to try to understand how his &quot;box theory&quot; works. The author does an extremely poor job of explaining the most important part of the book as is evident by the questions posed by other readers in the Appendix. He focuses too much on the story and not enough on the technique."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"\\"Box theories\\" and techno-fundamentalism aside, this book is an enjoyable ride through the swinging 1950s and 60s. Even if Darvas was successful, one has to imagine luck played some role. (He admittedly lost plenty before hitting it big with just a few choice picks.) In any case, some variables have changed (trading regulations) and others were always going to be risky (using margin heavily). On the other hand, getting up-to-date stock information nowadays would be A LOT easier, though surely Investor's Business Daily would be favored over Barron's.None of this minimizes the readability of the book. Following Darvas as he dances around the world, reading his cryptic telegrams voyeuristically, wondering if many of the companies in which he invested are even still in business, all makes for a great read. And there *are* nuggets of wisdom (\\"Whenever a trade was successful I praised myself; when I lost, I blamed it on the broker\\"). But there is also a lot of ego and plenty of grey area (\\"I could 'feel' my stocks...It was a marvelous, unexplainable instinct\\").All in all, one of the most fun investing books I have seen. In terms of rating this book, I think it depends on your expectations:Expect an entertaining biography (and a fast read, at that) and you will be pleased.Expect the secret to unlocking millions of dollars in stock market profits and you will be disappointed.NOTE: The current edition for sale here is a reprint, through Martino Fine Books, who I have never heard of. Maybe best to just pick up a used copy."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"To the naysayers and the non-believers, this book is the convincing testament that it is unquestionably possible to BEAT THE STOCK MARKET without a single shred of doubt. Moreover, not only is it possible but also quite feasible for ANY TRADERS who are supremely discipline in their trading operations to achieve their wildest trading euphoria. If you identify yourselves as strong opponents of Efficient Market Hypothesis Theorists and Random Walkers and truly desire to knock out the stock market BIG in its own ring, you owe to yourselves to carefully read and study this book several times(at least three times)."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Its easy to see why this book has become a classic. Darvas writes with a style that's both entertaining and enlightening. And he proves with his actual buy/sell statements that a simple technical analysis method can work if applied with discipline and combined with good money management techniques. Furthermore, contrary to what some reviewers say, much of his success occurred in flat to down market periods.Even though we are presently in a severe multi-year bear market, its a good time to study techniques and prepare for better times - EVERY bear market in history has been followed by a bull market. For more on the money management aspect, and why its actually more important than a good entry/exit method, I recommend Tharp's Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom. Its a real eye opener."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"What more do you want? Drama, inspiration and timeless ideas all wrapped up into a thoroughly readable autobiography. The lessons taken are that two stigmatized investment approaches - concentration and momentum investing - can have their place as long as you are disciplined in your stop-limit orders. The precise mechanics of the &quot;box method&quot; are fuzzy at best. Despite this flaw, the book is a gem. It sits proudly in my library despite the Wade Cookish like title."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"It is just so interesting to read how Darvas started in stock market investing. First, he was clueless about the stock market so he was asking others for hot tips. Since they were all amateurs, these tips did not bring him much success. So he moved on to asking professionals for hot tips. To his surprise, they did not work either. Reading his story makes me laugh because people still keep doing this even though there is so much information available now on the stock market. All it takes is a trip to the bookstore. When Darvas was playing the stock market, he had to learn the hard way because of the lack of information.After failing, he needed to learn how to think for himself. He developed a techno-fundamentalist theory where he decided to take a 20-year view. This did not mean he wanted to hold the stock for 20 years. It meant that the stocks had a bright future. This is just a fabulous story of a person who started with zero knowledge and built himself up to a successful operator. I recommend this book to any investor.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"I'm new to investing and trading, I will admit it, I've been doing it for a few months now, and I started with only a thousand dollars, even though Darvas once said that if you don't have five thousand you shouldn't even step in--though I'd say that was probably because the cost of the commission made it so much more difficult. I've read this book four times, once out loud to my mother who has also opened an account, and used this strategy with William O'Neil's CANSLIM to start growing her retirement, already up five thousand from the twenty thousand account she opened.This book helped me spot stocks like FUQI at ten to fifteen, STEC at twenty. I had lost five hundred dollars of my thousand before I found this book and started reading it, with it, I was able to use it to catch the trend upwards on Borders Group and ALD from April to May which turned my five hundred into twelve hundred. Through a series of stocks, I'm up to nearly three thousand, I also put a little money in the account, about a hundred and twenty, for full disclosure, but this book is excellent. I understood it right off the bat, and along with William O'Neil, I have been very profitable. I bought fifty shares of STEC it up to thirty four, FUQI is up to twenty five and I bought a hundred shares of that. I'm up to nearly five thousand dollars. This small bull market has been doing me great, and I've been prospering in it, making sure to keep my stop losses reasonably close so not to give back all my profits. I have taken a lot of losses, nearly fifteen hundred dollars worth of losses, but I've always made that back with my winners. I was trading small cap until I had a good deal of money, and used to get stopped out at thirty five cents daily.This book should be required reading for anyone considering getting into stocks, its an uplifting story, its entertaining, its fun, it lets you get a good look into the work it takes to become very profitable in the stock market.The rules I come away from with this book are simple.1: You're going to be wrong half the time if not more, so always make sure you cut your losses.2: Only buy into rising stocks.3: Use volume, new products, earning growth, and price to decide if the stock is about to move.4: Never listen to the news or analysts, they're human and can be just as wrong as you, and their information is usually late and of no use.5: Annual Reports and Company Records mean nothing about the companies future.I've used these rules and I plan to keep using these rules. This is an excelent book, and at 8.99,7.99, its too cheap not to buy."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"For some one who is interested in investing in the stock market using technical analysis, this is a great book.

I came to this belief after reading this book. Mr. Darvas's failures in reaping profit in the stock market when employing only the fundamental or technical approach is clearly evident in the book. He later realizes the importance of both approaches and uses both to make $2 million dollars. He terms it \\"techno-fundamentalist method.\\"He also used volume(trade) and price to find the potential stock. He would ask for the price of a stock from a broker when there was a sudden significant increase in the volume(trade) or price of a stock. A sudden increase in the volume(trade)implies that many investors are dumping and trading their stocks which Darvas saw as a key to exponential price increase. Seeing this as an advantage, he jumps in and buys the stock after couple days of price increase. A smart move, as he made a huge profit. Another useful approach he used to make profit in the stock market was his \\"Box-Theory.\\" He employed this approach primarily to control his fear of losing alot of money in the stock market.

I had to radically change my approach about one year ago, as I, very foolishly, let the market whip me around the summer of 2011. The path and history the author had to take was reminiscent of mine (except for reaching $2 MM - yet!), and, so, it was very illuminating and encouraging.Some key insights for an individual investor are:- Never take big losses. Darvas had to struggle and lost when he was not doing right. But even then, he was able to limit the size of losses by getting out of losing positions relatively quickly (usually after a few points down). From what I read, he never averaged down, and remained very disciplined. Averaging down or sticking with losing positions is, as Darvas says, a pure gamble that should never be allowed. I had to admit this was one of my most egregious mistakes till a year ago.- Study price charts carefully. Be patient and observant, and let the market (- not news media) tell you new trends. Become a partner with the smart money that moves the market and identifies leaders. Again, until a year ago or so, I was too anxious to find and enter market bottoms - such a useless exercise!- Let winners run as long and far up as possible. You must learn how to keep winning trades if you want to make big profits. I tend to get too nervous and be quick to close winning positions, only to realize later that it was just a minor correction. I still think, though, it's good to take some profit if your gains get huge in order to secure a psychological advantage, but you will need to see whether your stock's character still remains OK to hold.Lastly, I read this book because it was one of the readings suggested by Daniel Zanger (- Google him), and I agree it is totally worth reading for all swing traders. For me, this book was an affirmation of the direction where I'm seeking to establish my trading method."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"I nearly made 4x times on my trading capital between 2003 & 2005 following the Darvas approach. The method works best in a strong market but will show profits in weak markets. This book is a must read for all traders and compliments other great books by Livermore, Wychoff, O'Neil, Baruch, Loeb. All these traders bought new highs and avoided bottom fishing cheap stocks.

It is basically a biography of an entertainer who decided he wanted to learn about the stock market in the 1950s & 1960s. He did very well, as the title indicates. He describes the ups and downs of trading and learning the ropes before online trading was possible. He travels the world as an entertainer and it's really interesting to find out how he was able to keep in touch with his broker and convey his desired trades by telegram from far-flung cities all around the world. The most useful thing I got from the book was the way that he often decides what he wants to buy shares in partly by keeping up with when a stock kept 'in the zone' so to speak, which is to say if it rises above either above or below its channel line for more than a few days, it's time to seriously consider getting out of this stock. Another thing I found interesting was that he never really pays much attention to the daily volume. As a student of the CANSLIM method, this seems really foreign to me. I would never attempt to trade without having a good idea of the daily volume. Something that I found rather amusing was that when he finally moved to NYC, that is, close to Wall Street, where he can really monitor what's going on, he lets his emotions and other people influence his decisions more than ever, and he starts doing poorly in the market. When he realizes what's happening and just watches the stock charts once again, he does much better. With all that being said, I would have appreciated if he had described more of his 'techniques' and the true mechanics of how he decides what to buy and sell and fewer interesting stories and anecdotes. The book does have quite a few stock charts in the back, and it's interesting to see just how well he does on certain trades."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"...into how someone with no stock trading experience was able to develop a trading system and make it big.

That's the whole book in a nutshell. If your more interested in strategy than entertainment you may find the book drags a bit, but it is a small book. The one thing dangerous about this book is that the author makes heavy use of leverage which is very risky. His whole success really stemmed from one very very lucky trade where there was an incredible short squeeze due to someone trying to take over the company which he had no premonition of - just very lucky timing. A beginning investor could take this success story to heart and go leverage themselves to the hilt and create a disaster."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"An amusing little read - - but buy O'Neil's book on how to make money in the stock market if you really want to get into the detail."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This book laid the foundation for the type of investing I do today.

So that got me interested because I agreed with the author.Then he talks about his box system.The idea is that he abandoned any fundamental analysis and just looked for stocks that (for unknown reasons) happen to be STEADILY (day after day) rising in price. The strength of Darvas'es system is not in some special indicators, but in trading WELL BEHAVED stocks.Here is what I like about the book:1) He doesn't use ANY technical indicators, not even a moving average. He just uses \\"boxes\\" - trading ranges, defined by support/resistance lines. No moving averages, no MACD, no Bollinger bands... nothing! Just volume and price ranges (\\"boxes\\"). Because he doesn't use indicators, his system is simple.2) It's very humorous that he advises to trade long term, and not trade short term (\\"don't jump in and out of the market like a grasshopper\\"). I agree with him. On the short term charts, the profits are smaller and the trader needs to spend more time monitoring the trade.3) I believe that his \\"box\\" system can be used in the FOREX market, for example trading the GBP/USD on the 1 hour chart.4) The book is funny and he even talks about his girlfriend Julia, who sometimes is cheating on him.5) In the search engine Google, under the \\"image search\\", I found pictures of Nicolas Darvas and his dancing partner Julia.6) In the international movie database imdb, I found information that Darvas and Julia actually star in a 1950's movie called \\"Toast of the Town\\". They play themselves. (This is not related to trading, but I think it's funny trivia.)7) The book gives me hope that I too may become rich, although this will not happen soon.Here is what I don't like about the book:1) He doesn't talk about the FOREX market. This is because in Darvas'es time, the FOREX didn't exist yet.2) He is saying that the London Stock Exchange doesn't provide enough info to be used with his system. This is old information, because the London Stock exchange does provide enough information now.3) He believes that volume breakouts can help you find stocks that will go up. However, I don't think that volume is a very strong indicator. (And in FOREX there is no volume data available).4) He states that if you have less than $5,000 you shouldn't get started trading. This is old news. There are mini accounts, both FOREX and CFD, where you can start with only $500, or even less.5) The book is an autobiography, not a trading tutorial.Overall: buy and try this book. But I personally will apply it on the FOREX market, because the FOREX gives me more leverage, liquidity and 24 hr trading. I just \\"made\\" more than 700 pips on a GBP/USD long trade. But it is only in my demo account for now. Hopefully, when I'm fully confident, I'll do it with real money.P.S. In case you didn't know, Nicolas Darvas died in 1977."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"A tiny book, but absolutely loaded with timeless wisdom on trading, which is hard to find in books written today. Written in a very straightforward and candid way, this book outlines essential lessons such as: the importance of the price action of a stock - not the news - in making trading decisions. Darvas humorously demonstrates this point by explaining that when he bought a newspaper, he would rip out the page containing the stock prices and throw the rest of the paper in the trash.Another key lesson comes from how Darvas prospered when he was thousands of miles from Wall Street and received only periodic updates on his stocks, but disastrously lost money when he was in a vortex of information, rumours and news trading in New York. Bottom line: you don't need to be glued to 5 computer screens or watch Twitter feeds all day to make money trading.This book is worth 5 starts for these lessons, but one drawback about this book is that, in my opinion, there are not enough charts. It would have been nice if the author provided some charts to demonstrate visually the price action of the stocks that he traded. Other than that though, this book is a classic.->Danny Merkel->Charting Trends Blog"},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"The only useful technique of his that can be used in today's market is his box technique; A.K.A support and resistance lines. If you know about them (and quite frankly what new trader doesn't) then this book is a waste of time unless you want to read something that isn't going to tax your brain.The reason I gave it two stars is this book turned out to be a break for me from reading a lot of rather intensely technical books, and I was able to tackle the next book on my list feeling a bit refreshed without having lost my rhythm for reading stock trading books.Things have changed since the 1950's. There is so much irrelevance in this book for today's market, and that which is relevant is available to learn in almost any other book written this century.If you spot this at a garage sale then spend the 10 cents to satisfy your curiosity, otherwise don't waste your time if you are more interested in learning something useful from a book."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"The most important question of this book is this:How did Nicholas Darvas made two million dollarsin the stock market?

Did not mix with the crowd and was a lone wolf6. Used trailing stops and stop-loss orders7. Used both Fundamental (FA) and Technical Analysis (TA)8. Adopted a cold and objective approachI am not so impressed with the box theory. Itsounds like a rectangle or triangle in today'scontext. It was not well defined in the book.It was best that he illustrated the theory withpictures.I still give this book four stars for this in hisbook:FA only tells you of the past and present.

The point of this book is to teach some fundamental rules and understandings that are necessary in order to succeed in trading stocks. And the good news is that it teaches these ideas in a way that even a 12 year old child can understand.If you're looking for point by point steps on how to trade this guy's system, the book will probably disappoint.

Not because the author happened to make a lot of money in a short time, but because it gives real insight into what it takes to trade successfully in a very difficult environment that most fail at. It is a short read but manages to encapsulate the key aspects of technical analysis, trading psychology, devising and sticking rigidly to a trading plan and risk management. It shows the pitfalls by real experience of ignoring or mismanaging any of these aspects."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"For newcomers interested in share trading, Nicolas Darvas' account of his exploits in the stock market is highly recommended. While not containing anywhere near the level of technical detail of other books, 'How I Made 2 Million...' has several advantages for the beginner:Firstly, Darvas himself is a financial \\"layman\\" (he was a dancer by profession), and therefore appreciates exactly how intimidating the financial markets can be for outsiders. Also, his language is very straightforward and easy to read; he explains his experiences in the market very clearly, never becoming bogged down in technical jargon or complicated formulae.Even more importantly, during his initial forays into the stock market, he makes exactly the sorts of mistakes most new traders are guilty of: over-trading, impulse trading, reliance on rumours and tips, cutting his profits short, and spending every waking moment worrying about the slightest price movement. In fact, I'd almost suggest the first part of the book is the most important, as Darvas shows beginners (through his own errors) exactly what NOT to do.As the book progresses, Darvas begins developing and refining his system. His method is a bit primitive by modern standards, but many of its principles remain sound; essentially, the Darvas Box is a simple form of Stage Analysis. Once again, Darvas shows newcomers through his own mistakes what not to do once you've had a few successes. He highlights the problems of over-confidence, believing you have a \\"feel\\" for the market, and trying to over-think things that are best kept simple. It's only once Darvas develops the discipline to stick with his system that the money comes rolling in.As great as this book is, it is very important to emphasise, however, that this is not a substitute for a proper technical reference. Darvas' method is brilliant in its simplicity, but only touches the surface of technical analysis. To succeed in the market long-term, there are many more skills, techniques and indicators that need to be learnt. Please do not start to trade using only this book as a guide; rather, use it as a jumping off point for more detailed books by Stan Weinstein or (if you're Australian) Louise Bedford.With the above proviso, I would strongly recommend this as an easy-to-understand introduction to those who have an interest in becoming traders."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"It is just so interesting to read how Darvas started in stock market investing. First, he was clueless about the stock market so he was asking others for hot tips. Since they were all amateurs, these tips did not bring him much success. So he moved on to asking professionals for hot tips. To his surprise, they did not work either. Reading his story makes me laugh because people still keep doing this even though there is so much information available now on the stock market. All it takes is a trip to the bookstore. When Darvas was playing the stock market, he had to learn the hard way because of the lack of information.After failing, he needed to learn how to think for himself. He developed a techno-fundamentalist theory where he decided to take a 20-year view. This did not mean he wanted to hold the stock for 20 years. It meant that the stocks had a bright future. This is just a fabulous story of a person who started with zero knowledge and built himself up to a successful operator.

I read this book numerous time and I never get bored. I have always referred back to this book for advice. I admired the author on his independent thinking and studying the complex stock market.

Darvas stocks went up 400%. If you have the knack to pick up those stocks in a bull market, good for you, otherwise really be CAUTIOUS when trying out this system.Simple system:1. Buy on breakout2. Stops placed are subjective (based on how he felt the strength of the market is)3. Use Trailing stop-losses4. Stocks selected should be in a 'future' industry eg GM, Chrysler during that time as opposed to railway stocks (though I don't believe this is strictly adhered to in his stock picks)Also, the stocks you pick must not have a tendency to retrace when they are moving up, otherwise I'm pretty positive your trailing stop-losses will be hit 90% of the time and won't let your profits run as much.I'm highly skeptical and I've been in the market for 15 years"},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"I would say the 'box' theory in this book may be new at the time it published, but it is really the very basic support and resistence concept that we should all know a few months into trading seriously.It is a good read about the author's path from amateur to a knowledgeble trader, with a system of his own after many expensive lessons. The path would sound familar to most of us.I learnt from this book not so much in whether the 'box' system will work or not, but confirming again that without a system that you trusted and tested will be like drifting in a wide ocean with rumurs and news.I will not take the box system as my system, but I am thinking of shuting many channels of news and information, which are mostly noises.

Nick Darvas started out with no knowledge and learned from scratch going through the normal phases most go through. First gambling on stocks through tips, and random choice. After that not working he tried the value approach investing in companies with great balance sheets and P/E ratios versus other stocks. After all his frustration he just started buying companies that advanced in price and reached all time highs after forming solid price bases. This worked, he would place buy-stops on stocks for when they broke out of there boxes and would use trailing stops to allow them to run. He stayed away from rumors and the market while it was open and only bet on the winning stocks. I have made $1,000s when I have traded like Darvas. He is one of the models that William O'Neal used to build the IBD system which has been successful for numerous investors. Buy this book and use the mehtods, I have a a trading account that proves it works.Here are the main points of his system:1). ALWAYS have a stop loss order in place when you buy stocks, about $1.50 to $2.00 under your purchase price, this safeguards you against the huge losses people experience in a bear market.2). Watch unexpected volume surges in stocks that push the price up, this is a sign that other investors know something that you do not.You can partner with insiders and people in the know with out knowing what is really driving the price.3). Never sell a stock that is rising in price.Only sell on declines.4). Watch price boxes that develop in stocks, if a stock is trading at $66 to $70 for 6 months then suddenly goes to $72 it is likely the sign of a new price range box, buy at break outs.5). Take emotion out of tading set your rules and follow them.6). Stay away from the rumors and mob mentality of Wall Street, get your information from IBD weekly on Monday (darvas used Barron's)and daily quotes, everything else just leads to confusion.7). Watch stock prices and go with the patterns you watch develop.8). Look for the break away stocks that will make you rich, trade the stocks that are at their 52 week high if they are growth stocks and if they appear to be breaking new highs.Darvas has an entertaining writing style and gets to the point. 5 strong stars."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"The evolution of the little trader from clueless to breakeven to profitable.

They wanted an easy way to profit from the market of the post-war era without suffering the losses tat the previous generation did in the 1930's. Its secret for success (as a book)was to tell an empathetic story that novice/failed traders could relate to and promise them a simple solution. Top the story off with a $2,000,000 happy ending, and you've got the makings for a bestseller.It's a formula that still works. This book seems rather popular with most of its reviewers.Darvas's autobiographical book, unfortunately, has a large element of fiction. It is a not-too-well kept secret that he greatly exaggerated the degree of his success as an investor--which diminishes his credibility. It is not that the ideas of buying stocks that are moving up or cutting your losses quickly are bad ideas, it is that such ideas should not be confused with having any understanding about the market. If stock prices were random: (1) the technique of cutting one's losses quickly would improve your results nonetheless, and (2) the idea of buying a stock that was moving up (a higher box) would be rendered meaningless.Don't look for deep investment wisdom here. Look for a story about a trader that you may find amusing. Keep in mind that you don't always get the straight story about someone's level of trading success--now or when this book was written."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"It is clear to me that many reviewers just don't understand how valuable this book can be to some readers. I read the fifth printing of the original book in 1961. It introduced me to many good, simple trading techniques that are still valid four and a half decades later. Of course, new on-line brokers and data services have gone far beyond what Darvas had to work with. However, all the bells and whistles of the internet that people can get hooked on, and I certainly am, can make one lose sight of the simple basics.Darvas introduces buying strong stocks on the way up and then setting stop losses, although maybe tighter than I do. He introduces box trading that some traders might look at as \\"just\\" breakouts from support and supply areas. It is similar to what I now think of as cluster analysis in my trading. He introduces the importance of volume and volume breakouts and how confusing it can be when letting profits ride.After I recently saw that some seminar guru recommended it as an important stock market book, I reread for maybe the fourth time and I agree that important is the correct assessment. It was also still an enjoyable read. This reading gave me a slightly different perspective of my cluster analysis and it really hit me how valuable it is to not have to depend on a \\"live\\" broker as well as the high commissions of my earlier days.For someone who understands all of these basics and doesn't want the benefit of a review or different view, I guess maybe the book is not all that important. But why would they want to downgrade a five star book and mislead people who are seriously interested in learning from it? For an experienced investor, the book should just be an enjoyable one night read about a different era that still has meaning today.For someone who is reading it because they want to gain the knowledge, it is a classic. I recommend it highly even after four and a half decades. It is a great read that you can always get something from. Just seeing how Darvas had to reinvent himself several times as an investor is valuable, I certainly had to do it several times."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Good book if you enjoy reading about someone else's success.

There are a few lessons here for the modern investor:1) You should have complete conviction with your strategy or you will fail, in Mr. Darvas's case failure comes in the form of stop-loss order (and so should yours).2) Stay away from the talking heads of CNBC, they will distract and destruct you (except for Cramer of course, he so crazy!). Mr Darvas stayed away from any form of outside influence, except for Barron's. He operated in the dark, no information on the fundamentals of the company, not much on the prospects of the firm (expect for the futuristic industries part), everything except his strategies. Today, you have to at least, understand the present state of the company and its future prospects.3) He has a remarkable habit of writing down everything, documenting every trade in great detail; the reason for getting in, the reason for getting out, the prices, profits, losses etc. He was becoming a better trader, avoiding his previous mistakes and enhancing strategies that worked.4) The author operated during a brief period in the 50's bull market, these conditions are highly unlikely to be repeated again (except for a brief period in late 90's when most of amateur traders lost their shirts), most of the strategies have either been either CANSLIMed or Hedge funded out.5) Mr Darvas wears his emotion on his sleeve, the elation and joy of his early victories, the arrogance and ego after his initial success, and his agonizing decision not to sell his rising stocks. You have to have your emotions and ego in check or get out of the game.6) Mr. Darvas did what none of us has the guts to do, he bet all his money, about a million dollars, in just two stocks. None of has the guts to do this today (except for a few people, maybe perhaps with other people's money). We are happy to read this book and buy the next \\"hot\\" Index fund or ETF.There is one more thing that is left unsaid. What did Mr Darvas do with his two million, did he retire?

What bothers me about teh book, in addition to all the fishiness about a dancer-turned-stock-guru, are: 1) the \\"reissue edition\\" (which is the one you are looking at on Amazon) has pictures of the cables the author used to follow the market but there was absolutely no evidence of his actual transactions; 2) he himself admits he didn't follow his \\"box\\" system (where \\"box\\" refers to a trading range prior to a breakout) yet he still made money; 3) most importantly, I have not been able to find out what happened to him after writing this book, other than the fact he wrote another book (which is actually a better read as he compares Wall Street to Las Vegas). I mean, if he were so successful in turning $25,000 into $2 million (and almost all because of margin trading), he should have turned the $2 million into $100 million, no? OK, stock trading isn't exactly scalable but if you search on the net you won't find any information about the rest of his life. Hmm, interesting. (All the searches on \\"nicolas darvas\\" are sites that try to sell this book for $50 or claim to sell systems that identifiy the boxes -- of course, you can easily tell that these are just scam artists, none a successful stock trader/investor in his or her own right.)Well, this book is cheap and it's a little amusing to read, espcially the part about trading psychology (and how paper trading never works), hence the two stars rather than one. Otherwise, as someone who hasn't made any net profit in stocks despite a lifetime devoted to this vanity, I advise you look elsewhere. William O'Neill's book is more rigorous and although I haven't followed his method, I know a couple people who make a decent living following it. (I guess I just have really bad luck when it comes to stocks, options, health, jobs, dates, ... come to think of it, almost everything. That's why I now spend all my money on gadgets. To paraphrase the title song from one of the 007 movies, gadgets never lie to me.) Or just invest in mutual funds like I've started doing. Good luck."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Even though Mr. Darvas made these stock transactions about 45 years ago, many aspects of his system are still in effect today.

It is a very good book and a quick read."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This is the book that gave me the principles to acquire and keep $250,000 in the 2003-2007 bull market. Dancer Nicolas Darvas wrote this book to tell his story of how he turned a few thousand dollars into over $2,000,000 in eighteen months during the bull market of the late 1950's. How did he do this? He discovered that the key to stock market success was buying stocks that were rising to new highs on increased volume. He observed that stocks stayed in \\"price boxes\\" where they went to the top of a price range then came back down, and also found support at the bottom of a price range then went back up. He would buy at the moment a stock broke through the top of its range and entered a new \\"price box\\", he would also add to his position as it rose in that new box. He controlled risk by setting a buy stop to automatically by the stock as it broke out to a new high and a trailing stop to sell it automatically if it fell back into the old price box. He made all these decisions by telegrams sent back and forth between Darvas and his stock brokers as he traveled the world. He participated in the rise of Diner's Club as it popularized the use of credit cards, Lorrilard as its release of filter tip cigarettes caught on, and held a huge position in E. L. Bruce as the company had an attempted takeover through stock accumulation. Darvas considered himself a techno-fundamentalist buying stocks at 52 week highs that had huge future earnings expectations. This book tells his story of learning the hard way through losses then the incredible success he experienced. I have read over 150 trading books and this one captures all the principles of trading to be successful. Although Nicolas Darvas considered himself a growth stock investor, I use his principles for all types of trading. This book is recommended reading by William O'Neal the publisher of Investor's Business Daily and contains the principles that IBD uses to this day.

This book is the Granddaddy of the technical approach to buying rising stocks that will make you money! I've read it about 8 or 10 times now because it is interesting reading from how Nicholas Darvas started as a complete amateur then through years of experience, became professional and made a fortune for life.You can do the same if you are dedicated and get lucky when picking out stocks that look like they are rising. Everything is explained in the book on just how to do that.The book I received came in excellent condition. It has a jacket cover on it and there are no distracting marks in the book.

Whether you're in it for Darvas' strategy (which, though there are some dated elements to it, i.e. telegrams, and fractional stock prices, it is still fundamentally a doable strategy); or, if you're just along for the literary ride, this sorta rags-to, definitely, read: Riches, book, is a Must purchase.As I flip back through it's pages, what stands out to me most now, is how extensive and illustrative (yes, actual photos of his charts, And original Western Union telegrams, in black & white) his trading activity is proven and presented to the reader. And what's great is that even his ongoing Profit/Loss math that is well-placed throughout the book in basic facts and figures, doesn't take anything away from his otherwise suspense-fully fascinating story. They actual help maintain it's authenticity.As one of my first reviews, I had to give a solid, 5 star, winning review for an even more amazing book, that I hope you'll eventually choose to enjoy as well.Happy Reading,Khalfani Rushiddin[...]"},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"The book is exactly what the title says. Very easy to read, and interesting. It could have been a little longer, as i read it in 2 days...maybe he could have talked about dancing a little more? Apparently his box system is just looking for a bunch of rectangle/sideways channel patterns, which is probably the easiest pattern to find without looking at charts (he recieved quotes by telegram)since he just watched daily highs and lows. Some people give bad reviews on the book cuz it doesnt \\"explain his box system more\\", but he does explain it. It just might be hard to understand if you dont already have trading experience, but its there. He traded breakouts out of \\"boxes\\" and he would pick stocks that looked good fundamentally, combining technical and fundamental analysis. He would exit at targets or when price closed below and out of a box (he only went long). He liked to see volume/volatility. All these details seemed to go over some people's heads, i dunno why since the book is only 170 pages, you cant miss anything. My trading platform has an indicator called the Darvas Box, now i know where it came from.Very good book."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"When I saw the title I thought this would be an infomercial. What a surprise! The narrative of the investment activity in 1950's of a Hungarian Jewish immigrant who fled Nazi genocide turned successful ballroom dancer reviewing his learning the trading business that leads to $ 2,000,000 from a $ 10,000 seems like a novel. In reading about the book I learned most of the public and the government didn't believe his story either. In addition to dancing and investing Nicolas Darvas is an exceptional writer. The organization of the book and the narrative is not only easy to read but is an excellent teaching tool. Having read the Market Wizards books by Jack Schwager I see the same lessons learned by Mr. Darvas as the greats in the Wizards series. I cannot attest to the validity of the Box Theory employed to make the $ 2 million ($ 14 million in today's dollars) but I can say I enjoyed a great read!"},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Darvis stuff can be dowloaded on the web.

I liked it anyway."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"For me this was an easy read.

Worth the time."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Dravas is one of the best speculator. He is able to keep his profit and he has his own style. The method of trading is capable for any, if not too stupid, investor. Buy this one, don't buy other books because they're unaudited and no difference from How I Made $2,000,000."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"I shunned this book 10 years ago because of its title and its use of margin. Following the recommendation of Investors Business Daily I bought the book and started reading it. The author's experience of trading stocks echoed with mine sentence by sentence and I was totally absorbed. I admired his relentless pursuit of how the stock market actually worked and he finally figured it all out to make two million dollars. To create tremendous wealth you must concentrate on the best acting stocks in the market and use trailing stop loss orders. I am glad the author, a dancer, was willing to share a secret that Wall Street pros will trash but who made $2 millions? The book has already doubled my net worth and whoever follow these words of wisdom will become the millionaire next door!"},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"If one looks at the biggest winners of the past several decades, one finds that practically all show the same &quot;chart behavior&quot; that he writes about in his book. Learn from the past. A word of caution to value-oriented investors: This will probably be a waste of your time. But for the person who naturally gravitates to growth stocks, and who doesn't shy away from a stock due to its high valuation, this is second only to William J. O'Neil's &quot;How to Make Money in Stocks&quot; as the best book written on how to use charts to limit risk, yet expose yourself to each year's big winners."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"For those of you who have not purchased this book yet because you feel the title reminds you of a weekend infomercial, you are making a HUGE mistake. As a market investor for 5 years, I have yet to find a better book on how someone made so much money in the market and how they did it. Written similiar to a diary Darvas shares his first five years worth of mistakes, all of which we have made and the progression he made in himself in identifying his \\"box system\\" or better known as \\"techno-fundamental analysis\\". One of the better subjects in this book that gets addressed, is how human emotion wears on someone who has invested in the market. While he does not give advice on how to control ones emotions, its great to see that the same fears and excitment we feel as market players, is also shared with the greatest of all-time.How I made.. is a quick read, and can probably be read from cover to cover in a few quick hours, and will definetly be one you will want to read many times over."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Supertrader David Ryan mentioned this title when I attended William O'Neils Workshop 9 yrs ago. I had to source it out with diffuculty shortly after that from some antique book store. Now that you are here reading this at Amazon, dont miss this goldmine. It allows you to get into the brain of a Supertader. Easy Reading."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This book follows Mr. Darvas' path from being a professional dancer to him becoming a successful investor using what he refers to as a \\"Techno-Fundementalist\\" method.I found this book to be an informative introduction to the subject as well as rather entertaining. What I found to be especially compelling was how the book takes you through the evolution of this trading method. The mistakes made along the way have just as much value as the actual method itself. I very much recommend this book to anyone interested in the more mechanical techniques of investing.The only real caution I would have to people who are interested in this book are as follows:1)This book was written in the 60s. The stock market has changed considerably in that time. The concepts of the book are still applicable, however the market (especially the rules of the SEC) and situations that Mr. Darvas was investing in have changed.2)Mr. Darvas lost over $100,000 dollars (in late 1950s dollars) before he made his riches. Furthermore, he made his 2,000,000 primarily through 4 or 5 stocks. Many of his trades actually netted him a loss. Please don't buy this book if you are looking for the magic bullet of investing. Like the title of this review says it is a good introduction. I would recommend further reading on the subject before you start using this method with your own hard earned dollars."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This is a nice little motivational book. Darvas went from an absolute novice who knew nothing about stocks to a millionaire in a short period of time. He basically stumbled upon simple price/volume technical analysis without realizing it. The lesson to be learned here is unemotional discipline, which Darvas clearly points out that he did not have at times and shows you the disasterous results. His trades are followed in detail along with the mindset that went along with each one. Surprisingly he really didn't diversify that much. There are no groundbreaking techniques here, but it is a fun read."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Box break-out, originally posted November 6, 2001When prices move out of a narrow trading range, this often leads to an extended move in the same direction as the break. The box-breakout technique works well on all securities including Spreads.Darvas is a master at this technique and one of its best teachers. Simple and easy to read. The book was originally how he made $1,000,000.00. During the time it took to get it published they had to change the name.Darvas was a traveler, he shows how even a nomad can catch every major move, using just prices and volume. Information anyone can easily get from the Internet anywhere in the world."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Warren Buffet is richer, and Peter Lynch and George Soros are more well-known, but in terms of the capital gains he was able to make in a relatively short timespan (18 months), Nicolas Darvas is perhaps the greatest investor of all time.That being said, this book shouldn't be taken at face value. It's very telling that the title is \\"How I Made 2 Million Dollars...\\" and not, \\"How YOU Can Make 2 Million Dollars.\\" Neither this, nor any investing method should be trusted until you have had time to study it over time (I recommend developing an artificial portfolio over a period of several months, at least, using a spreadsheet and adjusting for commissions), and until you feel comfortable with it: Darvas' tales of his early losses should show just why that is the case. Another thing is that it is NOT based entirely on a price pattern in its methodology: Darvas was apparently blessed with some remarkable foresight into industries which had a high potential for future demand growth, which is what caused most of the spectacular upward trends he describes in the book. Unless you are able to analyze fundamental market characteristics in a similar manner, you may make some money, but you likely won't match his returns. He also noticed stocks that interested him by unusual surges in volume. Using Barron's or the Wall Street Journal, that would mean studying pages and pages of closing prices (with no charts) in order to qualitatively asses what the normal volume of a stock was...it sounds much more time-consuming than we might wish.Still, the best thing that this book ever did for me was that it made me curious about what kind of profits a person could expect to make in the market. I decided to investigate this method (and I'm still doing that) to compare it against others, and hopefully it'll do the same for you."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"I doubt doing the things he actually did to make his money would work today. But thankfully he documents all the mistakes he made before hitting it big.Those mistakes would still be mistakes likely to cost an investor a lot of money. What he got right is much less important than what he got wrong.Study the errors!!"},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"The author's system is actually nothing new and is based on time-tested principles of trading/investing. Specifically, he looks for emerging growth companies in industries likely to lead the economy in the future that have strong earnings growth and have recently broken out of a &quot;basing&quot; pattern on high volume to new highs. After taking a position in these stocks, he uses trailing stop-loss orders to protect his capital. He never used charts, instead devising a system of &quot;boxes&quot; which are actually trading ranges. It is understandable that he did not use charts as he was traveling the world at a time when there was no Internet, computers or faxes, and therefore he had no access to such data. Now of course, anyone with a Internet connection can analyze a stock's patterns and all other pertinent information necessary to implement his system.The one technique he uses that is not traditional is to take huge positions in the stocks he picks, which allowed him to make his two million in just a few series of trades. This of course is not exactly low-risk, even using stops. For example, if one had a 10,000 share position with a stop two points under the entry-level and got stopped out, you would still lose $20,000, not exactly chicken feed.For those who wish to use his system, it is essentially the same as touted by William O'Neill and his Investor's Business Daily. That newspaper does the research on each stock's earnings history and other fundamental and technical indicators so that the individual reader is spared from that tedium."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"It seems many reviews are either hot or cold on this book. I guess its that kind of a book. I tended to identify with the author. I made many of the same mistakes, and enjoyed reading about his journey of knowledge and persistance. I agree fully with his strategy. 90% of all daytraders are losing money (according to the book Trading for a Living) but Darvas was never a trader. He latched on to good stocks and stayed in for the ride until the market told him to get out. I have been able to accomplish similar success -- always making much more money using this strategy than trading. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Darvas never did actually make 2,000,000 trading, was sued and barred from trading. The ideas seem solid but if you look up the actual records it was about 200,000 USD. Just to keep in mind there is no better trader than one who thinks for themselves. Study the market, learn the market, hunt it, stalk it, take home your game. Now who wants to know the truth about Gann?"},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"If you think you can get a sound-proof system from reading this book, you will be disappointed. There are some lessons learnt that Mr. Darwas shares - like buying on new highs, signs for HUGE volume buying, margin usage, selling automatically using stop order, not watching the market on a minute-by-minute basis, etc.Mr. Darwas learns early that making the same mistake is one thing you should avoid. Keeping track of all his trades and re-visiting and learning from them is something all investors should do. The system of boxes that he refers to is never really clear, but if you know a bit about investing, you can relate it to support and resistance. One thing many investors don't do is to buy stocks hitting new highs; Mr. Darwas' experience clearly teaches you otherwise.Staying close to the market, though with money on the sidelines, is a key factor for a successful investor. Mr. Darwas' sell-stop order system (often less then $2 from his original purchase price), helped him stay prepared for an upcoming downtrend. I haven't seen any instances in the past 10 years where a stock is halted from trading, because the demand was too high! Mr. Darwas was surely lucky to benefit from such a situation.Listening to what the market tells (read William O' Neal) and not to the analyst is a key factor for a successful investment. Mr. Darwas was wise enough to implement the system - he ignored tips from brokers frequently and also finds out that working actively with those on Wall Street actually hurt his investment.It is a very easy read (I read the book in 2 days) and will instill in you some basics of sound investing approach (buying on huge volume action, selling w/o taking too much of a loss, hanging onto a stock while rising and knowing when to sell, etc). But as far as a methodology, the rules aren't clearly laid out. For a relatively better set of rules, refer to books on CANSLIM investing, for example. If you have 4 hour flight, take this along, for $10, it will re-inforce what you need to be a good investor."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"For some reason, Amazon keeps deleting my review but here it goes again.I personally found the book interesting when I first read it (particularly the box theory on triggering stock purchases and sales). However, when I bought a later copy I found a newspaper clipping from December 1964 which stated that the New York Attorney General had sought and received an injunction against Mr. Darvas from promoting his book because the results he cited were not real.I don't know how the case ended up because there was only the one clipping, but buyers should be forewarned before buying this book."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"I first found a dog-eared paperback copy of this book in a second-hand bookstore in about 1980. I'm sure it cost me less than one dollar. As the great bull market began in August 1982, the Darvas method was an ideal way to get onboard. My return on investment in that book was truly astronomical, even though I modified the Darvas technique to suit my own personality.This is a wonderful story of an extremely talented and hardworking man. He is brutally honest in his self-examination of trading errors. At the same time he exhibits a charming exhiliration upon discovering the sources of his trading problems and their solution, which each time helps him refine his trading methodology.Many other reviewers have done a fine job of summarizing the book's contents. I have one contribution to make and that is Darvas' observation that detachment from the markets is very important to successful operation as a trader.Trend followers with a time frame measured in months or longer cannot improve their performance by watching intraday action, listening to CNBC, or allowing their ego to inflate along with their bank account. Those activities cut into whatever edge you may have, eroding confidence, instilling doubt and ultimately result in losing money. Darvas found this out himself when he went to Wall Street. Read his firsthand account in the book (Chapter 9: My Second Crisis) to learn more.I know this from firsthand experience, trading while living overseas, receiving my Wall Street Journal 3 days late, and submitting orders to my broker via Telex at night. Snap decisions were impossible, but it was easy to see the longer-term trend. At the time I thought this a disadvantage, but it proved a profitable method of trading. In a similar manner, 20+ years earlier, Darvas unwittingly traded best at a great physical distance from the markets, while on a world tour with his dance act, and later after his \\"second crisis\\" at a great psychological distance from the markets. The lesson: detachment is key for a trend follower.How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market is a detailed and entertaining true story well worth reading by any investor. I have no hesitation giving it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"No long winded writing - just gets to the point.

Nicholas Darvas has system can hardly be more easy. That shouldn't suggest though it's easy to make money from the markets. Applying this system in your real time trading is hard as hell.The main concepts of successful trading are all present here.

As such it covers most investment fallacies and mistakes new investors tend to make. His big run up in value took place with large companies that were rapidly growing during the late 1950's. He was wise enough to select stocks that went up 200%, 300% or more in a matter of a year or two. His job shielded him from getting too close to the daily ups and downs of Wall Street, which worked for his advantage. I am not sure this can be repeated in today's modern investment world.

This book is indeed entertaining for leisure reading. However, it lacks the much more practical details in explaning what the techo-fundamental method he used is all about. The book did provide some basic advice on implementing stop-loss, limit buy, etc, to limit the risk. However, these are all very basic elements of trading that all the traders should learn in the first chapter of trading. In other words, the book only covered the story (and some stock trading 101) which do not teach readers (especially the very beginners) what practical set-ups or methods are used to be profitable in trading stocks. This book is good if you are looking for a non-textbook leisure reading. If you are looking for trading methods (either technical or fundamental) that can help you to be better in trading, I think the \\"Mastering the Trade\\" by John Carter is by far the most practical book that I found in the market."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"First of all, this is not a how-to book - while there is a lot of great advice in this book, it's not really explicitly spelled out for you and you have to read between the lines a bit to get it. It's really more autobiographical than anything else. That said, it's a fascinating read and it's definitely worth your time. I've been reading a lot of financial books lately and this is easily the most readable of the bunch. It's well-written and entertaining, and the author is funny and candid; I read this book in one sitting. If you are looking for an easy-to-implement strategy that's going to make YOU $2 million in the stock market, you may find yourself somewhat disappointed, but on the other hand there are some real gems in here and reading about the mistakes the author made on his road to success might keep you from making the same ones.

He participated in the rise of Diner's Club as it popularized the use of credit cards, Lorrilard as its release of filter tip cigarettes caught on, and held a huge position in E. L. Bruce as the company had an attempted takeover through stock accumulation. Darvas considered himself a techno-fundamentalist buying stocks at 52 week highs that had huge future earnings expectations. This book tells his story of learning the hard way through losses then the incredible success he experienced. I have read over 150 trading books and this one captures all the principles of trading to be successful. Although Nicolas Darvas considered himself a growth stock investor, I use his principles for all types of trading. This book is recommended reading by William O'Neal the publisher of Investor's Business Daily and contains the principles that IBD uses to this day. This book along with the other five Darvas books now back in print by BN Publishing are must haves for any serious traders library."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"if you know something about technical analysis you will probably find this a fun read. unfortunately it suffers from the poor formatting so common to e books which is particularly annoying in the tables of his stock purchases and sales. but the narrative is well written and it s a fun story. do not expect to make your own 2 000 000 in the market starting from 3 000 as he did however."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"How I Made $2,000,000 In The Stock Market is one of those titles that comes up quite often in discussions of what books traders should read. Given how long its been in print, that probably should come as no surprise. While I won't personally go so far as to call it a must read, I definitely found it worthwhile.First, be aware that this book - at least this particular edition - is quite short. It's only a bit over 100 pages, and a healthy portion of that is editorial addition tagged on to help further explain the author's story, along with some Q&A; with Darvas tossed in. You should easily be able to get through it in one sitting.Second, this book - again, at least this edition - was very poorly copyedited. There are formatting issues all over the place. It's not necessarily the easiest book in the world to read to start with, as the author's narrative leaves something to be desired. The formatting issues, don't help make for a particularly enjoyable reading experience.Thirdly, you will note that I have used \\"story\\" and \\"narrative\\" in describing the text. That's exactly what it is. Nicolas Darvas was a professional dancer who performed all around the world. The book describes how he somewhat randomly got into the stock market, and then the progression he made to building a $2 million portfolio for himself. All of it takes place during the 1950s, so be prepared for the author to talk about cables and things that modern readers will have little to no point of reference on.At it's core, How I Made $2,000,000 In The Stock Market is a trading diary. The bulk of the book is a discussion of the various trades the author made over about a 6 year timeframe. Some readers will find that interesting, others will yawn. But that's not what you read this book for, fortunately.It is the developmental path Darvas takes from newbie to multi-million dollar trader - which the author interweaves with the discussion of his trades - that is the read value to be had from How I Made $2,000,000 In The Stock Market. Anyone who has gone through that developmental process as a market participant will immediately be able to relate, and those who haven't yet (or are just starting to do so) will see that even wildly successful traders went through their struggles.In parallel with the author's discussion of his personal trading development is also the construction and refinement of his trading strategy. As is the case with most traders, he started on one path, but shifted course several times until he finally found the methodology which suited him best.Darvas employed a combined fundamental and technical approach which is the core of the popular CANSLIM methodology outlined in How to Make Money in Stocks. It's not an exact thing in terms of application, as Darvas developed an entry/exit strategy based on what he called boxes, but a great deal of the preliminary set-up elements are very, very close. That philosophy is definitely something that works. I can personally attest to it myself, though I have never employed Darvas Boxes or anything like that.The issue a reader might have, though, is that the outlining of this methodology isn't concisely presented. Rather, it's spread out over the course of the narrative, presented in bits and pieces over the timeline as Darvas refined his approach to trading. It would probably take a couple of readings to really get a handle on things.Overall, I definitely think there's value to be had in How I Made $2,000,000 In The Stock Market. If nothing else, it proves that part-time trading can be extremely rewarding. As I commented above, it's not a great read as books go, but there are quite a few good nuggets in the text if you can fight through."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"If you want to be motivated or if the market is down and discouraging you. This book will inspire you to get back in the world of trading and teach you basic trading techniques that are still applicable today."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"The Darvas trading technique was designed as a simple method for identifying the strength of a trend. Buy signals are created on new bullish strength and managed by a volatility range with a stop loss. This approach is built around long term trend trading and is most suited for trending stocks. All in all, the book is an easy and fun read and highly recommended for beginners and experienced traders alike!"},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"A bookseller gave me a copy of Darvas' book with the comment &quot;Read this if you get a chance--it almost seems possible&quot;. This book changed my life. I never had any interest in the stock market until I read this book. Darvas made every mistake but kept on and finally came up with a method of buying stocks that really works. This edition is great because it has a section at the end of the book entitled Questions and Answers that did not appear in the original hardback edition. By the way Darvas was Hungarian and he pronounced his name DAR-vash not DAR-vas. This is a must read."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"I enjoyed the system derived purely from his experience. My only disappointment was the lack of explanation of Darvas boxes and how they were used. I think the book will be beneficial to anyone who reads it and realizes that Darvas' success happened in spite of, maybe because of, all the positions in which he lost money."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"An excellent book which you will not be able to put away till you complete it........written in a very simple and narrative way.It will surely make you wonder if making a fortune in trading / investing is as simple and easy as described.......but believe me IF you are able to cut out the noise and clutter of the business channels and have a 'simple strategy' like Nicolas had the chances of succeeding increase manifold."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Darvas' book flows along making it very easy to read and understand. I found this book to be inspirational. Darvas' system is nothing new or complicated. Considering he managed to find stocks that met his criteria without the aide of computers, easily accessible stock charts and scanning software, it is amazing he accomplished what he did.His approach, learned through trial and error - lots of error - was to look for a stock that was in a consolidation after a move up and then look for that stock to break out. He used price and volume to ascertain the breakout and patiently waited for confirmation by using what he termed, The Box Theory.This approach is not something revolutionary as it is suggested in most credible trading books. What makes this book special is how it is laid out in the easy to read story format.The book is more of a story rather than dry, jargon filled information. Obviously, Darvas was a very smart man and he was educated in finance and economics but as he humbly points out, he started like most traders - doing all the wrong things - and his results were like most traders, he lost his shirt.The sole advantage Darvas had over most present day traders is that he started with a substantial sum. His first stock was 6000 shares of a 50 cent Canadian stock. He got into owning this stock almost by accident but it turned out to be a very profitable trade and that got his curiosity going,From there he tried different thing until he formulated his theories and system.I enjoyed the book and already benefitted from the information presented therein. I would recommend this book to anyone whether they are a novice or an experienced trader. It more likely reinforces methods the reader is aware of instead of introducing a new system, but if the reader is smart enough to work with the same system until he becomes proficient, rewards will follow.Now that it has been a few days since I finished the book, I find myself reflecting back on the concepts and realizing what a great message this book offers. If I could give it 10 stars I would. A really terrific book."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Kind of antiquated now, but still a good story. The author tells the story of how he made a fortune in the markets - $2 million in his time is probably more like $10-$15 million now. He started by investing based on tips, then on fundamentals, and finally by combining technicals and fundamentals. It's educational and very readable. The amazing thing is how little Wall Street and the investing world have changed since Darvas made his fortune in the 50s."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"When I first looked at the title, my thought was \\"Yeah right...\\" I started reading nonetheless, and read the book in one sitting. It was a page-turner, if that's possible with a book about investing. The book is concisely written, entertaining, and inspirational. One of the lessons in this book I immediately applied to my trading was to eliminate \\"noise\\". So bye bye to CNBC and TV/Internet gossipping of markets and stocks. It seems to work so far.I recommend reading this book and William O'Neil's book \\"How to Make Money in Stock Market\\"."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This was an easy and interesting read.

The book was originally how I made $1,000,000.00.

I mean, read that title, and look at that yellow cover!After reading even a few pages, I related with the author's experiences with stockbrokers, and continued relating to his investing experiences -- I went through a lot of this myself, as I'm sure many people have.By the end of the book, the author learned how to time stock purchases using his self-developed technical analysis system. This book was at the vanguard of a generation of technical analysis work, which is culminating with terrific sites like Tradingmarkets.com. To make a long story short, this is a good story, a good education, and if you're not using stock charts in your investing, this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This book gives the best example of leaving your emotions out of the stock market.

(I HATE moving!) By the time I made my first trade, I had forgotten a number of important points and suffered losses as a result.After ordering a copy of the reprint, I bought several more copies of this book and also &quot;Wall Street - The Other Las Vegas&quot; with the idea of selling them by mail order. At the time, &quot;How I Made ...&quot; was still in print, and the company was considering re-releasing &quot;Wall Street,&quot; but I've since sold out of the latter, and it looks as if I might sell out of the former too.I can't believe that none of Darvas's books are still in print! He is much easier to follow than O'Neil, and his requriement of an all-time high, rather than the 52-week high of IBD, is a much more thorough way of separating the &quot;wheat from the chaff.&quot; Granted, the reprint's Q&amp;A section is a little muddy without also having read &quot;Wall Street,&quot; but even the general principles of the method make for a strong potential showing in the market.There are at least two more Darvas books that I'm unable to find: &quot;You Can Still Make It in the Market&quot; and &quot;Over-the-Counter Profits.&quot; Any suggestions as to where I might be able to find either of them would be most welcome. I'd also like to know whether Darvas is still alive. My guess is that he'd be in his 80's by now."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This reads like an autobiography and shows not just how he made his money but the mistakes he made and the money he lost as he learned how to invest profitably. As someone who has been trading for a couple of years now there was an awful lot that hit close to home, and I received a ton of inspiration on how to approach my future investments! The appendix goes into a full analysis of Darvas' investments that he tells about in the book -- very educational."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Darvas provides an interesting account of someone picking up share trading. He discusses the highs, lows, emotions, protection mechanisms, pitfalls and learnings. The book though is old - 1960s I think - and does not delve into the modcons of trading today. That's one of its beauties people say. It is also light on basic info required for a decent assessment like: why certain S/Ls were chosen; timing of trades; why particular stocks were chosen etc. Often it says things like - I liked the look of this stock, or it had a good feel to it - which is annoying if you want to know why."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"One of the biggest take away one can take from this book is that stocksin a strong group goes up together or goes down together. A very recent example and one repeated so many times is that in aug 2007 when shipping stocks were going up Dry bulk shipping, excel meritime, diana made good gains, when they went south in Dec 2007 they all tanked together. Another example is the solar stocks in 2007 a very strong group considering the energy other group was performing the best and FSLR, STP, and many other solar companies made the strongest gain. FSLR went up by 710% since its IPO in 2006.We may see similar ones in future one of them may be the Visa IPO (ticker symbol V) will it repeat the same feet as master card, well time will tell but I am positive on it."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"My style of trading is not similar to Darvas' style, so I didn't learn too much to help me in that respect, but others might. His style closely resembles William O'Neil's CANSLIM trading system.However, outside of his trading system, the book is well written and engaging. Darvas well conveys the problems with trading and many of the impediments to making money. I'm sure many of us will see something of ourselves in his mistakes, and thus be able to learn something. This is a great book for any beginning investor."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"...the guy tells the story of how he made lots of money in the markets.

Don't expect to read this and then go out and make your 2 million."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"The previous reviewers of this book must have been on drugs when they wrote them. All this book talks about is the mistakes he made which lost him money. He doesn't demonstrate any clear methodology as to how to invest and make money like the title suggests.

Darvas never shorts a stock. The concept would probably be too taxing for his brain.Not a bad system. It supposedly worked for him.In my opinion,their are a few, and only a few, good ideas which can be gleaned from this essentially worthless book."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"I just thought of something...

He actually forbids his brokers from calling him because he did not want emotion to play into his decisions. He wanted to let the technical action speak for itself which worked out fabulously for him. There is also an important message to learn from this.His travels take him from Hong Kong to Istanbul, Rangoon, Manila, Singapore, Stockholm, Formosa, Calcutta, Japan and many other places, all the while he is trading larger and larger positions with one or two telegram at the end of every day.You can definitely learn lots from this book and be entertained along the way.By Kevin Kingston, author of: A 20,000% Gain in Real Estate: A True Story About the Ups And Downs from Wall Street to Real Estate Leading Up to Phenomenal ReturnsMy Blog:The Real Estate Investors Blogat Bloglines"},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read.

The book was recommended to me by some very successful traders so I picked up a copy. I read investment books continuously trying to figure out the seemingly psychotic behavior of the stock market. I was very pleasantly surprised by this book. This author, even though writing about experiences 50 years ago, had a fantastic review of his trading. I was riveted by each page because he went thru what I went thru when I started out trading. His conclusions were right on and his trading style works. It isn't anything fancy but basically states what it took me 20 years of trading to conclude. The good news for me is I am doing basically what he did and I am successful in this choppy market. All in all, a GREAT BOOK."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"I read the entire book in three hours. It held my interest. I enjoyed the way Nicholas Darvas included tons of his own mistakes and mis-buys. It's good to know that I'm not the only one learning about the Stock Market through trial and error and error and error...It's more of a fun read than an indepth book on technical investing strategies, but I did pick up a few informative nuggets to put into practice. I also liked the Q&amp;A section added to this second printing, not because I gained any additional knowledge, but because some of the questions were so foolish, they were entertaining (i.e. asking Darvas's thoughts on individual stocks, as though he knows what's in the secret sauce; even asking him for a loan to use for investing purposes).What the heck; it was worth the investment. It gave me a few chuckles and confirmed some of my suspicions."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"The delightful thing about this book is the author's honesty, especially in the beginning, about how he made all the classic tyro errors. I also found the deterioration of his investment results when he had too much information to be very true, and this was in the pre-Internet age! I think if you read this book and no other, you can do well in the market, if only because you will keep it simple. So often people hold on to losing stocks, hoping and praying they will come back, whereas his approach mechanically and automatically forces you to cut your losses early. The charts in the back are very good despite their skimpiness, and illustrate how he would purchase a stock as it is making a new high out of a base (a &quot;box,&quot; to use his terms). Very entertaining and inspirational."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Heard about this book from columnist Gary B. Smith at TheStreet.com. It's an excellent and fascinating recap of a professional dancer's entrance into the stock market of the 50's while touring the world. New investors and traders will relate to what Darvas goes through with his ups and downs of learning the market. Darvas's methods combine company fundamentals with technical analysis using his own self-discoveries and style. I recommend this book for anyone interested in analyzing stocks -- although Darvas may call it by different names, his successful concepts in picking stocks are just as true today. It's especially interesting to compare what he went through back then using overseas cables to communicate with his broker VERSUS what we can do today with on-line research and on-line brokers -- in a way, it shows all the on-line stuff is nice, but not necessary to be good at picking stocks."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"As an older book for making money in the stock market, it is worth reading today for a few reasons. First, it reinforces the point that it is more important to avoid losses than to strive for gains. Darvas includes his rules for limiting losses. Second, this investing theory is oriented toward active, moving, growth stocks. With increasing volatility in the market, most stocks go through cycles, taking even many of the former value plays into a &quot;growth cycle&quot; arena for part of the year. Third, many people shy away from buying on margin, and maybe they should, but here is one philosophy for buying on margin that takes some of the risk out. This book would have been better if there were more details on what, how and when to do what is described. Other books since then have addressed these issues. One of the real problems that investors face is The Disbelief Stall: The idea that they won't really make money in the stock market. That leads to behaviors and bad decisions that reinforce that idea. Then based on those few experiences, they fall in to The Misconceptions Stall: That they may lose on each trade. That leads to The Procrastination Stall: Not getting out in time and incurring more losses. To learn more about these stalls that get in the way of being successful, you should also read THE 2,000 PERCENT SOLUTION. Books like HOW I MADE $2,000,000 IN THE STOCK MARKET, HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN STOCKS, and the new books on E-trading help to break The Communications Stall and explain what to do, how to do it, and which investing style is comfortable for you based on each individual's objectives. With the right information, you will find your 2,000 percent or $2,000,000 solutions!"},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Nicolas Darvas wrote a very entertaining book. Maybe the fact that I'm half Hungarian added to the vicarious enjoyment. His early misadventures touched a raw nerve. His remarks about the high cost of trading in the bad old days reminded me of why I switched to an online broker. While reading the book I broke out in laughter several times.I was so intrigued by the box model that I created a computer model to test it. The results were a disappointment. While I didn't test it with too many stocks, I ran the tests with growers like BLWD, AAPL, and CMG. Darvas stated that he invested in growth stocks even if he didn't call them that and I tried to mimic his style as closely as possible. To give an example, over a period of 18 month from Jan 2006 to June 2007, the model traded BWLD five times, two winners and three losers for a net gain of 11% over 18 months. Improving the stops might have increased the yield to around 16%. That's nothing to write home about. During that same period of time the Dow 30 advanced 16% (annualized percentages).Some seven years ago I played around with another computer model based on crossing the various DMA lines. The stocks I used were the tech darlings of the bubble era. I used real price data from the '90s. The model made Warren Buffet look like a rank amateur, it was producing yields well in excess of 50% and it generated a very concentrated portfolio even when I fed it data for over 100 stocks. When I tested the same model in a bear market scenario it came out even, losing the trade commissions.Why the long story? Because I'm trying to put Darvas' achievement in perspective. From Jan 1957 to Dec 1958 the Dow 30 yielded 24% annualized, about three times its long term average. Darvas used an enormous amount of leverage or margin, more than most of us can obtain today and certainly much more than I would ever be willing to risk. Darvas must have had very good income from his dancing to dare risk that much. He did keep is income and his investing funds separate. Darvas was also very astute in his stock picking. The Soviets launched Sputnik on October 4, 1957 and America was feverishly trying to catch up. Kennedy was a good speechmaker.I believe that an extraordinary number of favorable circumstances came together in a very fortuitous way to enable Darvas to achieve his feat. From $25K to $2.25M in two years is an annualized return of 843%.

It's a little bit harder to trade using his approach in a downward market, but it is not impossible. I read his second book, and according to it after several years had passed after 1960 his account was still around 2.4-2.6 mln which is not a big annualized percentage increase.The approach is still valid today. It's called trend-following."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Nicolas Darvas's \\"How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market\\" is a short, easily readable, and interesting story of how a dancer turned $10,000 into $2,000,000 in less than two years. The book does not serve as a \\"how-to\\" and is a bit dated, but it is an interesting read and does have many underlying principles that still apply for today's traders.Darvas was a world-famous dancer who took some of his savings and got lucky on his first stock investment. That led him to continue to invest - and usually lose - money until slowly he worked out a personal stock system based on both technical and fundamental analysis. Darvas made much of his money while on a world tour using telegrams to communicate with his brokers and track his stocks.Darvas's system is dated, but many of its principles were used by William O'Neill to develop CANSLIM trading. Darvas would buy growth stocks with solid fundamentals that showed strength and rose above resistance levels (he called them \\"boxes\\"). Darvas would always protect his trades with stop-losses and when never hold onto a losing position.This is an interesting book and a short read, and many of Darvas' underlying principles (if not the execution of his system) are still useful in today's trading world."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"I DON'T NEED TO GO ON AND ON ABOUT HOW GREAT THIS BOOK IS, BUT JUST ONE THING SUMS IT UP...I HAVE READ DOZENS OF STOCK MARKET BOOKS, BUT NONE AS GREAT AS THIS AND IT TOOK ME FROM LOSING IN THE MARKET TO WINNING...ITS THAT SIMPLE."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This is a truly great book! I had been aware of the importance of having a trading system to \\"protect\\" you against the emotions of stock trading for a while now. 90% of people lose money in the market. Why? Because they try and predict stock prices and get emotionally involved. They also do not know how to read entry and exit signals.Darvas was a dancer in the 1950's who invented a completely unique stock trading system - one which still stands tall today. His system automatically sold him out of bad markets but let his profits run with rising stocks. He gave up trying to predict the market and decided to actually follow the market and let it dictate when to make a move either way. This way of working changed the emphasis of his making large losses into his making of even larger gains ($2m in 18 months - probably $10m in today's money!). The book outlines the system he successfully used.It is, however, difficult to tease the system from the text. Darvas writes well but you have to read the book several times understand all the nuances of his system. Even then, after four readings I had some questions. If you're serious about making money in the market or are fed up losing money, you really need to read this book. If you're not fed up of losing money, you must be mad!!!Searching on the net for more information on how to construct Darvas Boxes (essential to his system) and screen for winning stocks led me to an updated version of Darvas' system. I highly recommend this system as an adjunct to the Darvas book. It elaborates on the principles outlined in this book and gives you all the tools you need to screen for the type of stock Darvas was interested in - on the Internet! Screens for stocks that have 200% increase in volume, are near their all-time high and have good earnings are all part of the package. Automatic plotting of Darvas boxes is also included.I found after reading both the Darvas original book and the system [...]my stock picking has now made me some money. Why not start right here and do the same?"},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"As a participant in the financial markets for the past 3-4 years I have been keen to read as many books as I can about the industry (much like Darvas). This is a title that had come recommended to me by various co-workers and on a number of internet websites.The book itself discusses the Darvas technique of using technical analysis combined with fundmental analysis to make investing decisions and how he stumbled across this method. This technique wasn't uncommon then and is still used today. That being said, I believe it still has more merit than using one or the other alone.Although Darvas does not give away his secrets, it provides a rough blueprint for developing a trading style. It also acts as an inspirational story for those starting out in the markets that if you are willing to work towards becoming an exceptional trader, it is possible. I wouldn't call this a 'bible' of financial markets, but as far as fairytales on Wall St go, this would have to be the equivilent of a Brothers Grimm tale.An enjoyable read which should inspire the Darvas in all of us that Wall St can still yield financial freedom."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"After spending thousands of dollars in Wade Cook seminars, etc., trying to learn how to invest in the stock market, I found this wonderful book by Darvas. It is better than any I have read, and extremely easy to understand."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Darvas frankly admits his initial ignorance of the market as he describes and analyses his initial failures and eventual success. His technique brings together advice you'll find scattered across many other less readable books, such as the use of points of resistance and support (his boxes)and simple fundamental analysis. Combining his method with the powerful online investing and research tools available on the Internet today has got to help make you some money."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Many people, including myself probably picked up this book to read more about box theory. Box theory turned out to be the smallest part of the value of this book.Darvas discusses his start in the market by being paid for a performance in stock. That peaked his interest in the market. He then traded on rumors, tips, newsletters, broker's advice; analyst advice which he all determined did not provide consistent returns.This snippet in the book speaks volumes \\"I walked into the lobby of the Plaza Hotel, automatically bought an evening paper, tore of the Wall Street closing prices, and threw the rest of the newspaper away...\\"He learned to stop listening to rumors \\"threw away the paper\\" other than stock quotes. He focused on PRICE and only followed his own advice and his theory.Darvas Box Theory may not work for you or me, but what will work is if we find our own way.This book would be of great value for anyone that has traded for a while and not getting consistent returns. It is really a book on how to think as a trader."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"In review of How I Made 2,000,000 In the Stock Market, I found the book to be overall worth the read. The story is about a young professional dancer who happens to begin trading in the stock market during the early part of the twentieth century. The book goes over a lot of the lessons he learns, some of which are applicable today and some of which are not.A few key items to keep in mind are:1. Learn to take a profit2. Minimize your losses3. Think about utilizing Stop Loss Orders when you purchase a stock.4. Buy only appreciating stocks, never depreciating.The author develops what I call \\"box theory\\" throughout the book. This translates to the author following a stock for a given period of time and drawing a high and a low point in which he expects the stock to trade inside. Once the stock breaks the top of a box (into the low of a new box) he will buy the stock.If anything, I would recommend this book for the very begining person who is interested in making trades inside of the market. It's a fun read and very short. It might be a little dated where as the Internet has GREATLY changed the way we trade and the extension of how many people can obtain information quickly compared to the author, but most of his thinking still holds true today."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"Thinking about getting the teens involved in finance? Then this is a great first book. I enjoyed it after 20 years in the market, and learned some good lessons. Should be on the shelf, and a must read for the investing family."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"First, I must correct Vincent L. Jahn, Jr.'s review when he states this book is a \\"novel.\\" This is a true story, a non-fiction book. Mr. Darvas relates his stock market career in a highly informative way and continued to do so in the following books: \\"Wall Street: The Other Las Vegas\\" - a fabulous book that tells the truth about what Wall Street really is about and gives additional details on his stock market techniques (1964); \\"The Darvas System For Over the Counter Profits\\" (1971); \\"You Can Still Make It in the Market\\" - more techniques (1977); and finally, \\"The Anatomy of Success\\" - his thoughts on succeeding in life (1965). All are excellent and should be read before anyone puts a lot of money in the stock market. Some of these are hard to find but worthwile to look for."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This is the first book I read on investing, and the most interesting and amusing. It's dated, but it describes the very interesting life of a man who made and overcame mistakes and learned from them, and led a very intriguing life while making his $2M. This book is what got me hooked on the stock market."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This book details the trades of an investor/trader who turned a small stake into $2 million in 18 months. As with most successful investor/traders he survived years of failure before developing a system and the discipline to adhere to that system which would make him rich. This is NOT your typical &quot;I get rich by selling the book&quot; publication. This is real, and readable."},{"Title":"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The actual investing technique the author used is explained in less than half a page at the end of the book. The rest of the book is just piles of completely useless and irrelevant stories about the authors travel and adventures that have absolutely nothing to do with his technique or investing.The technique explained at the end of the book is one of the most basic techniques in Technical Analysis (TA). In the TA terminology, it is called support and resistance levels. If you are interested in this technique, use one of the books on TA. Those books cover it in much more rigor than Darvas' book and they cover a lot more TA techniques that are much more powerful. My favorite book on TA is \\"How Technical Analysis Works\\" by Bruce Kamich."},{"Title":"Rice Is Life","review":"I bought this book for a class study of Japan. It is actually set in Bali but is a great story about how rice grows. It is especially enlightening for those of us who have no personal knowledge of this process which many of the world's people would consider so common. The book also teaches about the entire ecosystem that has grow up around the rice production (animals, insects, etc) and it is all done as a beautiful rhyming timeline with a factual explanations on each opposite page. I will use this book every year in class."},{"Title":"Rice Is Life","review":"I love this book. The artwork is colorful and simple, a pleasing combination for the eye. Not cutesy or too complicated And the story is poignant and accurately told. As the author spent a good deal of time traveling the Bali countryside, she comes to the writing with a real story to tell of the people there. It's a great look at the circle of life in a rice-driven society. The best thing is the combination of poetry on the left pages and nonfiction prose on the right- what a great combination for kids.

In this book, Anne McAlpin makes suggestions on how to pack fewer items and eliminate the need for bulky, heavy luggage. She shows you how to hang pants on a hanger so they don't come off, and also how to pack pants without getting wrinkles at the knees.

So...I found one on Amazon, thank goodness.If you are going on a weekend trip, or longer vacation, take EXACTLY the items of clothing this book says to take, and you will find you don't need anything more. My husband and I packed (there are great directions to keep clothes from wrinkling) like the book said, and took only what the book said we needed for 17 days. Guess what? We were able to fit everything (even a sports jacket for him) into a carry on bag for him, and another carry on bag for me. My bag included a portable hair dryer and make up. If anyone would have told me I could get away with only a carry on bag, and not have to check a bag, I wouldn't have believed them! Now I know it can be done. Buy this book and find out how!.One thing I did on each trip is take an old pair of tennis shoes, wear them on the trip, and throw them away before coming home.

A famous author once said &quot;Memory is the treasury and guardian of all things&quot; - Cicero, De Oratore.This journal and scrapbook is a beautiful way for first time Grandmothers to pass on her treasures as a new Mother to her expectant daughter. How many times have we asked our Mothers, &quot;what was it like giving birth to me?&quot; or &quot;what kind of baby was I?&quot;Each page of this lovely journal has a one line heading, and then an entire page for the Grandma to write about her experience. The first section is dedicated to the present and gives Grandma an opportunity to talk about your relationship now. Some of the answers you'll be anxious to read are to questions like, &quot; I love you so much because...&quot;, &quot;Being your mother has been...&quot;, and &quot;When you first told me you were going to have a baby, I thought...&quot;Then you go down Memory Lane and get to learn all about Grandma's pregnancy: the birth and details about what you were like as a baby.There are designated spots for photos, and at the end of the journal there are a few pages to detail special family traditions, family stories, and your family tree.I can't think of a better gift to give my daughter when she becomes a mother, and I can't think of a better gift that I would have liked to receive from my mother. This journal is truly a unique gift to give and receive."},{"Title":"For My Daughter On the Birth of Her First Child","review":"A very nice book with lots of thoughtful questions. I bought the book for a few friends who are also pregnant and gave mine to my mother to fill out.

Can't wait to read what my mother writes."},{"Title":"Convention M.D.","review":"This is a great book, quite reminiscent of Arthur Hailey's earlier works. Fast-paced and just scientific enough to make the reader feel scholarly without losing interest, this book offers a rare glimpse into the seething world of medical politics.The fast-paced action, played out in several ranges from political intrigue to bedroom frolicking to life-saving emergency surgery, keeps us on our toes as we follow a select group of doctors and exhibitors throughout the four-day annual convention of the Central Medical Association (a fictitious entity). Entire lives are altered within this very short time span. Loves and lives are won and lost.While it wasn't one of those books that you just can't put down, it was definitely one that I wanted to pick up again and again."},{"Title":"Chemistry and Crime: From Sherlock Holmes to Today's Courtroom (American Chemical Society Publication)","review":"This is my father's book.

Coursen--Herb Coursen to his friends. He's been writing for decades now and the longtime Brunswick resident has turned out 25 books of poetry, at least eight novels, 11 books on Shakespeare, has another novel in the works and almost certainly his 26th book of poems will be along before the year is out. He is a writer's writer; he's also an academic whose been tagged by the University of Pennsylvania as one of the century's 25 greatest teachers of Shakespeare. Non-poets, non-readers of literary books will Coursen because they've read his letters to the editor, or, like me, discovered him when one of his baseball poems showed up on the pages of Sports Illustrated--not generally recognized as a magazine for poetry scholars. The man writes well about baseball (see his novel \\"The Outfielder\\") and he writes well about flying, which he learned as a fighter pilot during the Korean War. And of course he writes well about Shakespeare, which he has taught at Bowdoin College and still teaches at the University of Maine in Augusta. Archerland is a place he invented when he wrote his initial fantasy/allegory/morality fable in 1993. A free-flowing tale of good and evil, heroes, heroines, villains, monsters, and magic, it is the launching pad for this just-published sequel. What with Harry Potter firmly in charge of the best-seller lists and a book called \\"The Indwelling\\" (the seventh in a series about true believers who confront the Antichrist) at the top of the latest Times best-seller list, it's a wonder Coursen's imaginative tale hasn't drawn more attention. It has all the magic, all the action, all the sinister devices of darkness and the bright lights of virtue that give these fables their particular capacity to carry us off to another world. And \\"Return to Archerland\\" has a language you won't hear in Harry Potter's company, nor find in the pages of \\"The Indwelling.\\" Like all of Coursen's many books, it pulses with poetry, not with verse you understand, but the poetry of language, the poetry of prose rhythms, the poetry of imagery. Consider these insights of Queen Aprilla, the heroine, as she ponders a recent meeting with the tyrant Mazlund. &quot;She saw under the surface of things. It had been her living in the mines for so long that had given her that insight. Underground she had learned to read the interior of things, to hear the truth beneath the spoken word, the tone that often said something other than what the words said, to read the shadow behind the object.&quot; A poetic and philosophic contemplation of the nature of truth is probable not what most readers expect from and adventure/fantasy, but it is just one of the flights of intellectual inquire that blossom here and there in this book like wildflowers in a meadow. Coursen's mind is never still, nor is it content with merely satisfying the reader's expectations. Instead, he challenges them. Where else, for example, will you find a thumbnail history of Christianity while you are also learning about crows that spy for the enemy or a great black hound whose bite lasts a lifetime? You know from the start that virtue, love and truth will triumph--that's how these fables are constructed--so it is the journey and the struggles along the way that sustain your interest as a reader. You make an agreement with these kinds of books: You give yourself to the writer and let him take you where he will. Coursen is a splendid guide, and there is always just enough uncertainty to maintain interest. After all, as our hero tells us, &quot;The battle between good and evil is always an ebbing and flowing. It is never really won.&quot; And if Archerland is not quite where you most want to be, there are scores of other books by Herb Coursen waiting for you to discover, especially if you like poetry, love baseball, flying, truth, intelligence and humanity. --John N.

I like science and have enjoyed other books in the past, but this book is just plain dull and confusing. I would not recommend this book to people at my age."},{"Title":"BIOLOGY: Concepts and Connections (3rd Edition)","review":"I love this Biology book. I first studied biology nearly twenty-five years ago with a huge and lovely biology book written by an author whose name unfortunately escapes me. I loved that book, and have always judged future biology texts against that one; this one measures up well against my memory of that text.The fourth edition of \`Biology: Concepts &amp; Connections' is an excellent, thorough introduction to the science of biology. It is used at the community college where I tutor (biology and other sciences) for general education and nursing students. The book is divided into seven major sections: The Life of a Cell; Cellular Reproduction and Genetics; Concepts of Evolution; Biological Diversity; Animals; Plants; and finally, general Ecology.After an interesting introduction, which talks about discovery-based science in addition to theoretical/hypothesis science with interesting examples (the Australian Flying Fox, flies that mimic spiders), the first unit on the Life of the Cell looks at basic structure and chemistry of cells. Even though this text deals with chemistry, a chemistry background is not required. Care is taken from the outset to relate the biology tasks to \`everyday life', things that people know and care about - there is a look at athletic performance with slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscles, light in the lives of plants, and even look at the possibility of extraterrestrial life.The unit on Cellular Reproduction and Genetics introduces a hot topic in general conversation today, including discussions of medicine and law in addition to the basic theory, with some of the latest information included. The units on Concepts of Evolution and Biological Diversity include new features such as discussion on mitochondrial DNA comparison and the use of molecular clocks to date divergence in evolutionary paths. Topics such as increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics are discussed, and the interesting evolutionary situation of Australia, separated from the major landmasses of the rest of the world, shows an interesting side-show on biological diversity.The unit on Animals will be the most interesting for many, and the diversity here includes discussions from geckos to bears to human traits shared with and different from other animals. Particularly for our nursing students, the sections on respiration (anaerobic and aerobic), broken bones, immune systems, blood-cell diseases and the like really drive home the need for a basic understanding of biology.The units on Plants and Ecology draw in the larger mass of living things sharing our planet, work to show how the environment operates from the standpoint of individual plants to entire ecosystems. Interesting current topics such as organic farming, population ecology, endangered species and global warming drive home the importance of biology.The book is very colourful, both in text copy and in pictures. Headers reinforce the broader topics while modules give key concepts within each broad topic. Diagrams are arranged with numbered steps to help understanding, and there are frequent references to website and CD-ROM additions. Key questions are asked at each conceptual point. The \`behind the scenes' information helps reinforce the concepts both with the hot topics involved in biological issues today, as well as the personalities driving the science in key areas. Each chapter has a summary of key points, concept questions and multiple-choice questions for test preparation. There are well over 100 \`Connection' Modules and \`Talking about Science' Modules. Each of the 38 chapters has an interesting, inviting essay as introduction. There are probably 200 CD-ROM and website activities to engage the students, everything from the cloning of genes in bacteria to steroid hormone action to the Honeybee waggle dance.This is a very good book, with lots of information - it is also a flexible book, and certain portions can be omitted in a syllabus without diminishing the overall text. I find myself constantly glancing through the chapters and reading the interesting essays and connection modules between my tutoring appointments. That's the mark of a good textbook."},{"Title":"BIOLOGY: Concepts and Connections (3rd Edition)","review":"This new Fifth Edition of an old standby.

This includes a major upgrading in the area of the evolution of biological diversity.the sections on animals and plants has been redone with a greater emphasis on those forms that the student sees in their everyday life.the ecology area has been updted with current ecological data and fresh photos.The text has been extensively reviewed to ensure that the new edition retains the reputation for accuracy that has become a hallmark of this book."},{"Title":"BIOLOGY: Concepts and Connections (3rd Edition)","review":"This is a college biology textbook intended for use by introductory-level non-majors and mixed-majors college biology students. It was not intended for use by high school freshman introductory biology classes, and should not be used for that purpose. I am using it for my H.S. junior/senior level Biology II classes. I and my students love this book! Each well-illustrated and well-organized section begins with a clear and succinctly-worded concept statement that drives home the most important idea in the section. There is an outstanding amount of superb ancillary material available for use by both instructors and students -- including a CD-ROM interactive study guide, a printed study guide that complements the CD (but is not redundant with it,) two differently-focused course-companion web sites, an instructor's guide to web-based research activities, really great lab activities, and all sorts of other good stuff. The student reviewer from Troy, NY is right about the test questions, though. Most of them would be a challenge even for very sharp college biology students. But even so, I enthusiastically recommend this book for any advanced-level high school or introductory college-level biology program!"},{"Title":"BIOLOGY: Concepts and Connections (3rd Edition)","review":"Biology Concepts and Connections, is an excellent text on life science. This book presents information in a clear and logical way. At the end of each section, there is a question box, which allows the reader to check their understanding of the information presented. It is also very helpful that answers are included for all the questions in the book. The book is broken into thirty-eight sections, which cover a wide variety of topics, such as cell biology, evolution, plant biology/botany, animal anatomy/life function, and much more. The CD-Rom which comes with this book is great for reviewing the material presented. I used this book in my honor's biology class and received an A. I highly recommend this text to anyone wishing to gain a better understanding of life science!"},{"Title":"BIOLOGY: Concepts and Connections (3rd Edition)","review":"I used this for high school freshman introductory biology, and boy! The writing is dense and excessively formal, and some concepts weren't explained very well. It's a gorgeous book, though, with beautiful color photos and computer diagrams, and it's chock-full of bios and anecdotes. Buy it was a coffee-table book, not as a simple biology text for regular high school kids. (The test questions, which my teacher used from the cd test bank, were devastating. You wouldn't believe the nitpicky details they asked you)"},{"Title":"BIOLOGY: Concepts and Connections (3rd Edition)","review":"I own the International Edition of this book, ISBN 0-321-10679-2.I would NOT recommend this book to secondary school students, unless they were of exceptional ability, and nor would I suggest it for students seeking very detailed explanations of any particular topic.Rather, I found this book (apart from being the set text for one of my papers) to be very good at presenting a good overview of the many areas encompassed by the term 'Biology.' The \\"Concepts and Connections\\" theme is really very good, providing insights into real life scenarios. Excellent graphics and superb photographs help to give life and depth to the subject matter.Initial preparatory sections on chemistry for biologists proved very helpful, with indispensible glossary and thorough index at the back.If you're studying Diploma level Biology, or a more general undergraduate Biology paper, then this book could be for you."},{"Title":"BIOLOGY: Concepts and Connections (3rd Edition)","review":"This is a fabulous textbook. The descriptions are clear and there is always a picture following in case you are a visual learner. The greatest thing about this book is that it provides so many ways to study. The book has a website and a CD rom, where you can read the book, do very helpful activities, hear MP3 tutor sessions with the author and more. If you don't understand something, there are so many ways to study it, that it won't take long before you will."},{"Title":"BIOLOGY: Concepts and Connections (3rd Edition)","review":"I used this book during my freshman year in college. It was an excellent book with top-notch descriptions, well-placed layouts, and easy to understand content. The topics range from biochemistry to genetics to histology and all sorts of tangents into zoology, anatomy, and pharmacology. I have kept this book for 4 years and now that I will be starting medical school, I am taking the book with me. Many others in classes ahead of me have said that this book helps to clarify some of the complex topics that are presented in 1st year medical school. I firmly believe that and recommend this book to anyone with an interested in biology, medicine, and related fields."},{"Title":"BIOLOGY: Concepts and Connections (3rd Edition)","review":"It is overall a fairly good book, but contains much to much detail for the typical non-major collegfe student. I am a teacher for the Intro Biology class ar a well known university, and I was admittedly called in at the last minute to teach this course, so I couldn't choose the text. This one I would not have chosen, as it has too much info for students who have never taken a biology class in their lives before. I find I have to &quot;dumb down&quot; a lot of the material, which is unfortunate, because it really is a well written and well thought out textbook."},{"Title":"BIOLOGY: Concepts and Connections (3rd Edition)","review":"This books does an excellent job of giving overviews and then details about the topics it covers. This text was used for a Bio 101 class at my university. I would NOT use this text in a high school, because the wording and just the detail it goes into gets very complex. Even as a junior in college taking the class (haven't taken bio since 10th grade), I was overwhelmed by the information because my professor expected us to know almost every word the chapter. If she had stepped back and tried to get the general idea from each unit, the book does a great job in emphasizing those ideas. The connections modules and multiple choice questions at the end of each chapter are useful. All in all, if you're looking into medicine, I would keep the book to refer back to later, but I plan on selling mine back."},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"I knew little about black cowboys and that's coming from a gal who lives in Texas and went to the rodeo as a child. The book is the first I've come across the history of black cowboys and since it's in fictional context, students might appreciate it more than reading about it in a reference book. The book teaches a few lessons regarding gender stereotypes and learning how to do something.I didn't find the book exciting. If I were in elementary school, I'd probably pass on reading the book. The nice thing about the book is its main characters are Black, and we need to see more diversity in children's fiction books. It's a good book for parent/child and classroom discussions because of the lessons it teaches. I debated whether to give it a 3 or a 4. It's more in between."},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"I really, really like this book because it's about a boy named Justin and it seems that he can't do anything right.But luckily his grandfather comes to his rescue.He takes him to his ranch and he learns responsibility and how to cook the best biscuits in the world."},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"I thought this book was pretty good because he was supposed to do his chores but he did'nt and did not do the dishes and Hidya had to.And he made a mess in the kitchen and his mother had to clean it up."},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"Justin and the best biscuits in the world is about a little boy named Justin.

When he believes in him self and tries he did all the stuff he could not do before."},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"I Didn\`t like it because it makes me feel bad when I read about responsibility. It is also about family value and I like that. So, I give this book three stars."},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"I had my fifth graders read this book and they loved it. They couldn't put it down. It's an excellent look at an all too unknown group of people in history--Black Cowboys. It's also a wonderful coming of age story. It comes highly recommended from the students of St. Malachy School."},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"This is a great book about an African-American boy named Justin. Over the course of a stay with his cowboy grandfather, he learns that there is no such thing as women's work, you can do anything once you learn how, and a cool history lesson about black cowboys. My 4th grade students loved it and we had a great debate over whether there is a such thing as women's work!"},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"My son read this book with his 4th grade class. I read it along and out loud with him because we are really working on reading comprehension.This is a terrific discussion-starter book for parents and children. Not only is there the sexism parts, but there is also the theme of Justin being never shown how to do things (or made fun of when he tries) to the extent that he just stopped trying.I was very surprised to see the \\"n-word\\" (it's on page 82 in mine) in a book geared toward such young children. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but I would not have known about it if I had not been reading the book with my son. They did not discuss it in school or let the parents know which is a shame, as it led to a few great discussions in our home about racism and the power of words.Overall, a great book. It was nice to see some diversity in my son's required reading and to have a completely boy-centric book where the main character is not sickeningly perfect."},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"I really really liked this story because it show that at first Justin does not know how to do anything right and he had two sisters and one that was bigger than him and he always got in trouble and at the end he learns how to make his bed and cook biscuits and other stuff and know body believes that he can do all those things because before he went to his grand fathers he could not do anything but when he gets back he can make his bed and his on food and it just amazing that he could do all those things after he got back from his grand fathers and its cool."},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"I borrowed the book from the library, because my children like biscuits. The book surprised me with its story line. It is so beautiful about a boy becoming man of responsibility and knowing his african american history. A few times the story did not flow too well. Therefore I gave it a four star review."},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"I liked the book cause it was exciting.I relate to Justin because I don't like to clean my room,or make my bed.This book made me hungry cause of the biscuits.My favorite parts were when they went to the festival and at Justin's house.If you like cowboys,roping,and horses you'll like this book.And it also teaches you stuff.I think this is a great book.I really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"I really,really thought this was awsome because they talk about cowboys and roping.I am not like Justin.I hate the night riders.I don't like his sisters because they were mean.So were the night riders.The Q-T ranch is cool.Justin's Grandpa is nice.Justin likes going to his Grandpa's.He likes to ride horses.One time they found a fawn in the fence!Luckly they got it out.Then they went to the festival.Justin makes a new friend.He Deos 4 actvities.He has fun.And Grandpa won the \\"Best Biscuits in the World\\""},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"I really,really thought this book was cool caus they talked obout cowboys and roping.I think that i'm kinda like justin.I thought the night riders were so awsome even though the night riders were kinda mean!When Justin went to the Q.T ranch he learned how to make his bed and do other things.When they went to the fair and they had to rush,rush,rush toget the \\"best biscits in the world\\"to the fair for the contest.Justin entered In the shoe kicking contest,the Greasy pig catching contest.A giri not much older than him won a cake baking contest.His grandfather won the biscuit contest,justin said he could smell the smell of popcorn and B.B.Q chicken."},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"A gentle story with a slow pace and little action, this reads almost as sleepily as a Henry Huggins. Then you get to the jarring fact that Justin's father was killed in a car accident, and Justin has to make do with a houseful of females. When he can't muster the organization needed to clean his room or do the dishes without making a mess, Justin breaks down in tears. Clearly, a father figure is needed, and Justin's grandfather arrives to whisk him away to a picture-perfect ranch hours away from Justin's usual urban environment.Grandpa takes Justin in hand and teaches him how to take care of himself. He learns to do \\"women's work\\", which isn't as demeaning or demanding as Justin had previously thought. The ranch itself is described in nostalgic terms, beautifully imagined. I wished I was there.Justin learns how to check out the fencing on the ranch and prepare meals in the open. He reads about his family history in a book he notices in Grandpa's room. The reader learns a little history about black cowboys and exodusters, African Americans who went out west to take advantage of the Homestead Act. The notably grisly episode of an exoduster getting his hands cut off by night riders (whites who felt threatened by the exodusters' departure) was fairly shocking in such a sweet story.The book culminates in Justin's trip to the Bill Pickett rodeo. There he wins some ribbons for skills he didn't know he had; makes a new friend at a pie-eating contest; and gains some self esteem. The \`best biscuits in the world' are those that Grandpa entered in the contest. Justin learns the recipe and makes them for his impressed family.I liked how this book educated the reader about black cowboy history, but didn't preach. The information was brought in naturally and didn't take center stage. This book would be of interest to most third graders."},{"Title":"Justin and the Best Biscuits in the World","review":"Justin is a whiny, lazy, sexist kid who is miraculously transformed by a trip to his grandpa's. There were some interesting references in this book, but it just wasn't believable. The title was boring and so was the plot. It did make me curious about Black cowboys, but that wasn't enough to keep my attention."},{"Title":"WIN32 Network Programming: Windows(r) 95 and Windows NT Network Programming Using MFC","review":"Though the book is already pretty old for the fast developing area it is still veru usefull. It covers areas like RPC that are even usefull for UNIX programmers and it describes Multithreading and the TCP/IP Socket API quiet well. It is one of the books for real programmers who do want to understand what is going on and keep control over their programs."},{"Title":"WIN32 Network Programming: Windows(r) 95 and Windows NT Network Programming Using MFC","review":"Good book and easy to follow. Covers a wealth of information. I found this book much easier to follow than some of the other books on the market with similar topics. Source code included (on floppy) contained many errors, however."},{"Title":"WIN32 Network Programming: Windows(r) 95 and Windows NT Network Programming Using MFC","review":"There is a resurgence in Win32 programming brought about by a renewed interest in C++ program design. I searched among my personal reference books and only found scattered mention of Win32 operations in my old MFC references. I needed a more comprehensive and concentrated compendium of Win32 knowledge and I found it in &#34;Win32 Network Programming&#34;. If you are returning to the lower depths of Windows programming, this book can save you time and effort in reaching your goal.I have noticed a tendency in the last decade for reference books to shift to the teaching extremes in their approach to educating the reader. The &#34;How To&#34; books like this one are much fewer now. More of the new offerings are set either in the basic training of a computer language or settle entirely around the narrow application of that computer language to a highly limited area. Try finding a book on how to apply JQuery properly or the best use of C++ to build OOP. We are forced to return to the old references to find out how to master a spectrum of tasks. This &#34;old school&#34; book is one such that brings most of Win32 programming under one cover.In my world the meat of programming is applying the language to particular problems. Getting a new C++ C11 reference accomplishes little if it doesn't talk about file I/O, graphics, networking, or databases. I want far more than theory, I want the power of knowing how to apply the language to the computer's devices.This book provides that answer for Windows operating systems. If you need to know how to get traction for your program in Windows, this is one of the best places to find it and learn how to master the details.This 800 page book covers most aspects of Win32 in detail. It provides hundreds of pages of working code while explaining the approach to controlling the underlying machine. It does not cover graphics interface design, you will have to consult to another book for designing MFC, Forms in .NET or WPF to gain that understanding. A companion 3.5&#34; floppy is contained only in the new version of the book and contains all the code in the book and would be the reason to buy it. I keep two operating computers with floppy drives just to be able to access these older disk formats.There are sixteen chapters roughly divided into five sections:Section One : Basic Language SupportIntroExceptionsMemory AllocationSection Two : MultithreadingBasic MultithreadingSynchronizing ThreadsSection Three : FilesFile I/ODLL FilesSection Four : CommunicationsPeer-to-PeerSocketsNamed PipesRemote Procedure Calls, Win ServicesSection Five : WrapupLAN ManagerSecurity APIRegistry and Performance MonitoringOther network APIsSample ApplicationsI found four areas to support my current work in this reference book. If your time is worth some money get the new version and save yourself some typing. Even though WCF has supplanted some of this work, legacy code still rules much of the computing world and is going to take many years to catch up with the latest framework developments. For an old reference this book has much to recommend it."},{"Title":"WIN32 Network Programming: Windows(r) 95 and Windows NT Network Programming Using MFC","review":"Forget this book if you want good working examples. In nearly every chapter the author displays MFC class code but no examples for use of the technologies he is talking about. Also, if you are trying to learn how to write a multi-threaded TCP based server, you can foreget this book. Like others have stated, this book is old. Published in 1996 it refers Windows 95 and NT 4.0 as new technologies."},{"Title":"Windows Programming Annotated Archives","review":"If you know how to program windows with c++ but u want to go further, then this is the book for you. It assumes you know what you understand the basics and so only shows you how to do the interesting stuff u need, like: hooks, writing DLLs, threads, animation and even screensavers. But dont get the book unless you understand the basics of C++ for windows (like messages etc) otherwise it will be too hard to understand. This is because the author uses source code to explain how to do everything."},{"Title":"Philosophy: A Guide through the Subject","review":"As a graduate student I have taught newcomers to philosophy and I would not recommend this book to them. I agree with the other reviewers that the scope of the book is impressive. But the writing is unnecessarily complicated. Scott Sturgeon's attempt to explain issues in epistemology by use of the biconditional left me dumbfounded. It makes what can be quite a fun topic a dreadful chore and far more difficult to get one's head around than it need be. I found this to be a general flaw with the book. It may be that some people will enjoy the writing in this book but I doubt it. I fear that most people who turn to this book for an introduction to philosophy will be turned off the subject.I should say that there are exceptions to what I have written above. The most notable one being Tim Crane who always puts a priority on clarity of exposition. But in general the ideas are more obscurely presented than is necessary. For those who are coming to philosophy for the first time I would recommend any of the following:John Hospers, An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis.Nigel Warburton, Philosophy: the basics.Philosophy made simple, (sorry can't recall the authors).Bottom line: if you are new to philosophy and are thinking of buying this book, then first of all you should read some of it to see if the writing is to your liking."},{"Title":"Philosophy: A Guide through the Subject","review":"This is an excellent book for someone with a minimal background in philosophy. The essays are informative and thorough without falling into the usual trap of obfuscation. While the casual reader might find its contents slightly overwhelming, any philosophy major should have this in his or her reference library and anyone taking a philosophy course should not be afraid to consult this book. The detailed bibliographies following each section are indispensible. I highly recommend this text."},{"Title":"Philosophy: A Guide through the Subject","review":"&quot;Philosophy 1&quot; is a good introductory survey text. While it is somewhat more technical than what the casual reader may want, my goal was to learn something about &quot;real philosophy, not simplified philosophy.&quot; The book hit the mark on this account.I was drawn to the text because of another (popular) book by A. C. Grayling. Each chapter of the text, however, is written by a different author. Consequently, the chapters vary in style and, to some extent, quality. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on methodology, the rationalists, the empiricists (by A. C. Grayling), and aesthetics.It took some effort for this casual reader to get through the text, but it was well worth it."},{"Title":"Philosophy: A Guide through the Subject","review":"This thorough introduction to the core areas of philosophy is written by some of the leading figures in their specialisms, and it is remarkable for its lucidity and comprehensiveness, and for the excellent bibliographies attached to each chapter. The volume, covering Epistemology, Metaphysics, Ethics, the Philosophy of Mind, History of Philosophy and other core subjects, is the first of two companion volumes: the second volume covers mopre advanced or specialised areas of philosophy, like Medieval Philosophy., Indian Philosophy, the Philosophy of Psychology, the Philosophy of the Social Sciences, Frege Russell and Wittgenstein, and much more. Both volumes are outstanding pedagogical collections, and their editor, AC Grayling of London University, has ensured that between them they provide what is perhaps the highest quality pacakge of introduction-to-philosophy literature available anywhere in the world today. I found it especially helpful, in my own studies and in guiding students, to have such full material on all the branches of philosophy available together in the two volumes, because it made for ease of cross-reference, and topics that were mentioned in certain of the chapters were fully explored in others. You could say that the two volumes together are a complete introduction to contemporary analytic philosophy, and there is nothing comparable to them for scope, depth, or clarity in the literature for students and teachers of philosophy now available. Dr Vere Ayer"},{"Title":"Philosophy: A Guide through the Subject","review":"Grayling, the editor, appears to be the successor of Scruton at Birkbeck College. I find him supremely fitted to put together such a tour d'horizon of contemporary philosophizing, albeit happily restricted to the analytic tradition. The articles are largely bereft of Continental mambo-jumbo, and refreshingly competent across the board; therefore, the two volumes may serve as a major reference work on any shelf, as well as an apt introduction and stimulation for serious college students."},{"Title":"Hebrews, the epistle of warning","review":"The 17th century puritan John Owen is brilliant. More Christians should read him and I think that this short introduction is an excellent starting place for Owen in Hebrews. While it is an extremly abridged version of the 7 volume mass of Owen's original work, the modern lay will have a hard time picking up Owen in Hebrews and understanding the Greek and long theologically explained points. I believe this is out of print but finding one would be a gem for the lay person.Owen has a way as many of the Puritans do in making you afraid to stand up upon finishing a reading for fear that the floor will fall out from under you and you will end up in hell, but this is a point that modern Christians ought to spend more time in. He has wonderfully crafted and well pointed out the various points in Hebrews. I personally have benefited very much from this short commentary and would recommend you go out and find one!"},{"Title":"How to build a vacation or retirement house (Easi-bild simplified directions)","review":"This book (and the rest of the series he wrote) gives a great overview, with some particulars on building a small home. Someone with a bit of knowledge could pretty much accomplish it with the aid of this book....although in today's world you would need detailed blueprints for most localities. A great basic 'how to' book at a good price."},{"Title":"Gotham Central Vol. 1: In the Line of Duty (Batman)","review":"In Gotham, Batman is a dominating presence hanging over the criminal underworld. In Gotham Central: In the Line of Duty, we can see how he also overshadows the people involved in everyday law enforcement. In all the Batman comics, TV shows, and films, the police have been relegated to latecomers who show up when Batman has solved the crime and tied up the bad guys, leaving the police scratching their heads.The Gotham Central comic really is completely unique in that we can get into the minds and lives of some very tough, very good cops who care about the city and protecting the innocent as much as Batman does.In the Line of Duty contains the first five issues of the comic. A tense, well-executed storyline balancing plot development and character development is a real treat. Readers are treated to the appearance of Batman arch-villian Mr. Freeze, and a brief glimpse of the Bat himself. The art is dark and gritty and perfectly matches the setting and story."},{"Title":"Gotham Central Vol. 1: In the Line of Duty (Batman)","review":"So I bought Gotham Central Vol.4 from Amazon hardcover and vol.5 paperback at the same time. I read vol.4 over the course of a month or so and got to vol.5 only to realize that it was the exact same book! DO NOT BUY vol.5 if you have vol.4! Vol.5 is the dead robin story which is in vol.4 and also includes the corrigan story as well. PEACE"},{"Title":"Gotham Central Vol. 1: In the Line of Duty (Batman)","review":"Take any cop show and try and find an episode that was to bland to be aired on TV so they put it in as an extra in a box set and labeled it \\"never before seen episode\\" and you have Gotham Central. I've been reading graphic novels for 30 years and I received this book as a gift. I thought the concept was a great idea and I couldn't wait to open it up. I was incredibly disappointed. I kept reading, hoping the stories would produce some meat, anything at all! But it was second rate cop show bland. All they had to do was take one of the many great Batman stories and write about it from the police departments point of view. I can't imagine the people that wrote positive reviews actually read it."},{"Title":"Gotham Central Vol. 1: In the Line of Duty (Batman)","review":"This book does not live up to the reviews others are giving it. Of course anything tied to Gotham City will feature Batman, but, in this case, only in cameo shots (perhaps the writers were too embarassed to feature him more). This is supposed to be a \\"behind the scenes\\" kind of effort wherein the \\"real\\" heroes of Gotham City are its dedicated police officers. I cannot honestly see any point in serving up these stories. They are really very poorly written for coming from Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka; actually pretty hackneyed which would give credence to one reviewer's saying it recalled the good old days - the language seems right out of an incredibly bad Mickey Spillane pulp novel. The whole Mr. Freeze arc starts off good, but fizzles out very badly. Maybe this was better at some point as the editing seems very choppy. The art was good, but the story should be the driving force and it lacks any real suspense or drama. Look elsewhere for better (way better) stories by these writers."},{"Title":"Gotham Central Vol. 1: In the Line of Duty (Batman)","review":"With Batman lurking on the fringes, Gotham Central is a darker Hill Street Blues, focusing on the rough-edged men and women of the Gotham City Police Department Major Crimes Unit who resent Batman's presence while often coming face to face with members of his gallery of rogues. This collection of the first 5 issues of the series features a brutal appearance by Mister Freeze (nothing like the abomination played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) and the resolution of two seemingly unconnected cases without Batman's help.Michael Lark's gritty and atmospheric art are a perfect complement to Brubaker and Rucka's taut plots and precise characters, making Gotham Central one of the most compelling comics currently being published."},{"Title":"Gotham Central Vol. 1: In the Line of Duty (Batman)","review":"Gotham Central is a great series that is unfortunately under-read. This volume collects the first five issues for a very reasonable price -- and is a great way to get into this series. In fact the collected TPB is almost a better and easier read than the single issues. This is an intelligent book and appeals to a wider audience than just Batman fans. If you enjoy Law &amp; Order or any crime drama, you will enjoy this book. Even if you haven't picked up a comic since you were a kid -- pick this one up."},{"Title":"Gotham Central Vol. 1: In the Line of Duty (Batman)","review":"\\"Gotham Central\\", volume 5, spans issues #33-40 and (sadly) ends the series with a pair of fine stories... A tepid mystery involving the murder of two Robin lookalikes serves as the backdrop for the real drama -- inside the squadroom -- and in particular the descent of Detective Renee Montoya into a spiral of ragefulness and violence. The second story arc focusses entirely on Montoya and her partner, Crispus Allen, and closes out on a bleak, abrupt note. Fans of the series will be sad to see it end, but pleased to pick up this final volume, which is still one heckuva nice read. Several \\"Gotham Central\\" characters appear in later DC stories, but the original books are pretty special. Recommended! (ReadThatAgain!)"},{"Title":"Gotham Central Vol. 1: In the Line of Duty (Batman)","review":"I have now read all five volumes of Gotham Central, and I can recommend this title with only a few reservations. First the good news...Gotham Central is at its best when it focuses on the working stiffs of Gotham PD's major case unit. If you haven't picked up any issues of this book, try to imagine TV's \\"Law & Order\\" set in a world where a costumed vigilante routinely steals the PD's thunder. Now imagine a collection of diverse personalities trying to uphold law and order in this world. That's what you get when the book is at its best. Keep in mind that this is one of the most corrupt police organizations in the world. And because this book takes place (mostly) just after the \\"No Man's Land\\" episode in Gotham's history, most cops are ambivalent about Batman.But that isn't always an issue. Some of the cops have faith (secret or otherwise) in Batman, and some wish he would just vanish, but the book tends to concentrate on what a normal detective unit would do in a world full of crazy supervillains. It also provides a much-needed reminder of the real-world, street-level consequences of supercrime. The sad fact is that most superhero titles focus on the knock-down-drag-out between the central protagonist and his super-nemesis; when bystanders enter into the picture at all, it's usually just long enough to be rescued by the guy in the cape. Gotham Central, however, is primarily about those bystanders. So when Mr. Freeze kills a random detective, we (as readers) feel the unfairness of it.In other words, this book shines most brightly when it concentrates on the \\"little people\\" who occupy all the negative spaces of a superpowered world.Now the bad news...Renee Montoya is not a terribly convincing character, and she's our POV character more often than not. As a female detective who is also a lesbian prone to public violence, she seems more like a \\"message\\" character than a character drawn from real life. To the extent that she is the central protagonist in a story, the story suffers. It isn't that I don't sympathize with her; I do. It's that I didn't believe in her. Perhaps in a world where the cosmic axis has tilted wildly toward liberal wish-fulfillment, Det. Montoya might be a perfectly normal character. But Gotham Central's strength, usually, is that it makes the world of Batman more realistic -- more like our own world. And I'm sorry to say this, but in the real world, Det. Montoya would be directing traffic or working private security at a mall faster than she could say \\"violation of Miranda\\" or \\"Don't ask, don't tell.\\"The series is sequential, so if you're going to buy Gotham Central, just buy the whole thing, all five volumes. They're inexpensive, and they're a treat, even when they aren't firing on all cylinders. But some volumes are certainly stronger than others. Volume 1 set up expectations that Vol. 2 failed to live up to, but then Vol. 3 came back with a truly impressive strength. Volumes 4 and 5 make me wonder why the series was ever canceled -- not as strong as Vol. 3, but surely stronger than -- for example -- JSA or JLA or, well, much of DC's mainstream material.If this title is ever revived by DC, it will be because fans buy the TPBs. And if it is ever revived, I have a suggestion: Swing the POV. Seriously, you'll find yourself caring about characters in this title who show up once or twice, only to vanish. I'd love to see that become a standard feature of this book, if it ever comes back. I found myself wanting to know more about some of the walk-ons; instead, I got more Renee Montoya. If this title is ever revived, I'd love to see each arc told from a different detective's POV.If you like police procedural, and if you've wondered what goes on behind the scenes at Gotham PD, then you should certainly pick up these five slim volumes. Not everything works, but the writing and art are solid enough that you'll be glad you shelled out the shekels."},{"Title":"Gotham Central Vol. 1: In the Line of Duty (Batman)","review":"Another fine entry in this compelling series set in the gritty underbelly of Batman's Gotham City. The plot increasingly focusses on Det. Rene Montoya, which is fine by me (although I'm waiting for her partner, Crispus Allen, to come out of the box a bit more...) Author Greg Rucka's debt to HBO-TV's \\"The Wire\\" is increasingly obvious, but that's mighty fine source material.In this volume, a booby trap set by one of the Flash's foes, Mr. Alchemy, sets Montoya and Allen on a trip to Keystone City, where Alchemy pulls a \\"Silence Of The Lambs\\" taunt-the-cops number... Although the story gets more wrapped up in super-doings than earlier story arcs, Montoya's eventual beat-down of the bad guy, though emotionally satisfying, sets the stage for her to begin questioning her own attraction to extreme violence. I predict an even stronger, richer storyline further down the road.Great entry in a very strong series, compulsively readable from start to finish."},{"Title":"Gotham Central Vol. 1: In the Line of Duty (Batman)","review":"This entire series is excellent! Rucka & Brubaker are NOT my favorite people for Superhero books but they do EXCEL at crime stories. Gotham Central is an excellent \\"reality\\" approach at one of comic-dom's most famous cities. Not everything in a town like Gotham is about Mr Freeze or the Joker but even when they are, Batman isn't the only one working on it. Love this series and highly recommend it to ANYONE who likes Law & Order, Batman and maybe even The Untouchables."},{"Title":"Gotham Central Vol. 1: In the Line of Duty (Batman)","review":"INTRODUCTION TO THE SERIESThere are many graphic novels about superheroes and their world and how important it is for them to save the regular mortals but rarely do we get a perspective of the mortals unless they're family or lovers. In this series we focus almost exclusively upon the detectives (morning and night shifts) of Gotham who sometimes resent \\"The Bat\\" for solving their cases. It's a fresh and interesting approach with Batman showing up less than 5% of all the tales.START BOOK FOURThe two tales within are broken into parts and are titled as follows: \\"Corrigan\\", \\"Lights out\\" and \\"Keystone Kops\\". All are written by Greg Rucka and the Artwork is by Michael Lark & Stefano Gaudiano.\\"Corrigan\\" is about a corrupt evidence collector who sells a chief piece of evidence on E-Bay. \\"Lights Out\\" is a decision by the new commissioner to break ties with Batman much to the dismay of some of the detectives and staff. The last tale, \\"Keystone Kops\\",brings Flash villain, Dr. Alchemy, into the game and his lab has damaging side effects on a good and noble cop.I would say \\"Corrigan\\" was slightly better than the other two tales but they were all good enough.ARTWORKI found the artwork hit or miss. Yes, it's dark and gritty looking but sometimes it feels like only 80% of the normal details are there in the artwork. Batman doesn't look terribly impressive though maybe that's intentional to add to the mundane setting.RESULTSThis series received great critical acclaim and a passionate fanbase but never did well commercially.STORY/PLOTTING: B; ARTWORK PRESENTATION: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; WHEN READ: late July 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B."},{"Title":"Gotham Central Vol. 1: In the Line of Duty (Batman)","review":"This is a series that should have never been cancelled. Its like a Law & Order episode taking place in the DC Universe's Gotham City. The book, while definitely focusing on two detectives, still has a great team aspect and Batman isn't needed in the book but when he shows up its great. Here we get two different storylines and both are fantastic. Greg Rucka has such an amazing feel for these characters. You can tell he loves this book and that's why I love it.

Told from the perspective of Gotham's Major Crime Unit, this series puts a different point of view on the super hero story.

Du Bois, 1868-1919: Biography of a Race (Owl Books)","review":"Prior to reading volume one of David Lewis' &quot;W.E.B. Du Bois:Biography of a Race&quot; I was somewhat puzzled by the subtitle. But the significance of the subtitle becomes clear as one progresses through the book because Lewis does a wonderful job of tying Du Bois' life, thought, personality, and political activity to the evolving fortunes of African Americans as a people. Like all great biographies this one places Du Bois squarely in his social and historical environment. The result is that one gains deep insight into the plight of African America in the Age of Jim Crow as well as the various divisions within that community over strategies for dealing with the greater society.This magisterial work is not a book for the casual reader who wants little more than a few facts about the life of W.E.B. Du Bois. It is a complex tapestry of a troubled man who saw himself as &quot;the avatar of a race whose troubled fate he was predestined to interpret and direct.&quot; Lewis clearly wishes to show how Du Bois was &quot;the incomparable mediator of the wounded souls of black people.&quot; This is a very rich and full biography. There are many asides and digressions as Lewis takes the reader into the troubled world of the educated African American at the end of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth. The conflicts and turmoil among Du Bois' &quot;Talented Tenth&quot; are vividly brought to the fore as the struggle between the Tuskegee Machine of Booker Washington and the more &quot;radical&quot; Du Bois faction takes center stage.Du Bois' development and personal history are thoroughly covered as are all his important writings. He is shown to be a high-energy, brilliant man who was terribly frustrated and somewhat warped by the lack of intellectual and professional respect afforded him by the dominant white society. Du Bois is revealed to be a very human, if rather arrogant, and at times, hypocritical individual. He never outgrew, for instance, the racial stereotyping he learned at the German universities. Throughout his life he retained a deep ambivalence about Western civilization, almost a love-hate relationship that eventually fed his Afro-centrist delusions. Beneath it all one senses a degree of racial self-hatred at work. At times Du Bois waxes between practical political proposals for the United States and a quite utopian or mystical view of the possibilities of the colored people around the world. Along the way the reader is introduced to an amazing number of fascinating people involved in philanthropy and the early civil rights movement. John and Lugenia Hope, the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, early founders of the N.A.A.C.P. like Oswald Villard, Joel Spingarn, and Mary Ovington, and the irrepressible William Monroe Trotter are just a few of the individuals who rightly have their lives celebrated in this eye-opening account.Lewis is especially strong in depicting the limitations of the viewpoint and the activity of the white philanthropists and the developing conflicts between white organized labor and the poor black migrants moving to the northern cities during the &quot;Great Migration.&quot; Throughout Lewis demonstrates total command of the material as well as a comprehension of philosophy, history, and the issues of the day. Overall, this is a marvelous look at the life of an important and complicated man as well as the evolving fortunes of the African American community. Lewis has given us a balanced and fair assessment of Du Bois the man and scholar. And, along the way, he provides a ringing indictment of much of American life in the one hundred years following the Civil War. This Pulitzer Prize winning work is a book for the patient and learned reader, but a book that returns great rewards. There are few, if any, books that so thoroughly document the struggle for civil rights in this country from the perspective of America's educated black community."},{"Title":"W. E. B. Du Bois, 1868-1919: Biography of a Race (Owl Books)","review":"I have been in awe of William Edward Burghardt DuBois since I read &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; in 1967. As a ninth grader in the heart of the civil rights era, his passion for intelligence and his people moved me. I have longed to read the history of his life since. Lewis' book more than satisfied my longing. Lewis writes artisticly. The language sometimes caused me to stop and enjoy the words on paper as DuBois' writngs had in 1967. I understand the Pulitzer award, the text is brilliant and the research complete. The life of W.E.B. DuBois is even greater than the writing. This life deserved the best possible writing and research. I am amazed with the effort spent on the lifes of mere celebrities. Lives of great people such as DuBois deserve study. This life requires two volumes as Mr. Lewis intends. This life, W. E. B. DuBois, explores many of the issues we face today with race in America. As detailed by Mr. Lewis there is little experienced since the end of slavery Dr. DuBois and not considered in his thoughts or experienced in his life. The debates of the sixties between seperation or intergration were not new to DuBuois. He challenged Marcus Garvey. The thoughts of todays Black conservatives would have been understod by DuBois. He debated with Booker T. Washington. Lewis allows us to understand the debates in their time and place. DuBois departure from America in the ninth decade of his life can be understood if we know the depths of his commitment to the american ideals of freedom and meritocracy. America broke his heart. Reading his life will help all understand the way America breaks the heart of many who accept her ideals, try to live them, and are rejeced. It hurts. I have been waiting for the second volume since the day I finished the first."},{"Title":"W. E. B. Du Bois, 1868-1919: Biography of a Race (Owl Books)","review":"I wanted to learn about W.E. B. Dubois and I did --the book is thoroughly researched --but at times there is too much detail; as an example, sometimes DuBois the man seemed hidden in digressions which covered his writings in what seemed to me excessive detail.

Not only was his accomplishments impressive, as to be expected; Lewis gives us a 3-D picture of who Du Bois really was as a person: he was passionate, engaging and brave. The battles that he had with Booker T. Washington and then Marcus Garvey were mainly philosophical, but what could have happened if these three men could have worked together.This book is a great read and is highly recommended for serious readers."},{"Title":"W. E. B. Du Bois, 1868-1919: Biography of a Race (Owl Books)","review":"This book gave me a lot of information that changed my opinion on public policy. It was written to do more than just discuss DuBois' life. By detailing the overall picture of that era and including biographies of other famous Afro Americans of that time, it put specific events into a perspective that I did not have before reading this book. One of the many changes that I experienced was the view of segregation. I did not know that many leaders were pushing for separate facilities for the recently freed slaves; that everyone for a short period was on board, and only after the concept was perverted by southern whites did the damage of segregation rear its ugly head. There were many other lessons about leadership and civil rights that are important for us all to know. This is a must read for all!"},{"Title":"W. E. B.

E. B. Du Bois, 1868-1919: Biography of a Race (Owl Books)","review":"Sociologist, economist, historian, feminist, propogandist...W.E.B. Du Bois was a man of breathtakingly stellar intellect. He became the leading voice in the struggle for black equality and a glaring refutation, held by most whites, that African-Americans were an inferior race. But along with his huge powers of literary persuasion came a man that was arrogant, childishly egocentric, pompous as well as a subpar husband and father. You can not truly have an appreciation of Black America's struggles after the Civil War without understanding this iconic, heroic figure. His clashes with the black political-heavyweight Booker T. Washington, the founding of the NAACP, the rise of Jim Crow as well as the odious tactics of several U.S. Presidents and white powerbrokers are covered. Mr. Lewis takes great pains to explain the cultural mind-set at important junctures in Mr. Du Bois' life. The author has produced an outstanding, engrossing biography of the subject matter's first fifty-one years. Without a doubt, my next book is Mr. Lewis' follow-up volume dealing with the remainder of Mr. Du Bois' life."},{"Title":"W. E. B.

E. B. Du Bois, 1868-1919: Biography of a Race (Owl Books)","review":"What most impressed me about this very detailed biography was the complete treatment that was given to Du Bois' Communist connections. With the end the the Cold War we have learned conclusively that the Communist Party USA was not the possibly misguided, but good-hearted progressive folks of conventional wisdom. Instead, the CPUSA was a conscious and dedicated tool of Soviet foreign policy.No one can doubt that Du Bois was a brillant scholar and a careful researcher, at least in his early works. It was a tragedy that the unjust treatment of his race lead him to renounce America just as the Civil Rights movement was about to change it. Ironically, Du Bois exiled himself to newly-independent Ghana - - a country that became a one-party state, then a dictatorship (which Du Bois did not renounce) finally ended by a military coup.For all Du Bois' claimed affiliation with the masses, reading this biography one cannot but get the feeling that what really bothered Du Bois was not the rejection of his people, but rather of himself."},{"Title":"W.

She carefully selects the dashing Lord Melwin, a man of wealth and some political standing -- Lady Lillian has decided that she would rather like leading the life of a political hostess. Unfortunately for Lady Lillian, Lord Melwin leaves the house party on the very night she has decided to brazenly carry out her plan, and gives his room to his best friend, Lord Anthony Wendover. Wendover is also a man of some wealth but is more a fashion arbiter than a political animal. Poor Lady Lillian finds herself compromising the wrong man, and walking down the aisle with someone who seems to dislike her a great deal!Lord Anthony Wendover had always believed he would marry for love. His parents' wonderful marriage have been an example of what he would like his own marriage to have been. And now he finds himself married to a conniving young woman, who on top of it all has a tendre for his best friend! However his friends and his parents urge him to try and get to know his wife, and to make his marriage work. The burning question then is if Wendover can look past his anger and disappointment in order to make this hasty marriage work.&quot;The Perfect Husband&quot; is a rather goodish read. I felt quite sorry for Lady Lillian, who had no one to turn to for help, as well as for Lord Anthony who saw his dream of marrying for love go up in smoke. Both characters are somewhat well developed, and I quite liked the manner in which Jeanne Savery built on this theme of a married couple getting to know each other from the very beginning and attempting to make their marriage work. I only had two caveats: Lady Lillian's real character and motivations only seemed to come to the fore when she was with her best friend, Elizabeth Browne. Unfortunately, Miss Browne does not figure into this novel very much. Wendover's friends figure a lot more but they do not throw as much light onto his character and motivations as Miss Browne did for Lady Lillian. The second caveat I had dealt with the entire Sahib motif. Sahib is a tiger who seems to enjoy the role of cupid. I found the whole last bit of the novel where the tiger more or less forced the couple to spend time alone with each other too contrived. Anthony and Lillian were already beginning to like, respect, and feel the beginnings of love for each other. There really was no need for Sahib to have interfered.All in all &quot;The Perfect Husband&quot; is quite a good read, especially because of it's warm hearted and gallant heroine."},{"Title":"The Perfect Husband (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"The Perfect Husband was an excellent adventure -- the hero who wanted to marry for love but was thwarted, the heroine who trapped the wrong man, the white tiger, and the gaggle of friends from previous novels were all enjoyable aspects. The characterization was excellent. And if one puts aside the oft-questioned workings of the tiger as a plot-point and possibly more-than-tiger being, it can become quite comical.This book is not the first in the series, but it is easily enjoyable as it is. Though the flock of marrieds that appears as the book progresses is a bit confusing at first, in the end it is nothing more than an enticement for the reader to track down the other novels in the sequence.Personal Note:I do not read many straight regency romances. I would not recognize a historical inaccuracy if it was circled in red on the page. And, I like (and this is one of the main reasons I greatly enjoyed this book) series where there are links between the heros and heroines, and where the &quot;visiting&quot; of old friends makes you feel like you know everyone. This book, with its host of recurring characters and cute twist of a tiger singlehandedly had me picking up straight regencies again."},{"Title":"The Perfect Husband (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"The book, while quite readable, has two central problems--a boring main romance and too many characters.1. The main romance starts well. The two main characters, Lillian and Tony, seem to have a connection in the beginning. When they are forced into marriage (the how is covered in other reviews), we're supposed to believe that he is utterly convinced she is nothing but a featherhead. Lillian becomes guilt-ridden and withdrawn, Tony becomes resentful, and they spend the rest of the book being uneasy around each other and complimenting each other on how nice and caring the other is.(Given the premise, there is understandably no steamy sex scenes or necking.)2. This book is #4 in a series of 6. This setup works terribly. There are much too many characters to keep track of in a 200-page novel. 6 guy friends, 4 wives, a tiger, 10 noble friends and family, plus noble extras and a couple of servants. And the extra characters aren't making cameos. We're supposed to care about over 15 of them, plus the overarching plotlines. Doing a series of 6 is a great marketing ploy, but it would have served the stories better to have structured them as an epic or a series of 3 larger novels. The large cast of characters is a more realistic reflection of our own lives, but when we're peeking into someone else's for a couple of hours, we simply cannot care for that many people so soon.If you're reading the series and already know the characters, you will find the book reasonably enjoyable.

Towards the end of the book he decides he loves her but earlier in the book you never really know why she is the special one to him. I did like that the whodunit Ms. Laurens likes to put in each of her Cynster novels is more of a challenge this time. But that kind of fizzles out in the end too. However, this is still a satisfying story and anyone interested in the series should read it."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"well this book is really great i thought. i haven't read devil's bride so i was unprejudiced that way though, although this wasn't my first step. laurens novel and by faaar not the first romance i've read!I'll admit the mystery could have been done a bit better...I had figured out who the culprits are, but not why they were and exactly what they were doing...so there was a bit of suspense.The romance was very well worked out...The chemistry between Vane and Patience was very believable (and YES the sex scenes are also believable...even though the regency era was officially 'prude' doesn't mean that people were!) Laurens is the master of the steamy, emotional love scenes, and while there were plenty of them in this book, there weren't too many.Yes you could get annoyed at Patience for her constant refusal of his marraige proposal, but once the author explains her reason, you can understand.I also thought it was a bit odd how quickly Vane changed his mind not to get married...almost as if by that time in the book the author decided not to continue on that point.wonderful book, i look forward to reading the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"I liked Devil's Bride much better because it had more action and plot. The plot in A Rake's Vow was very thin since Laurens paid very little attention to the Spectre and didn't really develop it. It also seemed to me that she had trouble including everyone in the house party. There were times when she didn't mention some of them at all when they were all supposed to be together. Maybe there were too many people in her story.I also noticed that Laurens has a habit of using the word &quot;who&quot; as the subject of the next sentence after she ends the previous sentence with a name. I still enjoyed this book, but I think Loretta Chase is a much better writer."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"By 1819, Spencer Vane Cynster knows which direction his heart blows when it comes for him to give away his love: nowhere. Vane has vowed to never love or marry anyone because he prefers to be the recipient of pleasurable indulgences from all the aristocratic ladies of the Ton.Patience Debbingham has no use for her male peers and she trusts none of this worthless lot. Since her parents are both dead, the independent Patience is used to doing what she wants even as she raises her teenage brother. They meet when he seeks shelter from a nasty storm in her aunt's home. When her sibling becomes the prime suspect of recent criminal activities, the pair works together to ferret out the real identity of the outlaw. However, both soon realize that the calamitous weather that brought them together moved indoors, with them being in the eye of a passionate storm.Readers will swear that the second &quot;Cynster&quot; Regency romance, A RAKE,S VOW, is one of the sub-genre's top novels of the year. The story line is whimsical yet filled with intrigue and romance. The lead protagonists are a delightfully daring duo, who challenge much of propriety as they find love with one another. After reading this novel and its predecessor, THE DEVIL'S BRIDE, fans will be clamoring for more stories to quickly fall from the Bar Cynster family tree.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"Vane Cynster, Devil's cousin and closest friend, has his turn at meeting his match in this book. An enforced stay at his godmother's house brings him into contact with her niece, Patience Debbington, and a mystery: who is the magpie thief stealing all and sundry, and who is the Spectre who appears at night, in shadow, and appears to haunt the place? The primary suspect is Patience's young brother Gerrard, but Vane doesn't believe that for an instant. His godmother begs him to stay and sort it out, and as he is already very intrigued by Patience he agrees.Patience is alarmed by Vane and does her best to avoid him; she's also worried about the effect he's having on Gerrard. ...The plot of this book follows exactly the same direction as Devil's Bride. Vane - determined not to marry - encounters a woman and knows that he's met his fate. He wants to marry her. He proposes; she refuses him. He determines to persuade her through sensuality and at the same time find out why she won't marry him. And in the background there is a (not very interesting and pretty transparent) mystery plot - again, I'd worked out who was behind it pretty early on; ... Maybe Laurens wanted him to be seen as an idiot?I found Vane's approach to Patience unconvincing; in one scene - when he'd just met her - he was aware that she had the power to attract him in a way no woman had before. And he was determined to resist that: he didn't *want* to marry. And yet barely a half-dozen pages later, with nothing having happened in the meantime, he was suddenly reconciled to his fate and determined to marry her. ...And Patience's antipathy to Vane in the beginning was simply not explained until some way in the book. I can accept her stereotyping him as a certain type of man - and not being told what she meant by an \`elegant gentleman' until almost halfway through the book did not help! - but we need to know *what* stereotype she's using, and why it bothers her. That took some time to convey.Again, a lot of detailed sex scenes, which is fine if you like that kind of thing; they're too numerous and technical - as well as lengthy - for my preference. I prefer my lovemaking scenes to focus on the emotions rather than descriptions of sex organs. Of course the extent and locations of Vane and Patience's amorous encounters are all wrong for the period, and I'm not sure why Laurens seems to assume that engaged, or near-engaged, couples of the - quite Puritanic, remember! - Regency period would naturally have sex. This has come across in three of her books now; her heroes seem to make an automatic assumption that an engagement means free sex. ...I do have the rest of the Cynster series and will keep reading - Laurens has a readable style, even if I do skim some scenes - but I do hope that she varies her plots for later books."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"This was the first book I read of Stepjanie's Lauren's or the Cynster series. I am hooked!! Vane was so refreshing, and so real in his reactions. I thought Patience was wonderful!! I was surprised to read that the majority of the other reader reveiws found her boring. I have a very busy day with work and family, and found this book to be fun, engrosiing, a wonderful story, and not at all insulting of my intelligence. I loved this book, the story line, the characters, Vane, and the incredible love scenes. Maybe because this was the first of the Ms. Lauren's books, I was not set up for diappointment. I have since purchased &quot;Scandals' Bride&quot; and LOVED it am now ordering Devil's Bride. These Cynster Men are awe-inspiring!! Let me say that I would like to thank Ms. Lauren's for doing more for the lovelife in my 11 year marriage than anything else - Stephanie Lauren's writing is the most wonderful aphrodesiac!!"},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"Okay, for those of you who are Bar Cynster fans, here me out, not that I need to defend my opinion in anyway.I believe Stephanie Laurens has exceptional writing skills, especially when it comes to her love scenes. I really believe that in that particular case, she's at the top of her class in this area.But what I find typical of her stories is that her love scenes usual sizzles while her surrounding story/mystery-line fizzles.The characers and mainly the plot surrounding the love story appears either uninspired, half-hearted and lagging. In fact, the only sure-fire thing you can look foward to (and never be disappointed in)is the love scenes themselves.Unfortunately, I find it to be the very case with \\"A Rake's Vow\\". For one, she tries to convince us that Vane is this alpha-male, ladies' man that does as he pleases. He, just like all the Cynster males, vow that they shall never marry.I don't know if its just me, but I truly would like know why they were so against the martial state in the first place. This was never made clear, so you never knew the real motives behind the \\"Bar Cynster\\" get-togeter to begin with....Anyway, Vane then suddenly meets his match -all of a sudden- when he meets this 26 year old spinster who has nothing to claim to her name but an annoying younger brother and a cat.For all we hear of how dashing these Cynster males are, Vane's love interest, with the way she was described as this spinster who never really got out much, doesn't really suit his tastes, in my opinion. I just feel that Patience (the herione's name)could have had a lot more going on for her than was described in her side of the story. Compared to all the other heriones in the Bar Cynster series, she's the most boring!Besides the characters not being overly consistent with their viewpoints, the mystery just plain as hell, sucked. After reading 4 of her books, I am convinced more than ever that S. Laurens lacks the talent to write a decent plot/mystery line to hold together the romance that helps build her characters and push the story along.I find that it is not so much the characters that lack depth so much, but the plot itself and with this book - like most of her books- I get bored easily after reading only 10 pages or less, despite the well-detailed, page-scorching sex scenes.I am one of those people who appreciate a well-thought out, engaging mystery, if there is to BE one, along with the tittilating sex..... But if I had to choose ONE aspect over another, I'd choose a good plot/mystery over steamy love scenes all the time.A \\"Rake's Vow\\" could do no justice for me, I am sorry to say..."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"Something was definitely missing from this book. In the rest of the Cynster series, Vane is portrayed as one of the most enigmatic of the cousins. In his own story, however, Vane falls into the mold of the regency period rake. There is not much development to his character outside of this formula.Patience is just as typical of a character. I was bored with her.Laurens is also in the habit of repeating herself over and over again. She will use 3 adjectives where one simple description will do. I don't understand what her purpose in this display of vocabulary is, but it has the result of cluttering up the page with meaningless text to the point where it is difficult to follow the storyline.Between the flat, formulaic characters and the excessive verbiage of the descriptions (particularly when dealing with the emotions of the characters), I was just annoyed by the book."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"After a few Stephanie Laurens' books, I almost gave up but someone told me about her first Cynster book - Devil's Bride. When I saw a good deal on the Devil's Bride/A Rake's Vow combo, I bought it.Devil's Bride did not disappoint me but A Rake's Vow did.How many times can Vane \\"arrogantly raised his brows\\", or \\"coolly arrogant, raised a brow\\", or \\"quirked a brow\\", or \\"a brow arogantly quirked\\"? I counted, in one instance, 5 in 2 pages. I attempted to say: \\"Stop raising your eyebrows or you will stick with a surprised expression forever\\" - just like my mother always said.Vane was my favorite of all Devil's cousins and Ms. Laurens did not do him justice in this book. Why did he feel that Patience is \\"The One\\"? There was no indication or explanation for the way he felt - just that it was \\"fate\\".I think I am done with Ms. Laurens. Her style of writing is not to my liking. I like Mary Balogh or Jo Beverley better. Their books are not trenched with sex scenes and you know why the couples fall in love."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"Caught up in a bad weather, Vane Cynster decides to pass the night at Bellamy Hall, his godmother's place. Upon arrival, he meets Patience Debbington, who immediately catches his rakish eyes. When Vane learns from his godmother that there has been a series of theft (with Gerard Debbington being the main suspect) and that a spectre is haunting the grounds, he agrees to stay on and help solve the mystery, much to the dismay of Patience, who has taken an instant dislike of him on the grounds that he is an 'elegant gentleman' and the possible influence he may have on her brother, Gerard.The plot follows that of Devil's Bride, which would have been fine had it been written in a more convincing way and supported by memorable secondary characters. But the mystery was too weak, and some of the secondary characters were boring and plain annoying, to the point of being ridiculous. And I found it hard to relate to Patience and really like her compared to Honoria. She just lacks depth and is rather boring in my opinion. Her dislike for 'elegant gentlemen' in particular should have been explained earlier in the book to make her dislike of him a little easier to understand. At times, I felt like she wasn't being totally honest with Vane. As for Vane, he wasn't really portrayed as well as Devil and his character just wasn't fully realized.After reading Devil's story, I was quite disappointed with this novel. Since Vane was the other Bar Cynster member who featured the most in the first book, I was eager to read his story but sadly, this didn't live up to my expectations. I think that this is the weakest of the 6 Bar Cynster novels, and I actually skipped a lot of pages just to get to the end. But still, I think that this would probably be enjoyable to those who haven't read Devil's Bride."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"Just when you thought Stephanie Laurens couldn't get any better, she writes another stunning novel.Following Devil's Bride as the second book in the Bar Cynster series by Laurens, this book manages to top the first.Vane Cynster makes a mad run for it after his cousin Devil's wedding, as he refuses to be caught in the parson's mousetrap as well, but leave it to a thunderstorm to force him to take cover at his godmother's house, and introduce him to Miss Patience Debington.When Patience gets trapped in the intrigue surrounding a petty thief at the house party she's attending, things begin to look up for her and her brother Gerrard when Vane shows up and puts his investigating skills to good use.Though Patience hates the idea of getting tied to an &quot;elegant gentleman&quot; for life, she finds herself falling in love with the handsome cynster.Laurens continues to amaze with her talent for writing. Hopefully she'll continue to pull off these wonderful romance novels for many years to come."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"Even though this is the second book in the series, I read it last and found it just as satisfying as all the others. Nobody is doing Regency romances better today than Stephanie Laurens. The plot of this book focused almost exclusively on the relationship between the two leads. There was some sort of mystery plot surrounding the whole thing, but frankly I couldn't keep the cast of characters straight and didn't find it very interesting. Not that it mattered. The core relationship was more than enough to keep me entertained. Unlike some of Laurens novels, the heroine in this book is a very level-headed, smart young woman. As always, the Cynster lead was devastatingly sexy. If we can't clone them in real life, at least Laurens has given us the next best thing - Cynster after Cynster."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"This is my third book by Stephanie Laurens, and unfortunately...I think its my last...I have tried to like this author, but I just cant do it. \\"A Rakes Vow\\" was sooo excruciatingly slow I wasnt even able to finish it...there was no plot..its just a bunch of way too long sex scenes broken up by chatting around the breakfast table...Not worth reading..."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"A RAKE'S VOW picks up where DEVIL'S BRIDE left off. After attending the dedication of a chapel roof Honoria Cynster strong-armed the single Cynster cousins into funding, Spencer \\"Vane\\" Cynster flees the realm of matchmaking mamas and marriage-minded debutantes, only to be done in by a storm. The erratic weather forces him to break his journey at his godmother Minnie's estate, and the first sight that greets his eyes upon his arrival is the too-fetching form of Patience Debbington, Minnie's niece, bent over a flower bed.Vane is the last person Patience wants to see - not that they've met before, but she knows the type. Her father was a consummate rake, leaving her mother languishing in the country while he conquered town and ignored his family. Patience is alarmed when she learns Vane has decided to stay; she does not need someone as tempting as him in her life, and she certainly doesn't want him corruptly influencing her impressionable younger brother, Gerrard. Vane has agreed to stay and track down the mysterious \\"magpie\\" thief that has been plaguing the household, taking bric-a-brac which appears to have only sentimental value. On top of the thief, there also appears to be a specter haunting the ruins of the abbey on which the estate was built. The house's mismatched occupants - guests Minnie shelters to keep her from being lonely - appear to be united in their choice for a suspect: Gerrard.Vane and Patience join forces to clear Gerrard's name, and on the way, they succumb to their strong mutual attraction. There's only one problem: Vane is metaphorically driving for the nearest church and Patience is running as far and as fast as she can in the other direction! Can Vane convince Patience of his sincere belief in love and family without having to grovel or humble himself? Will Patience learn to believe in love as a strength rather than a weakness? Given the Cynster history, readers know there will be a happily-ever-after, but only when both parties learn to give a little, guaranteeing that the way to true love is an interesting (and sometimes steamy) read.Patience's doubts and fears of marriage without love are made vivid and real, and Vane, being the wonderful and sensitive man that he is, does a very complete job of convincing Patience to see the truth of his feelings for her. Patience, in turn, is just the right heroine to teach Vane that humbling himself to admit his love is not a bad thing when the rewards are so plentiful. Laurens has nailed the chemistry between these two very likable characters. The suspense is still a little lacking, although the mystery is a great deal less transparent than the one presented in DEVIL'S BRIDE - but keep in mind, this is not a mystery novel. A RAKE'S VOW is a great relationship story, and any fan of the Cynsters or Regency romances will appreciate it.

It stretches the imagination too much to swallow Vane Cynster, a typical London rake and \\"man about town\\" is so devoted to his Godmother that he would spend weeks looking for a petty theif in her unorthodox household.

I was more than pleasantly surprised. While Vane is the typical Cynster (no faults, whatsoever) Patience is a wonderful heroine who does only what all heroines in romance novels do - she waits for love. If she had, in the face of Vane's serious declarations of love, dragged her feet, and for no worthwhile reason continued to refuse Vane, I would have agreed with the other reviewers.

Yes, by now I know part of what I am going to get when I pick up a new Cynster novel: strong, sexy, possessive family-loving male protaganist. Strong heroine. Some arousing sensual scenes. A happy ending. The reason I keep buying, and enjoying, each new book is that Laurens does provide a new conflict each time, and her main characters have different personalities from book to book. (Besides - when I want to be surprised, I read murder mysteries) Here, Patience is reluctant to trust Vane because of his superficial resemblance to her father, while Vane is an intuitive type who doesn't always find it easy to put his feelings into words - especially when he can put them into caresses instead. I think their relationship develops throughout the book in a plausible way, as Patience gradually dares to trust, and Vane succeeds better and better at getting his feelings into words. I'm glad this book, like her others, is long. I get to see the characters develop through many different incidents, and my enjoyment is prolonged."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"I am fairly new to this series that has been around for years. So when I read the first book in the Cynster Series,Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels), and loved it, I knew I would have to read more. But I didn't expect book number two to be so much like book number one. It isn't like I disliked it, not at all, it is very well written but it was like the author used a template from the first book and entered different characters and scenes. The mystery does seem to go on for an interminable amount of time and it was pretty easy to figure out early-on. I actually was hoping for some eye opening twist. There is lots of sex which seems to be the hallmark of this series. Not complaining, mind you, just saying there is lots. The hero, Vane Cynster, is certainly everything I like in a hero, strong, handsome, caring, protective, sexy, etc. The heroine, Patience, was a bit one dimensional and I had trouble understanding why Vane fell so hard, so fast. But I'll allow that it was just one of those chemistry things. I will continue on with book #3 in the series,Scandal's Bride (Cynster Novels)."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"I've read this series all out of order, and finally got to read this one, the earliest one I've read so far.

I loved the plot, and the characters.However, the one thing that bothers me, still to this day, is Laurens's wordiness. Itn gets on my nerves, and I'm sure a lot of others'. For instance, the way she writes certain sentences can be arranged in another way to make the paragraph flow a little more. And there were so many words that made me stop and think, Wait, that's an actual word?Of course the intimate scenes were very steamy and detailed.

This was my second book in the Cynster Series, and I really liked Devil's Bride much better. I don't know if I will continue with the Cynster Series (when and if I even finish this one). At least I can see from other reviews that I'm not the only one disappointed in this book. I'm going to force myself to read the rest of it, but I honestly can't see myself continuing with this series.The plot is thin at best, and taking far too long to get interesting.

The pace was a lot slower and Vane came off a little desperate towards the middle of the book. This would not have been a huge let-down if it were not for the wonderfulness of Devil's story. I will still look forward to the rest of the Cynsters though and hope that they're up to the standards of book 1."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"If you you are a fan of this author, this is an alright book. Stephanie Laurens has however written much better books, so for those who have not read Stephanie Laurens, I do recommend &quot;Scandal's bride&quot; and &quot;Captain Jack's woman&quot; first. The latter is not part of the Bar Cynster. The first book in the Bar Cynster serie is Devil's bride. I don't think there is a need to read them following each other; in fact, I do think it is better to just read one by one because it gets a little boring to have part of the story repeated all the time and hear how marvellous (yes, I know what genre it is) those cousins are."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"After reading Devil's Bride I couldn't wait for Vane's story to be published. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed. Vane, who we met in Devil's Bride, would simply not succumb to marriage as easily as was portrayed in this book. The author had him put up no fight at all. In fact, it seemed to be one chapter after another of Vane agonizing over how he would convince Patience to marry him. Stephanie, what were you thinking? Vane deserved better! Please don't let Scandal down."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"I enjoyed the character of 'Vane' in Devil's Bride and decided to pick up the book with Vane's story. Although he is still very bit as attractive, he somehow lacked the excitment of a hero in this story. I failed to understand how the two of them felt in love. The relationship between the hero and heroine were not well developed leaving me only understanding the lust between the two.The story moved so so slowly starting from the middle. It was truely painful to get through. The thiefs sub-plot was not exciting in any way and the mystery not well developed in the book. I only finished the book because I bought it and refuse to waste money/book."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"A Rake's Vow is the second book in Stephanie Laurens' Cynster series. After reading the first book in the series - Devil's Bride - I couldn't wait to read Vane's story. He was one of my favourite side characters in Devil's Bride and, as such, A Rake's Vow, promised to be just as enjoyable. Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. For me, this book lacks the excitement, humour and emotion that features in Devil's Bride. Vane and Patience share a physical passion but I felt there was a lack of real chemistry and their love is not really believable.The mystery surrounding the spectre and the thief is a little weak and I found sections of the book rather boring. Similarly to Devil's Bride, Laurens filled this book with numerous explicit sex scenes, each of which are described in such intricate detail that they cover pages and pages of the book. This also has a tendancy to become somewhat boring after a while.I am hoping the other books in the Cynster series are an improvement on this particular book as I would still like to read them all but, after the disappointment of this book, I will leave it for a little while."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"This is my second excursion into Stephanie Laurens' period love story. They are well written novels with much attention given to plot development. I enjoyed Evil's Bride somewhat, although I found the love between the main characters and the characters themselves, to be hardened.Take Two, and Rake's vow has a similar plot and love scenes to Devil's Bride, but with more emotional sensitivity, and the main character Vane, actually acknowledges his love for his bride Patience.It was a little slow is places with not a lot of action or movement with the story. And there were a lot of secondary characters, that at times it's a little hard to keep up with who's who.the love scenes were descriptive and intense, although sometimes the description was superfluous and too flowery that it made me roll my eyes. but in all, an entertaining novel and it certainly doesn't put me off reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"You can't go wrong with Stephanie Laurens' earlier works. Any books published after \\"The Perfect Lover,\\" are not her best works and have not been the sameI do think Stephanie Laurens does use the same kind of characters and similar plots, but each story has a different back drop that makes it special. I'm not saying that all her novels past \\"The Perfect Lover\\" succeed to live up to our expectations, but for this story, I have to say is worth your money. It's not the best like Devil's story, but it lives up to my expectation as a Stephanie Laurens book. For me, it's not worthwhile to read a hero less than ideal to the Cynster males... those alpha males make you want to read more and more. I don't care if the characters and plots are similar-- as long as she re-delivers the magic in a different way, then I'll be there buying her books.Bar Cynster Series:1. Devil's Bride2.

A group of strong virile males who love family and protect it at all cost? Not to mention just how handsome the whole lot of them are. But ah this all seems to play against one Vane Cynster (as in weather vane thank you very much) because right of the bat Patience labels him an \\"elegant gentleman\\" which of course he is. But in her terms this means a man who doesn't love and feels fit to sleep with anything he wants while keeping a wife and nursery at home. Ah but Miss Patience doesn't know the Cynster's very well now does she.The second book in the thrilling series by Stephanie Laurens A Rakes Vow kept my attention throughout. While it was not quite as exciting as the first book Devil's Bride, but not to worry it is wonderful. You get to follow Vane as he is leaving the dedication ceremony for the church he and his Cousins had to help re-roof thanks to Honoria. And true to his name while Vane has no plan at all to be leg shackled and seeks to get out of the storm at his Godmothers house, but fate has another idea in mind. And from the moment he seems Miss Patience Debbington, he knows fate had another idea in mind.We follow Vane as he isn't sure what to do about fates plan, and than his inevitable acceptance. And Patience having some issues of her own with the whole idea. All the while we have aback cast of characters, and someone who is stealing things. Now the plot with the thief and the scepter at times drama drags. But in the end it is curious and you do follow some sweeps and turns. Although I knew one person involved in it from the moment they mentioned a certain clue, (no I am not going to give it away.). Truly though bar a few small blips is fantastic. Huzzah to Stephanie Laurens and Huzzah to the Cynster men bring on the next one!"},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"Except for her hard-to-understand aversion to men like Vane, Patience is a good if slightly ordinary heroine. We eventually understand her reasoning, but it takes time to sympathize. Vane is one of those characters you really want to like, a lot, but Laurens never gives him his due. To me, Vane is never as clearly realized as the rest of the Cynsters.I, however, found it refreshing (having read this series out of order) to have the hero almost immediately realize that this was the woman he wanted to marry and she's the one who needs convincing. The mystery plot was not particularly good; honestly, why could no one figure out the sand any earlier? Geez.But Laurens writes well, and this book is enjoyable, although certainly not the best of the series. I think Vane has been cheated; it's almost as though the author never really understood him. His handling of Patience's brother Gerrard was one of the most insightful elements. Read it as part of the series, but it's hardly the best. Devil's and Scandal's stories are much better."},{"Title":"A Rake's Vow (Cynster Novels)","review":"Vane is the second eldest in the 6 known as the Bar cynster.

Vane comes to the youngster rescue while adding him in some growing up of his own. How honorable.He of course falls in love but is unwilling to admit it. I don't know why men just can't get it through their heads that a women wants to be loved. He wouldn't have to do so much convincing if he would just recognized what is there. Oh well, Patience doesn't seem to mind his tactics. In fact, he is pretty convincing. Enough to set your blood to boiling. There is a scene in the conservatory that will never leave you looking at a fountain the same way again.Her novel is fun to read. I enjoyed trying to figure out who the real theif was. The situations Patience and Vane got themselves into playing detective were amusing.Vane and Patience are one steamy couple. Definitely buy this novel.

Gerard is Patience's sweet, teenage, younger brother and she is trying to be everything to him, and keep him from being exposed to rakes and the bad life. He is more interested in his art, anyway. It was a fairly good story with lots of characters to keep track of. I like the family tree she has in each book, to remind just who is who and from whom.

I can not compare this book to her first in the Bar series, but on the whole it was a good read. I'm in the understanding that a Cynster does drop their rake, rouge (what have you) character when the have met the women they want to marry. This seemed perfectly logical to me. And I have to agree with another reviewer who said that Patience lacked in depth of character. But she was still very likable.Enough babbling ... on the whole the book was great. The love scences where fabulous. There where a couple of times I wanted to smack both Vane and Patience up side they head for being so blind to the obvious... but then again I guess that's what made them seem more real and human.

Considering that web page design is a relatively simple task (compared to, for example OS design,) this book proves that it is possible for man-kind to mess up just about anything. The one good thing I discovered from reading this book is what not to look for in an InterDev development book. At best, it's a confusing introduction.

Definitely, I fell in love with her books."},{"Title":"Maida Heatter's Cakes","review":"I have owned Heatter's 'chocolate deserts' book for years, and it is a great book for the most part, so I have been VERY dissapointed in her 'cakes' book. Cakes of all kinds are my speciality, and this is just a poor, poor cookbook. Nearly all of the recipies contain odd errors-especially in baking times-if you try to use this book, be very careful, cuz her overly specific baking times are usually too long. Neither of my kitchens have been able to make her times work as printed.The recipies themselves are very odd as well-frankly, most of the times that I have gotten them to be succesful, people dont really like them that much. It seems like her goal was to collect as many recipies as she could that involved at least thirty dollars worth of nuts and dried fruit. \\"Fruitackes\\" would have been a more accurate title for this book. For God's sake even the chocolate cakes are packed full of fruit etc. Yuck.The cheesecake section of the book speaks for itself in the overwrought fussiness department...almost all of the recipies just sound gross-reading the ingredients is enough to ruin your appetite...way, way overdone.I would definetly recomend her chocolate desert book, but this one goes in the trash. I gave it the benefit of the doubt for a while, but that only goes so far!"},{"Title":"Maida Heatter's Cakes","review":"I owned an older edition of this book and eagerly bought this newer one when it became available. Maida Heatter is one of those cookbook writers who is as enjoyable to read as to cook from.I consider this book the diametric opposite in style to Bevelyn Blair's cake book, which is also a great book. Whereas Blair's book is sleek and substantial with virtually no 'fat' in the writing, Mrs. Heatter has a story to write about each of her recipes. For those who only want the recipe, no brag, just fact, buy Blair's book. However, if like me, you enjoy learning some background on a recipe, this book is up your alley. Mrs. Heatter freely admits mistakes and trials leading to the recipes, and I suggest the buyer take those to heart. Like another reviewer, I've tried tweaking some of her recipes, to my regret. She has obviously worked long and hard on these recipes and has perfected these through trial and error.Many of the cake recipes in this book involve several steps, and can get quite complicated, especially for a novice cake baker. This is where Mrs. Heatter really shines. Her instructions are explicit and detailed. Few things are more frustrating than receiving a new recipe where the instructions leave the baker guessing steps. Not a problem with Mrs. Heatter! Though some of the instructions will be redundant to the experienced baker, I think it's much better to get too many instructions than too few!The English Madeira cake is a jewel, possibly the best all-around pound cake I've ever baked. Her 'best damn lemon cake' is awesome in its overwhelming lemon-y flavor, a golden jewel that's certain to fly off your serving plate.Mrs. Heatter also recommends having a stand mixer with two bowls and sets of beaters (she's a Sunbeam user). I'd recommend the same for these recipes--two bowls will cut down on the rather long preparation times.Also--use bread crumbs like she recommends rather than flour for pan prep. It really does work, and work well.In summary, this can be a great book for the novice cake baker wanting to learn technique, as well as the more experienced baker wanting to try new flavors. Her accessible and reader-friendly writing style completes a delightful book"},{"Title":"Maida Heatter's Cakes","review":"Stated simply, there are no better dessert cookbook writers than Maida Heatter. I have five of her bookbooks and from pleasant experience know that she has no bad recipes in any of her books. This one is no exception. If you can read English and own an oven, I'm not sure how you could possibly screw up one of these cakes. Ms. Heatter spends two to three pages on the simplest of cakes. She tells you where to place the rack in the oven, how many minutes to beat the sugar and butter together and what the batter will look like. For example, in the recipe for Cranberry Upside-Down Cake on page 201, she says: \\"The mixture might appear slightly curdled--it is okay.\\" I'm happy to say I cooked this cake for the first time a few days ago. My friends thought it was wonderful. The best lemon cake I have ever baked and/or eaten has to be East 62nd Street Lemon Cake(page 22.)Over 20 years ago, when I had never melted chocolate in my life, I cooked a perfect Queen Mother's Cake (pp. 54-56.)The Robert Redford Cake(59-61)is a wonder to behold. Then there is the Oreo Cookie Cake, and on and on they go.There are sections on all kinds of cakes here: plain cakes, chocolate cakes, layer cakes, fancy cakes, cheesecakes, fruitcakes, cakes with fruits and vegetables, yeast cakes, sweet breads and more. And all kinds of tips-- even how to wash a pastry brush.There are no photographs in this book but who needs them? Your own cakes will be pretty enough to photograph. If you own other Heatter cookbooks, be forewarned; these recipes have been previously published in two of the author's earlier dessert books but here the cake recipes are all together.I must admit that I find the cheesecake recipes-- at least most of them, a little over the top. I suppose that's because cheesecake recipes have been anthologized to death and Ms. Heatter sought out the most exotic ones. And I, being a lazy cook, an unwilling to fool with baking a cheesecake in a pan of water. Having said that, if I could have only one dessert cookbook, it would have to be this one."},{"Title":"Maida Heatter's Cakes","review":"I bought this on a whim, with no idea who the author was, or if the recipes were any good. But much to my surprise, the promises made on the cover and in the blurbs actually panned out into fantastic results. Maida has perfected every one of the recipes, so much so that even the slightest tweaking of them on my part usually ends up in less than perfect results. (A word of caution though; I find most of the cakes a touch on the sweet side, so bakers with a less-than-sweet tooth may want to reduce the sugar.)Nonetheless, it is a fabulous selection, a mind-boggling array of delicious cakes (more than 175!) whose recipes are so carefully crafted and lovingly detailed that they will work beautifully even in the hands of the most inexperienced novice. Instructions are crystal clear, and Maida never leaves room for any ambiguity to creep in and spoil a recipe. She doesn't always tell you WHY a particular step is performed (unlike Rose Levy Beranbaum's &quot;The Cake Bible&quot;), but it always works. (If she did explain, I imagine the book would be twice as long, given how detailed her instructions already are!) As a book for learning the art of baking, I think it needs to be paired with something else as well to make up for the lack of explanation (Why a tube pan? Why the bottom third of the oven? Why 350 degrees here but not there?), but it is a rich resource indeed.The book has a number of typos, surprisingly, but they do not affect understanding of the recipes (thank goodness).There are, however, few concessions to health and diet -- the main thrust is delicious cake, but the enthusiatic reader can still find some healthy choices (like the marvellous Zucchini Loaf, butterless and low in cholestrol, yet marvellously moist and delicious).

This one, in essence, is a collection of some of her best recipes. You can't go wrong when you follow her easy, fool-proof instructions. The techniques she has taught me over the years helps me with other, less informative, cook book authors. Her precise instructions give you total confidence in the results. My favorites, which I have made many times are the East 62nd Street Lemon Cake, the Queen Mother's Cake, and the Sour Cream Cake (which is unbelievably delicious). She is always the one that I return to."},{"Title":"Maida Heatter's Cakes","review":"I found this book to have a variety of excellent recipes especially the Bullseye cheesecake which is dense and delicious. The author writes in an informal style and describes what should be happening during the cooking process very well.

All in all an excellent buy if you need to make cakes, the recipes are traditional but do have some creativity to make them different."},{"Title":"Maida Heatter's Cakes","review":"This book is full of wonderful recipes that just prove that Maida Heatter is the expert on baking. I started off with the Zucchini bread, which is out of this world. I then tried the sticky buns. My family thought I bought them at a bakery. And they weren't that difficult. Anybody who has baked before will be able to complete them with ease.

The recipes vary from pound cakes to layer cakes with frostings and from cheesecakes to sweet breads and yeasted sweet treats. Had there been some pictures, I would have given it 5 stars (I like the visual aspect as an extra inspiration). But the recipes definately deserve 5 stars in itsself."},{"Title":"Maida Heatter's Cakes","review":"I was disappointed that there were no photographs inside this book, as I find photos helpful not only for choosing what I want to bake, but also helpful in creating a finished cake."},{"Title":"Scooby-Doo!

I have purchased two or three copies over the years of both. With Scooby-Doo, however, I ended up being pretty disappointed. The paint is easy to \\"swipe around\\" and covers pretty well but almost everything on the page is a combination of yellow and blue which makes the picture end up looking like a big park no matter what the subject is. I really wish they would bring these types of coloring books back. I am having a hard time finding them to buy anywhere anymore and I prefer these to regular coloring books when doing activities with my nieces and nephews.

Or mom to caring book buyer...This is my first time bringing home one of the \\"Alphabet Friends\\" series and I have to say that I am *very impressed*. This book has a lot going for it. It uses bold text and color to draw attention to the letter \\"b\\" in all of it's forms. The book points out that \\"b\\" can be found anywhere within a word: beginning, middle, end.In addition, at the very beginning where the letter \\"b\\" is introduced, there are two huge letter Bb's (they cover the whole page) in the background. I took my preschoolers finger and traced those letters so he could feel what they are like, as well as see them.From there the book introduces pictorial representations of words (rebuses) so that even older toddlers can get the feel and idea of what it is like to read.Having said all this wonderful stuff, I have to add that there is no way that I would buy this book, or buy into this series. My goodness, at $21 dollars a book that would be well over $546 US dollars for the set-and that's not counting shipping!!

The Acknowledgement thanks Arthur G Nuhrah, who wrote his PhD thesis at Tulane University about Scots-Irish Presbyterian John McDonogh Junior.In her Preface, the author states that without access to Dr Nuhrah's research she could never have written this biography about the New Orleans bachelor tycoon who enabled slaves to buy their freedom so that they could go to Liberia.The story is told in ten chapters with a rather disturbing Epilogue wherein are reproduced biting newspaper obituaries that appeared at McDonogh's death.***A Google search about John McDonogh yields enough information to ensure that the author has indeed grasped on to a contentious personality. One article from The Journal of Southern History, gives a link to:John McDonogh--New Orleans Mercantile CapitalistLewis E. Atherton, The Journal of Southern History, Vol. 7, No. 4 (Nov., 1941), pp. 451-481doi:10.2307/2191437, This article consists of 31 page(s).http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=00224642(194111)7%3A4%3C451%3AJMOMC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-FAnother item from Google offers: Reports of Cases Argued and Determined in the Supreme Court of Louisiana by Louisiana Supreme Court - 1859 - Law reports, digests, etc... will and testament of John McDonogh, is a genuine instrument, written, dated or signed by the said McDonogh.http://books.google.com.au/books?id=UrUEAAAAYAAJ&pg;=A86&lpg;=PA86&dq;=john+mcdonogh+junior&source;=web&ots;=y4FXfAPMt&sig;=gWbJVxm0vb0DRUAaWeN8B_yaIoE&hl;=en*CONTENT: Chapter 1 begins with a quotation from the Will of John McDonogh Jr. and thereby sets the tone for the whole book:\\"I have still one small request to make...it is that it be permitted annually to the children to plant and water a few flowers around my grave. This little act...will open their young and susceptible hearts to gratitude and love to their Divine Creator, for having raised up (as the humble instrument of His Bounty to them) a poor, frail worm of earth, like me.\\"Today's reader usually has a conventional simplistic and not a differentiated view of the US slave era, much as Apartheid South Africa has been reduced to a caricature of simplistic racist thinking, or, for that matter, in much the way how World War Two is reduced to one of \`Holocaust-Shoah' remembrances. We may even focus on ancient history and how Greek and Roman democracy are celebrated without focusing on the fact that such societies had a built-in slave system. Then again, today's western societies are free and democratic and are celebrated as such, but you had better not state that a large sector of the population within any one of those free and democratic states is enslaved to international finance. But slavery of that kind is always attributed and explaind with reference to personal failings.Amelia Phillips Aremia manages to break this stereotypical way of viewing complex human interactions by focusing on McDonogh's personal written record and, of course, on the \`worn, stained, and brittle yellowish pages curled at the corners' of his old leather-bound Bible. Add to that the patriotism of the Federalist kind that Donogh's father inculcated his son with and the stage is set for a tense and productive journey through life. Early impressions included the boy sitting on his father's broad shoulders and standing under an elm tree watching George Washington \`take the oath of office as the first president of the United States'.During the late 18th century, before the \`French Revolution' and before the US War of Independence, the political climate in the colonies was well informed by a \`transplanted Britisher', Professor Emerson Forsyth, the headmaster of young John Donogh's school. Forsyth predicted that the young German genius, Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel, would influence future political theorists.There is another episode at school that young John survives - the proverbial fight begun by an older boy, which John won, but then concluded the episode without accepting the extended hand held out to him by the older boy, Billy. John's father severely admonishes his son for this because \\"Hate is the mark of a little man, and an expensive luxury. God teaches us that we must forgive if we wish to earn His forgiveness.\\" John and Billy become friends.A subtle rivalry developed over Maria and John won out, for a while, until the young woman, Maria, with her family travelled to Liverpool, England. Billy was also on that trip. Later John receives a letter from Maria, posted from Birmingham, wherein she still expressed her love for John, though now she was already married to Billy! And, like many individuals who lose their first love, John began to acquire the necessary knowledge needed to build a mercantile empire. Later, during his own time in Liverpool, John recalled his father's lesson, and so he sent the couple a wedding present.What follows is a detailed personal account of John developing his empire, and being a pious man, rumour had it that John had God on his side. French and Spanish Catholicism and English Protestantism co-existed in the young French colony as traders plied their wares from the New World to the Old World. Then in July 1803 Napoleon sold Louisiana to the US for $15 m. something the Federalists objected to because it was believed the foreign-speaking Roman Catholics could not be absorbed and thus would threaten the developing democratic way of life within the USA nation. Sounds familiar, doesn't it.The author continues in this vein, making indirect comparisons with today's prevailing US social fabric. It is such insights that humanise and universalise the American dream of old, of how the pioneering spirit enables individuals, at considerable personal sacrifices, to rise above their station in life.The young bachelor John McDonogh grows older as his business flourishes and his social calendar keeps him busy. He becomes a fine art and furniture collector but separation from his parents living in Baltimore, especially from his mother, did cause some grief for which he compensated by inviting his younger brother to stay with him at New Orleans. Yet that, too, reverberates into the usual family tensions most readers who have brothers and sisters would be familiar with.By Chapter Six the European battlefield was dominated by Napoleon, which reflected its effects in trade with the new world. In 1808 the foreign slave trade was abolished, and \\"Professional slave traders ...and prosperous dabblers in slave traffic-among them John McDonogh Junior-now had to turn to the eastern seaboard for new stocks of black laborers\\".Add to that a personal tragedy, the death of his mother while he suffered another severe attack of malaria, McDonogh's faith carried him through more tough personal crises - his father's dying a year later.In 1810 Donogh worried about his Florida holdings because armed American settlers planned a coup to capture Baton Rouge, which succeeded, and Congress approved it by incorporating West Florida into the Orleans territory, later to become Louisiana.Donogh's humane attitude to summary judgments when escaped slaves are caught did not endear him to the locals who had no time for legal niceties. Likewise he felt for the Creole planters, but then he had also developed a reputation: \\"His ruthless oppression of debtors and gentle acts of charity presented a perplexing dichotomy to his critics...\\". And still John soldiered on by enabling his slaves to have time for themselves on Sundays to study the Bible, and giving them his name by permitting them to call themselves McDonogh, and supporting any moves to enable slaves to buy their freedom - then to re-settle in Liberia.When his young sweetheart Maria returns he realized he had never stopped loving her, while she went on to have a family:\\"...None of John's friends, both old and new, could remember when they had seen him so happy, or look so young. He was actually handsome again. Before the evening ended, everyone expected momentarily, to hear a marriage announcement.\\"Unfortunately, for Maria, \\"With John, always so wrapped up in his own doings, there would have been much confusion and bitter selfishness...John never mentioned her after she returned to Baltimore\\".- and then John McDonogh Junior died of cholera. The message in this book is multi-layered where personal and public aspects of John McDonogh's life are effectively interwoven, and they speak for themselves."},{"Title":"Secret of the Emerald Star","review":"Artistically inclined Robin is drawn into the mystery of the cranky old woman next door and a beautiful young girl who seems to be held against her will. Twelve-year-old Stella and her mother are refugees from Cuba, and Stella's overbearing grandmother treats her like a helpless baby because of her blindness. In defiance of her grandmother, Stella constantly wears a beautiful emerald and diamond pin in the shape of a star, a gift from her (dead) Cuban grandmother. Robin senses that more is at stake when a mysterious, unpleasant stranger shows up at the Devery house searching through rubble and sneaking around, but is preoccupied with trying to find a subject to sculpt in clay so that she can enter a sculpting class by a talented local artist.Although dated, \\"Secret of the Emerald Star\\" is another wonderfully engaging, crisply written entry in Phyllis A Whitney's long list of excellent juvenile mysteries, which are all sadly out of print. The book makes an honest attempt to deal with ethnic and religious discrimination, a 1960s view of the Cuban crisis, and (for the time) forward thinking about dealing with blindness. The author includes a brief chapter on the inspiration for Stella's character and of her conversations with blind adolescents in preparation for writing the book, as well as the inspiration for Grandmother Devery's stuffy Staten Island neighbourhood that labels people as \\"Cubans,\\" \\"Catholics,\\" and \\"Jews.\\""},{"Title":"Secret of the Emerald Star","review":"I am 46 yrs old and I read Secret of the Emerald Star in the fourth or fifth grade. It left an everlasting sensation on a certain summer day, when the air seems just right that brings me back to the day I read that book for the first time. It was long ago given away in a box of paperback books purchased from the scholastic book club or something like that. I have recurring flashbacks of the scenes in the book and how I hoped to befriend a blind girl to see if she was the same as the character in the book. I perceived these thoughts at 10 or 11 years old and have been on a mission since this past summer to find the old friend and see how I like it 35 yrs later...I will send the REAL review at a later date to see if I am pleasantly pleased or disappointed this time around."},{"Title":"Secret of the Emerald Star","review":"This book taught me a lot about blind children. The basic plot was interesting, but was not developed very much. The book focused more on the relationships of the characters in the book than on the mystery.

Otherwise, people might find this book boring."},{"Title":"Secret of the Emerald Star","review":"First I must say I'm not a \\"young reader\\" which is who this book is intended for; nevertheless I did enjoy reading it. Because this is a juvenile mystery I assumed the mystery part of the story would be predicable, however this couldn't be farther from the truth! There are a few lessons to be learned by reading this book. The first is how to relate to a blind person and how you should treat them. Also, the book also addresses ethnic and religious discrimination. Overall, I think this is an engaging book that a kid would enjoy reading."},{"Title":"Secret of the Emerald Star","review":"Secret of the Emeral Star by Phyllis A. Whitney; illustrated by Alex Stein.When Robin Ward and her family moved to Staten Island, one of the first strange scenes she encountered was a lovely young girl whirling around on the front lawn of a huge house. Suddenly a white-haired woman ran out and dragged her away. She found out later that the girl, Stella, was blind, and born in Cuba, where her father had been killed. The stiff and unpleasant old lady was her Grandmother who put lables on everyone -- \\"blind\\" for Stella, \\"newcomer\\" for the Wards, \\"Jew\\" for the sculptor's son, and \\"Catholic\\" for Stella's mother, since none of them fitted into her world. Robin tried to make friends with Stella, but it was a rocky, up-and-down friendship, yet the girls learned from each ohter and the world around them. Stella wore a diamond and emerald pin all the time and there was mystery and danger around the girls upon the arrival of a menacing stranger. An excellent mystery with an unusual approach to the blind youngster."},{"Title":"Death By Dickens","review":"Death by Dickens is a worthy companion to Anne Perry's previous anthology Much Ado About Murder. In this case the stories are based on the novels of Charles Dickens. Two of the stories are based on A Christmas Carol, including my favorite, A Stake of Holly, in which a dying Scrooge, 19 years after the events of the novel, charges Tim Cratchitt to discover the earthly identities of the three Ghosts. As he investigates, he uncovers a diabolical murder. Two are based on A Tale of Two Cities. In Death in Dover the crime is solved by a well-known character from another novel. Sidney Carton is the detective in Anne Perry's story A Tale of One City, in which Marat &amp; Robespierre play roles. There are two Great Expectations Tales, two from the Pickwick Papers, one modern-day story revolving around an Oliver Twist manuscript, and two in which Dickens himself is the detective, once with his friend and fellow author Wilkie Collins and the other with his son-in-law (and Wilkie's brother) Charles Collins. You don't have to know Dickens to enjoy these stories, which are to be read, re-read, and savored."},{"Title":"Death By Dickens","review":"As if Anne Perry isn't creative enough as a novelist, she apparently enjoys editing anthologies, and readers are better off for it. Her latest collection, in which she modestly contributes one of the stories, \\"Death by Dickens\\" is a delightful read, especially for Dickens fans (or any ninth grader who's suffered through \\"Great Expectations\\"!). It's not so esoteric, however, that even if there's a reader who's not familiar with Charles Dickens, the stories, eleven in all, are noteworthy and readworthy.Dickens' writings often were characterized by heavy socially significant themes (\\"Oliver Twist,\\" \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" and many others) and the authors of these stories don't forget that aspect of Dickens.Murder becomes the significant theme (what else-it's edited by Anne Perry!) and each of these writers have skillfully incorporated Dickens' own characters and settings into their own plot developments.A favorite, and written by Perry herself, is \\"A Tale of One City\\" (in which she uses Sydney Carton to \\"save the day,\\" as it were). Bill Crider's \\"Mr. Pickwick vs. the Body Snatchers\\" is probably the best, although Peter Tremayne's \\"The Passing Shadow\\" (in which he teams up Willie Collins and Charles Dickens to investigate-and solve-a particularly grisly murder, is also superb. But the others are just as worth reading.Short stories are generally not what I read, but sometimes a collection comes along that's worth reading-and Ms Perry's done it again.

We are all familiar with A CHRISTMAS CAROL and the transformation of Ebenezer Scrooge; in this collection, Lillian Stewart Carl, whose specialties are ghost stories and fantasy which she weaves in this short feature called \\"A Stake of Holly\\" presents her view of the three spirits and how they save the soul of a modern-day Scrooge. A clever production adapted by David McCann is currently being enacted at the Clarence Brown Theatre, presenting the nighttime journey with the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future (with a darling Tiny Tim) until Christmas eve -- a season favorite.\\"Scrogged: A Cyber Christmas Carol\\" by Carole Nelson Douglas, about a modern Scrooge, Ben Scorggs, put me in mind of Bill Murray's 'Scrooged' film of a few years back. She wrote THE HOLLY AND THE IVY and CAT IN AN ORANGE TWIST. \\"Next Christmas at Dingley Dell\\" by Gillian Linscott and \\"Mr. Pickwick\\" by Bill Crider incorporate some Dickens characters. \\"Mr. Pickwick had been dreaming of something peaceful and lovely, like Dingley Dell in the springtime....\\" He and his wife were nominated for an Anthoony for their collaborative story, \\"At the Hop,\\" and they won the award in 2002 for their story, \\"Choclate Moose.\\"There is murder, mystery, detection in all eleven stories on which the authors used the premise, \\"Who the Dickens done it?\\" and \\"The plot Dickens...\\" Other writers include Martin Edwards, P. N. Elrod, Marcia Talley, Carolyn Wheat, Brendon DuBois, and Peter Tremayne. In the introduction, Anne Perry asks \\"Was there ever a writer who created a finer variety of characters young and old, villainous and heroic, tragid and comical?\\" Dickens' books abound with color, variety, and emotion. With her short \\"A Tale of One City,\\" she and the rest took liberties with a few of his characters \\"all in the cause of ...entertaining the reader and keeping his creations, his city, and his times alive.\\" Two of her books about this time of year are A CHRISTMAS VISITOR and A CHRISTMAS JOURNEY."},{"Title":"Death By Dickens","review":"Anne Perry is at the top of her game as a mystery novelist-and her true genius shows as editor of this creative endeavor!

I'm eager to delve into the others for him!"},{"Title":"Moon (Jump Into Science)","review":"I used this book when teaching a unit on the moon. I read through about 15 books and my children and I picked this one as our favorite.

It is all-emcompasing in regards to what is typically studied about the moon in elementary school."},{"Title":"Moon (Jump Into Science)","review":"Ages 4-8, 32 p. To pick a book to read to a class of 1-2 graders about the MOON, we landed on this awesome Jump Into Science book from National Geographic where a cat and his firefly pal take kids for a moon walk and unlock some secrets about our companion in space that earth \\"can't go anywhere without it.\\" Kids get answers on why does the moon seem to change shape, what is the moon made of and learn brief history and concepts about it from Galileo Galilei's first telescope in 1609, Apollo II's footsteps that remain till today in 1969 to the many scientific names related to the moon such as craters, meteorites, \\"seas\\" as well as the moon's orbiting and sizes in relations to the earth and the sun. The book concludes with a project \\"Making Craters\\" that kids will have great success and fun doing it. The interior pages are attractively designed with astronomical borders that engage young readers' interest in learning. On the page where the cat actually measures the earth and the sun with a ruler had brought forth some laughter.

Boswell equated the modern concept of homosexuality with the medieval concept of sodomy, whereas Jordan does not.Instead, Jordan argues that the term &quot;sodomy,&quot; as used by early church fathers and pre-Renaissance theologians, was a usefully vague invective, employed not altogether differently from the ways &quot;philistinism&quot; was used later or, for that matter, the way &quot;homophobia&quot; is used in some circles today.But parallel to what Jordan says about the term &quot;homophobia,&quot; &quot;sodomy,&quot; too, has been used politically not as a precise explanation for human behavior, but as &quot;a placeholder for an explanation yet to be provided&quot; (167-68).[Arguably, as philosopher Judith Butler does argue elsewhere (cogently), the same could be said for the current uses of &quot;gay,&quot; &quot;homosexual,&quot; &quot;queer,&quot; etc., or for that matter, &quot;sex.&quot;]Jordan's book is an important one for people who identify themselves as either Christian or gay (--or both) because it addresses issues underlying the clash of values and &quot;culture wars&quot; being played out in society now. If indeed, as Jordan suggests, &quot;sodomy&quot; was invented to fill a gap left by Christendom's refusal of the &quot;erotic&quot;--even between two sexes, perhaps progress lies in our seeking a place for the erotic INSIDE the moral, instead of persisting in (often hypocritically) dichotomizing the two--something, in response to a previous reader's comments, Plato did NOT do (though the later Platonists did)."},{"Title":"The Invention of Sodomy in Christian Theology (The Chicago Series on Sexuality, History, and Society)","review":"The Invention of Sodomy in Christian Theology, did not disappoint me. What I expected was a conformation to what I've questioned in Christianity's condemnation of homosexuality. This book presents undeniable evidence that Early Church Fathers spoke of something other than homosexuality. This book does not address the sin of the Church but does present enough evidence as to present homosexuality as a scapegoat for the Church's sin. One can not read this book without wondering why someone has not yet written about the Church's gravest sin."},{"Title":"The Invention of Sodomy in Christian Theology (The Chicago Series on Sexuality, History, and Society)","review":"The writing and reasoning in this history of the medieval formation of Christian condemnation of the &quot;nefarious sin&quot; of &quot;sodomy&quot; are very crisp. My only complaint is that the book is too short (not examining the condemnation of &quot;sodomites&quot; in the first Christian millennium, or in Jewish or Islamic theology).Jordan shows how one after another Church Father produced incoherent condemnations of sodomy--monastic, clerical, and layman--in part out of concern for suggesting such a sin to those not aware of its possibility, in part not wanting to reveal the extent of its prevalence within the priesthood and monasteries. One striking feature is that this tradition/discourse only began more than a thousand years after Christ, who is not recorded as having condemned sodomy or sodomites."},{"Title":"The Invention of Sodomy in Christian Theology (The Chicago Series on Sexuality, History, and Society)","review":"at the start of the second millennium of Christianity.Looking at the preceding &quot;review&quot; that ignores the subject of the book (what Christian theologians of roughly a millennium ago wrote about &quot;sodomy&quot;) and seems to have been written by someone who did not read the book but substituted his own condemnations of homosexuality, I was astounded to read that Romans 1 is clear. The &quot;reviewer&quot; also must not have read that, because the syntax (in the original, which the reviewer probably does not know was not English) is VERY convoluted.There are no condemnations of &quot;sodomy&quot; (by any name) in the Gospels that allegedly report the words of the Christ, and Mark Jordan's book does not deal with the Hebrew background or the first millennium of Christianity.(An earlier reviewer must not have seen the blurb FROM Michel Foucault for John Boswell's book, one that is considerably less sound than Jordan's.)"},{"Title":"The Invention of Sodomy in Christian Theology (The Chicago Series on Sexuality, History, and Society)","review":"Jordan does show convincingly that &quot;sodomy,&quot; in the Bible defined as the sins of the men of Sodom, applies to a range of sinful activities rather than specifically homosexual ones. He does not, however, show that homosexual activity is excluded within that range of activities.But even if Jordan were to show that homosexual activity is not one of the sins of Sodom, the implication for us is merely that &quot;sodomy&quot;--if we would like to be etymologically correct--ought not be used as a term for homosexual activity. If he were to establish that, he would not be establishing that homosexual activity is not a sin. The only implication would be that we should use a different term to describe homosexual sin (as for instance was often done by using the more inclusive term &quot;luxuria,&quot; it appears). Since Jordan shows a hermeneutical friendliness to the Bible (which is what motivates his etymological interest in &quot;sodomy&quot; in the first place), he would be hard pressed to do away with passages of similar brevity in which homosexual activity is specifically labeled as a sin. (In fact he ignores these passages entirely, as the authors he reads do not, which decimates the value of his arguments around pp. 166 ff.)Regarding the Middle Ages, even if &quot;sodomy&quot; had been constructed incorrectly as a term for homosexual activity and similar sexual sins, the idea of those sins was not constructed. His interest turns out to be merely etymological through page 40.For most of the remainder of the book, Jordan moves to &quot;invention&quot; in the rhetorical sense, finding all the different ways that sodomy was discussed--seldom engaging the arguments, as though he is having enough fun repeating all the unsayable words.On 42 and towards the end, he unfairly objects to the use of places and place-names as symbols, calling this an &quot;essentialism&quot; that is &quot;antihistorical.&quot; This hermeneutical prejudice is untenable, and not just in the case of Sodom. One might say that &quot;homophobia&quot; is also one of those words that is used as &quot;an attack upon a [supposedly] malignant essence&quot; (43, cf. 167-68). If Jordan really is attacking the whole system of applying abstract words to sets of activities, he loses the ability to make many of his own points as well.For those interested in the relationship of nature and ethics, the most relevant and good parts are: 54-56, which are especially good for showing the connection between nature, reason, and ethics in Peter Damian; at 87 (and the whole section as well), esp. where Jordan summarizes how Alan of Lille demonstrates the naturalistic fallacy; after a lot of digressing, some material on Albert the Great at 126 ff.; and a good summary of Aristotle's NE at 132. By the Albert the Great section, it becomes apparent that the relation of pleasure to the natural and the moral is what is really at issue. One should also pick up some Plato on this, e.g. from the Laws, 732e, 836c-e, 838b-839c, passages which seem very pertinent. Jordan and Plato seem to diverge regarding this relation. My vote is with Plato."},{"Title":"The Invention of Sodomy in Christian Theology (The Chicago Series on Sexuality, History, and Society)","review":"I had the pleasure of being taught by Mark Jordan my senior year of college at Emory University. I'm not a particularly emotional person when I'm not supposed to be, but one of the lectures he gave in class about this very topic made me teary.

As early as the Council of Ancyra (314 A.D.) the Church spoke juridically against those \\"who.. commit [acts of] defilement with animals or males.\\" Certainly that the Church spoke in different terms, even in circumlocutions, to avoid describing acts so foul against Christian morality provides no \\"cover\\" for the sin. Whether \\"sodomy,\\" \\"defilement,\\" or \\"liers with mankind,\\" Christians have always taught that homosexual behavior is intrinsically disordered and sinful --- at least until revisionist \\"scholars\\" sought to muddy the water with fabrications."},{"Title":"The Invention of Sodomy in Christian Theology (The Chicago Series on Sexuality, History, and Society)","review":"No one is at fault. It is simply the nature of the beast that each book has its limitations, each author his or here axe to grind, and so be it, and so what? The point is that books in general and this book in particular do not go far enough, deep enough. Robert Graves (e.g., THE GREEK MYTHS) is a good place to start one's investigation into the Original Sodomy, which was heterosexual...always!...indeed, it involved a complex sodomistic Priesthood in honor of the Great Goddess, and had nothing whatsoever to do with males."},{"Title":"On shame and the search for identity","review":"This is the sort of pioneering work that changed lives in its time, and still can today. Exploring concepts of shame and of guilt historically and across cultures, and exploring in depth the meaning of these ideas and the feelings they both express and hide, in contemporary society, this book liberates people to understand that, as Ms. Lynd's brilliant analyses point up, the sense of felt guilt may remind one of what one needs to do, and the sense of shame may often hide--and point one to--a beauty in self, and in others, that society's strictures have not let one see.There are many books on the topics of self-esteem and shame. This is the one you need. This is the one to read."},{"Title":"Soldier's Pay","review":"Many people who review this book give it a bad rating because they have read Faulkner before and expect his writing to be of a certain style and intellectual caliber. Perhaps this book is not quite up to the level that people are expecting, but when you compare it with much of the other literature available dramatizing this time period (just after World War I) in a fictional manner, this book stands out as being a simply extraordinary peice of literature. While it lacks much of Faulkner's later literary intuitiveness, this book still demonstrates true Faulknerian style with its soap-opera-ish manner of storytelling and robust character development. Even this, one of Faulkner's least talked about and least admired novels, is better than the work of 99.9% of the authors writing today. What people consider &quot;bad&quot; as a Faulkner book is still leaps and bounds ahead of what other writers are able to produce. I found this book to be an excellent stepping-stone into Faulkner's style and literary skill from less &quot;deep&quot; books. I would definitely recommend reading this book first before reading other Faulkner novels. Once you finish this one, THEN try another book directly after this one - his style will be much easier to follow and understand.Overall, a wonderful book for discussion and reflection!"},{"Title":"Soldier's Pay","review":"This is one of Faulkner's best stories, but perhaps the least read. If you are a Faulkner fan, you have read it. If you are not a reader of Faulkner, this is a good one with which to start. It is the story of a World War I soldier coming home with debilitating terminal injuries which have essentially ended his life as he knows it. He is treated with human kindness by some, but others are horrified and uncomfortable, and even deny his humanity. As Hemingway wrote about \\"The Lost Generation,\\" Faulkner also brings the human cost of war into stark reality. It seems the most artistic among us are the most prescient."},{"Title":"Soldier's Pay","review":"In his first novel, SOLDIERS' PAY, Faulkner deals with the aftermath of World War I to illustrate the disillusionment that war inexorably brings to combtants and non-combatants alike. Whether is is the war to end all wars, the war to save humanity, the forgotten war, or the immoral war, no one who survives escapes unscathed. The narrative is more straightforward, with fewer digressions, than that of most of Faulker's later novels; but it is still difficult to follow at times. Using the shattered life of a wounded and dying war veteran as the vehicle, Faulkner weaves the lives of his characers into a revealing tapestry. In the arras he depicts fear, despair and denial; sexuality, frustration, and fulfillment; pettiness and compassion; love and hate--a range of emotions to which all mankind is subject. While many of his descriptions seem strained and burdensome, others present a blinding insight into the foibles and failings of our neighbors and of ourselves. Likewise, to the modern reader, some of the moral values and motivations of his characters may be arcane; yet, as a whole, the universal standards of human behavior still apply. All in all, I would say that if you are a fan of Faulkner, give this book a try. It hasn't the power of THE SOUND AND THE FURY or ABSALOM, ABSALOM! nor the delightful comedy of THE REIVERS, but it does give the reader a glimpse into the evolution of Faulkner's inimitable style."},{"Title":"Soldier's Pay","review":"This book was first published in 1925; it is the author's first novel. And it is my second reading of it; the first time was more than 40 years ago, under some unusual circumstances. As with numerous, but not all other second readings, I understood and appreciated it much more this time around. The received wisdom is that this is one of his lesser works, and might easily be given a miss. I would disagree. Although several of Faulkner works should be considered essential reads, \\"Soldier's Pay\\" is also essential, for several reasons. It is oh so rich in insights into the human condition. There is a wide-range of character types, many not very \\"sympathetic\\", whom I feel Faulkner developed quite well. And the plot development is quite sophisticated, for this being his first novel. Also there are the rich descriptions of the Georgia landscape, over a two month period, in the spring of 1919, at a time of fireflies, and the street lights going off at midnight, and yes, the smell of magnolia trees.Donald Mahon is the central character, coming home from World War I. He had been an aviator in the British Air Force, and badly wounded. An ugly scar across his face repels most who see him, including, once he arrives home, his fianc&eacute;e, the ever so flighty and shallow Cecily. Throughout the novel, he is the \\"object\\" of the other characters' attentions; he can say virtually nothing. An older soldier, Joe Gilligan, and a young war widow, Margaret Powers, help Mahon return home to Georgia, and his father, who is an Episcopalian minister. If one were to accuse Faulkner of being misogynist for his portrait of Cecily, the defense would offer an equally scathing portrait of Januarius Jones, a \\"scholar\\" of sorts, and one who clumsily fancies himself a lady's man. Lesser characters include Emmy, who is the housekeeper at the Mahon residents, with her own heartbreaking history, as well as aspirations, and George Farr, who has interests in, and is enticed by Cecily.In real life, Faulkner, greatly exaggerated his non-existent participation in World War I. So, in terms of characters, I felt Cecily's young brother, Robert, who was fascinated with \\"war stories\\", and wanting to see the Mahon's scar, might come closest to resembling Faulkner himself. But somehow, Faulkner got the war, its participants, and the reaction from the \\"home front\\" almost perfectly right. For example, when you really know that the death of a given soldier was anything but heroic, there is an absolute conspiracy of silence on that issue with the family. I also thought Faulkner perfectly captured the wild attractions (and repulsions) of the soldiers, and the women they would be leaving behind, and some would return to.Sexual innuendo, maneuvers, and the occasional fulfillment permeates the novel. There are the ugly jealousies of three women, and the collective jealousies of all American women. At the Grand Ball, one woman makes the remark, to a returning soldier: \\"Of course, we can't hope to compete with French women.\\" There are those Georgian spring nights when: \\"Dew on the grass, dew on small unpickable roses, making them sweeter, giving them an odour... Dew on the grass, the grass assumed a faint luminousness so if it had stolen light from day and the moisture of night were releasing it, giving it back to the world again... Tree-frogs...released the liquid flute-like monotony swelling in their throats, filling the night with the imminence of summer...Fire-flies had not yet come.\\"Some portions of the novel do seem improbable, which seemed to only match the improbability of my first reading of it. My copy is from Australia, where I purchased it on \\"R&R;\\" from Vietnam. When I returned to Vietnam, I only had a few days left, and I started reading it. And I finished it in Hawaii, on the way home from the war, since one of the crew-members had claimed he saw a rat on the plane, and it had to be delayed for fumigation for 24 hours. I always suspected the far more plausible sexual yearnings of the crew member, and an arranged \\"hot date.\\" Nonetheless, the themes helped prepare me for the many misconceptions, and general indifference of the home-town folks, as it seems to be, after every war. Faulkner's first novel, and not one to be overlooked. 5-stars."},{"Title":"Soldier's Pay","review":"Poetic and with an \\"ackward lyricism\\" (Weinstein, BECOMING FAULKNER). The novel more faithful to the naturalist-realist tradition Faulkner inherited--from Anderson, Dreiser, et al.--than other of his less accessible works. A fecundity of poetic description imbues the natural world with more life than some of the characters. \\"A tree...turning upward its ceaseless white-bellied leaves, was a swirling silver veil stood on end, a fountain arrested forever; carven water.\\""},{"Title":"Soldier's Pay","review":"Wow, two really good Faulkner books in a row (this and The Reivers) - I could get used to this! Here we find one of Faulkner's earliest books, one free of the pomposity and obscurity of his later works and also one that offers some genuinely noble and likable characters. Going into another WWI-themed novel, I admit was cringing a bit in fear that it would turn out to be another Fable, but not so. Here, he gives a compelling and touching look at the men and women whose lives were touched - and more often than not, wrecked - by the war, and he does it with accessible depth and passion."},{"Title":"Soldier's Pay","review":"This early novel by William Faulkner is interesting as an example of where his style and focus were as a very young writer, before both had settled into the predicatable Faulkner voice of his later and better known books. I enjoyed the book more when I first read it, I think, than I do now. But one thing has still not changed. I can remember having to read certain passages over and over and still not being sure what they were about. I still don't know. There are those who think this deliberate ambiguity is a plus but I prefer to be able to follow the plot of a book. I don't even mind working at it, as one must with a number of writers. But it is frustrating to come up against an impenetrable hedge of words that crowds out meaning, and this happens a lot with Faulkner.I have read almost all of Faulkner's books and enjoyed many, if not most, of them. Frequently moving and always interesting, these books deserve a special place on the bookshelf of American literature. But admit it, often Faulkner - even in his later books - uses words the same way that Jackson Pollock used paint. He sprays, splatters and dribbles them into a squiqqly mess that might, like a good Pollock, be pleasing or meaningful in an 'abstract expressionist' way, but simply doesn't make sense on a purely cognative and narrative level. There is less of that in Soldier's Pay than one gets later, but you can sure see it coming."},{"Title":"Soldier's Pay","review":"This book is a piece of history, but that's all it is. This was when Faulkner was hanging out in New Orleans with Sherwood Anderson, and Anderson told Faulkner if he wrote a book, he would get his publisher to print it. This and Mosquitoes are the result. They are both terrible, and it takes longer to read them than it took Faulkner to write them.The interesting thing here is Faulkner's obsession with the war hero and the tragedy of war cliche's. Remember also, that Faulkner was walking around in a pilot's uniform that he made himself after failing to join the air force. This book is very much the same thing, and for that point, it's interesting. It's amazing that such a dolt became one of the true voices of wisdom for the century. The upside of this book is that it lets you know you have plenty of time to develop. If you love the guy, you'll read this anyway, but you can save your time and skip Soldier's Pay and Mosquitoes. Save them for when you've already developed an obsession."},{"Title":"Always Look Back","review":"For John Balfoort, &quot;looking back&quot; over the first 25 years of his life revealed a boyhood in the Dutch East Indies,education in the Netherlands,treaining as a ship's engineer,and finally,service in the Allied Merchant Marine during WW II.Thru John's eyes,we witness the fall of colonialism after WW ,the losses suffered by ordinary people during that war and the disruption of lives which followed.Thanks Dad."},{"Title":"The Hay Diet Made Easy: A Practical Guide to Food Combining","review":"The Hay Diet Made Easy was very informative and easy to read and understand how to combine your foods.

While the basic diet is shown in a single chart on page 12, it is so basic that I wonder if readers will understand. The really helpful chart is on page 98, which again breaks down the basic diet.Chapters 2,3 and 4 are about using the diet to treat various ailments.

A great book and a great buy."},{"Title":"The Hay Diet Made Easy: A Practical Guide to Food Combining","review":"this is a good introductory book about food combining. i read it before reading kathryn marsden's one and that is my fave. if you want to dabble in combining this is great. some aspects are confusing and you just have to draw your own conclusions. and its british, so its fun to read the little idiomatic expressions. i walk around calling it an 'avocado pear' now and my husband thinks i'm crazy-in a good way."},{"Title":"The Hay Diet Made Easy: A Practical Guide to Food Combining","review":"The Hay Diet Made Easy is in english.... but not american.

It is great for those just starting to learn to Spanish, or for those at the intermediate-upper intermediate level who need a portable reference for going out and about in a Spanish-speaking environment.But if you want a dictionary for things beyond reading basic news articles or everyday chit chat, this will start coming up short. It has a good basic vocabulary, but to save room it usually gives only one or two translations (the most common), with very few secondary meanings or idiomatic usages. More complex vocabulary is usually absent. It will not do much good when reading literature or specialized articles.Still, it is a very good small resource to have around at the start of Spanish studies, or in your bag while on the street abroad where Spanish is spoken."},{"Title":"Webster's New World Pocket Spanish Dictionary","review":"Ok, this is not Amazon's fault as they posted the dimensions of this dictionary and I should have taken out my trusty ruler.I was hoping for a tiny dictionary.

In addition it has conjugation models for regular and irregular verbs--something missing from most small pocket dictionaries. This is a true pocket dictionary, small enough to fit in my shirt pocket (unlike some fat volumes marketed as \\"pocket\\" dictionaries). And this volume is beautifully made: good quality paper; print that is sharp and small but not too small; and it comes inside a rugged soft-plastic slip cover. The cover says \\"28,000 words and phrases--the everyday vocabulary you really need.\\" And that is true! You don't really need a big 70,000+ word dictionary for most purposes. And finding the word you need is much faster with a smaller dictionary, with fewer pages and fewer entries to search through. I wish I had had this dictionary during my trip to Peru; the pocket dictionary that I used then did not have the helpful usage examples and idioms and conjugations that this Webster's pocket dictionary has.

The rest of the pocket dictionaries out there (Oxford, Vox) where a bit too thick, while this dictionary is .7 inches thick, which is great for me.If you're interested in learning Spanish in a full way, don't just get this dictionary.

The electronic dictionaries were cumbersome and not very helpful. This Websters New World Pocket dictionary was the one I used almost exclusively after my first week of travel. This dictionary is truly pocket sized and has a durable plastic cover to survive rough handling. It has some definitions by region (e.g. frutilla = strawberry in Bolivia, Ecuador, Southern Cone; llanta = wheel rim, but tire in Americas), however Harrap's is much better in this regard. It has a useful center section of verb conjugations. Its coverage of foods is a little weak. I found about 90% of the words I searched.

Also, it has a nifty feature so you can easily look up all the verb forms of any word. I speak beginner spanish, but using this little book, I'm able to send emails that sound closer to intermediate (a real achievement for me!).

Also love the material that the cover is made of and actually purchased this particluar dictionary because it had a \\"turtleback\\" cover instead of paperback. It's kind of like a plastic that you could easily wipe off if it gets dirty. My only complaint is that when my instructor asked me to look up a word that should have given me \\"shower head\\" it said watering can, but everyother time I've looked up a word it has been accurate and 90% of the time it does have the word I'm looking for (my level is intermediate-three years in highschool and this is the second semester long college course I have taken, the first was 10 years ago.)"},{"Title":"ATL Developer's Guide","review":"All, I see developers are still reading this book.

Many people follow a macrobiotic diet as part of a life philosophy...\\" (Pg. 14)She argues, \\"Another result of the market for meat in affluent nations is the choice of those in power in poor countries to raise animals for export to the wealthy overseas. The losers are again the local people, who might have benefited from less profitable plant foods grown to feed the masses. Another downside to this practice is that in some developing nations, natural resources such as land and forest are depleted and are no longer suitable for growing the crops that could feed the masses.\\" (Pg. 30)She observes, \\"The United States Department of Agriculture is in the business of protecting and promoting agriculture. In large part, that means advocating for the meat and dairy industries. However, the Department of Agriculture is also charged with issuing dietary recommendations for the American public.

The dairy industry has historically been aggressive about providing nutrition education for the public.\\" (Pg. 66)She admits, \\"Our need for vitamin B12 is truly miniscule, but the tiny bit that we might have gotten in years past ... isn't available to most of us now. If you eat animal products regularly, you've got a source of vitamin B12. If you don't, then you need to find an alternate source.

It moves quickly and covers a lot of material, so I'm glad I tried some of the other courses first, to give me a basic introduction. This program does a good job of teaching conversational Danish while introducing the essential grammar rules a little at a time. The authors have a good sense for what is essential and what can wait. It teaches many colloquial expressions and rules of Danish sentence construction, so I am now able to create my own expressions and not just parrot back the ones I have memorized. The book has a few misspellings, as other reviewers have mentioned, such as &quot;hi&quot; in chapter one--it should be spelled &quot;hej&quot;--but I catch the occasional errors because I also work with a dictionary. (There are very few). The four cassette tapes are an absolute must. We English speakers will never get Danish pronunciation right unless we hear it spoken by a native. You will find that native speakers in Denmark slur their final t's more than the speakers on the tape (Danes make a a sound on some d's and t's that only Danes can make--it is NOT &quot;TH,&quot; as all the books claim). But the extra careful pronunciation on the tape is useful for learning the language. This is the only tape that enunciates carefully enough so that I can tell the difference between words like &quot;dansker&quot; and &quot;danskere.&quot; Another reviewer complained that the word lists are not grouped by topical subject type. That reviewer missed the fact that the words are grouped according to which spelling and conjugation patterns they follow. That is very useful for memorizing all those confounded endings on Danish nouns and adjectives. This program makes me hopeful that learning a foreign language is possible and easy with a little daily effort on my part. It is fun! I'm driving my family nuts, talking in Danish around the house. The other excellent beginning course that I am using is from Rosetta Stone--but it is a lot more money."},{"Title":"Hugo Language Course: Danish In Three Months (with Cassette)","review":"This book is a good road map to Danish...it does an excellent job of explaining grammar and sentence structure.What makes it frustrating for a beginner like me, however, is the way it approaches vocabulary. I've learned several other languages, and I like to learn new nouns in groups (&quot;animals&quot; &quot;professions&quot; &quot;rooms of the house&quot;)This book throws huge groups of unrelated words at you as it goes about explaining sentence structure, and I found them almost impossible to keep straight.I ended up keeping a separate notebook to organize them myself!Another important point: Pronunciation is the most difficult part of Danish, so I'd recommend buying this book WITH the cassettes. I bought the book alone, and now to get the cassettes - which are really necessary - I'm going to have to buy another copy of the book!"},{"Title":"Hugo Language Course: Danish In Three Months (with Cassette)","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to learning the Danish language. However, several misspellings are present within the text. As this can be a problem, I would recommend to EVERYONE to get the accompanying cassettes which compliment the course. This would also act as a good precautionary due to the fact that at the beginning, Danish is often very difficult to understand until your ear has been finely tuned to the sounds of the language. Aside from the mistakes, the text gives a simple and easily understandable approach to grammar and also to the vocabulary. The course uses such things as humor and fairy tales to teach the language, along with several model sentences and short dialogues to hear the language spoken at a normal rate of speech. Having the cassettes comes in handy the most with these dialogues. All in all, this is an excellent intro to the language, and one can deal fairly well with Danish after completing the course, as it expresses both formal and informal usage of the language."},{"Title":"Shay Pendray's Inventive Needlework","review":"For the serious needleworker, Shay Pendray's Inventive Needlework is a must-have book. Included are discussions on materials and on techniques, clearly drawn diagrams, and excellent color photographs. Examples of various techniques are drawn from both the author's own teaching pieces and from other pieces which have been exhibited at ANG National Seminars. I was particularly excited by the close-up photographs, which show stitching details clearly. (Many of the goldwork photographs were stitched on a black ground) Note that this book is about techniques, and is not a catalog of diagrams for specific stitches - there are many other reference books which fill that purpose.For needleworkers who are interested in advancing their skills, or who have wished for opportunities to examine advanced-level stitching in detail, the excellent photographs and elaborating text of this book offer a great deal of inspiration."},{"Title":"Shay Pendray's Inventive Needlework","review":"This is \\"the\\" book for the serious needleworker. It has the most comprehensive technique instructions of any book, ever, for gold work, painted canvas, and shading; it isn't a cutesy book of simple projects. The illustrations are excellent. The color photos are to die for: closeups of step-by-step work in progress and examples of finished work will enable you to strive for excellence in your own work. This is a teaching book with important information about threads, fabrics, frames, tools, framing up, tips ... the list goes on and on. I can't recommend this book any higher."},{"Title":"Shay Pendray's Inventive Needlework","review":"This book does offer insight into shading and goldwork techniques, but has few, if any, practice projects. The pictures are very lovely, but I was led to believe that there would be more patterns to practice on.If you are looking for a book with projects, minimally practice projects, this book is not the one to buy. No projects, thus no materials and fibers listed, no patterns.As a non professional needlework enthusiast, I need a head start on any project, because I don't have time to design a project from start to finish; books with projects offer the headstart I think most people in my position need: the hard work is done (which is why we pay for the book) and it is left to the individual needlework enthusiast to tweek it here and there to fit his or her decor/color favorites/personalization, etc. This book does not save any time or give any headstart to any project, which is the reason people pay money to the professional needleworker for their efforts. These efforts have not been made in this book.I would say a person looking for a book in goldwork or embroidery (shading, with silk or wool) would be much better off buying \\"A Victorian Floral Alphabet\\" \\"Redoutes Finest Flowers in Embroidery\\"; \\"The Art of Painting with a Needle\\"; these books make beautiful, individualized embroidery projects a possibility for those of us who don't have the time to start from scratch.This book is the equivalent to buying a pair of stamped pillow cases or a tablecloth to embroider, but when you get the pillowcases or tablecloth, they are blank, there is no design stamped on them, and the manufacturer includes instructions on how to embroider them."},{"Title":"Shay Pendray's Inventive Needlework","review":"For people who have watched her Needlearts show on PBS, Shay and her wonderful way with all forms of needlework needs no introduction.

Each section is lavishly illustrated with detailed explanations of techniques. I'm not very familiar with Goldwork, stil I found Shay's explanations clear enough so that I would feel confident tackling a beginner's project. There is a charming one, a dove, in the book.The section on painted canvas has a good overview of threads andtechniques. It includes detailed instructions on techniques whichoften aren't covered, stripped threads, using a laying tool, andproperly starting and ending threads. A wonderful part of thissection talks about choosing the right canvas. Further informationcovers how to change colors on a painted canvas as well as severaltechniques for optically mixing colors.Following this chapter about painted canvas is a chapter which goesinto depth discussing how three different painted canvas Christmasstockings were stitched. Several pages are devoted to each canvaswith a picture of the entire canvas as well as close-up pictures ofthe details. Even if these three Tapestry Tent designs aren't yourcup of tea, you will find many ideas for using on your own canvases.The section on shading covers two different techniques to createrealistic shading. While the techniques were developed for surfaceembroidery, a part of this section shows how they can be applied tocanvas. In fact, the shaded canvas piece is photographed on thecover of the book.The book ends with a gallery of designs.

It is considered foundational to much present-day teaching on Christian meditation and prayer. Although it was written for a monk in 14th-century England, this good translation by William Johnston makes it very accessible.Is this book for everybody? No, and the author starts right out by saying so. If you don't care about nurturing your relationship with God in deep prayer, if you have no experience of spending time in God's presence, and don't want to, then you should forget about this book! But, if you want to grow in prayer and experience God in your heart and yourself in God's heart, this is written especially for you.Review by Janet Knori, author of Awakening in God"},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing","review":"This is the best book I have ever read on the life of prayer, and it has transformed my prayer life. It was originally written as a series of letters to teach mystical prayer to one particular monk. This book tells us that our minds are too small to grasp God, and when we try to approach him intellectually, we freeze up, entering into a &quot;Cloud of Unknowing&quot; which our minds can not penetrate. Yet God is approachable - &quot;Because he may well be loved, but not thought. By love he can be caught and held, but by thinking never.&quot; We are told to long for God, to &quot;strike that thick cloud of unknowing with the sharp dart of longing love&quot;. This longing love calls us to give up everything else for the sake of God - &quot;a naked intention directed to God, and himself alone, is wholly sufficient&quot;."},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing","review":"It seems only proper to begin a review of this book with the warning given by the anonymous author in his/her prologue. My paraphrase of that warning goes something like this, &quot;In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in the bond of love I beg you not to read, copy, or look at this book unless you are ready. Furthermore I beg you not to copy it, loan it out, or give it to anyone else to read unless they, too, are ready for this depth of spiritual growth, lest they misunderstand the things written herein and fall into error.&quot;In this age of newly rediscovered Christian mysticism I agree with the author. This, almost zen-like book, can lead the novice into an empty, shallow, form of spirituality that misses the substance of our true faith. Do not be misled by sensational experiences. Most people experienced in meditation can put themselves into an &quot;alpha&quot; state almost at will. Do not forget the old saying, &quot;Study without prayer is flat; prayer without study leads to error.&quot;OK . . . NOW THAT I'VE GIVEN THE DISCLAIMER . . .There is another old saying that is relevant here.Let prayer lead to meditation.In meditation allow God to grace you with contemplation.Contemplation, in God's timing, leads to intuition.Intution ushers in oneness with God.This book reminds us that if we have the ability to conmprehend all there is to know about God, our God is too small. When I first read this book, I wasn't ready. It didn't make sense. However one day, years later, while I was praying, all the pieces came together and the book made sense.If you read this book years ago and didn't like it, read it again. If you are a novice in the contemplative life begin with works by Nouwen and Thomas Merton. Then, dig deeper into the writings of St. John of the Cross. Hold on to The Cloud of Unknowing until you are ready for it."},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing","review":"The theme of the writings:In short but instructive chapters, the mysterious Briton, who mastered the way of the mystics gave an admirable essay on Christian life and its development through contemplation. Prayer is in fact the core of Christian life, and the backbone of this marvelous work, where he explained conducting oneself with respect to examining and silencing the thoughts with humility. Love is the goal in which a faithful should abide through contemplation.His smaller work \\"the Book of Privy Counseling,\\" is a more mature but moving treatise on attaining salvation by enlightenment through kenosis (self denial). What is left should only be consciousness of the presence of the Lord!Apophatic tradition of the Orientals:Eastern monastics started the root to mysticism, practicing the Macarian arrow prayer (K. Ware, in Study of Spirituality p176), carried to Europe as \\"The Jesus Prayer,\\" through the Praktikos of Evagrius Ponticos.In chapter 38 of the Cloud, this holy English mystic speaks of a little prayer of one syllable Kyriya Elaison (Lord have mercy) that is powerful enough to pierce the heavens.Origen was the initiator of the Apophatic concept (commentary on song of Songs), carrying over from Philo, based on roots that go all the way to Asaph, Ps 73:21-24. But, the crystallization of the whole theology took final shape in the writings of a Syrian monk of early six century of pseudonym Dionysius the Areopagite (who was probably a student or companion of Severus of Antioch), taking to himself the name of St. Paul's Athenian disciple.The wave of Mystical Milieu:During 14th and 15th century Europe, a pilgrimage to the unknown God started by Eckhart and his fellow Dominicans Susa and Tauler based on spiritual poverty. In England, Rolle, Hilton, and Julian of Norwich took the same road. These were all disciples in the school of negation. The influence came through John Scotus who in the ninth century translated the corpus Dionysium into Latin, initiating a chain of commentaries from Aquinas, Bonaventure, and Gallus. The English Counselor translated Dionysius' Mystical Theology under the title\\" Hid Divinity\\"Rowan Williams, wrote in his book (The wound of knowledge); \\"The unknowing Englishman gave a brilliant little summary of the Dionysian ideas\\"Enjoying the way of UnknowingAfter reading the expert introduction by Wm. Johnston, helpful for a reader of some background on the subject, but the seal of the deal is reading his Privy Counselings.

Such a shame to have published this without care."},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing","review":"My understanding and practice of contemplative prayer is that it cannot be forced or willed; it is God's gift. In this state, one transcends words, thoughts and images to enter a state of oneness with God. It silences the noises of daily life, revealing an awareness of God's love which both humbles and exalts. To that end, this 14th century book on the nature of apophatic (mystical) prayer also provides modern audiences with an understanding of the foundation of \\"centering prayer\\".As a practitioner of lectio divinia and contemplative prayer, I found that over time, *The Cloud* enriched my relationship with God. However, it took some time; I wasn't ready when I first tried to read and absorb it.

The author continually contradicts himself and sometimes what he is trying to say is entirely inaccessible:he condemns &quot;the Devil's contemplatives&quot; who seem to view bodily sensations and the exhilaration of the senses as some sign of God's approval in their discipline. And then, a chapter later, he will approve of certain sensate phenomena as true signs of God. This could be merely the confusion of a novice, but I would say the anonymous author approaches agnosticism with his view as the actual CONTACT we can have with God: &quot;the cloud of unknowing&quot; prevents it entirely, although we must &quot;beat upon it&quot; until, eh, something happens. This is the path of spiritual darkness as a way to the Divine, which is indeed fascinating. The author's recognition of the tenuous and error prone nature of human consciousness could be seen as a precusor to the existentialist view of human life.

The book seeks to offer to novices advice about how to achieve a more focused relationship with God in prayer. The monk's first premise is that our active lives intrude upon our ability to focus when we pray: he prescribes that we enter a \\"cloud of forgetting\\" about our everyday, active lives when we enter prayer. His second piece of advice is that we do not know what the future will bring and should not become worried, fearful or stress about the \\"cloud of unknowing.\\" He urges us to focus only upon the present moment and to build a bridge through prayer worthy of oneself and one's deity. He recommends that with suitable mindfulness we can raise the depth of prayerful experience and advises that we are responsible for every minute of our life. I have practiced what the monk preaches and it works -- my time of prayer is more attuned and brings more energy to these spiritual moments. The net effect is that epiphanies or awakenings come more frequently now in which the essential meaning of life is revealed. I find that I am happier through the application of the monk's good advice as spiritual well-being leads to healthier relationships. The health of the interior impacts beneficially one's physical sense of well being. If you seek a higher level of spirituality, then this book can help take you there. \\"The Book Privy Counseling\\" in this edition builds upon his themes and advice aimed at more experienced practitioners seeking higher levels of spiritiuality.

Not for all folks, however is immensely gripping."},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing","review":"This is a work of immense value, and while I am sure that it is not a book for most people, and it is written only for honestly committed Christians, I do know that for some this book will mark a milestone in their journey of life, faith and love.Long ago, when I was 15, I began to study the Zen approach to (un)reality. A friend, who himself was knowledgeable about such things, gave me his copy of The Cloud of Unknowing and said that it would change my life if I read it seriously and prayerfully, and that I shouldn't think that Christianity lacked what I was seeking in Zen. My friend was something of a mystic, at least to my adolescent mind, and I was impressed by anything he said. Growing up Lutheran, and being a teenager, I was not at all exposed to monasticism or the concept of contemplation. I wasn't sure what reading a book prayerfully even meant, and I had no clue what contemplation meant, but I was trying to live a life of love and prayer, and I was filled with an intense longing for I did not know what, so I gave it a shot. In short, it did change my life. For the first time I began to think of God as not something to be thought about and defined, but to be loved. Later I would learn this to be what the Greek Fathers call apophaticism, or what the Latin Fathers call the via negativa; that sometimes we can say more about something by saying what it is not, to say negative things to a positive effect. Lutherans place a high value on defining everything, which certainly has its positives. But it doesn't often leave room for mystery, which means it doesn't correspond to reality. I know LCMS pastors and seminary grads will rightfully disagree with my description as too simplistic, but on the lay level this holds water. So the change and challenge was liberating. I began to understand that it isn't all about understanding, if that makes sense. For the first time I began to see that God is God, and not my idea of God. And that to draw near to God is not something that I can will to happen as if God is at my beck and call. This all calls to mind Evagrius of Pontus' line, \\"God cannot be grasped by the mind. If he could be grasped, he would not be God.\\"This releasing of our images of God has a great deal to do with the current trends in pop-spirituality and even Eastern/Asian spirituality of the traditional sort, methods and goals that want to disassociate adherents from thoughts and definitions and creeds. But Christianity is not a theology or philosophy of nihilism or reductionism or monism. All is not one and persons actually do exist and love really does unite us to God, Who made matter because matter is a good thing. God reveals Himself in Jesus Christ (John 1:18). He is the Word, the Logos Who reveals the Father (John 10:30). One of the messages of The Cloud, then, is that God reveals God's self to us, and He is not understood through our mental efforts and images. And God even reveals Himself to us as unknowable. This is the opposite of the intellect's inability to conceive of God as God is. That sort of natural apophaticism is a logical deduction as found in Neo-Platonism, Hinduism or Buddhism, but not a divine revelation of the apophaticism of Person (just as our calling God \`Father' by our adoption in Christ is a revealed Name, and not a logical leap, as in Galatians 4:6 and Romans 8:1,5).This is all to say that The Cloud reminds us that our heart's deepest longing is God, and it is put there by God, and that we don't have to and cannot intellectualize our way to God, but to rather allow God's life, by loving our neighbor and bathing in the Word and sacrament (in Greek the word would be translated as \\"mysteries\\"), to draw us into God. Of course this does not force God's hand, but it is what God has Himself said to do, in the same way that a clean mirror reflects the light. The mirror doesn't own the light, but it most a mirror when it is reflecting light. Illumination is neither random nor accidental. There is a condition that is more apt to be illumined than others.Other works of interest, which reinforce the author's point (which actually is about not doing more reading!) would include:Revelations of Divine Love,Dark Night of the Soul (Dover Thrift Editions),The Imitation of Christ (Dover Thrift Editions),The Practice of the Presence of God The Best Rule of Holy Life,New Seeds of Contemplation,Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander,The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality,Dionysius the Areopagite: On the Divine Names and the Mystical Theology,The Mystical Theology of the Eastern ChurchandEncountering the Depths: Prayer, Solitude, and Contemplation.What is a little ironic is that this book has so much to do with apophaticism and just now, as I finish this review, my young son asked me, \\"Why do you want to understand so much about God?\\" Hmmm..."},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing","review":"The book was received in excellent condition and expediently.The contents were good, but some of it was a little bit too deep for me.Somebody with a great amount of Christian knowledge could probably handle the book a little easier."},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing","review":"Many turn to other texts for guidance on contemplative practices in the East. Others turn to this text because they want a substitute for Eastern practices. This is different from Vipassana meditation or any Eastern form of meditation, and perhaps more powerful. The book itself has many secrets, and is both a subtle and clear introduction to attaining (partial) union with God. More than in other books on contemplative work, it is made clear that through contemplation truly amazing things can be done (things that in the modern world would be called &#34;magical&#34;). You will hear this message in some of the saints, but you won't hear this message in too many other places.

The standard documentation is pretty good, and Lutz's Programming Python book (own that too) is also superb. I bought this new book sight unseen because I knew what to expect...and this book did not disappoint! I feel like buying this book for friends just to introduce them to the language. It's current, it's well written, and it is a wonderfully crafted introduction to Python. It's useful even to people who know the language already...it works well for me as a reference for those various things I forget here and there (to supplement Lutz's Python Pocket Reference -- another must have).

I am really impressed by the power of Python and by the exceptional quality of the reference guides and this book in particular. As a former Professor of Computer Science at Harvard, I wish that all computer science books were written with this amount of clarity and humour. Everybody in my research lab is now learning Python from this book and my chief programmer is even more enthusiastic about it than I am. It has enabled him to write some image processing software in a few weeks that would have required months in other languages (and he knew nothing about Python two months ago).

Perhaps that reader was holding a grudge about &quot;Programming Python&quot; -- admittedly, not the best book in the world. :-) While the first edition of &quot;Learning Perl&quot; was nicely written, the second edition was an absolute mess.

Please note that the reviews on this 2nd Edition are mixed with the reviews of the poorer 1st Edition. But they should be considered separate books -- because this new one is such a remarkable improvement over the first.This is the BEST BOOK SO FAR FOR UNDERSTANDING PYTHON BASICS AT A DETAILED LEVEL. It is a delight to read, the explanations are very clear, and the material is dense: every paragraph has something technical and interesting to say, at a fair level of depth. For me, this book is the only Python book that sets off a little lightbulb in my head on WHY things work the way they do in Python.Also, this is the best work by Mark Lutz so far. He appears to be the major writer in this book (discussing the Python Core), while David Ascher worked on \\"the Outer Layers.\\" Ascher also was co-writer on the Python Cookbook.The 1st Edition was superficial in my mind. I had originally ranked the 1st Edition as a 3 out of 5. But this 2nd Edition reflects the authors' training and writing of other books and materials and clearly is a 5 or better.This 2nd Edition takes you through version 2.2 of Python and discusses many aspects of version 2.3. This was very important for me as I wanted to know about the many changes in 2.0 and 2.2.I recommend this book most highly.

It provides Java with generic capabilities similar to C++ templates and Ada generics, something I have been missing from the language itself [sure you can use intefaces, but they're not the same]. I knew very little about Python before reading this book, however I had read in Dr Dobbs about the potential of JPython for automating Java testing and decided to give the language a once over. I am very glad I did.A number of my fellow developers have started using JPython now and I know that it has been saving me a lot of time. Excellent reading, especially if your main interest is in picking up enough [realistic] knowledge about Python to use JPython effectively in simplifying many commonly tedious Java tasks [such as testing]."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"For all programming newbies that want to start with a real programming language, Python must their choice and &quot;Learning Python&quot; their first book on programming.It provides a complete, concise introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Python and cleary explains how you can do almost everything with simple scripts!It does not include any kind of reference at all - however this is not a drawback because it's not directly in the book's purpose - after all the standard Python distribution includes all the references you need.So far, the languages mostly tought in schools are LOGO and stone-age distributions of BASIC (such as GWBASIC or QBASIC...). Even if you overlook the fact that they are way outdated, the most oblivious student can understand that even when these languages were created, they were all useless.It's high time for this situation to change - as Python can be the first language a young person can learn and probably the only one it will ever need!"},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"Though this book has often been recommended as an excellent source for beginning programmers, I didn't get much from it after the first chapter.I found the writing excessively dry, the index substandard, the and the language very very opaque. The organization is also pretty haphazard. Quite often concepts are introduced briefly and off-handedly, but then dropped as &quot;not quite ready&quot; to be discussed, with no further reference given.Most of the examples used to demonstrate basics are either trivial or very abstract. A set of well-thought-out, useful examples are missing from this book, and if they had been included, would have gone a long way towards showing a beginner how to use this language.Generally, not up to O'Reilly standards."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"A really great book, but more so if you already have some knowledge of programming. If you are new to Python and can make a few things happen, but would like to have the basics discussed for you in a book to enjoy in bed, this may suit you just fine.

Of course, I can't really tell that part, just my impression. If you can do something as trivial as VB, I guess you'll be fine.Other than that, this is an EXCELLENT book. I read though it in about 3 days, and it was very effective. For example, the day after I finished, I programmed a Python script for work that used COM, despite never having programmed anything in Windows before let alone used COM).

If you already know &quot;Programming Python&quot;, the previous book of Mark Lutz on Python, and are concerned about the possibility that this book was just another messy collection of concepts and tips, relax: this is a completely different object. &quot;learning Python&quot; is a well-designed, well-written and concise book. It gives you all you need to write system administration utilities, Internet-related programs and other small applications. (Should you need a book on TKinter, the standard GUI module of Python, buy &quot;Python and TKinter programming&quot;, by John Grayson, Manning publisher).Consider to buy this book because:- It is clear and well written. No struggles to understand the basic concepts and having the first programs running.- It is well-designed and well-structured. You can find the info you need in a snap.- You get a real understanding of Python, not only a description of its nice features.- It is concise. In a day or two you will be coding in Python.- It is a very good guide to keep on your desk. It is the missing part of the online documentation.- In describes how to perform the most common task with Python. You will not have to reinvent any wheel.- It describes a few important modules of Python: JPython, TKinter and COM. You can get a feeling of what you can do with Python (but, to go further, you will have to read the online documentation and perform a few experiments by yourself).Python is a very smart language and deserved a better book than &quot;Programming Python&quot;. This is that book."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"I bought this book because I originally bought the author's Programming Python book mistakenly thinking it would be similar to the Programming Perl book (which is a stellar book, where as the Python equivalent is more like a cookbook). It was immediately obvious that I was NOT going to learn Python from that book so I bought this one. Again, a mistake. It may be a fair overview of Python but it did not give me the tools I needed to be productive right away; and if it did have the information that I was looking for it was not obvious. Simple things like writing to standard error, file tests, executing separate programs and saving the output, parsing text, even how to force a script to bloody exit... basically common things people expect from a scripting language right away were given either little, weak, or *NO* obvious treatment. The appendix is no help either, I could not find most of these simple operations listed there under the usual key words.

Python is a great language and you will enjoy programming in it. This is probably the source of excitement in reviews on this page. Because the book, unfortunately, has a number of flaws.The tradition of O'Reilly Perl books has been not only to teach you the syntax of Perl, but also to introduce programming techniques and ideas how to make best use of the language features. This Python book scores zero on these points. It focuses on syntax exclusively and this makes it unsuitable for an absolute beginner. The examples are unimaginative. The authors show you how to write correct code for using &quot;dictionaries&quot;, but not how to USE &quot;dictionaries&quot;. A Perl book author would throw in a program that uses a &quot;hash&quot; to search for duplicate data entries (as they did).Besides, the flow of the book is uneven. Functions and classes are discussed at length, but built-in data types and exceptions are looked at only briefly. All this is really unfortunate because there are not very many Python books on the market and it is a very good language.Overall, I think, this book is best for experienced programmers who already know their CS, have to get up to speed with Python very quickly, have $30 to waste, and really love to own O'Reilly books. The rest might be better off by printing out the Python tutorial."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"Mark Lutz and David Ascher deliver precisely the needed information to meet the objective stated on the cover of the O'Reilly text, &quot;Learning Python&quot; (Help for Programmers).A succinct, yet thorough treatment of the Python programming language is presented in some 350-plus written pages that are well organized and facilitate the development of Python programs in a &quot;Read and Code as You Go&quot; fashion.After spot reading the Chapters on &quot;Getting Started&quot;, &quot;Types AndOperators&quot;, &quot;Basic Statements&quot;, &quot;Functions&quot;, &quot;Modules&quot; and &quot;Common Tasks In Python&quot;, I was coding and running my first text file I/O Python programs within the first half of a day. The authors concise presentation of the concepts definitely facilitated the &quot;learning curve&quot;, which so often is an obstacle when learning a new programming language. The material was also indexed very well with clear index descriptions to easily determine what the topic was and where to find it.What I found to be the strongest point of the book were the &quot;Gotchas&quot; sections, in which the authors discussed topics such as Python Language Constructs, Program Class Usage and Coding Practices to be aware of. I found the &quot;Common Coding Gotchas&quot; section at the end of Chapter 3 of great benefit in coding and debugging my first self-authored Python programs (As I learned, Python is definitely a language where you want to indent consistently, avoid the mixing of blank spaces with tabs and not forget the use of colons to denote decision logic). The application of these concepts alone were a great asset in reducing the &quot;Learning Curve&quot; for me.The program examples provided reinforced the clear, concise concepts presented by the authors. The programs that I studied were suited to running in both a Linux environment (using Linux Python Version 1.5.2 for SuSE(tm) Linux 7.0 and Red Hat(tm) Linux 6.1) and MS Windows(tm) NT/98 (using Active State's Active Python(tm) Version 2.1).Exercises presented at the end of the chapter were effective at reinforcing the programming concepts presented. With some supplemental tutorial material for non-programmers, this book could be used as an educational text for a Python programming class, particularly one geared for programmers with scripting language experience.The authors did a good job of covering a number of topics important to application programmers. Object-oriented Constructs, Manipulation of String Objects, Operating System Module Use, GUI Programming Component Frameworks and Applications such as Tkinter and JPython are discussed to provide the reader a good exposure to the extent of the Python language implementation and its strenght as a robust, object-oriented scripting language.The book is definitely an invaluable resource for providing the essential material necessary to construct your first Python programs, especially if you've had prior programming experience with other scripting languages, such as REXX, Javascript or Perl.Definitely one of the best O'Reilly publications I've read to date. Kudos to Mr. Lutz and Mr. Ascher for their contribution to making the experience of &quot;Learning Python&quot; a fun and productive pursuit. Five Stars!"},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"I first purchased this book nearly two years ago, but I never got past the first few chapters.I just picked this book up again, with the benefit of two years' experience programming in PHP and a little but of Java, and I realize why working through this book seemed like such slow going the first time around.On the one hand, &quot;Learning Python&quot; is written with a lot of hand-holding for readers who may not have much programming experience at all with any other languages; the basic concepts of variables, statements, functions, data types and the like are all clearly explained, which is a good thing for someone just starting out.On the other hand, there are also quite a few tips and bits of information about memory efficiency, or how certain elements of Python relate to their C underpinnings; things that a rank newbie probably won't understand, and probably doesn't need to know when they're just trying to learn the basics. These esoteric points are probably quite helpful/interesting for programmers coming from low level languages like C, but those programmers will be frustrated by the slow page of the sections covering basic mechanics.So you've got a book that moves at a beginners' pace that's full of asides targeted towards experienced programmers; beginners will be confused and overwhelmed, and experienced coders will just get frustrated.For what it's worth, I have the first edition of this book; I'm not sure how the second edition compares."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"Having previously read several O'reilly Perl books I thought that learning Python from this text would be straight forward. Unfortunately this book has none of the helpful examples that the Perl books have and also dissappointing was the reluctance to write the code as you might using a text editor. Instead the authors seem to prefer to write code as it would be run from the interpreter on the commandline. This made it really hard to write any Python using the text editor. All in all a complete waste of money."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"You can learn Python from this book. However, this is not one of those books which capture your attention, like, say, Kernighan's books, or even &quot;Learning Perl&quot;. You have to fight against this book. This is mainly for the following reasons, IMHO:1. Jargon is used too frequently. If you are not a hacker (in the good, original sense) you have to work against the language (not Python, English!), too. I had to reach for the &quot;Hacker's Dictionary&quot;, now and then. For instance, the word &quot;hook&quot; is used in a technical sense without being explained.2. Object is never defined. In the &quot;official&quot; tutorial, which is much shorter, a clear and concise definition is given. This is badly needed, for &quot;object&quot;, in the python world, is different that inC++, or smalltalk, world, where it is a class instance. In python it is the triple (type, address, value).3. Phrases like &quot;Classes are mostly just namespace&quot; don't help the beginner who wants to know what distinguishes a concept from another. These abstractions are premature.4. The too frequent use of Monthy Python terms like &quot;spam&quot; and&quot;eggs&quot; is ridiculous, and makes the examples seem totally useless pieces of programming.So, I think this book is perfect for one who is a personal programmer and wants to learn quickly what Python is all about. He will probably like the book for the very reasons I complain against it. The subtitle is correct: Help for Programmers.Still, you'll learn the language. But with a fight!"},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"If your goal is to get up to speed quickly with Python this might not be the book for you. Especially if you already have programming experience then you are better off downloading the documentation from python.org. That documentation covers the same material but much more succinctly. For example, in the reference manual at python.org, the \\"while\\" statement is described in less than a dozen lines of text, while in \\"Learning Python\\" it drags on across multiple pages.The advantage of \\"Learning Python\\" is this: (1) the author shares the style and idioms that experienced Python programmers would use; and (2) the author offers insight into the history and design of the language. This allows the reader to \\"taste\\" the language as well as learn it.

Now, as I need to help some other people learn Python I'm looking back through the book and NOW it looks great - covers the key details, describes them well, warns you about pitfalls, etc. In short, everything I'd like to present as a trainer (and I know it grew out of the authors' experiences as trainers).

This is the ONLY book I would recommend for learning Python provided you already had some programming experience with another language."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"Not recommended for newbie programmers since the authors assume a knowledgeable reader. But for experienced programmers who have used other languages, the excercises at the end of each chapter serve to inculcate unique Python characteristics in your mind quickly. I like the abstract approach better than the wordy 'learn-by-doing-examples' approach which I believe just creates fluff in a book. It would be accurate to call this book a 'Learn Python in X days' and at the end of those X days you can truly say that you do know Python (the language) very well. But this is a testament to Python's simplicity &amp; lack of idiosyncracies as well."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"This is THE book if you want to learn Python. I already program in the language, but found the book a great refresher that also showed me several new things. It will give beginners more than enough information to start programming and the knowledge to understand any other Python documentation."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"This book is a great quick introduction to Python. And don't be fooled, this book DOES deal with some subtly advanced topics. Great job, I recommend it everywhere!"},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"A little difficult to understand from a web perspective shifting to programming, but not too bad. However, I have to wonder why O'Reilly chose a rat as opposing to a python? I thought the snake would make more sense. Oh, well, back to the book. This would probably be more useful to someone who has more programming experience and not just some scripting and HTML which is what I had when I started the book."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"Awesome python resource. Picking up the intrinsic details of python is made a SNAP with this book. *Finally* a book comes along that has relevant orginization from cover to cover. The book takes you through it all with so much ease you leave the chapters nodding your head. To add more frosting on the cake, the sections on applications, including the Tkinter GUI and CGI, are what make this book lie next to my 'bibles' on the shelf. They teach you why to do it, how to do it, and what you can do with it!This book is especially perfect for all of us perl/c fellows who want to stop putting off learning this exciting language. (you know who you are!) The book understands the position we are in! (and includes some helpful correlations c in many places)in a word: WOW."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"Learning Python is a good introduction, but if you are serious about learning and using python, you will need this book AND the larger Programming Python. An example of Learning Python's shortcomings is __str__ is not in the index for Learning Python (__str__ is the default way to print). It IS in the index for Programming Python. I have found using both books to have all the information I need.Learning Python also has a pretty good introduction to object oriented programming and how it is implemented in Python. I haven't done a lot of OO programming and the description in Learning Python was readable and understandable.Another thing I liked about Learning Pytyhon is that the end of each chapter had interactive examples you could run to reinforce the ideas presented in the chapter.Clearly however, Learning Python is much better for beginners. And I must say, the index's of both book are pretty good."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"Excellent for beginning programmers. Very clear, light reading. Nice sense of humor. Even for advanced programmers (who are new to python), I recommend &quot;Learning Python &quot; instead of &quot;Programming Python&quot; because it is better organized and takes up less shelf space."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"As someone who works with and trains people in many different programming languages and techniques, it is necessary for me to always keep an eye on new things. I had heard a great deal about the Python language and most comments were positive. Therefore, I read this book for the purpose of simply learning what the language had to offer rather than to actually learn how to program in it. I found the material to be well presented and informative, but certainly not for anyone with a limited programming background.There are many references to what is done in C, which helped me, as I have an extensive background in the language. However, if you do not know C, then they are somewhat helpful filler at best, confusing chaff at the worst. The examples are in almost all cases very short, which makes them toys of limited use, but that is how learning a programming language is best done. It is possible to use this book to learn how to program in Python if you already know how to program in an object-oriented language. There are exercises at the end of each chapter and solutions to all are in an appendix. The exercises are at the level that they should be for beginners and the topics are standard learning material.Since my goal was to simply learn something about the Python language, I extracted the desired information when I read it. If my goal would have been to learn how to program in Python, I could have also done that if I had read slower and did the exercises. It is a language with many interesting features and since it is also a scripting language, Python could be used for many things. No doubt I will have to learn it in the future and this book is where I will start."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"I would have preferred to give this book 3.5 start, but oh well. I think my opinion of this book would have been better if I was a member of its target audience. I picked it up ( ) about six months ago, and I only had the option of either it or Programming Python (also by Mark Lutz).After getting through the first couple chapters I became a little restless because of the rate at which it progress's through the language. It falls into the same category as most other introductory level books, it presents both the language and programming as if never before seen by the reader.I ended up getting getting Beazley's Python Reference, which I was quite happy with. But the one thing I do have to give Mr. Lutz credit for are the &quot;Gotchas&quot; section at the end of every chapter. I think Python is a terrific language, and it incredibly fun to program with, but there are a few things about it that are a little... mmm... odd, i guess. Lutz points them out whereas in a reference type manual they would be presented and a feature of the language rather than something that might trip you up.There's also something to be said about his later chapters that try and present some of your options, as far as what you can do now that you know Python. A couple of other books I've read, i come away feeling.... &quot;ok.... so what?&quot; You spend all that time learning syntax and data structures, but there's no sampling of their application to anything.If you've programmed very little (or not at all) get this book, Python is an excellent language to start out on. You don't have to mess around with variable types and pointers which can be a little frustrating in the beginning. Lutz's book is the best to start out with."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"I own several books on Python, but found this one the best as an introduction. Interspaced throughout the chapters are many examples, which are indeed simple, possibly trivial (as other reviewers have complained), but in fact are purposely so in order to illustrate succinctly the specific points in the surrounding text. As a further and important learning tool are the excellent &quot;test questions&quot; at the end of each chapter. Solving these (answers in the back of the book) will train the fingers to code python and the mind to think python.Overall the writing style is VERY accessible. After you learn python, you may prefer a very terse reference manual like Python in a Nutshell, but you learn the language best if you start with &quot;Learning Python&quot;.Luckily, the second edition will soon be here -- the reader is advised to wait for that."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"I think this book would be quite overwhelming to the compelete newbie to programming. It does assume that you have a programming background already, e.g. You will definitely not learn the principles of OO from this book, though you will learn the python constructs to support OO.But if you have the background, I think this book serves its purpose well, I was writing non trivial programs within a few days of picking up this book. It gives a good feel of what can be acheived with Python and a good base before you tackle the more hardcore Programming Python."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"I find this a great book for experienced programmers who have used other languages to get to know Python's unique features very well. The exercises at the end of each chapter with their abstract approach inculcate the concepts very well in the reader's mind as opposed to a 'learn by implementing &quot;supposedly practical&quot; stuff' approach which i believe only contributes to fluff in a book. This book could be aptly named Learn Python in X days where at the end of X days you would truly have a useful and in-depth knowledge of the language but this is also a testament to Python's simplicity and lack of idiosyncracies."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"Having read this book a couple of years ago, I still browse through it frequently. David presents a gentle intro for the Python beginner but I appreciate the quick summaries of modules and methods.

Buy this book for a good intro to the language and keep it around for future reference."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"An excellent tutorial to get started in doing Python work. The sections are nicely ordered along with plenty of handy reference tables and explanations.

After getting this book, I was getting Real Work done in Python in a matter of hours."},{"Title":"Learning Python (Help for Programmers)","review":"As a infrequent programmer, I've read about and studied other languages (C, Java) but found them too complex to master. The simplicity and power of Python, combined with this clear well-written book, made it possible to learn and start using Python right away. I read and worked through the (platform agnostic) examples on my Windows PC and quickly grasped the information being presented. This book makes occasional comparisons with other programming languages so that experienced programmers don't trip over the knowledge they already have. These comparisons don't get in the way of a first time learner. Well done!!!"},{"Title":"Anybody's Gold : The Story of California's Mining Towns","review":"This remarkable book is now available in paperback and should be read by anyone interested in the West, the Gold Rush, California history and those who just like a good yarn.If you like first-hand accounts and a gissipy view of well and lesser-known icons of the fields this is for you.

I found the first half of the book to be a bit drawn out and uninteresting, but it improves in the second half. The author gets in a wide variety of things- jealousy, revenge, unrequited love, murder, family ties, mystery. She does a good job of getting inside of people's heads. If you have spare time this book is OK to read, but if you pass it by you aren't missing all that much."},{"Title":"K","review":"I agree that this novel is a bit slow moving at first..but like any good book the suspense builds.

That is not to say I agree with all aspects of his chronology but I do not feel personally threatened by his theories either, unlike some who have careers and such at stake.I think it also needs to be made clear that Fomenko himself stresses repeatedly (when applicable) that not only is he theorizing, but also continually points out where more investigations may lead to productive results and sometimes even suggests ways to do it! Imagine that!Unlike others who view themselves as gatekeepers of \\"correct\\" information Fomenko seems to prefer that we all became key-masters who can read the writing on the wall (or ceiling, or manuscript, etc) for ourselves.Definitely worth the read IMO."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"It should hardly surprise us that historians demonstrate such bloodthirst when it comes to the brilliant Russian mathematician - if enough people begin to question the foundations of world history and find all the tremendous inconsistencies buried there, the historical profession shall cease to exist and make way for the new natural science. If Fomenko isn't eaten alive come that bright day, that is."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"This book will blow your mind, if you let it. Many people will find this books conclusions impossible to swallow for the direct assault on so many commonly but uncritically held beliefs about historical and even personal family timelines.But regardless of whether one follows the reasoning to its conclusion or one stops short of accepting such revisions to the now commonly held version of history dictated largely by the West, there is no doubt the book raises many, many important questions about what we know as the history of civilization. Despite its academic tone and the fact that it is a translation from Russian most will find this book to be extraordinarily readable.Many who experience difficulty accepting the conclusions of the book will still find it a quite enjoyable read if taken as a work of historical or speculative fiction, a book of possible worlds, alternate past histories.Surely by now, most would recognize the semantic curvature of mens' minds, the subtle distortions in stories retold for generations, the relatively late development of standardized and consistent dating among the world, could lead to there being many things taken as \\"fact\\" in our history, that are yet uncritically founded or in need of further research. But surprisingly, many folks still resist a critical review, revamping, or making a fresh attempt to construct a new model through years of meticulous research as Fomenko has evidently done.People who are unused to critically questioning and challenging the accepted \\"Truths\\" of history, religion, and even science, will probably have a hard time with this book. People who are set in their ways, or believe very strongly in any dogmatically asserted beliefs or paradigms, or with cultural or moral imperatives that prevent them from revising their models of the world or making new models, will likely be unable to read very much of this book.Also, some replies to the other reviews.There are a lot of two or three line negative reviews, claiming the book is too fantastic, too \\"christian\\", makes unsupported claims, or \\"lacks methodology.\\"Really the only way the reviewers could arrive at these conclusions is if they did not read the book, or perhaps they only skimmed it, or perhaps they have heard about its admittedly fantastic claims and feel a need to defend their personal world view by writing a negative review.Please - don't take their OR my word for it, read the book on google books. Fomenko and the publisher have kindly consented to present the book in its entirety on Google Books. I read the book first there, for free, and now I'm buying the first of what will likely be several copies, the remainder of which I will gift to select friends who already question the dominant paradigms and world-views handed to us by dated or uncritical high school text books and much modern media. Indeed, as another reviewer mentioned, Leary and RAW would be well proud of Fomenko.Perhaps the reviewers who find this book \\"christian\\" do so because of the subject matter. Europe since the time of the Roman Empire has used the Birth of Christ as the point of origin or date zero on the timeline now in use in the western world, A.D. or Anno Domini, latin for \\"the year of our Lord.\\" Yet even this system was not standardized for nearly two thousand, or if Fomenko is to be believed, many hundreds of years. So much of Fomenko's work involves verifying, questioning and reconciling many of the earlier dates of the Christian era. But despite the centrality of the birth of Jesus to the European system of chronology, the book pretty much leaves alone the issue of Christ's actual existence. Its pretty hard to take away any sort of religious bias either for, or against, from this book.Also there is a reviewer who has stated that a lot of the positive reviews seem to be written by Russians, or at least bear signs of being written by non-native speakers of English. To this I can only say, Fomenko is indeed a Russian, so is it really that surprising that his widest recognition and audience thus far is with fellow Russians?Seriously, buy this book here on Amazon, or go find the book on Google Books, and read it. This is the kind of critical questioning of the underpinnings of civilization that could be the start of an entirely new version of the history of civilization, and could also be the beginning of an evolution in analytic methods of mathematics being applied to the analysis of historical events."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"There is no doubt that history as most know it is a sham, & institution's version of History both University & Church is fradulent & inaccurate. Everything was established with an agenda, The real \\"Dark Ages\\" are now when we have access to incredible amounts of information past authorities & more important 'common folk' didn't have but our institutions & educators are slow to evolve because of what has ignorantly & arrogantly been taught for too long. This is on many subjects not just Chronology.For anyone to question \\"Why would a Mathematician have anything credible to say of History?\\" The answer is from Dr. Fomenko's preface in the book: \\"It would be worthwhile to remind the reader that in the XVI-XVII century Chronology was considered to be a subdivision of Mathematics.\\" These volumes could possibly be some of the most important works to date & should be read by everyone with an interest in History, especially professors & educators who have a duty to the public. I have read both books & must say that 'Chronology 1' has some very eye opening & revolutionary information. Even if these volumes are part true the implications are profound & opens the doors to further investigations & questions which must be done. I speak several different lanquages & must say the logic Dr. Fomenko uses with \\"inflection\\" of words & words being read from left to right in one region & right to left in another then written backwards, the removal of vowels & get down to basics of words, or different cities & locations having the same name etc. is correct. Vowel usage has always been optional & varied, actually complicating linquistics & study. The first thing one has to understand is that words never had a fixed spelling in history like we do now, the spelling of words was mutable & regional, as well as names & titles of people were vast, varied & changed, NOTHING WAS FIXED or understood linear.

So does this book and therefore I like it very much. It is the first history book - I got hold of - that compares events that happened in different areas at the same time. History teaching, as done in school, always focuses on one area and one never gets the great picture. That is why I remember so little of it, history was a random compilation of bits and shreds and the occasional number of a year in between. To me - I am by no means qualified in the eyes of academics, of course - much of what is said in the books seems possible and makes sense. And additionally I learned a lot about official chronology, astronomy etc. on the fly. But even if one decides to refuse Fomenko's new chronology lock, stock and barrel, it still is a treasure chest of hints where to look for further information.

I don't have the math background to judge his statistical methods critically, but obviously he has discovered many cases where the same events/people/dynasties appear more than once in established chronology (just as Immanuel Velikovsky did years ago concerning ancient Egypt). I have to question, however, his assumption that the most recent event/person/dynasty is the \\"true\\" one, and that all the others are phantom reflections thereof. He offers no evidence or even argument for that, just seems to assume it as axiomatic.Unlike one reviewer, I did not find the translation from Russian very fluent. It is as best dry and stilted, at worst ungrammatical in places. But I think I usually got the gist of his thesis.Most frustrating of all, for me, was that, after shooting down the established chronology, he does not (in this volume) offer his own version or alternative chronology.

For example, did he consider all the work of exegesis, of bible scholars, or of archaeology that somehow form the basis of the current time-line of events described in the Scriptures? It is obvious that anyone claiming such things must perform the additional work of re-shifting all the historical events that are chronologically related to the current time-line. For example, if Jesus has been crucified in 1186 as the author claims, then Ignatius -Bishop of Antioquia - that was killed in the Coliseum under the rule of the roman emperor Trajan would have been killed at the year 1293, which then implies that the roman empire is situated on the medieval times. Then, all the history from the fall of the roman empire till our days would have to be compressed considerably.Also, take the chronological order of the popes from Bento XVI to Peter, a total of 266 popes. The author would have to conform the currently accepted 2000 years of pope service within roughly 1000 years.Having said that, inevitably it comes to my mind Alan Sokal's hoax and I only hope the author is not doing the same, but to be sure of that one has to read it first. Even though I am quite convinced that his two claims in the \\"product description\\" of the book makes no sense, I would risk to give this book 3 stars based on faith that, whatever the argument he employs, it may be original, after all, Fomenko is an accomplished differential geometer and topologist."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"The author is gone realy too far, but made, a few quite valid points.

Having been interested in history for a number of decades, but having got tired of always the same topics in only a new jacket, Fomenko's book opened wide avenues to study new topics to test the author's thesis. To give just some examples: medieval history of the Middle East (Islamic history), the history of the Mongols, Tamerelane, the Ottoman empire; the origins of Christianity and Islam, the development of cartography, language, technology, astronomy.Everybody who has an interest in history should read this book, if only to start out on his own voyage of discovery and to try to come up with his own solutions!"},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"Fomenko is highly entertaining, if not on targetIt should also be possible, as Fomenko states, to study regnal year lengths on a statistical basis. Historically, a long reign is generally followed by a succession battle and a number of shorter reigns. In the Old Testament period, kings were consciously reviving the memory of earlier kings, even to the point of trying to match their reign lengths. This was not always possible, but it probably did serve to reinforce natural and recognizable patterns (with statistical significance). He compares Germanic kings with the Biblical kings of Judah. Upon closer examination, the correlation is strained, but it is not surprising that the general pattern is quite similar. The dynamics of kinship did not really change that much over the centuries. I wish I had the time to better evaluate the Fomenko theories. They are highly entertaining, if not on target."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"Anatoly Fomenko has written a very intriguing book, full of pictures, charts, and computer 'proof' of his thesis: backwards of AD900 we don't really know what happened or when. Between AD900 and AD1600 there is more certainty, but there is still a lot of fuzzy ground, and things don't get reliable until we get past the 1600's where the printing press made it very difficult for the perpetrators of this timeline manipulation to change anything that had been committed to print. The Dark Ages did not happen. Books were burned for a reason. One organization has doubled the actual length of its existence by expanding the real chronology. Read why.I had always wondered why Christ died about AD33 and yet men waited until the 11th century to form the Knights Templar, the Cathars, etc and go after the Holy Land by force. Why the 1000 year gap? Turns out there wasn't more than a 10-12 year gap and he proves it using astronomy. This also implies that the planet is not as old as we have been told, and current Christian and other creationist scientists are already championing that idea without being aware of Fomenko's book. The two groups, creationist scientists and the Russian mathematical analysts corroborate each other. Fascinating.Of course, all this flies in the face of what we have been told traditionally is the 'proper' chronology of western civilization, and most readers will experience 'cognitive dissonance' in reading this book. It means that our history going backwards from AD1600 becomes progressively more incorrect and unreliable until it cannot be trusted at all... in the space of 700-800 years.Naturally, the curious, open-minded reader will want to know WHO did this, WHY, and did any of the events we think of as really ancient ever happen?Dr. Fomenko is a respected scientist/mathematician at Moscow State University who has already answered these questions to the satisfaction of his initially skeptical colleagues. Most of them are now believers, a few still refuse to believe (the usual diehards), and of course the western press has ignored Fomenko's work -- for obvious reasons when you read the book. The ones who perpetrated this chronology ruse have a lot to answer for. They are still with us. That's why this book is a well-kept secret.I gave the book a 4-star rating because I was unable to check out some of his claims; those I checked were as he said. But if even 1/3 of his claims are true, this punches a big hole in what we think is our history, the meaning of western civilization, our educational process (for repeating the ruse as gospel), and the trustworthiness of the organization that perpetrated this ruse, well-intentioned or not.This book relates to current research into a Young Earth paradigm, to John Keel's discoveries about our planet, and Fr Malachi Martin's insights (in his now out-of-print books). We are indeed sheep who are manipulated and kept ignorant -- for a reason. While knowing what these men have to say may be the \\"booby prize\\" (as in: 'what can you do with this knowledge?'), it will provide interesting reading.

A quote:\\"Everything keeps on changing, we see constant evolution - from Columbus to the landing on the Moon, from crossbows to nuclear bombs. Forwards and upwards. However, the traditional ancient history tells us of periods when humanity apparently remained dormant for centuries - \\"ancient\\" Egypt, the mediaeval \\"Dark Ages\\" - whole epochs of utter stasis in human thinking\\".Neither crackpot nor conspiracy. Albeit Academician Fomenko is Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, his book is quite readable for a layman. Five stars for an overdue revolution in chronology!PS: Prof.Dr.Fomenko adds insult to injury : vol.2 of his \\"History..\\", isbn 2913621066 is actually out at last.He refers to the Middle Ages as the \\"Antiquity\\" and proves mutual superimposition of the Second and the Third Roman Empire, both of which become identified as the respective kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Furthermore, he asserts that the famous reform of the Occidental Church in the XI century by \\"Pope Gregory Hildebrand\\" was the reflection of the XII century reforms of Byzantine emperor Andronicus who in his turn identifies with Jesus Christ. The Trojan war counted by Homer happened only as late as of the XIII century A.D. and the great poet actually lived in XIV century A.D."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"Neophobes are only right to scream in indignation; this is nothing short of a revolutionary work, and will yet become the foundation of a completely revised history of humankind.

It is fiction and -like we can read and judge for ourselves- no science. It indeed is \\"make belief\\" only. I \\"discovered\\" Fomenko while studying the \\"old\\" history of Al Andaluz, Spain. Having found too many contradictions in available data, having seen too many forgeries as to pretend the importance of christianity for its decline, I ventured out to find Fomenko, who convinced me that we know little if anything for sure of the epoch before the XI-century. However, the integration of the Arabic-Islamic cultural history into the heavily distorted Western fails... There are some attempts to fit \\"the budding new religion\\" (Islam) into Fomenko's scheme, but they are too weak to be taken seriously and too often focussing on Turkey as the region where things started to influence the West, which is untrue at all.Islam certainly was no \\"new religion\\" in the X-century. That the highly cultivated Al Andaluz ruler Mohammed-I could have been \\"mirrored\\" down in time into some myth about the \\"illiterate\\" founder of Islam itself is highly speculative. Nevertheless, Fomenko convinces me about the processes that were involved in forging a christian history. Intriguing and controversial as his books are, I recommend them as to rethink our current position in time and space and simply verify what was claimed.

Using a combination of deductive methods (lunar coefficient and lunar eclipse date settling), inductive methods (textual interdependency, cultural nominalism via geographic and linguistic verificationism), and abductive methods (thread by thread weave of chronologies and narratives originally interpreted as unrelated but demonstrated to be interdependent, redundant, misdated, and/or mis-located), Anatoly Fomenko illustrates what every historian should be held accountable for: the minimal baseline of what a reasonable person is to believe about the past given limited evidence, ambiguous and/or dubious sources, ad hoc gloss hyperbole and blind reckoning of second-hand commentators.Further, his approach feigns little and simply invites the reader to calmly and quietly attend to the fact and counterfactual comparisons themselves in order to reconsider what it is that they may have taken for granted when handed history.The first four volumes (currently the only available in the US) are the most penetrating look into history which a thinker/reader of historical texts has attempted. To put it bluntly: this is the best literary investment of your life. The degree of infuriation in the reaction of many who have not taken the time to calmly consider its contents, is only a sign of the pace of the modern day - and has little or naught to do with the actual contents.Fomenko claims to have an angle about how to hold history-making accountable before your own highest private standards for verificationism.

As the sign of recognition of the special role of the English historians who consider themselves the true scribes of World History, the cover of the present book portrays Tintoretto's Jesus Christ crucified on the Big Ben.The Russian historians brand it as pseudoscience because Dr Fomenko asserts that there was no such thing as the Tartar and Mongol invasion followed by over two centuries of slavery, providing a formidable body of documental evidence to prove his assertion. The so-called \`Tartars and Mongols' were the actual ancestors of the modern Russians, living in a trilingual state and aspiring Global Empire with Arabic and Turkic spoken as freely as Russian.The ancient proto-Russian state was governed by a double structure of civil and military authorities and the hordes were actually professional armies with a tradition of lifelong conscription (the recruitment being the so-called \`blood tax'). Their \`invasions' were punitive operations against the regions that attempted tax evasion.Fomenko proves for a fact that official Russian history is a blatant forgery concocted by a host of German scholars brought to Russia by the usurper dynasty of the Romanovs. Their ascension to the throne was the result of conspiracy, so they charged these German historians-imports with the noble mission of making Romanov's reign look legitimate.Dr Fomenko et al prove Ivan the Terrible to be a collation of four rulers, no less. These rulers represented the two rival dynasties - the legitimate Godounovs and the ambitious Romanov upstarts.The European historians fume not only because Fomenko blows consensual Russian history to smithereens, successfully removing a crucial cornerstone from underneath the otherwise impeccable edifice of World History but for asserting that all medieval European Kings and Princes were but breakaway vice-regents and vassals of the Global Empire who badly needed glorious and very \`ancient' past in order to legitimize their new independence from the Empire.Dr Fomenko adds insult to injury, wiping out one by one: the Ancient Rome: the foundation of Rome in Italy is dated to the 14th century A. D., the Ancient Greece and its numerous poleis, which he identifies as the mediaeval crusader settlements on the territory of Greece, the Ancient Egypt: the pyramids of Giza become dated to the 11th to 14th century A. D. and identified as the royal cemetery of the Global Empire, no less.The civilization of the \`ancient'' Egypt is irrefutably dated to the 11th to 15th century A. D. following the breakthrough in decoding of the ancient Egyptian horoscopes cut in stone and painted on the temple walls.Arabic historians may find some consolation in the crucial historical role of the Ottoman Empire as a part of the Global empire in the 15th - 17th century. The trouble is that this Empire was initially a proto-Christian state, with Hagia Sophia identifiable as Temple of Solomon, but built in 1550-1557 A.D. by Sultan Suleiman according to Fomenko and Islam with all its key figures is datable to 15th 16th century A. D.!The Chinese historians are also an unhappy lot because Fomenko wipes out the Ancient History of China outright. No such history. Period. The compilation of the so-called Ancient Chinese History is reliably datable to the 17th 18th century only. It is perfectly recognizable as the Ancient European history, reworked and transcribed in hieroglyphs as yet another historical transplantation.The Divinity excommunicates Dr Fomenko because the history of religions according to Fomenko looks as follows: the pre-Christian period (before the 11th century and Jesus Christ ), Bacchic Christianity (11th to 12th century, before and after Jesus Christ), Jesus Christ Christianity (12th to 14th century) and its subsequent mutations (15th to 17th cy) into Orthodox Christianity, the Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam, Buddhism, and so on..; and The Old Testament written after the New Testament in xiv-xvi cy A.D., if you please!

It is written by an outsider to the world of historical scholarship: Fomenko is a non-historian (a renowned mathematician) and an non-Westerner (from Russia.)Fomenko's theory says, basically, that everything we are told about history pre-1600 is BS. Ancient history is, according to Fomenko, based on evidence quote-unquote \\"discovered\\" since the 15th century and arranged into a spurious standard timeline in the 18th century. (In some cases, the evidence was discovered much more recently: some Eastern religious texts were only uncovered in the 20th century.) Fomenko collates this evidence to argue that all those ancient chronicles are different versions of events which really happened roughly between 1000 AD and 1400 AD. The key event in Fomenko's timeline is the life of Christ (who was born in 1053 AD rather than 6BC, Fomenko believes.) After a relatively short-lived Eurasian empire disintegrated, each nation made up their own version of the empire's history, and generally each new version of the story was set farther back into the past than the previous one. (The newest version is the Hindu Krishna myth which is set about 10,000 years before the present day.)This is an appealing theory, since it eliminates the various \\"dark ages\\" which blemish the conventional chronology. On the other hand, this is an appalling theory, since it creates one big dark age extending from the beginning of time till 900 AD or so.The book is translated from the Russian. There is no index, and the bibliography is rather annoyingly arranged in the original Russian alphabetical order (so for example, B's and V's are mixed together.) But the translation is extremely readable, more readable than most historical works originally written in English.This is the first book in a projected 7-volume set.The online bookstore entries for this volume rather amusingly show easily history gets mixed up. The translator is someone named Michael Jagger who is almost certainly not the singer Mick Jagger (whose full name is Michael Phillip Jagger.) However, some online bookstores do list Mick Jagger as a coauthor. Amazon.com says the translator is someone named Mike Jagupov. This is hard enough to keep straight while the singer is still alive, and a few decades from now, I am sure that many sources will say that the legendary Rolling Stones frontman translated this book into English.(I have no idea if Mick Jagger speaks Russian or not. Although he is an educated man--- an alumnus of the University of London--- one would assume that he doesn't. Certainly, in all the millions of words which have been written about him, no one has commented on his knowledge of the Russian language. And, if he actually was the person who translated this controversial text into English, the book's publishers would presumably be aggressively advertising that fact.)"},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"You learned history when you were a young lad from someone who learned it from someone who..... but who started it all?What's wrong with asking this question?

I wouldn't say I'm totally sold on all the crazy ideas Mr. fomenko puts out but they certainly are more plausable than you might think. He does a thorough job of showing how early \\"historians\\" were really working for the pope. Most were monks with limited resources, personal and religious agendas, and a willingness to fudge it whenever they didn't know (or like) the truth. You'll be amazed at how meticulously he presents his evidence that the dark ages were so dark because they never happened. Your head will probably start to ache when you get to the section where he analyzes historical timelines statistically (at least mine did). However, the parallels truly are startling.The first four chapters alone are worth the price of the book.

It was tough going (non-idiomatic translations, lots of repetition, often written like a mathematical proof). I became instantly disoriented, thought about it long and hard for years, reviewed the volumes on Amazon, and spent bunches of hours in a local university library following odd leads and trying to see if there was any possibility that any of Fomenko's theorizing could be grounded in reality.I read Robert Newton's condemnation of Ptolemy; Anthony Grafton's dissertation on Scaliger (and other writings about Medieval forgeries); F.F. Arbuthnott's peculiar disquisition (ca. 1900) on English history and the probability that the further back from Henry VIII you go the less you know (and why the Irish monks who \\"saved civilization\\" may have had other agendas); about Isaac Newton's chronological explorations; about the inconsistencies in radio-carbon dating; about an odd series of parallel \\"dark ages\\" in circum-Mediterranean cultures ca. 1200-to-800 BCE that can best be explained by positing that the period in question didn't exist; and a volume about the relatively late evolution of the concept of \\"absolute time.\\" Taken together with the astronomical and mathematical data presented by Fomenko that, to this educated non-scientist, seems eminently plausible, I have pretty much concluded that there is a lot of room for irregularity in the received chronology of history.This first (of seven!) volumes of Fomenko's work explains in far better English and more detail what his earlier papers explicated. It should be approached critically, will be derided and dismissed everywhere (and is not aided by Fomenko citing Velikovsky as one of the early \\"fellow travellers\\" along this path), but lays out a fascinating possibility that will take more than one reading and a lot of deep thought to assimilate and form any judgment about.But it gives new lives to the common aphorism \\"History is written by the winners,\\" Henry Ford's offhand dictum \\"History is more or less bunk,\\" and Napoleon's prescient (?) \\"History is fable of fiction agreed upon.\\"I suddenly don't look at anything that happened before the Renaissance with anything like the certitude I once did."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"Looking through this book reminded me of the movie \\"A Beautiful Mind\\". A brilliant mathematician constructs a fantasy world complete in every detail. The only problem is that it doesn't exist, and that he's as mad as a hatter.Just two examples of the many \\"possibilities\\" suggested by our schizoid author:(1) The Biblical flood and the Trojan War were the same event because Noah was Aeneas, who fled Troy to found Rome. (Noah and Aeneas had names that sound alike. Thus it is proven.)(2) Nine kings fled the fall of the Tower of Babel and seven kings founded Rome. Therefore, Rome was founded by the kings who fled the fall of the Tower of Babel. (In the author's words, the Biblical figure of nine is \\"close enough\\" to the Roman figure of seven.)Most of this book's positive reviewers don't support their opinions with science, but those who do cite what they think are the author's strongest arguments: (A) carbon dating isn't accurate; and (B) the Bronze Age can't be thousands of years old because tin, a bronze ingredient, wasn't isolated until much later.(A) Carbon dating is indeed accurate, and gets more accurate all of the time. But even if it wasn't, taking many disparate samples from a single site, and averaging the results, gives an extremely reliable estimate of the site's age. For example, the pyramids of Egypt contain many different forms of carbon, all of which have been tested in the last decade - and not, I might add, by Fomenko's bete noir, the Jesuits. All of these different samples, averaged out, give a date many thousands of years old, far outside even the \\"1,500-year error range\\" claimed by Fomenko and his defenders.(B) The first bronze artifacts were made by ancient metallurgists who inadvertently mixed increasingly scarce copper ores with those of antimony, zinc and other metals found naturally with copper. Tin is one of those metals, so pure tin was never required for the ancient production of bronze. The same can be said for brass, which is made with a metal - zinc - never isolated in ancient times.Fomenko's nutty conspiracy theory has feet of clay."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"The only conspiracies here have to do with the number of insanely positive reviews. There are twenty(!) here where the reviewer only has one review to their name and it's a five-star review for this book. And more coming. Funny that. It's almost like somebody has set up multiple accounts and is trying to up the rating. Parallelism indeed. Two with no other reviews may be coincidence. But twenty? Twenty! Good job buddy. Very subtle. You might as well have just copied and pasted your review.So, I'm not a mathematician and I don't know enough to contradict Fomenko's math, but I don't have to. By that reasoning Fomenko wouldn't be able to contradict me because I'm a Classical History Major and this is (ostensibly) a History book. I can tell you exactly why his math must be wrong and why he should be ashamed to call himself a scientist. Scientists must make the models match the data, not the other way round. When the facts don't fit your theory then the problem isn't with the facts, it's with your theory. And boy do the facts not fit this 'theory.' It would be hard to think of a way in which history could make less sense than it does through his model.First, a brief explanation for anyone not familiar with this book. Anatoly Fomenko is a Doctor of Mathematics at Moscow State University. Despite a lack of support from his colleagues (who consider his ideas on history nuts) he published a series of seven books in which he rewrote the history of the world based on his ideas of Statistics. As explained on the back cover, \\"Jesus Christ was born in 1053 A.D. and crucified in 1086 A.D. The Old Testament refers to mediaeval events. Apocalypse was written after 1486 A.D.\\" I'll go more into why he thinks that makes sense later. The Roman Empire and all of Classical civilization was invented by Jesuit monks who wrote in a remarkably short time all of Western literature and invented an entire civilization which people then immediately forgot never existed. All Classical buildings are simply medieval ones that have been misdated.And now a brief history of... well history, as seen through Fomenko-vision: History begins when Andronicos Comnenos dies and becomes Jesus. History records him as an unsuccessful Greek emperor with no real successes who was beaten to death by the mob and not a poor prophet from Nazareth who was crucified but hey, what do they know. It's not like the crucifixion was an important part of the story or anything. Immediately all of Europe decides that they're Christian and march against the Muslims. It may sound confusing why they'd blame the Muslims for what was an internal coup but they were probably just confused because Mohammed wasn't born yet. At some point they changed their minds and decided to skip the first three crusades and jump straight onto the Fourth (except that they didn't. It was actually the same as the First. Obviously. Please try and keep up). They then sacked Constantinople which was also Rome which was Troy which was Jerusalem. At some point they get confused and occupied the Holy Land as well and then forget all about Constantinople and let it fall back to the Greeks since Jerusalem was now Constantinople which was Troy which was Rome. People back then had very short memories often forgetting why they did something before they even did it. Very sad. During the First Crusade the Greeks decide to avenge the kidnapping of their queen by... also sacking Constantinople. After sacking their own city they quietly vanish for a few years, probably in embarrassment. Some time later Erasmus wrote the New Testament confusing generations of scholars who wondered what they had been copying out for all that time. Having now written a New Testament it was decided that they needed an Old one. I'm sure the reasons for the reversed order are as obvious to everyone else as they are to Fomenko. Some time in the 15th Century David rose up, except that he was Turkish and ruled in Constantinople. Despite the many wars with the Turks Europe had never warred with the Turks and accepted all of these events as holy writ. After all, the Turks were really Russian in funny hats and the Russians ruled the world. The Byzantines were secretly ruling in England. After the death of Solomon (Suleimon) the Jews split off from Christianity because they were tired of not being persecuted because of something they didn't do and decided that being hunted by the Inquisition was more fun. In the confusion the Catholics and Orthodox Christians split apart as well because everyone else was doing it and it seemed a good idea at the time. They were to regret this later when the Catholics sacked their city but that had already happened so it was fine.It turns out that Russia has dominated the world since the earliest recorded history (what nationality was Fomenko again?). The Mongols were not from Mongolia because the people there are nothing but worthless servants of the Russian Empire (it's ok. Fomenko assures us that the Mongols never knew of Genghis Khan until some pesky monks told them that they used to rule the world). Russia was actually the major Empire that the Romans were based off of and have existed since the dawn of civilization. Silly Georgians thinking they are anything but the personal property of Russia! Ha ha. They also controlled America, Europe and North Africa by 1300 so I guess that we should all submit to the Russian yoke as is our hereditary duty. Occasionally a czar would allow the governors of Europe (kings hah!) to wage war on each other if they pleased him. Presumably the English sucked up to him better than France which is why they did so well in the Hundred Years War but then lost his favor again which resulted in the French winning. Joan of Arc was probably the czar's sister or something. The czar could summon anyone to his court and they had to obey which is why Moscow is renowned the world over as being filled with better artwork and architecture than such dives as Paris and Rome (which isn't the REAL Rome after all). After Russia fell in the 1600s (through internal troubles. No one could EVER conquer Russians) the rest of the world immediately conspired to hide that they ever existed lest they should try to rule over them again. Thus they erased this empire from the history books and replaced it with such lies as Rome and the Holy Roman Empire (couldn't they even pick a new name? Obvious!). Thus the treacherous Romanovs rose to power (did I mention that he first published this under the Soviets?) and they too decided to forget there had ever been a Russian Empire of such a scale. Many \\"Roman\\" documents are simply Russian ones with a few name changes. I'm not sure where Latin came from but the Russians probably invented it to confuse future generations of schoolkids. They had after all had it engraved all over the southern part of their empire on specific styles of buildings which they immediately buried and built medieval cities on top of to confuse archaeologists. It never showed up in Russia itself. Perhaps they punished the provinces by making them write everything in Latin. Oh those cruel Russians. After the late 18th Century things begin to return to what is normally called history.As you can see it is far less confusing than the 'conventional' timeline. You might think I'm making this up but that is what you get when you put all his history together. Minus the sarcasm perhaps.It seems best to explain why he is wrong about the facts he lists before going into the facts that he's ignoring. First off comes a good example of how he combines Classical and Medieval history together. To him the First Crusade and the Trojan War are the same event. One of Fomenko's favorite tools, a chart, might demonstrate why this is.Simularities:First Crusade . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..| Trojan WarA war . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..| A warSieges involved . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| All about a siegeEast vs. West . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| East vs. WestUm, took place on the planet earth . . . . . . . . . . .| Probably the same if it happened at all...The differences:First Crusade . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..| Trojan WarLead by Bohemund, Raymond, Geoffrey, etc. . . . ..| Led by Agamemnon, Achilles, Odysseus, etc. (No matching names)Fought for religious reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| Fought for political/personal reasonsTraveled by land . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..| Traveled by seaLeaders fought on horseback . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| Leaders arrived on chariots, fought on footWeapons: lances, spears, iron swords, chain mail ..| Weapons: spears, bronze swords, bronze greavesAll participants monotheist . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..| All participants polytheistCame from all over Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| Came from GreeceLasted three years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| Lasted ten yearsWent to recover city . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..| Went to destroy city and recover wifeSet up a kingdom on enemy land . . . . . . . . . . . . .| Immediately returned homeLeaders became kings and lords of new land . . . . ..| Leaders offend the gods and are punishedArchaeology confirms presence in Israel . . . . . . . ..| Archaeology confirms presence in GreeceMentioned the Trojan War in documents . . . . . . . .| Was the Trojan War...As you can clearly see there is a great deal there fully justifying the combination of these two events as the same war. How could it not be?...Clearly this idea is nuts and fails on any comparative level. There are almost no similarities between the two events except that they were both famous. To combine the two would require removing all facts except for the sieges. If you discard all that then there is nothing left.His arguments for this are all mathematical and rely on eclipse records and other such information as well as a statistical analysis so vague that multiple mentions of sieges mean they must be the same one. By that reasoning my name is Stuart therefore I must be a king since previous Stuarts were kings of England. QED. Can I have my crown please? A key fact of mathematics is that garbage in=garbage out. He may have done all his calculations correctly, but if he feeds in the wrong data or assumptions then he'll still get worthless data back. Even I know better than to do what he does. By selecting only those sections of chronology which match his conclusions and ignoring those that don't he violates a key rule of statistics. My Statistics I teacher taught me that. It's as basic as you can get. For example he selects a segment of Byzantine Emperors and matches them with a series of Old Testament kings. The two dynasties match up very well indeed so he concludes that they must be identical. Sounds convincing. But why did he choose to compare that stretch of kings with that stretch of Emperors? Because they matched of course! Statistically speaking if you try hard enough you will be able to find matches in the lengths of reigns for various civilizations if you have no other qualifying factors. If he'd chosen Roman Emperors to match with the Byzantine ones he probably wouldn't have found his correlation. Or Frankish ones. Or English ones. Or even earlier Old Testament ones. In fact, even with that it doesn't fit because he has to combine Justinian and Justin I to make it match Manasseh. He had an even worse time fudging the list of ancient Spartan kings to make them match the despots of Mistra (p. 304). He actually inverted the Spartan king list, which makes total sense because people trying to hide what they did would naturally just invert the chronology instead of, y'know, making the dates up? It's not like there are any other similarities between the names he's matching. I should also point out that unlike the despots the Spartans had two kings at a time. He's actually skipped over the most famous king Leonidas (of SPARTANS! fame) because he didn't fit as well as the other one.He also thinks he's being clever by comparing the ancient kings of Rome with a list of Emperors from the later Empire (p.305). This shows his fudging at its worst although people who've never studied it might not know it. It looks reasonable at first glance. Kings of Ancient Rome: Romulus Quirin, Numa Pompilius, Tuttus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquin the Ancient, Servius Tullius, Tarquin the Proud lasted in total 244 years. In the later Empire Constantine I, Basileos the Great/Asa, Valentinian I, Honorius, Aecius, Valentinian III, Recimer, Odoacer, Theodorich, The Goths last 252 years. The first thing that any Classicist will note is that those are not the correct English transliterations of their names. The translator didn't even try to get them right. Basileos the Great is St. Basil despite never being called \\"Basileos\\" or \\"the Great\\" in English. I have no idea who Asa is supposed to be. The problems with this: First the ancient kings are fake. Probably made up by Roman mythologists. Certainly they didn't know the exact dates when they ruled. So he's comparing a fictitious dynasty with a factual one. He'd undoubtedly say they're both fictitious but this chart was supposed to prove that and it doesn't prove anything of the sort. Moving on to the real Emperors. St. Basil wasn't an emperor, he was a bishop and theologian. He has no place on this chart. Fomenko has skipped over Constantius, Constantine II, Constans, Julian, Jovian, Valentinian I, Valens, Gratian, Thodosius, and Valentinian II unless one of them is Asa. So one king ruling 43 years has become 11, including Valentinian I who shows up next on the list after he's been dead for about 5 years. Actually he only shows up on the chart after he dies. Perhaps he's supposed to be Valentinian II? He is followed by Honorius who actually shows up at the right time for once but they do neglect to mention that the Empire has been split in two by this point and thus there are two Emperors whom he can chose from to fit his chart. Apparently that's not enough because the next man is... well I don't know who he is to be honest. He's certainly not an emperor. If Aecius is in fact Aetius then he was magister utriusque militiae (sort of head general) under Valentinian III who shows up next. Even someone who's never read anything about the Later Empire should note that Fomenko jumped straight from Valentinian I to III. Aetius in fact lasted a further ten years dying in 454 a few months before Valentinian III who had him killed. He only lists him as dying in 444 because that way he matches with Ancus Marcius giving him a 'reign' of 21 years. Following Valentinian III comes what is definitely supposed to be Ricimir. He was also not an Emperor but a general and had been killed several years before the Empire fell. There were nine Emperors during this time (in the West) and then the Western Empire fell. Not one to let facts get in the way Fomenko continues with the first of the Gothic kings. Finally he's met another section that matches with his list. Odoacer and Theodoric last 50 years to Servius Tullius' 44 (according to Fomenko). At this point he just gives up and the next king is \\"the Goths.\\" Huh. Well that makes perfect sense. As you can see, despite his neat graph he's made up most of his dates and skipped over dozens of Emperors. The only ones that actually fit are Constantine I (the first one on the list) and Odoacer/Theodorich who were kinda two different people and not the same one like Servius Tullius. Even the bits that do match don't do so exactly and to have any significance it would have to match exactly. It's like saying that 2+2=5 because 2 is approximately 3. The average length of rule for a king is 20 years (look it up) which means that even a few years difference is a major deal statistically. That by the way is a valid and important use of statistics in historical studies.I leave the astronomical stuff to people more qualified than I to judge it. Clearly if his statistical analysis is this far out of whack his astronomical analysis isn't gonna be much better. I shall stick to the limited attempts he makes to explain away all non-mathematical historical evidence.The biggest problem that he finds is that all documents from Antiquity are copies. None of them are older than the 11th Century and thus must be fake. There are no original documents from the classical era (except that there are. See below). While this may sound convincing to anyone who has no contact with the subject it is inevitable if you think about it. The Romans were destroyed 1500 years ago. Parchment simply doesn't survive that long under ordinary circumstances. Any documents surviving must be copies. This doesn't mean that there is no way to test their authenticity. Comparisons of documents is one key way. If two documents are identical, or nearly so, then they may be presumed to come from the same source. Since it is possible to date documents in this way it can be worked out what the oldest one is and which document was copied from which source. What you find is that most of the more numerous sources are copies of multiple originals from unconnected authors on opposite sides of Europe. Which means that those documents must be based on even earlier sources. So already we're past Fomenko's 11th Century limit. Many forgeries can thus be detected by when they first appear on record, what sources they used to write it, and stylistic and factual variations. Fomenko is a mathematician. Every fact must be either true or false. Therefore this system must seem maddening and imprecise to him. And it is imprecise, at least on mathematical terms. That doesn't make it inaccurate.Since dates do show up in documents from time to time he needs to come up with a way to discredit every writer who's ever lived and I have to admit he has a highly original way of doing so. Without offering any proof he asserts that Roman Numerals didn't have a number for ten. X stood for ten in Roman numerals but Fomenko believes that they only had I's and V's since X stood for Christ (p. 337). X was the first letter of Christos (Ch was spelt X) in Greek and therefore they put it in there to indicate that it was the 1st Century of the Christian era. It makes me wonder how a 12 (XII) year old boy can really be a 200 year old man but I'm sure that the mathematician knows what he's doing. 1 is also fictitious. As a Russian who doesn't use the Latin alphabet 1, I, J, and l look much the same to Fomenko and as he does with all things that look the same he combines them. 1 was not actually a number but the letter I (or J) and stood for Jesus (Iesus in Latin). So the year 1300 is actually the year 300 after Jesus. As proof of this he includes a picture of a tombstone in Britain with what he claims is a J for a 1. Sure it is Dr. Fomenko. Sure it is. Don't worry. We believe you. As you might imagine he gives no evidence apart from the similarity (to a Russian) of appearance and treats his idle and unsupported speculation with the same weight as solid fact. He also views anno domini (AD) as being misunderstood (p. 351). While anyone who's taken even a little Latin will tell you that it means 'in the year of the lord' Fomenko has an alternate translation. Since 'dom' means house in Russian he assumes that it means the same thing in Latin. Thus anno domini would mean 'in the year of the (ruling) house' and would refer to the current ruler and not Jesus making it impossible to determine dates from AD. This is an early example of the ethnocentrism that is to dominate his later works. Needless to say this doesn't work in Latin. While the word house in Latin is domus I refuse to give him credit for this since he referred to a Russian word, not the Latin one. However 'in the year of the house' in Latin would be anno domi, not anno domini. Domini is the genitive of dominus which means master. While it is connected to the word for house (being one who is in charge of it) it has an entirely distinct meaning from it and the word cannot be used in that way. Clearly the fact that he doesn't know Latin isn't stopping him from making sweeping assumptions about it. Anyways this makes dating from the dates included in documents impossible which is certainly convenient for him isn't it? Of course all of this makes it hard to explain the many medieval Universal Histories that went from the Creation to the present and used BC and AD in exactly the same way they do now. I love the idea that Bede was actually living in the 18th Century describing the goings on of the Stuarts and Hanovers as if they were a dozen petty feuding monarchs in an only-recently Christianized land.Another way to determine a document's (or artifact's) age is Radiocarbon dating. Fomenko dismisses this entire branch of science as unreliable because it disagrees with him. Carbon Dating never provides exact dates, merely dates +- a certain number of years. It can usually be stated to within 30 years or so. This isn't a science that we're asked to have blind faith in. It can, and has been, verified. Radiocarbon dating is used most frequently in archaeology where it is one of the only ways to date a structure in the absence of written evidence. Fomenko dismisses this because it completely eradicates his 'theory.' Radiocarbon dating matches historical dating with high accuracy. Only in documents written about prehistory is there any variation which is to be expected given how little data there must have been for ancient historians to go on when they were dealing with events before their time. This is the factor that most of his supporters jump on because it is seen as harder to disprove. I admit I'm not sure how accurate it is, although it's certainly far better than +-1,000 years. But then, this isn't the foundation of his argument. He only attacks it because his 'theory' requires that it not be true. The real 'strength' of his argument lays in his statistical analyses and astronomical work. Even if Carbon Dating turned out to be rubbish he would be no closer to proving his 'theory.'To conclude: his events don't combine, his dismissal of carbon dating doesn't hold up, and his statement about forged documents is completely inaccurate. That last point I will demonstrate further below under the section which deals with the evidence that he denies or ignores. And speaking of...Having shown what utter rot his selective use of facts is it's time to turn to the facts that he doesn't want people to know. Starting with something I mentioned above: documents. While parchment doesn't last forever as I have said, there are certain conditions which allow it to be preserved for much longer than it would normally be. These finds are rare but offer a valuable insight into the ancient world. The most famous of these finds comes from Vindolanda. This was a Roman fort just below Hadrian's Wall. There were a series of letters written on thin slivers of wood which were preserved underwater in the muddy ground. These letters dealt with common every day things including troop strength, parties, new clothing, etc. They also include selections from Roman literature that Fomenko dismisses as forgeries. These documents are originals, not copies, and deal with an everyday Roman life that Fomenko claims never existed. The key points is this: there was no way that a group of Jesuits working in the 16th Century could have known that anyone would have the technology to read what was written. The processes used to recover the letters was invented by archaeologists in the 1970s including the infrared photography needed to recover them. There was no way that Jesuits could have known that they would survive by chance, would be discovered, or could be read once they had been. Furthermore, what would be the point? It's not like people doubted the Romans existed. Why create all of this useless information only to bury it forever in a place where it should have rotted away? Especially in Protestant England where Jesuits weren't exactly welcome? This parchment find is not the only one. There is a major dump in Egypt (also outside Jesuit control) and smaller ones in several other places around Europe and the Middle East. Furthermore, the building that the Vindolanda documents was found in was clearly Roman in design and structure. Which brings me 'round to my next point.Clearly Fomenko has no interest in the arts or humanities. He dismisses art historians with all the contempt he clearly feels for any field that isn't Math or Physics. Which explains how he can make some of his outlandish claims. I should point out that he considers none of these claims as proof of his 'theory.' He doesn't even take artistic studies seriously enough to dispute them. He simply assumes that they are wrong because he is right and leaves it at that. His sections on architecture are masterpieces of arrogant disdain. The only reason he even deigns to mention them is because his 'theory' is correct and therefore they must be wrong. I don't think that I need to explain why that is the wrong attitude to take.As an example he considers the Parthenon to be a Turkish mosque. The Parthenon is of course a masterpiece of Classical architecture and is lacking the traditional Muslim mosque design. Particularly the dome. Yes the roof was blown off, but they can still tell the structure of the thing from what remained. And what remains is remarkably similar to other temples traditionally labeled as Classical. I'm not kidding when I say he makes this claim based on no evidence either. His logic is that the Ancient Greeks never existed therefore this building cannot be Greek. He says that there was a Turkish tower on the Acropolis and therefore it must have been built there at the same time. His rather poor photo from the 1860s shows the tower right next to the temple of Athena Nike and it seems to be constructed of similar material to what is underneath it. By his reasoning this alone is enough to conclude that it was originally there when the temple was constructed.His conclusion ignores the similarity of design between classical buildings and assumes that they are all more modern. The fact that there are buildings of similar design and function located throughout Europe is ignored. Why these buildings were all built, covered in Roman inscriptions, and then abandoned is left as something of a mystery. Or it would be if he mentioned it. Also missing is a discussion of artifacts and how some artifacts are found throughout the Mediterranean despite the highly different cultures that exist there. Why do Turkish buildings and artwork differ so much from Italian buildings and artwork if they were all the same a few hundred years ago when they built Classcal temples? And for that matter, why were they the same? Roman armor is especially strange since the only conclusion possible from his 'theory' is that everyone around the Mediterranean adopted Roman armor, sculpted and painted it (but only on Classically styled buildings), and then abandoned it without it ever having an effect on medieval armor and weaponry. This entire section is a blatant insult to the reader's intelligence and his own. And it gets worse.When mentioning the dating of buildings he neglects to explain the layering. Specifically how one building is often built upon another. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the building on top is the newer building. Yet he would have us discard such obvious facts. Because when Classical buildings are found in a medieval city they are INVARIABLY found on the bottom. That's right, all those Classical buildings being built at the same time as medieval ones somehow all ended up on the bottom while their contemporaneous medieval ones ended up above them. Gosh, isn't that surprising?Additional 'proof' of his 'theories' comes from a series of drawings throughout his book. On page 28 he shows a medieval document that depicts Cicero and he's wearing medieval clothing. From this he concludes that he was a contemporary. What he doesn't question is how else Cicero was supposed to be portrayed? Everyone in medieval manuscripts looked medieval just as all Chinese paintings reflected contemporary Chinese dress, and Roman drawings reflected contemporary Roman dress, etc. Until relatively recently people didn't really conceive of the past as looking very different from the present. The important point is how the manuscript writer was supposed to know what Romans looked like? Sure there were Roman statues and monuments around but unless the writer was fortunate enough to live in Rome or somewhere with a standing monument they wouldn't have a clue what the Romans dressed like. That's why they depict everything the same way right into the Renaissance. Biblical stories, Classical stories, ethnic stories, they all looked modern at the time when the work was commissioned. If Cicero was truly a contemporary of some medieval scribe because these scribes always reflected the appearance of historical figures accurately then why did those figures' appearances change over the years? In the 16th and 17th Centuries there are plenty of historical paintings which depict the subjects in Renaissance dress. Are we to conclude from this that Cicero and others lived from the 1200s through the 1600s? Similarly on page 44 he shows Babylon depicted as a medieval town without asking how the artist was supposed to know what ancient Babylon looked like. In one last example of many he shows Augustus wearing a crown with a Christian cross on top in a medieval map and thus concludes that Augustus was a Christian and therefore came after Christ. The lengths that this man will go to to enhance his ignorance is amazing.So there you have it. This sad little pile of pseudohistory manages to waste 586 pages in his first book alone trying to prove something that your average five-year-old would know is nuts. A very sad thing. I'd feel more sorry for a man who's clearly slipped his bolt if it weren't for his unshakeable arrogance and contempt for all other fields. The basic assumption of the book is that mathematics trumps history. Clearly he knows better than all those stupid historians who can't see that they wasted their time in not becoming mathematicians. He actually says that one of his goals is to reclaim chronology for the field of mathematics from which he is convinced the church stole it. His contempt for other fields is staggering. He clearly knows this field better than any artist, art historian, historian, physicist, or even just plain commonsensical human being and has no hesitation in stating it. In doing so he never stoops to their level by debating facts, he simply states them as truths and then ridicules them. This book really doesn't deserve a response, but what the hey, it's a pretty funny read."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"This is a most unusual book, one that undermines the very foundations of History. According to the author and his team of researchers, History as it has been taught in Europe ever since the Renaissance is fundamentally false, verified history beginning around 1250 AD the earliest. Jesus Christ was born in 1053 and crucified in 1086, the First Crusade being an immediate reaction to his Crucifixion. Homer identifies an an anonymous poet of the second half of XIII century AD, and the event led to the creation of the Iliad had been the fall of the Latin Empire of Constantinople in 1261 AD. The list goes on and on.Historians generally oppose the author's views without making much commentary. The author is not a historian, they say, period. He is only a leading differential geometrician, successful and respected, author of many advanced textbooks. A. Fomenko is also a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences; his main argumentation is of a statistical and astronomical nature. I happen to be a physicist myself and not a historian. However, astronomy and differential geometry are known to me well from the area of general relativity, and I cannot recommend this book enough, since its author approaches History, usually a highly emotional discipline ascribed to the field of humanities, armed with impartial mathematics.History is collective memory; yet even our own memory errs at times, and no real memory extends beyond three generations. There are written sources, but each one of those might easily prove a forgery. There are material remnants of archaeological nature, but they may be misadated and misinterpreted.Astronomy is precise by definition, and a historical dating that can be calculated from information about eclipses should satisfy any researcher. Yet the XIX century astronomers did not use the lunar tidal friction value in the equations of lunar motion, which would make ancient lunar eclipses appear several hours off the mark and relocate completely several total eclipses of the sun geographically (assuming tidal friction value has remained the same all the time but there is no reason to believe it hasn't). How could XIX century calculations have conformed to consensual history?I must say that a methodical recalculation of ancient eclipse datings shall invariably bring surprises; in the unlikely case these datings are correct, we shall prove the existence of erratic changes in telluric rotation over the last 4,000 years instead. Both possibilities are highly alarming.Fomenko demonstrates the incompatibility between consensual history and modern astronomy. This incompatibility is a sad fact. (He exposes a number of other contentious issues as well, but those do not fall into my professional scope). Which is more reliable - history or hard-boiled scientific facts? Science cannot afford subjectivity; most of us would feel the same way about history as well.Chronological problems are very serious indeed; Fomenko offers a viable solution to most of them, and a radical one at that - a \\"Copernican revolution\\" of history, no less. I am not using the term to predict the final and total victory of his version; that is a matter for a multitude of scientific and scholarly discussions to come. But the contradiction between history and astronomy that becomes graver with the day cannot and must not be tolerated, in the best interests of both history and the theory of telluric rotation.Dr.PhD B. Luk&aacute;cs"},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"When I picked up &quot;History: Fiction or Science?&quot; for the first time, it was out of sheer curiosity. I appreciate crackpots and crackpot conspiracy theories of all sorts - one could say that I have a private freak collection on a separate bookshelf. Therefore, this entire history revision business looked very much like it belonged there as well, so I decided to give it a go. My initial reaction was disappointment; the author sounded perfectly sane, which is simply out of order, if you ask me (a good crackpot theorist is always stark raving mad, hence the interest - never a dull moment anywhere). Then I started to read deeper into the book and, as I submerged about thirty pages deep, the remnants of my ironic grin dropped to the floor along with my jaw. The stuff actually made sense. No hysterical overtones or complex paranoid theorizing anywhere - it is certainly a scientific work written in a manner that has academia stamped all over, no doubt about it.The critic in me would keep arguing with the authors every now and then - yet they never fail to emphasize the hypothetical nature of their reconstructions. Some of the hypotheses make perfect sense, others do not - which pleases me greatly, since I am most wary of books that make me agree with everything instantly; their integrity is nearly always heavily compromised in some way, yet never too obviously (the best crackpot conspiracy theorists are the ones you can't help agreeing with, and once you agree with enough, you find yourself ready to agree with the bloke who says reptiles rule the world). Here, you may be offered several contradictory renditions of the same historical event. Once again, I wouldn't have it any other way - anyone who is gullible enough to believe simple and unequivocal explanations offered by the official historical sources is usually unaware that those, in turn, contain numerous gaps, inconsistencies, and contradictions.I always knew that history, especially ancient history, has been a collection of fairy tales all along; still it took me some time to accommodate the thought that, for want of a better metaphor, even the fairy tales it consists of were culled from a wide variety of books, shuffled together like a very dodgy deck of cards, then put into a random sequence, given a new index and proclaimed the only authorised collection of fairy tales in the world (and children who ask silly questions about why certain things make no sense or whether there are any other, more interesting tales available elsewhere need spanking, of course - a time-honoured tradition, isn't it then?). Well, the Russian mathematicians do ask questions. Lots of questions. Questions which there was a very long tradition of not asking; ones that concern the very foundations of modern chronology (although &quot;modern&quot; might be a misleading term here, since said chronology is a child of the Middle Ages). And the historians who demand a spanking shaking fists and frothing at the mouth make me want to put every book on history that I own on the crackpot shelf - certainly not Fomenko and team. Indeed, I haven't put them on any shelf yet, since I'm reading the book for the third time over, and eagerly anticipating the second volume."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"Sky&Telescope; Magazine confirms results, but does not buy Fomenko's theoryFomenko uses astronomy data to support his argument that history is too long and that many historical events happened more recently than we thought. The temple walls and sarcophagi of some Egyptian ruins are decorated with depictions of the sun, moon, and planets as observed in the different zodiacal constellations. If a given depiction is accurate - that the celestial bodies were observed and placed correctly in the constellations - a horoscope can be used for dating. Fomenko has deciphered over a dozen Egyptian horoscopes. He claims, that the latter show dates that are 2-3 thousand of years later than conventionally thought. Most well-documented ancient eclipses actually took place in the Middle Ages.Roger Sinnott, studied astronomy at Harvard and is an editor at the respected Sky & Telescope Magazine checked Fomenko's calculations for the famous trio of eclipses from Thucydides's account of the Pelopponesian War. The three eclipses are conventionally dated to 431, 424, and 413 BC. Fomenko finds these dates as non adequate to narrative of Thucydides's and finds exact solutions as late as in 1133, 1140, and 1151 AD.The second example is the eclipse of 190 BC described in Livy's historyof Rome. Fomenko redates this event to 967 AD.Fomenko\`s dates accommodate details from ancient descriptions that the conventional dates do not. For example, Thucydides wrote that the first of his three eclipses was solar and that the stars were visible, that means that the eclipse was total. The accepted solution of August 3, 431 BC involves an eclipse that was only partial in Greece. Similarly, the Livy eclipse is supposed to have happened five days before the ides of July, which by our conventional reckoning would date it July 10. Fomenko's 967 AD solution nails that date, while the conventional 190 BC eclipse actually occurred on March 14.Sinnott confirms that eclipses did take place on the dates Fomenko has chosen and concludes, \\"Even though Fomenko has found valid eclipse dates that seem to fit the descriptions, I think it is far-fetched in the extreme to conclude that the chronology of the ancient world is 'off' by more than one thousand years.\\" Free country, isn't it?Check Fomenko's calculations with ANY sky mapping software, professional or amateur, you'll get his results confirmed."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"Earth was flat. Humans saw that it was flat, books were telling scholars that it was flat, teachers were teaching students it was flat; scientists knew it was flat. There was some disagreement about the way it was kept afloat, most common versions were elephants, whales and turtles, but that was subject for scientific discussion. Until Magellan sailed around the globe and proved all this science wrong.This book is precisely about same situation. Although it is written for casual reader, it still bears all the traits of scientific research. I was suspicious about credibility of this book, because of the scandalous 10,000.00 bet placed as advertisement here (you can beat math only by math, and guy who posted the ad knows this).I've studied math using Fomenko's textbooks as supplementary source at Fraser university (there are around 14 textbooks on math, at least known to me, written by Fomenko and translated to English, pretty expensive and rare as all advanced textbooks, but I'm pretty sure it is possible to fish something at your local university, here is the one for the start - ISBN: 0792326067).I've run some of the statistical examples in SPSS (of course simplified and using data from the book) and results were similar. Math doesn't lie, but there is old saying \\"garbage in - garbage out\\", so take my results as is. Anyway, history as a science is based on books written by previous generation of historians, who based their works on works of previous generation of historians, supplemented by archeological digs (great deal of assumptions was made there too, as people didn't usually mark their belongings with dates), so it definitely needs some mathematical treatment.It is very difficult to digest the new version of history from Fomenko without getting allergic shock. Official timeline is accepted in the same way as gravity, and movement of the sun; many nations have developed their identity based on official history. Literally speaking chronology is in our culture, in our roots, personal identity. Someone said here that this book was written by Russian nationalist to reassure Russian national identity. May be so, but I think for Russians will be very difficult to swallow that they were actually Mongols and Tatars too.This book will turn your world upside down. Literally."},{"Title":"History: Fiction or Science?","review":"This english translation may well be source of the same sort of paradigm shift that Bjorn Lomborg has instigated in environmental research when he exposed many researchers as scaremongers that put us on the wrong track to improvement.Although the tone is sometimes pedantic the content surprises with a matter of fact and extremely intelligent and consistent presentation using 1500 (!) sources. All arguments in the amazon.com reviews so far that try to \\"debunk\\" this book as nonsense are dealt with in a very thorough and convincing fashion in the book.The picture that very clearly emerges is that of a house of cards where different disciplines (C-14 dating, dendrochronology, archeology and history) need eachother in order to stay consistent about the timeframe from say 2000BC to 1500AC. I was particularly surprised about the fact that most C-14 datings are rejected and they are often off by 1 or 2 thousand years. The procedure seems to be one of carefully choosing the datings that confirm expectations. This is not only the view of renegades like Christian Bloss and Hans-Ulrich Niemitz but also of articles in New Scientist and Nature and the evidence (wrong datings) speaks for itself.It seems that nobody really ever questioned the datings that where invented by Scaliger and Petavius (based on interpretations from the bible) after the XV century. All the outrageous claims on the back cover are very well substantiated. For me it was interesting that the \\"dark ages\\" finally made sense.Does this mean that I think Anatoly Fomenko is right on all points? I don't think so. Many of the hypotheses that he presents will without doubt be corrected after thorough research. But I do think that his critisism is so valid and so fundamental that it will change or even obliterate current beliefs about ancient history.I am very curious how the scientific community of historians will react to this outstandingly researched work now that it's available in English."},{"Title":"Before You Pack Your Bag, Prepare Your Heart","review":"This succinct resource on short-term missions lays good groundwork for an upcoming trip through 12 short lessons on core issues and questions likely to be encountered.

Highly recommended to fans."},{"Title":"FRANK SINATRA: MY FATHER","review":"I have loved Mr. Sinatra since I was very young, have heard most of the bad stuff about him, and it seems that this book's purpose is to discuss his GOOD qualities. Which is a proper perspective from a daughter. If a father has raised his daughter well, she will recognize his faults, but focus on the things that made him a hero in her eyes. Remember that notion? I lost my mother in death at about the same age that Frank and Nancy Sr. divorced, and I appreciate the closeness that developed between the man and his oldest daughter. It's a precious thing. It's a mistake to read the book without understanding that it's biased. But almost ANY book about him will be, as will any book written by a daughter about her father. I'm glad for both of them that their relationship was that sweet, and for us, that we get to see a glimpse of it.Whatever else he was,the man was..... a man. And a father. And an incredible influence on our culture. I think all that shows up in this book, and I loved it. There's plenty of other people to demonize him, thank you Nancy for letting us see the other side."},{"Title":"FRANK SINATRA: MY FATHER","review":"Unlike the recent book by Tina Sinatra (which I give five-stars) this book softsells any of FAS's well known liabilities. Nonetheless, it does contain some interesting details about his life. My one complaint is that Nancy Sinatra's other book &quot;Frank Sinatra, American Legend&quot; seems to be indistiguishable from this one, and indeed contains 80% of the same material yet was not published as a revision. This, earlier version is better in my mind because of her notes about each of his movies and albums at the end of the book. That material is missing in the American Legend version. Given her softsell, I do have to wonder what Nancy has to say about her sisters more forthright approach to their father's story."},{"Title":"FRANK SINATRA: MY FATHER","review":"This is Nancy Sinatra's biography on her father, the legendary Frank. There have been many stories about him over the years; his drinking, his suspected alliance to the mafia, his womanizing... In Nancy's world none of this existed. No, Frank was a saint according to her, with no faults whatsoever. The greatest man that ever lived! I am not interested in some kind of tabloid-style, gossip-based diving into the rumours about him, but it would have been interesting to read a more nuanced view of who Frank really was. Nancy ignores all of that, and her perpetual praise of him, page after page, is very tiresome. Also, she takes the opportunity to use the book as a sort of biography on her own career (almost a third of the book is about herself -that's OK but then the title is misleading, I think). The only credit I can give the book is that there is interesting detailed information on Frank's career and I learned a lot about the music industry in the 40's and 50's. But I would like to read an outsider's story about Frank, a more objective one."},{"Title":"FRANK SINATRA: MY FATHER","review":"The photographs are fab,then you start to read ,and a little voice says wait a minute,espically as ive just finised his way by kitty kelley,i know he is dad ,and she's his little chicken,but how anyone in there right mind would fill a book cover to cover with such sugar sweet garbage,as this is beyond me,unless of course your ego and arrogance is higher than everest,now where would she have got that from,her explaining away the acts of voilence and cruelty,of one of the most feard performers to ever tread the boards,are airily brushed away with &quot;hell get mad,and youll get mad&quot;,but if you face him them all will be well, ah shucks ,that is if your head is still on your shoulders,here and there,the veneer seems to slip,such as when descriping Richard Burtons,tribute to sinatra,at a luncheon in sinatras honour.She commends burtons tribute,then icily adds his words were by someone else, burtons diaries (Rich a life)leave no illusions of he really thought of sinatra,somehow i get the feeling this didnt escape her,its these little cracks in the facade, that show the true nancy, like father like daughter,sorry honey you dont fool me for one minute, little chicken,little vulture,more like it."},{"Title":"FRANK SINATRA: MY FATHER","review":"The photographs are fab,then you start to read ,and a little voice says wait a minute,espically as ive just finised his way by kitty kelley,i know he is dad ,and she's his little chicken,but how anyone in there right mind would fill a book cover to cover with such sugar sweet garbage,as this is beyond me,unless of course your ego and arrogance is higher than everest,now where would she have got that from,her explaining away the acts of voilence and cruelty,of one of the most feard performers to ever tread the boards,are airily brushed away with &quot;hell get mad,and youll get mad&quot;,but if you face him them all will be well, ah shucks ,that is if your head is still on your shoulders,here and there,the veneer seems to slip,such as when descriping Richard Burtons,tribute to sinatra,at a luncheon in sinatras honour.She commends burtons tribute,then icily adds his words were by someone else, burtons diaries (Rich a life)leave no illusions of he really thought of sinatra,somehow i get the feeling this didnt escape her,its these little cracks in the facade, that show the true nancy, like father like daughter,sorry honey you dont fool me for one minute, little chicken,little vulture,more like it."},{"Title":"Novell's ZENworks Administrator's Handbook","review":"You will find yourself refering to Novells website to get full explainations and instructions on how to do things refereced in the book.

This story is an adaptation from Native American lore. There are two wind gods, the cold, icy North Wind that brings fall and winter and the warm South Wind that brings spring and summer. At one time, North Wind came early and refused to leave on time, leading to the Blackfoot Indians suffering, as the buffalo were no longer plentiful. While South Wind tried to move North Wind away, he was not strong enough and North Wind remained.However, by performing a ruse, South Wind was able to lure North Wind into his hot teepee, weakening him to the point where he could be overcome. Once North Wind was defeated, South Wind occasionally decided to stay a little longer in the autumn of the year, extending the warmth of the summer into the fall months. The Blackfoot then called the additional irregular season Indian summer.I did not encounter this story until my children were too old to listen to it. However, if I had known about it when they were young, there is no doubt that I would have read it to them and explained the point of the story."},{"Title":"What Shall I Grow?

Now I'm glad she did. \\"Life After God\\" has a somewhat experimental feel to the narrative, but it's a successful experiment if it is.Coupland explores the concept: \\"You are the first generation raised without religion.\\" Or more specifically, how human beings (all of which are born with a drive to believe in something -- religion, politics, art) respond to the material-driven world. Meditations on what separates humans from animals, imagining a nuclear explosion and how it would immediately impact the people who die in it, a philosophical bout with depression, and how people respond to their \\"lives after God.\\"Disregard the initially off-putting title of the book, because that title really doesn't reflect what the book is about. At the end of one short story, the narrator concludes, \\"My secret is that I need God.\\" Not the way religious fanatic Dana does, which is more needy and superficial, but rather in a deep and primal way. And Coupland doesn't go overboard trying to explain it to the readers -- he just writes it and lets it sink in.It has a slightly odd format; the pages are tiny, and the parts of each short story are more like connected vignettes, some only a few sentences long. And it's sprinkled with cute little drawings, like Coupland doodled on his manuscript. (Rain, boxes, computers, matches, and a parakeet with a key in its beak, among others) As in Coupland's other books, there is a sort of unhappy optimism to these stories, and Coupland's musings about how a lack of emphasized God has affected our ability to love and believe.\\"Life After God\\" is not exactly an ordinary book. But it touches very well on hard-to-write-about topics and its messages lingered for a long time in my mind."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"\\"Life After God\\" is a genuinely morose, sad, melancholic collection of stories dealing with loneliness, isolation and unhappiness. Most of its characters are numbly horrified by where they find themselves in life.The stories here deal with that in-between world of the childishness of youth and the maturity of adulthood -- and how the people existing in that world make the transition. Some simply take the step, while others -- the people here -- can't help but pause and reflect, to question it, to wonder if it's even sensible.Coupland's premise seems to be that this young generation of the '90s, so deadened by irony, so empty and unfeeling, experience this crushing loneliness because they are without religion (which is something I don't agree with, since I side with Marx and think of religion as nothing more than an opiate).Coupland does understand his characters, though, and as someone who's just a bit younger, I identified with them (even when I found them pretentious and dramatic). There are times when I felt like Coupland was stealing my thoughts. Showing me conversations I've had about the worries and insecurities in my life.The greatest thing about \\"Life After God\\" are the staggering and utterly true thoughts Coupland drops here and there, which are so perfectly accurate, they leave you gut-punched.I probably enjoyed the final two stories the least, and \\"In The Desert\\" the most, but \\"Life After God\\" is an excellent story collection that displays Coupland's considerable talent."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"This splendidly written book captivates the reader with compassion for the main character as he stumbles through the mistakes and beauty he has created in his life. The book follows the journey of a person who is trying to discover who he is in the midst of a fallen world, void spirituality and broken dreams. I'm a huge fan of the author, Douglas Coupland, and I feel that this is by far his best work. It will make you laugh, cry and ponder this crazy thing we call existence."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Two things stuck with me from the book Fight Club: (1) the line \\"Your father is your model for God\\" and (2) I wish I'd read it before I visited Blarney Castle.The reason I bring up \\"Fight Club\\" is that \\"Life After God\\" posits \\"You are the first generation raised without religion,\\" and \\"Fight Club\\" says men today are a generation raised by our mothers. So, I guess the problem boils down to \\"Where's Poppa?\\"My friend Todd loaned me this book after I graduated college. I felt really hollow then, like a robot that required pop-culture and irony to survive. All the characters in \\"Life After God\\" feel hollow, and it was comforting to read about them. I felt less alone afterward, and somehow the book gave me hope for a better future, even though it features a story about the apocalypse.I guess the key thing is that the book sparked me to feel again, shaking up some long dormant emotions. It's a quick read that I usually recommend to depressed friends."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"About 8 years ago I spent the night at a friend's house one night and had severe insomnia, so I picked up this book from her bookshelf and started reading it. I had never even heard of Douglas Coupland before. The book was so good that I read it the whole way through that night. It's very intense and hit me at a difficult time in my life. It was like reading the Bible- manna to my soul. I have gone on to read every Coupland book I could find, and they are all touching and engaging. I even met him at a book signing here in DC. He's not how I imagined him- he's very unassuming. Anyway, this book is great, just like all of his."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Forget the more famous &quot;Generation X.&quot; The collection &quot;Life After God&quot; is Coupland's best work by far. This collection of stories is related by theme and narrative voice; while the characters change from story to story, the point of view remains the same, and Coupland uses the same narrative voice throughout. And what a voice it is! Funny, Perceptive, Sad, resigned to the past yet yearning for a better future--a future which the author fears might always elude him. The characters in &quot;Life After God&quot; are more like real people than the characters in his other books, who often assume the roles of cultural stereotypes and morph into cliches. In different ways, the characters in &quot;Life After God&quot; are all dealing with loss--the loss of a lover, of a sister, a childhood friend, one's own idealism. And there are no happy endings. At best the characters manage to accept their losses and find a sliver of hope to carry them through the rest of their lives. Coupland's prose is lean and poetic; his eye for detail manages to convey much about a character or a situation through the use of one or two objects. His monotone prose reflects the flat, wounded states of his characters' souls. Each of these stories is heartbreaking in its own way. Despite his reputation as a novelist, short fiction seems to be Coupland's natural medium. His storytelling talents are average at best, but his observations of character and feeling are superb. It is the latter which makes &quot;Life After God&quot; such a moving experience."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"This book, like most by Douglas Coupland, is a fast-paced, easy read. The book that I read was very compact (more wallet-sized than like a book) and hard-back, so its small pages passed by in a flash of wonder and amazement.In a collection of six poignant short stories filled with colorful and full characters, Coupland addresses issues that affects us all: bravely looking at death, change, the passage of life; wondering who you are or waking up to suddenly realize that you don't know where you're going, or that you don't like who you are.Despite the atheistic title, the characters all are in search of God, and toward the end one of his characters admits that he &quot;needs&quot; God, but can't seem to allow that secret to come out. But how can we find any reality in the world of fast-moving cars, of freedom of movement and blindingly fast change, of religious fanatics, televangelists, a world tempered by drugs and a search for meaning, any meaning?Coupland's answer comes out in the beauty of nature and the wonder of our relationships with the people around us. Although his characters can't relate to the Jesus-lovers of organized religion, they are all reaching out for something bigger than themselves, something that &quot;the first Generation raised without Religion&quot; has a difficulty grasping.I have long felt that Douglas Coupland and his insights are perhaps the closest that popular culture gets to Truth spelled out on paper. This book has all the profundity and all the questions of his preceding books, in a very unassuming and readable manner. Pick it up: you'll read it in a single afternoon."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"i read LIFE AFTER GOD when it was first published and was simply floored. here was an author whose voice spoke to me and my generation. coupland's simple yet poignant prose captured the feelings of ambiguity and confusion that many of us were feeling. the stories in this collection may seem simpleton on the exterior, but they are much more than what meets the eye. think the greatness of ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT by erich remarque. its complexity lays in its very simplicity.i was still in college when i first picked up the book. i recently picked it up again. the effects were still the same. what's remarkable about LIFE AFTER GOD is the sheer optimism one feels after finishing it. coupland doesn't claim to know all the answers or to grant inner peace, but what he does do is allow the reader to intensely reflect on his/her own beliefs."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"All I can say is that it's one of those books that makes you realize you're not alone. The whole time I found myself going \\"YES!! Exactly!!\\" It just makes sense.An excellent read for anyone who has ever questioned ... well ... anything."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"This is one of those books that I have wanted to review for a while, but was unsure of how to approach it. I love the book and have read it over a half dozen times in less than two years. Yet it is such an atypical book that it is difficult to review. I can just be blunt and state that the book will grab you and draw you back in again and again.The book is published as fiction, yet rumors have it that Coupland will admit that it is at least partially autobiographical. It is a collection of recollections, thoughts, memories and drawings by Coupland. It is the recount a man's life, and as we find out he is telling the story to find out how his life got to where it is. He wants a record for his daughter so that maybe she will understand him better. My favorite of the individual entries is:\\"Now -- here is my secret:I tell it to you with an openness of heart I doubt I shall ever achieve again, so I pray that you are in a quiet room as you hear these words. My secret is that I need God - that I am sick and can no longer make it alone. I need God to help me give, because I no longer seem capable of giving; to help me to be kind, as I no longer seem capable of kindness; to help me love, as I seem beyond able to love.\\" p.359Every time I pick up this book, I get something more out of it. Sometimes I read it from beginning to end, and then at other times I just pick it up and read at random. This book deals with many of the 'big' questions all of us will have to deal with in our lives. Questions like: How do we deal with Loneliness? Anxiety? Failed relationships? How can we find quiet in our lives? It also deals with the question of being raised without a religion or belief system and how, as we age, we end up struggling with spiritual questions.If you can track down the first edition hardcover it is worth it. It is in a different format and shape. With the dust jacket off, it looks like a prayer book or bible. If you read it without the jacket in public places people will often ask you what you are reading. This was intentional and the shape and design of this book are part of the art of the book, and part of the complexity Coupland has woven into it. The front cover of the hardback also has an outline of a hand, like a tracing of a child's hand. As we are all reaching out beyond ourselves in search of some greater meaning in life, we are reaching out like a child in search of a parent.My hat is off to Coupland and this amazing work of art - on all the levels that it is art of the deepest level. Coupland has created a masterpiece that will become a classic, which will survive through the ages."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"This is the 8th book of Coupland's I've read and I wouldn't have read this many if I didn't think he was a great writer doing wonderful things with the novel. He's been on a roll recently starting with \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" up to his latest \\"Generation A\\" so I was interested enough to go back to those I've not read, his early books.\\"Life After God\\" is a collection of short stories written in blocks of 2 or 3 paragraphs per page, large font, with a single child-like illustration accompanying it. The stories are plotless and meandering. One concerns a man in a hotel talking with his neighbours and then setting free some goldfish into a reservoir. Another features a mother who's left her husband and is talking to the child about her plans for their future and their present journey. Another features aimless thirty-somethings, unhappy with who they became, wondering what to do, trying to change, etc.I'll say that the final story above hooked me. I've had similar conversations with friends I was close with who I've met at a wedding of a mutual friend or who I've met up with at a bar for a drink, and we've talked about who we were, who we are, and where we hope we're going. It's called growing up. It's called life. The overall message seems to be \\"life isn't what I thought it would be\\" and I get that, I think we all feel that. But as a book? It just drags.Coupland's written about the vapidity of modern life and the aimlessness of the individual and the human condition exceptionally well, better than many writers around now and easily the equal of classic writers of the past. \\"Life After God\\" though is a misfire. It's got the ideas and the scenes of a book like \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Generation A\\" minus the humour and the plot. As such, it's one of his least interesting works and at best feels like a self-indulgent experiment and a half drunk conversation with someone you vaguely liked once."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"\\"Life After God\\" is a collection of short works, some of which are obviously fictional and some it is hard to tell. The common theme running through all the stories is of life without the certainty of the existence of God. In various ways the author grapples with the implications of a world without God through telling stories of the people struggling to find meaning and purpose in various, and sometimes very strange, situations. This book is a lament for something lost with comfortable modernity, but it poses no answers and there is very little certainty between the covers of this little book.I found myself devouring the pithy, but often beautiful prose as I stumbled with the characters through shattered inner landscapes amid malls, airports, cubicles, and family homes. I haven't read something so melancholy and true for a very long time. As you read Coupland's struggle will resonate with you on several levels. You'll see yourself, your friends and loved ones, and our culture at large. Even though this was fiction it was honest in a way that most writing isn't. So, read this and think deeply about our loss. What will become of a world without God? Coupland doesn't know, and doesn't give any indication that he believes in God. Let me close with a quote from the book that sums it up nicely without giving too much away.\\"My secret is that I need God - that I am sick and can no longer make it alone. I need God to help me give, because I no longer seem to be capable of giving; to help me be kind, as I no longer seem capable of kindness; to help me love, as I seem beyond being able to love.\\"This is definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"\\"Beyond a certain age, sincerity ceases to feel pornographic.\\"This is an excellent book. I would say that if you've read any of his other works, you would know what to expect, but that's not entirely the case; this specific work consists of several substories from parties unrelated to each other but with similar mindsets and feelings.It is a short book, and if you are a reader, you can get through it in a day or so, and this should be a fine use for a day.You should know what to expect: it is not an uplifting book, but it is an intimate book in that it delves in a unique way into the consciousness of the viewer. More detail than that would not do it justice."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"I enjoyed this book. My first Coupland read but certainly not my last. Seems quite different than other Coupland I've read.

This book deals with many of the \`big' questions all of us will have to deal with in our lives. Questions like: How do we deal with Loneliness? Anxiety? Failed relationships? How can we find quiet in our lives? It also deals with the question of being raised without a religion or belief system and how, as we age, we end up struggling with spiritual questions.If you can track down the first edition hardcover it is worth it. It is in a different format and shape. With the dust jacket off, it looks like a prayer book or bible. If you read it without the jacket in public places people will often ask you what you are reading. This was intentional and the shape and design of this book are part of the art of the book, and part of the complexity Coupland has woven into it. The front cover of the hardback also has an outline of a hand, like a tracing of a child's hand. As we are all reaching out beyond ourselves in search of some greater meaning in life, we are reaching out like a child in search of a parent.My hat is off to Coupland and this amazing work of art - on all the levels that it is art of the deepest level. Coupland has created a masterpiece that will become a classic, which will survive through the ages."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"This is a good book, effective but not great. The series of stories as told by the disenfranchised narrator is filled with keen observations and poignant vigneetes, together forming a good carricature of the suburban lifestyle during these safe, post Cold War years where spirituality dwindles. I found the apocalyptic seres of vignette the most effective, as well as the relationship to the sister. The ending is a bit of a let down, as Coupland didn't really have a run up to the conclusion, it just appeared as a stretch."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Coupland drops much of the pop culture references and focuses on the soul. Where does one go to place those religious impulses these days. In this book he tries to find an answer. Being the same age as Mr. Coupland, I can really relate to his hard questions"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. It's minimalistic, profound, funny, everything great about literature is right here. Certain parts I cannot get past without weeping. EVen after reading them numerous times."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"If you want to sample Coupland, start here. At the risk of dubbing this book &quot;Chicken Soup for the Slacker,&quot; this is Coupland's best book, better than his breakthrough &quot;Generation X,&quot; and the most honest story he's written. Actually, it's several stories spun by the protagonist, wound around journal-like reflections to his daughter after his marriage breaks up. This is the only Coupland effort where he doesn't lean too heavily on mass culture references, so it might last longer than his other works. When I read &quot;Generation X,&quot; I immediately related to what was going on (some may not have and, alas, were lost and hated it), and I felt the same relationship to this book, although in a different way. It reads much like an epitaph to everything &quot;Generation X&quot; laid down before it."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"When Douglas Coupland tells a story it feels as though it's not just a story that he's telling, but the truth. Logic and reason float around in his head and flow out onto the page. I know this story by heart, every comma, every character. This story is a monologue in my head. It is after all, about me, and about you. He is subtle about it of course. Coupland is an old soul, blessed with wisdom and grace. He puts a smile on my face. His words explode in the static behind my eyes. They are fresh in my mind and in my heart and I have no need to look beyond the crinkled edges of these pages. I know these gentle syllables by heart, these lines are written on the parchment in my brain. These are the words, the words that heal, the words that tell us we are whole :)"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Anthropocentric fairytales and simple moral fables.He writes well however.

I've read all of his books and have even seen the movie Slacker. Yet this book is his greatest work of all. The way he writes as if you were sitting right next to him just blows my mind away. And his outlooks on things ranging from life to a blender are outragously funny and very true. This book will change your prespectives on everything. And leave your mind on the curb as he drags you thru an outer limit of realistic imagination. It's like a good hit of acid. He's the MAN.Bret Harvey"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"i dunno? something about this book's simplicity...and how it's all tied together at the end? something about how in the end nothing in life can fill the void except the Divine.

His tendancy to delve into such insightful, thought-provoking aspects of our existence with such freshness and accuracy remains to be both eye-opening and astounding. His excellent understanding of human nature in this novel will remain to be seen and respected in many years to come. A brilliant novel."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"As a Coupland Frequent Flyer, I almost lost perspective while I was reading this book. I had enjoyed (does anyone remember what it is like?) &quot;Generation X&quot;, &quot;Shampoo Planet&quot; and &quot;Microserfs&quot; so much, that I bought &quot;Life After God&quot; without much thought. In the end, I was standing in a crossroad: Should my zest for Coupland's style rule over the randomness I had found in most of the stories (in typical brain-heart conflict)? Or should I accept that this was for Coupland what &quot;Almost Blue&quot; was for Elvis Costello? Although I don't regret buying and reading this one, I still think it pales in comparison even to cronicles like the ones he usually does for Wallpaper Magazine, so my advice is this: Buy and read this book only if you have done so with ano-ther from the ones I mention above. If you like them, welcome aboard."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"There were some slightly profound, thought provoking passages in this book. Being in my late 20's, naturally I could relate. But after a while, I began to wonder why it was the Mr. Coupland felt that we needed to be included in ALL of his deepest thoughts and lonely banter. I too would love for the world to read MY existential life thoughts, family secrets, and childhood memories, but does anyone really care? After awhile, I just didn't care anymore. It would have helped if this &quot;stories&quot; were collected in a more organized semblance, it seemed a bit sloppy."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"After reading &quot;Generation X' and &quot;Shampoo Planet&quot; I was somewhat dissappointed by this effort. The angst of the central character as a tortured father separated from a child is understandable but maudlin at times. There is something of Coupland's earlier style in the book. The childhood reminiscence of the central character recalls the author's work in &quot;Generation X&quot; and was much appreciated. The book on the whole is not the pleasure to read that his two previous works were."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Life after God is a collection of short stories told in the famliar Coupland manner. As I've felt with his previous work, his work is more about expressing the feelings of the collective unconscious of his generation than actually telling a story, at least as he sees it. That's why he is probably better suited to short fiction than novels. Not for everyone, but that's Coupland for you."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Life After God is well written, there is no argument there (despite a few consistency errors). The problem is this nice read goes nowhere, it just delivers lots of little stories with nothing to tie them together into a cohesive whole. Coupland is good with his prose and is very easy to read, but I want more than that. And really, a plot is not too much to ask for is it?"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"A few months after reading and thoroughly enjoying Hey Nostradamus, I picked this book up, thinking that it would be good. Okay, I can see why the book might appeal to some.. it raises a lot of questions that young adolescents often ask themselves about life while struggluing to find a true identity, making the reader feel like they relate to what the narrators(as there are six in the book) have to say. But come on, what is this book even about? It seems to be full of pointless ramblings of worried and depressed characters (all seemingly sharing the same personality) that don't even establish anything. Nothing is accomplished as these narrators babble, and it seems that each character is right back where they started at the end of each story, or else the story seems incomplete somehow. Some things that are said in the book do make the reader think or laugh because they know that they've asked those same questions to themselves, but in the end... this book has no plot and is quite a waste of time."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Apparently &quot;God&quot; was crucially involved in stuff like prose style, characterization, and plot development. Coupland -- owing to . . . lack of talent? unfamiliarity with the literary canon? -- runs afoul of that fallacy whereby the affectless stupor of the things one represents dictates an affectless, stupor-enducing manner of representation. Mind-boggling tedium, in the service a *very* juvenile worldview."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Life After God speaks the truth for a generation of lonely, intelligent, and confused individuals, even those of us who do not find Beavis and Butthead even remotely amusing or entertaining. Coupland's vision requires no plot. The simplicity echoes with levels of meaning and emotion perhaps only few may grasp. Read with an open mind, slowly and thoughtfully, and you will find a profoundly beautiful and powerful study of our society."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"I found this book when I came across some interesting quotes from it online, and now I can see why. The book is full of concise, thoughtful points, embedded in small slices of life. I loved the childlike illustrations (I have an older version of the story, I'm not sure if they're in the newer prints) and the open-heart perspective from the author."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"A huge fan of his work. Beautiful, mysterious, haunting, and yet so normal and mundane. Such a wise understanding of people"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"After naming a generation and the planet in his first two outings, Culture-scribe Coupland takes on the \\"what's left\\": people seeking what for, and how for, in the void after \\"the Void.\\"Sound lofty? Well, look at the cover: it's a billboard.For those, like me, particularly struck by Michael Stipe singing the \\"Here's a TRUCK STOP / instead of ST. PETER'S!\\" line in R.E.M.'s \\"Man on the Moon\\" (a sort of \\"yes!\\"/\\"Eureka!\\" moment, of commiseration with that sort of \\"pining for\\") Coupland's explorations -- via parallel-themed, short-story form -- will be just the ticket.Instead of howling at the moon, people, nowadays, are howling at Stop Signs, and, whatever you wannacallit -- the aching for \\"God,\\" the Big Cheese, the Void, etc., etc. -- somehow, this human impulse seems to find its most aptly \\"placed\\" manifestation in transit. (Hence, the preponderance of hotel/motel rooms and related-over-road trip \\"framing devices\\"/settings in this collection.)Kerouac's \\"Desolation Angels,\\" were, of course, people \\"On the Road\\" -- and, let us remember, Churches themselves were intended for those \\"in transit\\" (weren't they? sure they were! or ... has our Cultural Memory gotten THAT far off track, that I--).Well -- be that as it may -- what people find themselves \\"filling in the gap\\" with, here, are tales within tales of their own lives, spun out to others ... or, wait: does that sound too much like a Master's thesis project?Hm.That's just me sounding \\"preachy\\": the pages spin out like something out of (what one would imagine) \\"The Arabian Nights\\" or \\"The Canturbury Tales\\" would have been like, at the time, hitting the listeners/readers for whom they were concocted: a bit of a \\"pause that refreshes\\" (yuk yuk!), culled from the ongoing cultural/historical streams from One Who Had Been There, with us, showing the \\"Way\\" we were, in fact, \\"Way\\"-ing all along ... and: isn't that all you can ask, really, of a fellow wordsmith?Throw the man his coin.

I would expect nothing less from Douglas Coupland. He has his own unique way at looking at the world and it comes across clearly in this book"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"I read this book 15 years ago, when I was 15. I loaned it to a friend who liked the cover art and internal pictures. She never gave it back. As I think back on how I felt when I read it, I remembered fearing that I would feel like the characters one day. Now that I am 30 and have re-read it, I feel a sense of Back to Future deja vu, like I once read my future and am re-reading the future that is my present, now. It is poignant in it's accuracy, capturing the apathy and disillusionment of my generation. I marvel that though he is older, he was able to see what we were and are going through. Do I think it is a lack of God? No. I didn't really think that was what Copeland was saying either. I guess that's why it's fiction, you can interpret it however you want.That angst that everyone told me would fade with time, that it was just a phase, is something that has never gone away. It is something I feel this author understands. Maybe it is a frustration with the lack of purpose in mundane life. Whatever it is, he captures it, makes you face it and leaves you reading frantically for more, making you think he is leading you towards an answer.I have read most of Mr. Coupland's work and highly recommend him to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"What an amazing book! I had to read this for a class and it blew my mind. I can't wait to read more of this author!"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"I stumbled across Life After God in a used bookstore years ago and found the cover (the prior edition) and the title interesting enough to spend the $3.00 on it. I've since purchased the book at least a dozen times after giving my copy away to anyone who would agree to read it. I finally picked up the Kindle Fire edition which I don't really recommend for a first reading; it seems to easy to skim past the drawings which, while not being important to the stories, Coupland included them for a reason and they shouldn't be treated as anything less than a vital part of the book.Life After God is a series of reflections and short stories; I understand that. There is another approcah to the book however. When I read it I think of the book having a single consciousness, a single soul. Yes times, places, genders and situations all change from chapter to chapter but after at least a dozen readings I feel that this approach holds up and makes for a more meaningful and impacting read."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"I received this book last Sunday and I read it in just 3 days. It's great, it has become one of my favourite books."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Here's what I like about Coupland's fiction work. He writes characters that I can relate to. Not all of them but most. In this collection of loosely tied together stories Coupland talks about the generation that has been raised without religious bias. A generation that takes the world at face value and tries to fit an understanding to that rather than understanding a god so that life can then take on meaning.The style of the storytelling is compelling to read because it contains very little definition of the narrators themselves and leaves you with a vague sense of identification with the feelings and not the characters. But I think that's the whole point of this collection. I think that the lack of identity, so to speak, is what has driven these characters to voice their feelings or lack thereof about an ambiguos an amorphous lifestyle of good and wrong. They emit the idea that without religious convictions there's not a whole lot of solid personality to identify with or even to brag about. The stories are mostly anectodotal parables of sorts from the characters' past or imagination. And all through it you can't help but feel like you're sort of lost and adrift in life with them. Maybe not as tragically, but deep down there's a part of you that makes you question how much your life sort of feels this way.This book is, much like my mother who recommended it to me, nagging to say the least. It's one of those books that, if you're young enough, will change how you process through certain things and how you try to understand life, adrift in pool without direction."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"I first read LAG 8 years ago when I was 20. At the time I was just beginning to feel a sense of ennui and angst. LAG absolutely floored me. I had never really been exposed to these types of philosophical/sociological thoughts and observations about the modern condition and life.This week on a whim I decided to read LAG again to see how it would hit me 8 years later. Now, as a 28 year old, the book seemed trite and callow. Most of the territory covered in the book has been covered over and over by so many authors. Part of this may be due to the fact that Coupland helped pioneer this style and message but a great book should always feel fresh and relevant and this feels cliche and dated.With all that said, though, LAG still carries a great warmth and honesty. It is a wonderful book for people in late teens or early 20s (or for older people who are a little late to explore some of these themes). But authors like Dave Eggers, David Foster Wallace, and to an extent Don Delillo explore Coupland's themes but in a much more sophisticated manner. Coupland provides a sort of cliff notes version to deep thoughts. Nothing wrong with that though! And despite its callowness, LAG still provided some genuine moments were I had to put the book down and gaze out the window and think and/or feel for a few moments. If an author can elicit that response from a reader, that is an achievement. And again, I BELIEVE him, in his voice, and I'll take that any day over a more erudite book that rings pretentious and false."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"My copy of this book has been underlined in, written in, dog-eared, and page-marked many times. Douglas Coupland has written a truly profound book that somehow retains sincerity. He has brought to words many of the ideas I have kept close to my heart, in particular, &quot;First, technology does not always equal proggress&quot; and &quot;McDonald's equals evil.&quot; Life After God is potentially the book we, the generation Coupland dubbed &quot;X&quot; might write to our own children. Life After God is filled with personal musings, and personal truth. Each time I read this book, I learn something new about myself and human nature in general. Coupland is not Kerouac, nor Vonnegut, but his own generation's possible saviour (sacrificial cow)"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"I love Douglas Coupland. I think he is an amazing writer, and this little book proves it. It's a collection of circumstances and stories that are really quite deep when you begin to think about it. Coupland just has a way of getting to the root of things and questioning beliefs without getting preachy. It's one of those rare little books that manage to be about everything and nothing at the same time. The first time I read it was several years ago, but I still find myself going back to it every once and awhile; it always gives me new things to think about. It's a short read, and I definetely think it's worth it."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Coupland never ceases to amaze me. It has been said that he is a modern day Salinger, and after reading this title, I can't agree more. His quirky observations, his ever-relative comparisons, and his thought provoking moments of genius--all these add up to make him in my opinion the greatest author of our time. My favorite part of this book is the fairy tale that the main characters sister is constantly having he and his brother act out. Pure genius! It will change your life. If you get a chance, you should visit the authors website and listen to real audio clips of him reading from this book. &quot;Sometimes I think this is the only thing I should be thinking about.&quot;"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Coupland continues to do us all a favor by describing the world from a previously unnoticed perspective. His innovations in language and storyline are an exciting change of pace from the status quo. Even so, his quirky, often cynical observations, are an acquired taste for those who have not grasped this brand of grunge-techno-pop-iconic-insider literature. He will be studied by young writers in ten or twenty years."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Coupland's Life After Godwas THE most depressing bookI have EVER had the pleasure of reading."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"SPOILER ALERTI've read quite a few other Coupland books and have found the last couple of be a bit of a chore to get through compared to his earlier work. As an atheist and from the description and reviews I thought this might it might be worth giving him another shot. It was a quick and easy read but the apparent \\"conclusion\\" in the final pages left me disappointed. After reading a lot of short vignettes that nicely highlight some of the existential angst and fears and problems of life all people have probably experienced Coupland's conclusion seems to say, that when push comes to shove - for the generation raised where God is not the default, go to explanation of everything we can rely on - we still really need God. To quote \\"My secret is that I need God - I'm sick and can no longer make it alone. I need God to help me give because I no longer seem to be capable of giving; to help me be kind, as I no longer seem capable of kindness; to help me love as I seem to be beyond being able to love\\". So I only got a 'C' in English literature but I'm pretty sure the Coupland is actually saying the generation raised without go is going off the rails emotionally without God and that we need to have a belief in a magical deity to make life bearable.Obviously as an atheist I'd disagree with that but I'm not going to give it a one star rating just because I disagree with the conclusion - like I said the writing is nice and it's a quick and easy read that finds resonance with many people's feelings about life and the \\"what does it all mean\\" and \\"where did I miss the boat\\" experiences we have as we get older. Those are well observed and translated into some characters and the short stories about them. But I have to ding my rating at least somewhat since I really think it does a disservice in presenting God as the only thing that can bring meaning and answers to live. Seriously, the generation living \\"after god\\" can aspire to greater things than falling back on the familiar magical crux of religion."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"\\"Life After God\\" is a collection of short stories and pieces that seem to sort of tie together in plot and character, but each piece can stand well on its own. The main character in each story seems to be the same person at different points in his life. It's a very quick read, and you will find more satisfaction in the different thoughts and epiphanies that Coupland brings up than in the overall plot line. To me, it read almost like a non-fiction book--a collection of the authors thoughts in a diary, perhaps. I would say it's a must read for Coupland fans.I think readers of this book will react with extremes--either you will find it pretentious and ridiculous, or you will find (like i did) that Coupland is putting words to the feelings that you've had about your life and your place in the world.I have a hard time telling people what Life After God is about--the main Coupland-esque themes of isolation, growing up and growing disillusioned, the need for faith and religion, the loss of love are all explored in different short stories in this book. However, because there is less of a focus on telling a story, Coupland goes off on tangents that are quite profound and relatable.My fave story is \\"My Hotel Year\\" in which the narrator spends a year of his life living in a rundown hotel with a cast of interesting characters who are all, in their own ways, looking to belong and be loved.I read this at the end of my freshman year in college, and after a whole year of college philosophy and late night discussions about who we are and what is this world we live in, i found Life After God to be the kind of book where you go, \\"wow, that's exactly it!\\"Also recommended: THE LOSERS CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"...after setting Life After God down, I began thinking about Coupland's narrative methods, and I ended up feeling manipulated. His narratives seem desperate to avoid traditional continuity, which is perfectly fine. The problem, though, is that his characters never have a life of their own. Their identities are never clearly defined, and in the end, are only a means for Coupland to express his meditations on some aspect of our culture, in the frail guise of a short story. Most of these tales, I'm sorry to say, haven't stuck with me in the the two years since I've read this book.His meditations are insighful, and sometimes moving (especially the stories about Superman and the drug dealer), but I hesitate to call this literature. And if some people say it is, I fear for the written word. Coupland strips his writing of subtlety; he hits you over the head with his thoughts, without wrapping them in a narrative that makes them interesting or evocative. Maybe that makes a statement about the contemporary world as devoid of mystery (and &quot;God&quot;) but it makes for clinical prose.Still, it's worth it for Coupland's thoughts. This book is worth your time, but focus on his musings more than his stylistic tricks"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Absolutly lovely. I had never been an avid reader. In fact, I had only finished a few books in my life. When facing a difficult time, a friend gave me this book. To be quite frank, (and mellowdramatic at that), it changed my life.

I keep a few on hand as gifts and have let my friends in on this truly amazing world.

Yes, it's not the most insightful thing he's written, and I am getting tired of his apocalypse fettish.

I heard him read in Victoria, B.C., and although he is uncomfortable at the podium, his message has &quot;the prophetic&quot; about it...and I hope he will continue to exmaine &quot;us&quot; and &quot;himself&quot; in that light (just as this fine collection does)."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Having read before two superb books from Douglas: Generation X and Microserfs, one finds this book, although as finely written as usual, but a little repetitive on the eternal-Coupland-themes: favorite brands of products (does the guy receive funds from IKEA or Count Chocula?), a little stiff of Japanese culture in the air, and the always present nuclear youth nightmare &quot;three seconds before the Bomb&quot;.

For me this book has so many different ways to read it, so many ways to find your reflection in it.This book saved me several times by showing me the diversity of life itself.The people in Mr. Couplands book are discribed in a way that is nearly more real than reality and you can go to this reality just by opening the cover of &quot;Life After God&quot;."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Everyone under thirty ought to read at least one book by Douglas Coupland, and since most are essentially the same insight repackaged some other way, why not this extended pamphlet? It's convoluted, going from one situation to the next and sometimes coming back to an earlier point, other times the story line just drifts off. The author makes it evident that his point has more to do with the theses presented than wrapping up any tedious plot. Maybe his next book should point out that the generation he targets often misses the point of art, as this is one of his books where he presents illistrations accompanied by text (Dave Eggers owes Coupland a nickel per royalty for drawing a stapler in the intro to his _Staggering Genius_), text I might add that could stand alone without the pictures, but then the book would be roughly the size of _Who Moved My Cheese?_.High recommendation for the insight, mild recommendation for the pictures, a point off for lack of closure."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Generation X was good, Life after God is even better.

Even at a young age, I &quot;understood&quot;. After reading this book and you close the cover you will say &quot;wow&quot;...it will just &quot;touch&quot; you, and make you think...well at least it did for me-so far, this is my favorite book."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"i just like the fact that although coupland targets a specific age range as his audience, the message of his ruminations extends far beyond into future generations similarly raised without the backdrop of religion."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"This remains my favorite of Doug Coupland's works. In this series of unrelated, although not necessarily disjointed, short stories, Coupland notes the unresolved existence of my generation. Namely, what is it about today's generations that separates us from our parents and grandparents.As the stories unfold, Coupland comes to the realization that our generation is the first where God and Church played no visible public role in our lives. As a result he cannot help but wonder whether this has affected our generation's capacity to love, or to find meaning that goes deeper than materialism.Therefore, at its essence, this book raises some troubling questions about the meaning of life and love."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Much in a similar format to Vonnegut's 'Breakfast of Champions' Coupland writes of the &quot;Godless&quot; generation. Coping without the luxury of automatic hope. Terrific, clever and you won't want to put it down. :) Illustrations make you want to write your own journal of personal experience. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"This book is for anyone who has reached that point in their life where they question whether there is any logic to the seemingly random series of memories they have aquired thus far. The magic of this book is missed by the editorial reviews. If you read Catcher in the Rye and then grew up, it's time to read this."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Coupland is one of the greatest literary voices of Generation X, and I dont know if the boomers or their offspring will be able to appreciate the impact of coming of age in the spiritual wasteland of the ~80s. I have enjoyed all of Couplands works that I have read, and this is one of my favorites. I can still remember reading the last page of the last story, and it has probably been 10 years. Great book!"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"I am a person of strong moral upbringing, and upon stumbling across this book, my first intention was that it would be just another book to unteach religion. But I soon discovered that this &quot;life&quot; that is being discussed is precisely how the world exists.Coupland hasn't merely written blatent observations about spirituality, or even about morals or living, but about rather philosophical views of life.If one was to take the time to read and ponder the views of the author, he/she might be able to connect with that inner belief. What Coupland is trying to portray is not so much that there is a God, but that we need a God."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Honestly, I read &quot;Microserfs&quot; by Coupland and I had to kind of push myself through it; it was a lot of techincal jargon and the computer world and that really isn't something I am interested in.Life After God, however, was a pleasant surprise. Coupland writes it in diary-like format, narrative, and takes the reader around and around the &quot;life&quot; he lives. Much like &quot;Desolation Angels&quot;, or really any Kerouac book dealing with finding yourself, and then finding out the world. Try reading it sitting outside on a sunny day; that's the best way."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"This is a good book in the Coupland ouvre... well worth reading as it includes, like the rest of his writings, poignant insights. He does well to put words to thoughts and feelings that may be difficult for others to do so. It was kind of depressing in some instances, but hey, that's life"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Stepping into Douglas Couplands books is like a journey into my own mind, without the hassle. The way he brings the thoughts and feelings of his characters, and, I suspect, himself, to life is incredable to say the least. I have read this book at least 8 times, and it is a large part of how I look at the world now. The views expressed in the book mimic my own, and many of my friends so closely I could swear Douglas had known me for a lifetime. A truely inspirational book that will change your life, as it did mine"},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"I lent &quot;Life after God&quot; to a good friend that couldn't afford to buy it himself.I miss it immeasurely every day.That's just about the only comment I can make right now, I fear a lack of words if I try to praise the masterpiece &quot;Life after God&quot;. I'm sorry..."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Coupland's book is intimate like a diary and close like a friend.It doesn't tell you where it is going or what it is ment to be.It is for all those people who believe being is more than doing."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"I own both book and cassette versions of Life After God, and strongly recommend to anyone considering purchasing the cassette version &quot;Read the book first!&quot; Sometimes I would like to kick in the teeth of the person responsible for Coupland's abridgements, because they always seem to leave out the most profound bits. As to the book itself, LAG was my second tryst into Coupland's world of people so achingly familiar-dissimilar to me (having been initially sucked in by the shiny, Lego-minimalist cover of Microserfs, which I also own in cassette and dead-tree formats). Admittedly, I was unprepared for the ambience of despair and confusion, but felt the book did not suffer for it. Especially pleasant is hearing Coupland read in his soft, Canadian accent. All in all, LAG secured Douglas Coupland both the prestigious positions of &quot;Author I Would Most Like to Emulate&quot; and &quot;Author I Would Most Like to Have Dinner With&quot;. In fact, when I log off tonight, I think I'll eat some Oreos and reread LAG on the couch for awhile. ."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"The history is not the same to everybody. After the bomb, for example, we have a lot ofdifferent experiences. If the family gone, you can travel around the world, but, like Emerson saids:you're only sending ruins to the ruins. From this book, the people have to doan inner travel to know themselves. If you have a son or a cat, if you wait forsome letter (remember Laurie Anderson), you only have to imagine that, becausethe reality is not in this age, the reality is only the velocity of yourmemory. In another way, the same work, the same friend and the same food in the same Burguer King orKFC, is not the life, is only the road that you drive in your own responsability.We have to read our lives from our wishes, not from our necesity. And if we want to sleep fine,we have to run so deep, out of nightmare and dreams."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"Douglas Coupland's words and stories string together like a dream, seemingly effortlessly. Life After God is a window into the lives of realistic characters people of this generation can identify with. This book is a welcomed break from moral doctrines and &quot;objective&quot; condemnations of today's anxieties.There is no intellectual pretense to Coupland's writing. You are left feeling as if you've just come out of meditation, enlightened and refreshed."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"A small book full of stories: some related, some not. Ifelt I was eavesdropping on most of the characters butCoupland writes with such pull that I couldn't put it down.It is a quick read full of real-people-feelings andstream of consciousness. I'm heading off to the library nowto find other works by him."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"It's hard to be born after 1960 and not be touched by this book. I read this book shortly after moving to Vancouver, where this book is based, and it spoke to me like whispers into my own life."},{"Title":"Life After God","review":"The kiddish sketches and the small chapters made the book more interesting to read. I enjoyed his frank way of speaking and the array of moments in time that Coupland touched on (particularly the nuclear scene). He definitely chose good scenes and good characters and was minimally boring. The end wasn't fantastic and much less than I expected. There simply wasn't enough building up to the end he chose; every event seemed to be leading up to a different end. The irony wasn't strikingly brilliant, though. It was more like a fizz."},{"Title":"Sweetwater","review":"I have read this book years ago. I found it disrupting - how quickly you can turn to less then animal, how shallow our society can be. Now, 20 years after first reading, it is yet more actual. Worth reading."},{"Title":"Letters for the Living: Teaching Writing in a Violent Age (Refiguring English Studies)","review":"Something happened to me when I read Letters for the Living. I'm not sure what it is. I have been an adjunct, a tenure-track assistant professor, a high school teacher, and most recently a counselor in a division for troubled youths. After reading this book by Blitz and Hurlbert, I feel as though I understand my career(s) for the first time. I am doing what I can to make peace. I teach for peace. Letters for the Living is so moving, I wish it were available in every bookstore. I want to tell everyone to read this book, to appreciate the kind of friendships, experiences, and heartbreaking violence--and peace, yes--that fill the book with real power to make a difference in the lives of readers. Wonderful wonderful wonderful."},{"Title":"Letters for the Living: Teaching Writing in a Violent Age (Refiguring English Studies)","review":"Too few academic books can hold an audience of non-academics. Blitz and Hurlbert have written a book that not only holds us, but rivets our attention from the first page to the last. The stories their students tell of violence combined with the stories--letters--Blitz and Hurlbert exchange throughtout the book, make for a narrative experience every bit as gripping as a fine novel. Parents of college students, fellow teachers, and students themselves should read this book. Somehow, we are all in this story, and Blitz and Hurlbert do a remarkable job in making us examine ourselves as makers of the society where violence has forced its way into everyday life."},{"Title":"Letters for the Living: Teaching Writing in a Violent Age (Refiguring English Studies)","review":"My friend at Brown University sent me a copy of Blitz and Hurlbert's book. I let it sit around for a month or two. My son, an 11th grader, saw it sitting on the living room couch and was reading around in it. He told me it was a &quot;weird&quot; book. I understood this to mean that he liked it. Then I read it. It is a peculiar and interesting book. No. It is a fascinating, honest and compelling book. It is also an upsetting book. These two authors are so direct in their exchanges with one another, and their students are so vividly PRESENT in their own excerpted writings, I found myself almost flinching as I read. It's not a big book. I read it in one sitting, in about 2 hours and a half. But--and here's the crux of my review--I will read it again. I will reread sections of it many times. My friends will read this book. And yes, my son plans to finish it, too."},{"Title":"Letters for the Living: Teaching Writing in a Violent Age (Refiguring English Studies)","review":"The immediacy of Letters to the Living is jolting. Blitz and Hurlbert allow themselves to be caught in the act of teaching, with all of the sticky intimacy that implies. They struggle not only with how to convey the relevance of composition to students living in the real world, but with how to recompose that world through writing. Their classrooms are emptied of convention but thick with false starts, clownishness, subterfuge and magical connections. By having students author their own lives, writing becomes proactive as well as reflective.In the end, Blitz and Hurlbert teach self and other advocacy, as well as literacy."},{"Title":"Letters for the Living: Teaching Writing in a Violent Age (Refiguring English Studies)","review":"I think this is a wonderful book. My only complaint is that it should be longer so that these incredible stories from students (and from the authors) might be followed up. I wish I could know what happened to all these people. Other than that, the book is quite compelling; I read it all at one sitting---several hours very well spent. I am a high school language arts teacher, by the way."},{"Title":"Letters for the Living: Teaching Writing in a Violent Age (Refiguring English Studies)","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers. This book is one of those must-reads. As a graduate student in Composition, I especially appreciate how quotable this book is. It seems as though every page has at least one or two statements that I want to include in an article of my own! Blitz and Hurlbert manage to capture a sense of realism about teaching that should make anyone who plans a career in academia--as I do--sit up and take notice. This is a profession full of danger and responsibility. I have put this book on my exam list; my committee has approved it enthusiastically. I only hope I can produce a work like this when I am knee deep into the profession."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],G={key:0},C={key:1};function M(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=g("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",P,[(e(!0),t(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),f(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",C,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",G,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const E=d(H,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-f8765d35"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/21.md","filePath":"library/21.md"}'),L={name:"library/21.md"},j=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(E)]))}});export{D as __pageData,j as default};
