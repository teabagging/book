LeFanu, despite fame in Victorian times, has mostly fallen off the radar of modern readers. His superlative \\"Uncle Silas\\" is clear evidence as to why anyone who loves a good yarn will be immediately drawn in by his considerable gifts. This novel has a well-modulated dark atmosphere, clearly drawn and fully human characters and a superb plot.The titular Silas is the uncle of our heroine Maud Ruthyn, who becomes the ward of her mysterious uncle upon her father's death. Silas has an unsavory reputation, having once been accused of murdering a man to whom he owed a gambling debt, but he has, by the time Maud first meets him, apparently repented and found religion. She goes to his home willingly, quickly befriends his saucy daughter Milly and is, for the most part, happy in her new surroundings. The plot thickens from there, and without giving away important details, the reader should know that LeFanu lets loose with a ripping good story that ends most satisfactorily and with some wonderful twists.LeFanu is a skilled writer at the apex of his powers and an astute observer of the human condition. Some of the more telling lines exhibiting his gifts include:\\" . . . that lady has a certain spirit of opposition within her, and to disclose a small wish of any sort was generally, if it lay in her power, to prevent its accomplishment.\\"\\"Already I was sorry to lose him. So soon we begin to make a property of what pleases us.\\"\\"People grow to be friends by liking, Madame, and liking comes of itself, not by bargain.\\"\\"She had received a note from Papa. He had had the impudence to forgive HER for HIS impertinence.\\"\\"In very early youth, we do not appreciate the restraints which act upon malignity, or know how effectually fear protects us where conscience is wanting.\\"\\"One of the terrible dislocations of our habits of mind respecting the dead is that our earthly future is robbed of them, and we thrown exclusively upon retrospect.\\"\\" 'The world,' he resumed after a short pause, 'has no faith in any man's conversion; it never forgets what he was, it never believes him anything better, it is an inexorable and stupid judge.' \\"\\" . . . I had felt, in the whirl and horror of my mind, on the very point of submitting, just as nervous people are said to throw themselves over precipices through sheer dread of falling.\\"Admirers of Wilkie Collins, Thomas Hardy and, to a lesser degree, of Charles Dickens will find much to please them in the classic \\"Uncle Silas.\\""},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"This is a real rip-snorter of a gothic novel.

The evil depicted is all too human, which accounts for the story's disturbing effect. A great read."},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"\\"Uncle Silas\\" by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu is consideredone of the great Gothic novels. It is a long, longnovel of suspense- and since it is so long, it must bea record holder for sustained dread. Chapter afterchapter, you worry about poor little Maud, thebeleaguered heroine.Actually, I doubt you do. Maud isn't verycomprehensible to the modern reader. She is thedaughter of a rich estate-owner, and she will inheriteverything upon his death. The problem is that herfather frets over his ne'er-do-well younger brotherSilas. He wants to pay off Silas's debts and reformhim, but being woolenly virtuous himself, the plan hecomes up to do it is impractical and may utterlydestroy poor Maud.Not that you really care about Maud. As a Victorianheroine, she stands up to her enemies using her powerof very-good-etiquette, and hopes that her stoicpassivity will stir the heart of some passingnobleman. The most she will do in her own behalf isstamp her foot. It's hard to sympathise with a weepyfoot-stamper, particularly when imagining what anymodern heroine would do in her place: write a letterto her lawyer, call in reporters, plan an escape, orbeat the living crap out of old Silas.It doesn't matter. In early Gothic novels, you wereexpected to care about the heroes and heroines, but asthe genre evolved, the emphasis shifted to thevillains. And \\"Uncle Silas\\" has mesmerizing villains.There's the grotesque Frenchwoman Madame deRougierre, who is at turns pathetic and terrifying.There's Silas's son, who could have been a younggentleman if he hadn't been raised in bitter povertyby his father. And finally, there's Uncle Silas: youdon't know what to think of this old opium-addictedruin. Is he a victim of other people's cruelprejudice? Is he a man who got off to a poor startand was never allowed to make it up? Will Maud be ableto rehabilitate him?You can find out by reading the book."},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"(WARNING - SPOILERS!!!)The question mark refers to the word \\"misunderstood\\", not to the word \\"masterpiece\\". I don't think there is much question that \\"Uncle Silas\\" is a masterpiece. According to E. F. Bleiler, an expert on the genre, it is the greatest mystery novel of the 19th century, one of only a handful of 19th century novels that are still read purely for pleasure today. But I do think that it has been widely misunderstood.The virtually unanimous opinion on \\"Uncle Silas\\" is that it has a wonderfully Gothic and ghostly atmosphere, but no actual ghosts. I beg to differ - I think that the supernatural absolutely pervades the book in a very fundamental way. True, LeFanu never makes the supernaturalism explicit - he leaves you free to interpret the events in the novel naturalistically if you want to. But it seems clear to me that he himself had quite a different idea of what \\"Uncle Silas\\" is really all about.For instance, there is all the talk of the Swedenborgians in the first third of the novel, to the effect that we are continually surrounded and being watched by invisible presences - the souls of the dead, as well as angelic and demonic forces. LeFanu spends many pages on this sort of thing, and it is all quite pointless (except as atmosphere) if it does not directly relate to the plot in some way.The father of the heroine (Maud), Austin Ruthyn, is himself a Swedenborgian. I believe it is LeFanu's intention to suggest that, although Austin Ruthyn dies early in the book, his spirit continues to be an active force for good, protecting his daughter from the evil forces he has unwittingly subjected her to (through an ill-considered will), and possibly being instrumental in the ultimate destruction of those very forces. For example, at one point Maud hears a disembodied, unidentified voice in an empty room warning her against Uncle Silas. Another time, she enters some kind of trance state and awakens talking to her dead father, whom she seems convinced is present. Near the end of the book, in another strange trance state - indeed, seemingly possessed - she utters words of doom to her two main persecutors, Madame de la Rougierre and Uncle Silas himself, using the very words that had been spoken to her by her father in a dream. Silas' reaction to Maud's appearance in this scene is instructive. He asks her, in a terrified whisper: \\"Where do you come from?\\" - a very odd question to ask his niece, who is living in his own house. The entranced Maud whispers in response: \\"Death! Death!\\"Regarding Maud's two evil persecutors, there are numerous strong hints that they are actually demons in human form, or humans possessed by demonic forces. Maud describes Madame as \\"ghosty\\", \\"like an evil spirit in a dream\\", and has a supernatural dread of her. Indeed, Madame's movements about the house mysteriously mimic the sights and sounds of two of the house's legendary ghosts. Madame even sings a song at one point explicitly comparing herself to one of the demons that possessed the swine in Mark's gospel. As for Uncle Silas, one of the main (good) characters says of him: \\"Perhaps other souls than human are sometimes born into the world, and clothed in flesh.\\" By the end of the book, I think that every reader will agree that this description suits Silas very well.There are other examples of the supernatural to be found - such as the gypsy fortune-teller who predicts the book's climactic scene with great accuracy - but you get the idea. All of these things can be, and generally have been, taken metaphorically and/or psychologically by most readers, and LeFanu does leave that door open to us, as I said. But he was a religious man - the son of a priest and a semi-Swedenborgian himself - who definitely believed in spiritual realities. I think that, in his own mind, the events of \\"Uncle Silas\\" were not merely metaphorical, but rather reflected the workings of a hidden supernatural order. But he didn't want to insist that the reader share his own beliefs, and so kept the supernaturalism implicit (though strong). The novel is all the richer and more fascinating due to the ambiguity of LeFanu's approach.A misunderstood masterpiece (no question mark)."},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"As another reviewer said, you have to be patient to enjoy this, I think. Fairly long passages can go by seemingly without anything significant happening, but Le Fanu's writing style is very nice and definitely vintage so if you like the words you probably won't mind. It's probably true that the book could have been trimmed down by a hundred or do pages to focus on the darker, suspenseful aspects, but I don't think that melodrama was what Le Fanu was going for. He argued for it not to be classified as \\"sensationalist\\". That probably makes the book seem boring, but there are moments interspersed throughout that are very engaging and the entire latter part of the book is masterful in its anxiety and culminates in a great climax that will not disappoint. The book has sunny spots and characters, but a majority of the characters are dark and mysterious and a lot are unpleasant interactions for Maud.Not exactly a gothic novel, and not all psychological thriller, this is a book I could see being disappointed in if you came into it thinking it was overtly either. But if you drop your expectations for what you want it to be because of what you heard it is, you probably won't regret it.And everybody interested in seeing the original movie adaptation starring Jean Simmons should go over and vote for it to be released on DVD at [...] -- it only has 10 votes as I'm writing!"},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"Uncle Silas lived up to all the rave reviews I had read of it before purchasing the book. Le Fanu's characterization of the Madame was convincingly sinister and he was able to create and maintain a meanacing and forbidding atmosphere throughout the novel. The climax was startling and apropos. What can I say? I love a good gothic novel with excellent plotting and characters. I highly recommend Uncle Silas if you wish to delve into Le Fanu's novels."},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"It's hard for me to believe that this book has seventeen reviews. And that it still has such a high rating. Don't get me wrong, I loved every page of it. And the endnotes are wonderful in the Penguin edition I have. I'm also a big fan of Gothic literature, so I was surprised to find myself enjoying the book as much as I did. When it comes to the genre, I'm not ashamed to admit that I fall squarely in the Monk Lewis camp-- pile on the shocks, keep upping the ante, and don't stop 'till the credits are rolling.Uncle Silas doesn't really provide any of that. The pace is deliberate, the plot is unsurprising, and there aren't any shocks to be found. But it works. Beautifully. Why? Largely because of Le Fanu's extraordinary prose. I continually found myself re-reading passages, and still quote some of my favorites to pleasantly surprised listeners.The beauty of Le Fanu's novel, I think, is that he managed to follow the Ann Radcliffe model of the Gothic romance-- particularly with his inspired evocations of atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere-- without the anti-climactic 'revelations' that feel more like cheats to the modern reader. Uncle Silas isn't a phantasmagoric experience a la The Monk or Melmoth the Wanderer, but it is an underappreciated classic of Gothic literature, particularly in its remarkable success at turning a rather thin plot into an extended series of beautifully realized, but never overwrought, vignettes. And given the genre's reputation for poorly written overwrought-ness, that makes it a wonderful find."},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"This is the tale of Maude Ruthyn, a young heiress who, on the death of her father, becomes ward to her mysterious Uncle Silas, who lives in a decaying mansion, under a cloud of suspicion for an unsolved decades-old murder. Is Silas the villain he is popularly suspected to be? Or a decent but misunderstood man as her father had always contended?This is a lengthy, low-key novel, and hard to categorize. Is it a gothic? A romance? A thriller? A supernatural chiller? A murder mystery? If I were to call it any of these things, you might read the book eagerly looking for elements that would be a long time coming, or perhaps never come at all.So I will say only that, in order to fully enjoy this novel, you need to be willing to enter the mindset of Maude Ruthyn. And, with the possible exception of romance, Maude is not really looking for any of the above genre-elements. She's not looking for adventure; she's not hunting for spooks; she is not really trying to solve a murder. She is not a modern butt-kicking, can-do heroine. She's just a nice, somewhat-timid, kind-hearted young woman trying to cope with the loss of her father, and otherwise trying to deal with whatever hopefully small problems life throws her way. Her problems, which seem major enough to her, include various suitors (both couth and uncouth), squabbling relatives, and an unpleasant French governess.I'm sorry if that does not sound too exciting, but this novel is one best read completely \\"unspoiled\\". If you are hesitant about investing in such a long novel, then I would suggest first trying some of Le Fanu's shorter fiction, such as the stories collected under the title IN A GLASS DARKLY. The weakest story from that collection is \\"The Room in the Dragon Volant\\". I rate this novel considerably higher than \\"Dragon Volant\\", especially in terms of its final impact. But I dare say that if you have no patience for \\"Dragon Volant\\", you will have no patience for this novel either."},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"UNCLE SILAS is simultaneously J. Sheridan Le Fanu's greatest novel and also his most celebrated and widely known--which is a rare combination indeed. It is a thorough reworking of the Radcliffean mode and of the Female Gothic in general, but it is also something entirely fresh (at least, for a novel published in 1864), concerning as it does elements as diverse as Swedenborgian mysticism, Collins-esque sensationalism, and--a relative rarity for its time and genre--the first-person, retrospective narration of a young, female protagonist. A classic work of 19th century Gothic, it is also generally considered one of the first examples of the \`locked room mystery:' and it contains many motifs that have now become common stock of detective fiction and of the mystery genre in general.Written with the kind of lush and yet curiously straight-forward prose that characterizes all of Le Fanu's fiction, UNCLE SILAS concerns, for the most part, three extremely well-written characters: the first, its titular hero-villain, is an impressive revision of the Byronic hero in all its complexity of characterization and is one of the most successful of these \`stock types' in all of Gothic literature; the second, our narrator Maud Ruthyn, is fleshed out to a degree that is much more three-dimensional than the typical 'Emily St Aubert' of most of these kinds of fictions; and the third, and perhaps most remarkable of UNCLE SILAS's cast, is the insidious, revolting, and utterly outrageous Madame de la Rougierre, who is worth the price of admission in and of herself. With these characters, Le Fanu takes the familiar mechanisms of the Gothic novel and twists and turns them about into fabulously crisp and colorful new shapes that are as enjoyable and darkly fascinating today as they were to Victorian audiences one hundred and fifty years ago.The plot itself concerns the isolation of our young protagonist at the decaying rural estate of her rumour-haunted Uncle Silas after the death of her father, where she may or may not be the target of a plot that is still capable of chilling the blood. Silas, whose decades-old association with a ghastly crime which he may or may not have committed and which continues to plague him, has been entrusted with Maud's guardianship; it becomes apparent, however, that this circumstance contains more of self-interest than devotion to his late brother. Madame de la Rougierre, whose early appearance in the novel is interrupted by the shift in action from Maud's ancestral home to Silas's mini-Udolpho, Bartram-Haugh, reappears as the novel begins to plunge towards its shockingly violent climax and brings with her a final word on the mysteries of UNCLE SILAS and its brilliant and compelling expansion of Mrs. Radcliffe's tropes. I won't reveal much more in the way of story, but Le Fanu is successful in that many times we can see exactly where UNCLE SILAS is heading, and yet still we are surprised with exactly where we have wound up.I suggest reading some of Mrs. Radcliffe's fiction before taking on UNCLE SILAS, for context: though the trappings used to such success in Le Fanu's novel are so common and pervasive in Gothic fiction that one is probably aware of them without ever even having experienced them first hand: the dark mansion posing as a haunted castle and full of enigmas to be sorted through, a persecuted young woman and a scheming male anti-hero, the vicious foreigner, the vague and shadowed suggestions of a dubious \`supernatural:' these are the hallways, crypts, and secret passageways through which Le Fanu treads with adept, if foggy, reimagining. His subtle insertion of Swedenborgian axioms and the metaphysics with which they are entangled lends a unique cast to his storytelling that is distinctly Le Fanu in its breadth of consideration.Of all the foundational works of the Gothic, UNCLE SILAS remains one of the most accessible for modern audiences and one of the most intriguing. One can see its influence on everything from THE TURN OF THE SCREW to REBECCA and beyond, and it is perhaps fitting: Le Fanu's greatest novel is a variation on a theme and on an entire genre, and has itself been reimagined and reworked by modern practitioners of the Gothic school to this very day. Like Radcliffe's UDOLPHO, it has been seized by its devotees and projected onto new sets of characters and motifs that continually expand the borders of the Gothic imagination while remaining firmly linked to a central conception and credo.(From my Gothic fiction blog:[...])"},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"It's 2:20 am and I just had to get out of bed to look up the reviews on this book.

Maud's first person narration gives the text an intimacy and immediacy which makes her atmospheric musings evocative rather than laborious; the short chapters encourage serial-style reading (as the text was originally published): it's accessible and reads quickly, but is equally easy to put down for days at a time. In many ways, this is the classic gothic novel at its best, unusually accessible to a modern audience and overflowing with gothic tropes--indulgent, excessive, but maintaining a faithful atmosphere. But the novel lacks refinement, destroying frightening antagonists with exaggerated characterization, both heavy-handed and inconsistent in theme. It's almost a delight, as exaggeration well suits the gothic genre; the book is a success on the whole. But I prefer a more accomplished text, and found Uncle Silas to be fun but forgettable. I recommend it moderately; for fans of the genre, it is a fun romp."},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"Having read the other reviews of this book I expected a thrilling gothic tale of mystery and suspense. What I got was somewhat disappointing. It certainly is an intriguing story with many interesting elements to it, not the least of which is LeFanu's masterful command of the English language. However, a few serious flaws stand out and detract seriously from the novel as a whole. One is the incredible amount of detail added. Over one hundred fifty pages elapse before Maud even enters Silas's dwelling. The conclusion is quite frightening, but to get to it one must slog through four hundred pages of building to the climax. Also it seems to me that there are far to many loose ends. For example, close to the conclusion of the novel Maud is traveling in a carriage when she hears a spectral voice whisper, \\"Beware the hand of Belisarius!\\" No explanation is given, nor does Belisarius appear during any portion of the book.Despite these and other distractions, \\"Uncle Silas\\" has a truly shocking ending, worthy of Steven King. It should only be attempted by patient readers, but those who do read it through to the end will rarely forget it."},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"I was pretty excited when I came across Le Fanu's book as I had read somewhere that he was one of the originators of gothic literature. Perhaps I am not used to the pace of Victorian novels, but Le Fanu's book was too draggy for me. I am not even sure it was very suspenseful at all. Too many minor characters also spolit the book for me -- was Captain Oakley only in the novel to show off the naivety of Maud? The mystery of Uncle Silas wasn't very engaging and I was just dying to get to the end of the novel just so I could move on to other things. The ending of the book is also predictable, and Uncle Silas basically lived up to his horrible reputation."},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"This is one of my favourite books, and certainly the most outstanding &quot;Gothic&quot; I have read.

Maude is the only thing standing between the money she will inherit from her father (when she comes of age) and Silas' considerable debt.

Le Fanu's writing style is more direct and accessible and his psychological insight allows for less reliance on coincidence than, say, Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; or Radcliffe's &quot;Romance of the Forest.&quot; The characters advance the plot and the plot is riveting."},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"An interesting aspect to Le Fanu's Uncle Silas is that there is something going on outside and beyond just the leading character, Maud's, narrative focus. Her being easily agitated and frightened, which she reiterates often, lends credence to the notion that we can't take everything she sees with perfect accuracy. Is there more than meets the eye when she feels the dread and gloom at Uncle Silas', or is this just an overly active imagination? Is she really feeling or seeing the darkness of characters such as Madame or Uncle Silas, or is her anxiety getting the best of her? The reader can take a step back, and come to their own conclusions as they follow the plot. Le Fanu might not entertain and enthrall contemporary audiences like he did in his day, but his method of ambivalence and uncertainty gives the novel the Gothic, mysterious quality that can \\"get under your skin.\\" He seems to go with the idea that \\"what you don't know or see\\" is far more terrifying than what you do; subtle hints, shady pasts, eerie settings and strange characters all give the novel a creepy, suspenseful, dark feel.The basic premise of the novel is this: Maud Rhuthyn, after her father's passing, is required to live at her Uncle Silas' estate until her twenty first birthday, partly as a means to clear her uncle's name. While some, such as her aunt, are strictly opposed to Maud's going to the creepy house for such a long time, Maud is a bit undecided. Maud's only knowledge of her uncle is a portrait of him which hangs at the Rhuthyn estate. She learns that Silas has an allegedly dark and mysterious past and that he was once suspected of the murder of a man, but it was ruled a suicide. He has changed his ways, and now lives a reformed life, although there is a somber, soft-spoken manner to him that makes Maud question who he really is. After Maud's arrival, she begins to adapt to life there, but begins to see some of the questions of the past unraveled, albeit in a slow manner because she rarely gets to see him. Eventually, a villainess from the past, Madame de la Rougierre, her father's governess who was fired for stealing, resurfaces at Uncle Silas' just as the plot begins to thicken.The gloom and foreboding mood at Uncle Silas wreaks some havoc on Maud's fragile state, and there is uncertainty what is real or exaggerated. At one point, Maud is looking through the house and is terrified out of her wits to see the face of Madame de la Rougierre. She immediately tells Silas' daughter or this and considers the room haunted. Maud also wavers between being intrigued with her uncle, and having him be her source of abject terror: \\"Gentle he had been to me...but it seemed like the talk of one of those goblins of the desert...Was, then, all his kindness but a phosphoric radiance covering something colder and more awful than the grave?\\" A puzzling fear seems to permeate Maud's existence at Uncle Silas, but we only learn later what the real story is.De Fanu's novel is comparable to a Wilkie Collins mystery, although I'd say Uncle Silas has a darker feel to it. The gothic, supernatural nature is created slowly and subtlety, but nevertheless, it is there. I enjoyed this suspense, and would love to read more of De Fanu's other novels and short stories."},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"If you are looking for a fantastic gothic book, look no futher. It has every element that lovers of the genre seek: Old houses, English countryside, murder, ghosts,romance--you name it.

The only problem is that the story takes too long to really progress forward. The story is told from the point of view of Maud, the niece of Uncle Silas, but there's only a small amount of significant plot involving her until she meets Uncle Silas. Once Silas actually appears (about 150 pages into the book) along with a host of other intriguing characters, the story finally starts to gain momentum. Although he is the black sheep of the Ruthyn family because of his debts and questionable past, Silas as a decrepit, old man has apparently found religion and reformed himself. However, Silas' true motives are concealed until the shocking climax, creating much suspense as the reader tries to understand his seemingly benign actions. Bartram-Haugh, Silas' house and the surrounding areas, are portrayed as such an isolated and disreputable place that its mysteries add another layer to the suspense. The closer I got to the end, the more quickly I read through this book. You just have to be patient for the plot to build up. It's unfortunate that this excellent Gothic mystery has faded away into obscurity."},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"I really liked this one. It's a definite page-turner with a very satisfying ending. I definitely recommend reading it if you're looking for a good mystery/thriller."},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"While working my way through this book, at times I couldn't figure out what to make of it. Sometimes it had me enthralled, at others bored. I had been led to believe that LeFanu wrote horror, and Dover Publications claims \\"mystery & detective\\" on the back cover, so this further reinforced my slight confusion. I would hazard to say that Dover is in error here, as this isn't much of a detective novel, rather it's an exercise in creating a sense of hopelessness, and at this LeFanu excels. Even though at times I felt boredom - some of the minor characters tended to become mixed up in my mind - the atmosphere just builds and builds and I found my hands sweating in anticipation of the story's outcome as I read the last 60 or so pages.There are a number of reasons that I purchased this book. Firstly, I've recently discovered the Victorian novel, and have been impressed by the three novels and several short stories that I've read by Wilkie Collins, and I'd seen LeFanu's name associated with his as one of the authors whose works have become mostly forgotten to modern readers. Secondly, I've recently purchased a television anthology series on DVD from England (sadly not available in North America) entitled Mystery & Imagination, and this novel is one of the stories adapted (in 1968 by Thames Television), and I thought it'd be a good idea to read the story first. Thirdly, Amazon's price of $3.95 for a book that retails for $14.95 was just too great a temptation to pass up.For anyone who enjoys richly atmospheric novels, with just a hint of strangeness thrown in, one can't go wrong with this. I see that Dover Publications and Wordsworth Editions both publish more of his novels and short stories in reasonably-priced editions. Think I'll be giving those a go soon."},{"Title":"Uncle Silas","review":"This book is great for anyone who is a fan of Gothic, Victorian, or mystery novels.

I bought this book with a bug vaccuum and bug jar to teach him about the bugs he caught, but it mostly shows bugs that are exotic and poisonous.

I've also viewed the film. However, the book brings out more details that reach deeper than the film. I enjoyed reading how the Lord saved &amp; delivered Nora Lam and her family. I was also very encouraged by Nora's faith in what God would do for her and her family. She had tremendous faith! This is a very touching story that I would recommend to anyone. It is an excellent book that doesn't take long to read. God Bless! Happy reading! You'll be glad you did. :)"},{"Title":"China Cry","review":"This is the incredible story of Nora Lam, a woman whose unwavering faith in God has seen her through more upheavals in her life than most people ever experience.Her story spans decades and takes the reader through the invasion of China by the Japanese. The daughter of a western educated doctor, Nora saw her comfortable upper middle class life end in 1939, when at the age of seven she was forced by the Japanese to flee her home on the outskirts of Shanghai with her parents and seek refuge at the home of her step-grandmother's house in the French section of Shanghai. There they would remain for three miserable years, during which Norma was to have the first of a number of visions of a guardian angel, appearing in the guise of an old man. This guardian angel would sustain her and advise her in her hour of need throughout her life.At the age of ten, she and her parents once again fled. This time they were to travel to Chungking, in free China, where her grandfather lived. Only after a perilous journey through Japanese occupied China and after being beset by robbers along the way, were they to cross the heavily guarded border and arrive safely at their destination. In the primitive city of Chungking, which was subject to continual bombing by the Japanese, Nora was to learn many life lessons that were to hold her in good stead.Nearly four years later, in 1945, having survived the invasion of Shanghai by the Japanese and their heavy bombing of Chungking, Nora returned to Shanghai after the Japanese surrendered. There, Nora was to continue her education at a boarding school for girls. Now an impressionable fourteen years old, it was there that Nora renewed her interest in Christianity. Then, in 1949, the peace of life in Shanghai was once again disrupted for now seventeen year old Nora, when the Communist Army entered within its confines and Red Army soldiers were suddenly everywhere. The Cultural Revolution had only just begun.Nora studied hard at the university in hopes of becoming a lawyer for the state. There she met and fell in love with Lam Cheng Shen, a handsome and young legal scholar. Some time after graduation, in 1955, when she realized that she was pregnant, Nora and Cheng Shen got married. Shortly after, she and her husband were subjected to interrogations by Communist officials, as they were deemed to be suspicious because of their family connections and because of that fact that Nora had, at one time, held Christian beliefs. Moreover, as Nora's independent spirit began to chafe under the repressive and oppressive party line, she found herself in conflict with the state and sentenced to death. Her moment of truth arrived when the pregnant Nora was brought before the firing squad.What happened next is sure to make one believe in miracles. It is at that miraculous moment that life really began for Nora. She goes on to live a life that is nearly incredible in terms of its experiential breadth. It is a secular life ultimately lived in the service of God in all parts of the world. It is amazing what this young woman would go on to achieve and accomplish in her life. Notwithstanding the fact that some of her story strains credulity, hers is, indeed, an inspirational story that will make one believe in a higher power, if one does not already do so. It is surely a story worth telling.Nora Lam has gone on to establish the Nora Lam Ministries, which is based in California, and she leads evangelical crusades in China and the United States. A movie, based upon this book and having the same name, has also been made."},{"Title":"China Cry","review":"I received this book into my collection when my father passed away a few months ago. A few days ago I picked it up and decided to read it. Am I glad I did. It's falling apart now, but I plan to use some hot glue to hold the pages in the binding so I can read it again later. This book can give a person a lot of insight into the workings of God in our world today. People who think God is dead need to read this book. He is alive and well and ready to come to our aid when and where we call on Him. Christians need to read this book. Sinners need to read it. People who are luke-warm need to read it.

At a very young age her comfortable life ends and she is subjected to years of difficulty and, once she becomes a Christian, persecution.Once free she dedicates her life to helping children and one perticular event, which I won't ruin by telling you too much but it involves a ring, a group of children and a swimming pool, brought tears to my eyes.Wonderful book, wonderful woman I'd recommend it to anyone.Gail JonesAuthor of Family Secrets"},{"Title":"Merlin's Musings","review":"I've been reading Sally's column for many years, as well.

Ms. Merlins compilation of personal anecdotes and philosophical musings is truly a gift of the spirit and a must read for all writers in all disciplines. Be prepared though, to learn the business and the magic of writing along with a thing or two about yourself. Musings manages to findthe common thread of spiritual truth within the film business and artfully weaves both together in a way that shows her great respect and love for all writers. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is either embarking on a writing path or is already on one. Even non-writers will enjoy Ms. Merlin's anecdotes of Hollywood and her depth of feeling for the process of writing."},{"Title":"Merlin's Musings","review":"Sally Merlin is the essence of what it means to be a writer.In lyrical prose she sings to the very spirit of the artistic heart with a symphony of years of experience.

If you are a fan of Sally Merlin's column in Scr(i)pt magazine you are already familiar with her witty and spiritual view of the writing process. If you are not familiar with Merlin's Musings you won't be disappointed. Far from another &quot;how to,&quot; Merlin's poignant essays get right at the essence and heart of writing--the &quot;why&quot; is more important than the &quot;how.&quot; (The section entitled &quot;Magic&quot; says it all.) From memories as a child of Hollywood writers to her own experiences in the film industry, her authentic voice rings through on every page. Her own hauntingly beautiful photos compliment the prose--she could have yet another career as a photographer if she so desired.Sally's love of writing, and of writers, shines through these fifty-three columns spanning her thirty-some years in the film trade.

In one chapter/column after another, words and ideas jump off the page to affirm support, honor the creative process, throw down challenges, and remind us how fulfilling the writing process can be. \\"The ability to write is a gift, and, as such, it requires time and care to make it blossom.\\" \\"Perception is the miracle we're given each moment we notice we're still breathing.\\" \\"You must not only see the movies you write, but feel, hear, smell, and taste them.\\" We're encouraged to find the depth in our characters, craft the words that bring images alive and fine-tune moods, understand the importance of balance in a script, look inside ourselves for that authentic voice. It's daunting stuff, but it's delivered in a way that gives you a sense of excitement about going back to the script with a bit more critical eye.And underpinning it all is the heart that comes through in every piece, the love and compassion and courage that infuse these musings, whether they're about writing, selling, movies, the industry, politics, or her own \\"remarkable family of writers.\\" I believe that whether this book finds a writer who is still thinking about it, or just starting out, or has been at it for twenty years, the same message will be discovered: \\"Trust in what you know. Be brave. Welcome to the unknown.\\""},{"Title":"Merlin's Musings","review":"I learned many things from this book.

My favorite chapter there: Who Will Follow Harry and Frodo?"},{"Title":"Art & Craft of Handmade Paper","review":"I read this book in the same day I received it. It is extremely informative. The first chapter details the history of papermaking. It talks about paper not only being used as a means to record our history, but also as an art form.Chapters 2 through 4 cover the basics of papermaking. Supplies and equipment you will need, techniques to adopt, and of course the how-to of it all. Even down to creating your own watermark. It gives simple instructions for building your own molds and presses that anyone with access to a lumber yard can make. All-in-all, the art of making one's own paper seems to be quite inexpensive, and this book makes it seem like with just a little practice, one can easily become an expert.The 5th chapter seems just a little more advanced. Once you master the basics, you will be able to go through this chapter and learn how to use 3-Dimensional molds, imbedding objects (like leaves, flowers and larger fibers) into your paper, and even making a portfolio to display your work.I love this book and it has made me so excited to create my own workspace for making paper."},{"Title":"Killer on the Loose, The True Story of Serial Killer Raymond Lee Stewart","review":"First let me start by telling you that Kevin Kaiser is my brother. When we, his family found out that this book was being released, we were in a state of confusion. No one had tried to contact any of us to find out how all of this affected our family. So, needless to say, we are not big fans of Greg Kelly. Now, for my review: unfortunately, it brought back all the memories again, but for the most part it was true. Kevin was not found in a crouching position as if he had been begging for his life, he was leaning against the wall, yes he had a gunshot to his hand, a reflex action, not an action of begging. And yes he was shot 5 times, the last four after he was already dead, and yes the last one was to the face. I was at the execution of Ray Lee Stewart, and in my opinion, as well as alot of other people the S.O.B. got of to easily. We as family members, were allowed to witness this on a 19&quot; screen. This so far as been the best television show I do believe I have ever seen. Greg Kelly did a good job on this book, but I do have a piece of advice for him. Please, before you write about another families tragedies, contact them, or at least make every effort to let them know, that you are about to open up very hurtful memories."},{"Title":"Killer on the Loose, The True Story of Serial Killer Raymond Lee Stewart","review":"I saw the book featured on Court TV and decided to buy it. It is the best true crime book I have read in several years and that is all I read. Where did this guy come from? Where has he been while the other true crime authors are crannking out bad books with gory pictures? This might have been a once a lifetime thing for Kelly, but I hope not. When is he writing his next book? Because I will be the first in line to buy. Very touching, very human and very complete."},{"Title":"Killer on the Loose, The True Story of Serial Killer Raymond Lee Stewart","review":"I am a member of the Law Enforcement community where Ray Lee Stewart went on his killing spree, however I was the same age the Author was at the time of it. I have heard an awful lot about Ray Stewart and know alot of the people the author wrote about. It was a very interesting account. Most true crime books do not have the personal touch to them like Greg Kelly's. Greg lived this book. The author was also very objective in his writing. The only slam on the book I have is that I wish it was longer and told more of the story. I would have like to have learned more about the things Ray did. I would liked to have read more detailed accounts about the way Ray behaved in court and the way he behaved in jail. A definite must buy book for anyone one in the Rockford,IL area!!"},{"Title":"Killer on the Loose, The True Story of Serial Killer Raymond Lee Stewart","review":"I read the book--spellbound--in one night. It's an excellent up close and personal portrayal of a town and a boy gripped by an unprecedented series of murders...and it's completely true."},{"Title":"Killer on the Loose, The True Story of Serial Killer Raymond Lee Stewart","review":"Author Greg Kelly was 10 years old growing up in Rockford, Ill., when Ray Lee Stewart went on a weeklong killing spree that took 6 lives and shook the community's small-town midwestern roots. Like so many others in Rockford, Greg was terrified until long after Stewart's capture and haunted by his crimes for years afterwards. Fifteen years later as a young newsman working at WGN Television in Chicago, Greg called in sick so he could attend the murderer's clemency hearing. A few weeks later he witnessed the execution. Kelly's vivid description of that eerie evening is alone worth the price of the book, as are the insights into courtroom proceedings, TV reporting, and Kelly's portraits of victims' families and their suffering."},{"Title":"Killer on the Loose, The True Story of Serial Killer Raymond Lee Stewart","review":"Besides the true life drama of these events,I was particulary intrigued by the different reactions of the family members of the victims. Some wanted vengeance, some wanted to forgive, some just wanted to forget.

It is an amazing story of how serial killer Raymond Lee Stewart terrorized the towns of Rockford, IL. and Beloit, WI. and dramatically changed the live of his victim's families forever. Mr. Kelly has an interesting perspective livng through the story as a 10 year old paperboy, interviewing families of the victims and Stewart himself, then witnessing the execution as a reporter for WGN television. I highly recommend this compelling book."},{"Title":"Killer on the Loose, The True Story of Serial Killer Raymond Lee Stewart","review":"A thoughtful look at the long term effect of a killer's rampage on individuals and an entire community. The suffering of victims long after the headlines disappear is examined in the author's search to complete the story that began during his childhood. The result is a compelling story that keeps you thinking long after you read the last words. Not just a story about a serial killer-it's much more than that."},{"Title":"The Desert of Death on Three Wheels","review":"It may be difficult for us to understand why a successful investment banker from New York, chooses to risk death and danger by crossing the world's second largest desert. However, when reading Antonio Graceffo's story, everything starts to become very simple and clear why he'd to do such a thing.This is a story of one man's own challenge, to cross the Taklamakan Desert from North to South alone, although unachieved by men before. It allows us Westerners to gain insight to not only an experience we may never visit or encounter but also types of cultures and people we never imagined could still exist.What's appealing about this story by Graceffo is his writing style as being ordinary and informal with snippets of dialogue to assist you in getting the \`bigger picture'. For a less intellectual but entertaining read this is ideal. Antonio's genuine character, blatant or funny statements and honest thoughts all provide a fuller engagement with his journey.Most people love a good story of knowing how a human overcomes something serious or survives danger. This is a story of survival from the extremely high temperatures, constant dehydration and consistent physical pain. This one man isolated, travelling nature's danger zone, riding miles on a strange impossible to ride three wheeler bike is remarkable.I became so engrossed in this story, my curious self questioning can this guy really make it? Is it really possible for a human to survive such ordeal? Throughout the journey there are times when he feels as if he can't go on. By great will power and determination he becomes a hero and completes his mission.The descriptions given are detailed enough to provide great visual imagery for the reader and therefore makes the reader feel as if they were encountering the journey with Antonio also. The various types of village people which he stumbles upon his journey provide an intriguing aspect to his story. You just never know what type of person he will meet next, some of these people pretty much save his life, and some of the conversation exchanged between them helps the reader gain insight to a completely unfamiliar culture we likely don't know enough about. It's very thought provoking meeting these characters in the book because it highlights the extreme different lives we lead. e.g. the Ughyur construction foreman Antonio meets randomly while travelling across the Taklamakan. The foreman earned in a month the equivalent to what a pair of sixty US dollar boots would cost. There are many people which appear in Antonio's travels which lead very simple lives living on what we would class as nothing, some are not even aware of what a camera is? It really makes you wonder how we are all a part of the same world.I recently emailed Antonio and asked a series of questions referring to his book \\"The Desert of Death on Three Wheels\\".He is currently living in Cambodia, writing articles about families and people living in poverty. He wrote the following to me in response to one of my questions:\\"In the west we have no idea of true hopelessness and desperation. Most recently I did a story about sick people gathered in a temple where they believed the monk could cure them. They were desperate and poor and ignorant and uneducated and infecting each other. More than one thousand people living on top of each other in an area about three times the size of a football pitch.What can I say to sites like these? They sadden me. There is so much humour in a lot of my stories. But that is often my way of dealing with the sadness I saw the previous day.\\"The Desert of Death on Three Wheels also has an added bonus story, it's about his trip to Thailand, where he plays for a team in a rather interesting sport called elephant polo. I won't go into great detail of what happens, or what kind of story to expect but I can guarantee you it is an extremely funny read. Filled to the brim, of course, with Antonio's witty and comic comments in reflection of his experience. Antonio does actually raise awareness for these elephants by fighting in a boxing match. He is a boxer as well as a writer! It is clear from my response from my online interview with him, that he really does care about the places and people he visits from around the world. He has a very unstable financial income writing about poverty, wars and the corrupt governments he encounters when travelling.The Desert of Death on Three Wheels is an entertaining great story about a man who is compassionate about people and the places he visits. He converts his travel experience into a story overcoming what may seem the unobtainable. Everybody loves a good story don't we?Vanessa Hyde Nov 2005"},{"Title":"The Desert of Death on Three Wheels","review":"An honest account of an adventure through a place most people would never have even heard of. The bonus story about Antonio's participation in an Elephant polo tournament is also an interesting look at a sport generally only enjoyed by the disgustingly rich.

Tales of Ivan Belkin are something about a JOKE OF GENIUS, don't you see that? They all are about things that were important for the author in this horrible autumn, 1830, when they were written.

Lord Peter Wimsey surely deserves to be counted as one of fiction's greatest detectives, along with Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Jane Marple and Inspector Maigret. This mystery showcases Lord Peter at his finest, along with the usual cast of Bunter, Parker and Mr. Murbles (with the lamentable exception of Miss Climpson!). Lord Peter has to untangle an unusually knotty mystery where a half-million pound inheritance hangs upon an uncertain time of death. His own feelings in the case are at issue since he has been friends with the brothers who stand to gain. I also liked the deveopment of Ann Dorland's character and the very real sympathy and desire to help that Lord Peter comes to feel for her is echoed in the reader's mind. The mystery itself is intricately plotted and as usual, Ms Sayers does a fine job of pulling together all the threads for the reader. A most satisfying and absorbing read!"},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"When Lord Peter Wimsey comes down to the Bellona club to dine with an old friend he little expected to find the 90 year old General Fentiman sitting quietly by the fire in full rigor mortis. Nor, did he expect to be confronted with a case about which one of the General or his sister, Lady Dormer, predeceased the other. But, seeing that it was a matter of some half million pounds he was delighted to oblige old Mr. Murbles, the family solicitor.It turns out that establishing Fentiman's time of death is going to be a major feat. No one, including his heirs, the staff of the Bellona Club and most of London seems to recall what the General was doing that morning, or when he showed up, opened his newspaper and promptly expired. Worse, what few facts that Wimsey can put together convince him that something was very, very wrong with Fentiman's timely ticking off. Suddenly this is no longer a case of friendly detection but a serious investigation into a murder.'The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club' was one of Dorothy Sayers' early smash hits. It shows off Wimsey's charming urbanity against the gemlike setting of his friends and cohorts, only striking serious chords when grim necessity rears its monocled head. Wimsey doesn't act quite as foolish as he was prone to in past novels, which makes him likeable as well as witty. The other regular characters have also acquired some extra depth that makes everyone a bit more believable. Everyone but the bit players, of course. Each of those is, as usual, a quick, delightful pastiche, one of Sayers greatest talents.This is one of Sayers' most memorable books, and, despite a plot that is a little too transparent, is one of her most re-readable. The odd thing about a Sayers mystery story is how unimportant it is whether you know or can guess the murderer. 'Who' is less important than 'how' in these tales, and neither is as important as the balletic interaction of the players, most of whom you would like to find in your sitting room - it you had a sitting room large enough, that is.This is also the first book that displays Wimsey's softer nature with the ladies. While Marjorie Phelps is not destined to become Lord Peter's great love, we see glints of the Peter to come. He shows a fair and attentive style without a hint of macho that will serve him well in his trials to come. I am tempted to say that, if you don't enjoy this book, there is no hope for you as a Sayers fan. That's not completely true, but ' The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club' is a completely representative Sayers effort and one of my perennial favorites."},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"Lord Peter is at his best in this mystery novel which gives us 21st century dwellers a view of English post WWI culture, specifically the Men's club. In the process of untangling this convoluted mystery, Lord Peter touches on some of his own issues regarding his military service and some resulting psychological scars.Despite all this, Lord Peter chases the criminal with class, wit and ridiculous humor. He never takes himself too seriously, and is always charming--even when the stessed out subjects of investigation lash out at him.Lord Peter has two perennial sidekicks--Bunter, his perfect butler, and Parker, the police detective. Both of these men are excellent at their trade and balance Peter's ridiculously good humor with sedate and serious good sense. Peter is a brilliant intuitive which contrasts with his piercing deductive mind. Bunter has good insight into human character and Parker has dogged determination and the abilty to integrate diverse evidence.Despite the sometimes dated language, Sayers has the knack of writing an engaging and suspenseful mystery as well as taking us back in time to simpler more gracious times."},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"Among the more successful mysteries is Dorothy Sayers' &quot;The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club.&quot; A very wealthy woman dies, leaving a fortune to her brother if he is still alive, otherwise to a young female companion. When the brother is found dead in his chair at the Club, the novel becomes, not a whodunit, but a &quot;whenwasitdun,&quot; a question much on the mind of not only the heirs of the two deceased persons but of Lord Peter Wimsey, who is asked by the brother's lawyer to help establish the time of the brother's death (that of the sister being certain).The question of When is answered halfway through the novel. But even before that, the other questions of how he died and by whose hand become paramount; and Wimsey winds up offending almost everybody concerned in his inexorable quest for the solution. There is a certain tongue-in-cheek element in Sayers' writing that calls out for a good reading--and that is exactly what we get in the Audio Partner's set of 6 audio cassettes with none other than Lord Peter himself, which is to say Ian Carmichael, doing the honors.Having read the book twice in the past and watched the Acorn Media video release many times, I enjoyed listening to this tape even more, picturing in my mind the scenes from the television version, which seems to be remarkably faithful to the novel. This set is highly recommended for those who love a good mystery, well-told and (here) well read."},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"THE UNPLEASANTNESS AT THE BELLONA CLUB wasn't the best mystery novel that I've ever read, but it was certainly enjoyable enough that I didn't feel I was wasting my energy. The characters are, at times, clich&eacute;d, but I was entertained by all of them enough not to be too bothered by any lack of real substance. It's a tale of murder, deceit and money, but is told with enough whimsy to make it fully enjoyable.Despite some initial false assumptions on my part, the plot managed to keep me mostly surprised much of the time. At first glance, I thought that I was in for a fairly tedious journey, as I wasn't very far into the book when I suddenly figured out what I assumed was a large part of the mystery. Faced with the prospect of having to read through the entire rest of the story pretending not to know how the murderer had gotten away with it, I began to wonder if perhaps the remainder wouldn't be worth reading. To my great surprise, while the portion of the mystery that I figured out was fairly well signposted, it didn't turn out to be as important as I had anticipated, and I was greatly pleased that Lord Peter figured out the puzzle not long after I did. This allowed the story to turn into directions that I hadn't anticipated, and brought me back into the narrative. There are several clever little moments of storytelling that successfully managed to keep my on my toes, which is an ideal situation for any detective story.This was the first Dorothy Sayers book that I've read, and I was surprised at how much of the story was conveyed purely through the dialog. There is almost no description at all and there were times where it seemed as though I was reading a television or a film script. (Incidentally, this is probably why the series translates so well to visual mediums.) This did contribute to a feeling of triviality, but it did make the book pass by much more quickly. This is not a book to be slowly picked apart, but rather one to be enjoyed quickly, in large gulps. The fast-pace adds to the fanciful flavor and allows the story to rapidly wash over the reader.I found THE UNPLEASANTNESS AT THE BELLONA CLUB to be a fun and enjoyable, if light, detective adventure. It's a great little piece of fiction to read on a lazy afternoon, and it should be recommended to any fan of mystery novels. A short, and fairly unambitious novel, but definitely quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"This book shows the charming and dry British humor. The setting: an old austere British club in 1928. On Remembrance Day, three men are sitting down to lunch. One notices an old soldier sitting not far away. He has a newpaper in front of him and a drink to his side. He is quite dead, and so the Unpleasantness begins. Wonderful"},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"Lord Peter Wimsey has planned on spending a quiet Armistice Day, just stop by the Bellona Club, reminisce with some old friends and then a quiet memorial dinner. But since this is Lord Peter Wimsey, the aristoctratic amateur sleuth, (and this is a mystery novel) a death soon occurs. The deceased is old General Fentiman and since he is ninety his passing is rather sad but not surprising. Not at all the sort of thing to arouse Lord Peter's notice until the exact time of the old General's death becomes a matter of vital importance to his heirs, one of whom is a friend of Lord Peter.As Wimsey looks deeper into the matter he becomes involved in the art world, a jilted lover, domestic tension and even receives a proposal. Of course he unravels the mysteries in the end, bringing the guilty to justice and protecting the innocent.As always with this series the glimpses into Lord Peter's world are as entertaining as the mystery itself. We are treated to visits with Inspector Parker, Bunter, and Marjorie Phelps and if those names mean nothing to you, you would probably do better to start this series with one of the earlier books. For fans of the series this is a definite must read."},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"This is one of my three favorite novels in the Lord Peter Wimsey series (the other two are Clouds of Witness and Murder Must Advertise), and it's the best solid mystery in the series. By this point, Sayers was concocting more complicated plots involving trickier clues, issues of timing, and calculated motivations. In this book, old General Fentiman dies at a gentleman's club, but it turns out that the exact time of his death relative to the death of the wealthy Lady Dormer he'd once known, as if she died first, then he (and hence his heirs) inherit the bulk of her wealth, whereas if he died first then Ann Dorland, who's lived with Lady Dormer for several years, inherits most of the money.Wimsey, a member of the club, is asked to discreetly investigate, a situation complicated by the fact that he's friends with both of General Fentiman's heirs, and that Ann Dorland - not unexpectedly - is reluctant to contribute anything which might result in someone else receiving the money. So Wimsey is left to discover when the General died, whether anyone tried to hide this information, and who stands to gain from it. Sayers mixes in plenty of atmosphere of 1920s English civility (with a brief aside to the art culture of the time), and paints a variety of interesting and sympathetic characters. The end result is an entirely satisfying mystery."},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"This is the first Dorothy L. Sayers book that I have read, and I can guarantee that it won't be the last. If you're looking for a nice, Golden Age mystery book of quick length, crisp pacing, interesting plot, and colorful characterization, then look no further. The mystery unravels quite rapidly from the start as Lord Peter Wimsey (the foppish and wickedly intelligent protagonist) is taking-in the evening at the private Bellona Club, and a body soon turns up. The club itself is host to many characters, some suspicious, some amusing. Outside the four walls of the Bellona also exist many plots and characters that are fun to meet and get to know. Whether it was murder or natural causes is part of the mystery. And then midway through the book another mystery springs up which takes things in a somewhat different direction. Never boring for a second, this was one of those books that was hard to put down. The atmosphere is good and appropriate throughout, especially a creepy scene in a graveyard. My only qualm is with a portion of the ending, which is a little to civilized for its own good. But that's small in comparison with the rest of this enjoyable Golden Age mystery. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"For those who have heard of but never read Dorothy L. Sayers, this book would be a good start. The novel offers a glimpse of the English upper class between the World Wars. Sayers is skilled at strewing red herrings and making the reader suspect various characters. Enjoy the class consciousness and snobbishness as well as the unraveling of the mystery. Realize, also, how much more extensive vocabularies seemed to have been in the first half of the twentieth century than now, based on the author's use of language."},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"Gentlemen's clubs are a peculiar facet of British upper-class life, serving as a place of retreat from family, from the hoi-polloi, and from all women. Most of London's clubs are rather different places now, but in the 1920s they still were going strong. On the morning of Armistice day, November 11, the many veterans of the Great War who are members of the Bellona Club put poppies in their buttonholes and go outside to observe the moment of silence in remembrance of their mates who didn't come home from France. And when they return to the warmth of the clubroom -- Lord Peter Wimsey among them -- they discover the body of the very elderly General Fentimen in his armchair by the fireside. Well, he was into his nineties; one can't be too surprised, right? Only, when one of the other members goes to call the home of the general's estranged sister to alert her to her brother's death, they find that the old lady has just died, too. A macabre coincidence, right? But then the terms of the two siblings' wills become known. The wealthy sister had left everything to her brother, but if he predeceased her, then it all goes to her young female companion. And the general left all his much smaller estate to his two grandsons. Obviously, if the sister died first, the general became (for a few hours) very wealthy indeed, and the grandsons inherit it all -- but if the general died first, the grandsons get only a few thousand pounds and the companion will be set for life. It's a complicated set-up, but a fascinating one. The lawyers ask Wimsey to look into the times of death of both parties, which are proving very difficult to pin down, and he begins to suspect the general's body was tempered with. The grandsons -- one an active-duty army officer, the other a victim of post-traumatic stress (\\"shell-shock\\" in those days) who had to resign his commission and who now cannot hold a job -- obviously would benefit from delaying the general's death, and that's where the first part of the story focuses -- but, as always in a Sayers novel, there's considerably more to it than that, and Lord Peter's investigations go far afield. While the plot will definitely keep your mind engaged and the dialogue is as snappy as usual (especially Wimsey's quotation-laden conversation), the author's characterizations are somewhat more melodramatic than usual. Though I'm rather partial to Murbles the solicitor. Still, it's a good novel. And Sayers makes the most of the opportunity to get in a few jabs at gentlemen's clubs!"},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"This is one of the early Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries by Dorothy L.

You've got a corpse, difficulty over time of death and an inheritance, all in a \\"fair play\\"--all evidence laid before the reader--mystery. Go for it!For fans of the series, don't look for Harriet Vane in this one. It's Wimsey, Parker and Bunter all the way.For those looking for \\"deeper\\" meaning, the background here is WWI veterans, often disabled, trying to adapt to the peacetime world. Escapism just isn't what it used to be."},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"I've been meaning to read more Dorothy Sayers for a while; but when Susan hill mentioned it in Howards End is on the Landing, I knew that this had to be the next to read.In the years just after WWI, an old military man (a veteran of the Crimea) dies in his club. Although it would seem that he died of natural causes, Lord Peter Wimsey determines that he was murdered; and he sets out to prove not only the time of death but the manner in which the General died. At stake is money, and who will inherit it.Of her early Lord Peter mysteries, this one is undoubtedly Sayers's best. She seems to have gotten better and better with each book she wrote, and she really perfected her art with this book. She deals with not only the petty stuff, but the larger things that were going on in he world at the time; in this novel, although WWI is ten years past, it's still very much on people's minds. George and Robert Fentiman, grandsons of the General, are perfect examples of this; George has been extremely affected by experiences in the trenches, while Robert escaped untouched.Dorothy Sayers has a very subtle sense of wit; what I love about Lord Peter is his dryness. You almost have to be looking in order to find the humor in this book, but it's well-worth it when you do. We learn more about Lord Peter's experience during WWI and his relationship with Bunter, too--surely one of the most patient butlers in fiction."},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"\\"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club\\" is a reminder of just how good Dorothy L.

Did he die before or after his sister? Her will either leaves the grandsons fabulously wealthy or leaves most of the money to a young female relation, depending on when he died. Peter is asked to try to determine the death time, although everybody deplores how \\"unpleasant\\" the whole thing is - the death itself at the club, the prying into the General's business, the need for Peter to even ask members of the club questions.It's beautifully written, clever, and has a depth of characterization of even the most minor characters that makes you feel you know them. The mystery and its resolution are satisfying. Sayers never skimped on writing with a great level of detail but I've never been bored by digressions and peripheral plot lines. Peter's time spent with Marjorie Phelps is an example. Her taking him to a party does forward the plot, but by their few conversations and the meals they have together we realize the Marjorie loves Peter, he doesn't love her, yet wants to be friends. A very nice little subplot.One thing I've always liked about this book, having read it perhaps half a dozen times, is how it describes men who've been through The Great War. What they came home to, how they were expected to hide their problems, how they were so fragile after such horrific events, especially if they were at all sensitive or badly wounded. George Fentiman, grandson of the old General, is a case in point, while his brother, Robert, took pot shots at rats in the trenches, laughing all the time.Peter's own trauma from the Great War is alluded to but not gone into detail, but serious Sayers fans know that he was almost buried alive and through most of his life suffered from his nerves.All in all a very beautifully written novel. One of my favorite Peter Wimseys.I had a bit of a problem with Ian Carmichael's reading of this book. I had a hard time differentiating the characters, and only because I've read it so often was I able to figure out who was saying what among the upper-class accents."},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"When an elderly gentleman, ensconced in a winged back leather chair close up to the fire and apparently reading the \\"Times\\", is found to be dead the word for this event, occurring as it does in a respectable London club in the 1920s, is \\"unpleasantness\\". When Lord Peter Wimsey investigates further and discovers that the death is actually murder, it is still not proper, in the Bellona Club, to abandon the euphemism \\"unpleasantness\\". Thus is established the tone and the subject of Dorothy L Sayers' fifth work of detective fiction, written in 1928.Readers of \\"Golden Age\\" detective fiction will find the usual wit and polish in the writing and a central idea for a crime that derives from nice points of logic and a specialized knowledge of anatomy and medicine. Somehow these strengths, together with a preponderance of dialogue, also account for the book's weakness. It lacks atmosphere. After describing the opening scene in the Bellona Club with great care and effect, Miss Sayers rarely thereafter gives a thought to sketching in details of time, place, action or surroundings.So this is one of Dorothy L Sayers' books that will always provide me with entertainment and rich enjoyment, while making me aware that it does not quite provide everything I ask of great detective fiction."},{"Title":"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"A well written mystery.

The convoluted family argument and complex relationships make Wimsey's efforts more difficult. Halfway through the book the culprit seems to be apprehended, but Wimsey isn't so sure. I liked the model of a solution partway through the book that had to be unraveled.This book had little engagement with Wimsey's life outside of the mystery. It is a book dependent upon Wimsey entering an existing situation. The details are numerous, and we get an interesting look at a London gentlemen's club in the 1920s.

Of course, events get curious and Wimsey has to use a good bit of his cleverness to figure it all out. I certainly didn't guess who the killer was.I guess I like Wimsey because he's all competence and properness covered by quips and a bit of playing the buffoon. He's clever and but haunted.

It is history with some common sense advice mixed in. Or what should be common sense...."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I have read this book several times. This book categorizes the deaths in Yellowstone in two categories: by nature and by man. I really enjoyed reading about them because I think the book serves an important purpose (especially the section on death by nature) - to respect the park and be cautious when in it. This book serves as a great warning to the many visitors who frequent the park throughout the year. It should give visitors a healthy fear & respect of the elements of nature & of the animals in the park. I couldn't help noticing how Mr. Whittlesey kept emphasizing that Yellowstone is a wild-life environment not Disneyland. I have been to Yellowstone several times; it is my favorite national park. There are so many beautiful sights to behold and so many wild animals to see. Unfortunately, many visitors in the park act like they are there to \\"pet\\" the bears or \\"feed\\" the animals or try to get as close as possible to the animals. They are WILD and there is a reason they are wild!! It also warns the reader to be watchful while in the park and to be cautious where you step! Death by thermal pools & hot springs show us why. The respect for nature and animals must be seen as it is . . . this is nature . . . not a theme park. These are bears, bison, elk, etc. . . not dogs, cats, or birds! Sadly, if many of the victims would have respected the park for what it actually is (RAW nature), the majority of the accidents probably could have been prevented.After awhile, the book does get somewhat tedious to read but this is understandable since it was written to record ALL deaths in the park (including if 20 people died the same way). It is extremely informative. I do wish a more recent book would come out since this book is fairly old now. I did think some of the details were somewhat gory and macabre, but nonetheless, it shows what happens when men are careless or infringe on wild nature without thought of consequences. It also shows that nature is WILD and quite unpredictable (since some of the deaths in the book weren't carelessness or stupidity on the part of the person)."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"While at times the list nature of the names of the dead were tedious overall the book was an interesting tell of the foolishness of man in the great outdoors. It seems if there is a way for man to die he has accomplished it in Yellowstone."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I read this book on the way home from our family vacation in Yellowstone. It helped me understand the regulations and made me appreciate the wildness of the park. It is so well written; concise, factual yet very entertaining. I can't wait to read more of Whittlesey."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I picked up this book on a trip and could not put it down. It was amazing to read how careless some people can be and how easily they put themselves in danger. Is it smart to jump into boiling (202 degrees) water to save your dog? Can you believe people smeared honey on their children so the wild bears would lick their kids while the parents took photos? All these stories are true and will really fascinate, amaze and entertain you! People really do the strangest things and for some of the people in this book, it was the last thing they ever did. Read it! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"My girl friend bought this book our first day in the park. That night in the camper, she got it out and started reading it aloud to me. We were totally mesmerized. Fascinating accounts of accidents over the history of the park. I didn't want her to stop reading but it got so late she just couldn't stay awake. The next night we finished it. Great book to read aloud around the campfire at night. If your morbidly curious about such things (like me), I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"A wonderful compilation of death from misadventure within America's first national park. My favorite is the guy who jumped head-first into a boiling hotspring to save a dog. Suffice to say, he was cooked, and died a miserable death just a few hours later. \\"That was a stupid thing I did,\\" he said. Well, judging by this book, you're not the only one, buddy!"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"The author fills the book with lots and lots (and lots) of true incidents gleaned from court and historical records. Unfortunately, the book reads like a court document...full of facts and dry as toast. With the exception of only a few of the incidents there is very little to humanize many of the tragic incidents here. Everything is too \\"just the facts Ma'am.\\"Mr. Whittlesey does do a good job showing the ugly side when tourists meet the wild. Park visitors are to blame for many, but certainly not all, of the close encounters with nature that go awry. He also shows a large number incidents involving \\"experienced\\" park employees whose behavior can be deemed even more foolhardy than the tourists because they should certainly know better. And some instances show that even by doing everything correctly in the wilderness (running a clean camp in a designated camping area, etc) you can still have a a negative experience with the local wildlife.I still rated this book as 4 stars depite being a rather slow read because it should be read by anyone that is new to exploring the outdoors. Yellowstone is not, in the words of the author, Disneyland. Smart planning of your trips, observance of park regulations, and respect for the wilderness and it's inhabitants (aka common sense) will enhance rather than detract from your enjoyment of the natural world."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"There are other, longer reviews on this book so I'll cut to the chase:The description of deaths in hot springs, by bears and bison and falling ARE gruesome and gripping. Aside from convincing you to be very careful if you visit the park (and maybe, to not take your kids), these tales will stay with you for years. The park history interspersed through the book is also interesting.On the down side, the author feels complelled to cover all none-vehicular deaths and with 300 or so of them, that gets dull fairly quickly once you move out of the realm of deaths unique to the park. His constant defense of the park and harping on the foolishness of the victims also gets old.His writing is frequently weak and the editing is also occasionally peculiar. (For instance, I'm still wondering why he mentioned that one of the three doctors who attended a Belgian could speak French. I assume some earlier draft passed on some quote from the Belgian victim but in the published version, it's just hanging their orphaned.)Despite the 3 stars, I highly recommend the book just for the initial chapters. Just don't be disappointed if you don't finish the book."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I purchased this book out of curiousity after our trip there and was amazed, dumbfounded, and shocked. It is a bit morbid, but also an eye opener. Yellowstone is a very wonderful place, but this book really gives the details on just how dangerous it is as well. It opened my eyes to things I never imagined and of course I uttered the words,&quot;how stupid&quot; a lot.This book gave me chills and a new found respect for such a beautiful place. I thought I had respect for the park and all that is in it before, until I read this book. Now I see it differently with a lot more respect. As stated above in another review, where the guy jumps in after his friend's dog, into a hot springs, grabs hold of you and makes you shake your head, thinking, &quot;How stupid!&quot;. From there you can't help but keep reading to find out what happens next. One part that got me was the chapter about the bears. There is a story about a lady and her dog and a forest ranger. There was a bear not far from where they were and the lady wanted to let her dog run loose for awhile and the park ranger adviced her not to, she of course didn't listen and the little dog went straight for the bear and I am sure you can guess what happened next. I sat there dumbfounded and thought, &quot;Geez lady it's not like the forest ranger has no clue what he is talking about. They are there for a reason and listening would have been a good idea.&quot; There are many more storie like that and then some.This is a well laid out book, with a lot of historical facts and references. Mr. Whittlesey put a lot of work behind it and this sounds strange to say, considering how bone chilling this book is, it is a good thing he took the time to write it. This makes you stop and think about the world around you and about the people in it. In three words: Don't be stupid!"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"A fascinating book about all the people who have died in Yellowstone (excluding auto accidents and illness). It seems strange that a book about death would be fun to read, but I definitely enjoyed this one. It also gives some good examples of what NOT to do when in Yellowstone. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has been to Yellowstone or is interested in the park."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"This nonfiction work is chilling but utterly fascinating, and serves as an emphatic caution for anyone who (like me) is planning a visit to the park. It is an account of all of the known deaths in the history of the park except for car accident fatalities and deaths due to illness.The author lived and worked as a bus guide and then ranger in Yellowstone for over twenty years. He was involved in some of the incidents and knew several of the people mentioned in the book. He did a massive amount of research while writing it, and it shows. Each incident is thoroughly and impeccably documented, and Whittlesey often also provides detailed information from personal interviews with witnesses and family members.The book is organized by means of death, with each chapter focusing on one particular type.Being the unique place that it is, Yellowstone provides some unique ways to die. The book grabs the reader's attention instantly by starting right off with the strangest and most gruesome of all: by falling into one of the boiling hot pools of water for which the park is famous. I've always wondered if that has ever happened, and the answer is \\"yes.\\" At least 20 known times, and probably 21, according to the author. (Since the book was published in 1995 there has been yet another such death.) Names, ages, and details are provided for each; and two victim's stories are told in great (and extremely intense) detail. It is impossible to convey the horror and morbid fascination of these accounts, yet they are a way of honoring the dead: by recognizing them as real people and realizing the extent of their suffering. And I guarantee that the stories will make anyone who reads them really, REALLY careful when they visit the park.What's particularly surprising is that some people have actually survived falling into the hot springs. These were always people who were submerged only partially, though, such as up to their knees.Being eaten by a grizzly bear runs a close second in the most gruesome ways to die in Yellowstone. Fortunately, this has happened less often (5 times as of 1995.) Each of these deaths is related in detail.One of the most common means of death is by falling from a great height. Although that can happen many other places as well, these stories are also horrifying. Also common are fatalities due to hypothermia and drowning.One of the saddest accounts tells of a little girl who was killed by boys throwing rocks in play from the cliffs above. The worst part is that when the boys - and their parents - were confronted by the girl's parents, they showed no remorse and did not even apologize, although they were told that the rocks had inflicted a severe head injury on the child.Another unusual death was caused by toxic gas fumes that were emitted naturally from underground.The only car accident included (because it was so unusual) was when a man (with his wife as passenger) accidentally backed a car off a very high cliff. Both were killed instantly.Other means of death were: murder, suicide, lightning, earthquake, bison, eating poisonous plants, avalanches, cave-ins, falling trees, forest fires, battles (between Indians and whites in the1800's), horses, accidental shootings, diving, structural fires, stove explosions, stagecoach accidents, carbon monoxide poisoning, airplane crashes, etc. The book also contains a chapter on people who are missing (usually for unknown causes) and presumed dead.There are some great black and white photographs and drawings, often historical. (Don't worry, there are no graphic photos of corpses.) Besides an extensive bibliography and footnotes section, appendices also include maps of the three Yellowstone cemeteries and known gravesites that are located outside of the cemeteries.This is a very disturbing but excellent book for adults. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for kids or for anyone with a weak stomach.(246 pages)"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Nature does not love you. As the author says: \\"Wilderness is impersonal. It does not care whether you live or die. It does not care how much you love it.\\" (198)This is a fascinating, sobering, and at times horrifying collection of reports on how people have died in Yellowstone since 1870, two years before it was established as a National Park, up until 1994, a year before the book was published. This is an excellent companion to Mountains Without Handrails, reviewed earlier, which is concerned, as is this book indirectly, with the question of how wild and therefore how natural, primitive, dangerous, unpredictable and deadly we should allow \\"wilderness preserves\\" such as Yellowstone to remain. Over 300 deaths outside of natural deaths are described, all that have occured in Yellowstone and been reported, with the exception of automobile and snowmobile accidents, which \\"probably add another couple of hundred.\\" (195)The first death mentioned in the book took place in 1981, when a young man on unthinking instinct, trying to save a friend's dog that had jumped into a 250 degree Farenheit hotspring, dove in head first after it. When helped from the boiling pool, the man's skin was peeling off and he seemed blind, \\"as his eyes appeared totally white\\"; and as someone tried to remove a shoe \\"the skin came off with it\\". Later, rangers found near the spring \\"two large pieces of skin shaped like human hands.\\" The young man died the following morning. He had \\"third degree burns over one hundred percent of his body, including his entire head.\\" (4) Chapter one, death in hot water, is 25 pages long and the entire chapter is about ghastly deaths of this sort.The book is divided into \\"Death by Nature\\" (14 chapters) and \\"Death by Man\\" (11 chapters). There are four appendices concerning the graves at cemetaries around Yellowstone Park."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I've lived in Yellowstone Park for about 6 years now, and every summer I'm appalled how easily the tourists leave thier common sense at the gate. This should be required reading before anyone is allowed to enter. This book is as entertaining as the Darwin Awards, with a few sad twists, and some fun wild west shinanigans thrown in. Some of the accounts are far more detailed than others, as there was more research information available. It has personal meaning to me, because I frequent the cemeteries mentioned in the book, and it gives more depth to that experience. (If you're ever in the Gardiner, MT area check out Tinker Cemerery--very cool, very old. There's also one by the horse corrals at Maammoth Hot Springs, you can park there and take a short hike on the trail--it's mostly employees from the days the army was running the place.) Bottom line--this is a terrific, necessary book. If you fall or jump into a pool of boiling geyser water you will die--if you're lucky it'll be quick. The animals are wild, and most of them a hell of alot stronger and faster than you. Yellowstone is definitely worth the trip. Just, please, if you come here don't be stupid. Happy trails!"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I purchased this book in 1999 while visiting the park with my family. Whittlesey presents a candid look at the varying degrees of human stupidity and the tragic consequences. In one way, this book portrays a sad picture of the human race, with tales of people trying to ride on top of bison or swim in scalding hot springs. In a warped, twisted way, I found some of the tales amusing.Several of the stories would be great submissions to the Darwin Awards. If you're the type of person who enjoys reading such material then this book would be great for you."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I'll try not to sound gushing, but this is a great book. Well researched and documented. Academic but readable. Objective but engrossing. My wife and I picked this up in West Yellowstone, and couldn't put it down. We read it through during our stay in Yellowstone Park, and it definitely added to the experience. I have read various disaster books, but thisone sets the standard. Definitely a buy, and take it with you next summer."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Death in Yellowstone is an amazing book that documents most of the deaths that have occured in the park since its beginning. The book is divided into two parts: death by nature and death by man. As an employee of the Old Faithful Inn this past summer, I recommend this book for anyone who has visited the park or is going to do so in the future. The stories are both educating and frightening at the same time but offer valuable lessons about traveling in the park. It is amazing to me how some people could even think of walking around the thermal pools at night, go camping alone, try to tame bears or get too close to the canyon's edge!"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Death in Yellowstone is a fascinating book in parts I picked up immediately after browsing through the book in the park bookstore.The author chronicles deaths in the park since Americans have been in the area to record them. There are Indian scrapes, early explorers travails and the mundane car accidents and odd murder here and there.By far the most unique are the deaths you won't find in the local section of your paper. People have been gored by buffalo, fallen into hot pots and geysers and frozen to death in the deep snows and incredibly harsh winter conditions that still see a few hearty souls exploring the back areas of the park.Like a similar book \\"Death in the Grand Canyon\\" (which I also bought in that park's book store), this tome is interesting because of the odd and peculiar circumstances that have claimed lives in ways that could only happen in those parks.The book is well written by a park historian and is factual and sober (as opposed to sensational or morbidly obsessive). An interesting read for those who have been out there."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"This is such a fascinating book, it's hard to put down. I just picked it up again after having read it about 2 years ago and got caught up again. It is a must-read for anyone going to the park. Having lived in Yellowsone for two summers, I don't find it hard to believe some of the stories. You would not believe some of the things visitors do. There are actually many people that believe all the animals are tame or they would have them in cages. After reading these stories, I'll think carefully when in the park. We used to keep a tally of all the bison gorings each summer -- there are that many! We had about 5 my first summer plus one car was gored. Books like this are great to educate people on the dangers, not just in Yellowstone, but in all wilderness."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Tells the history of the park in a different way. Author does a great job of telling the stories and the circumstances behind each person and their death. He even notes how the park has been forced to change things because of some legal problems related to he deaths. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"This is a pretty good book. Historical and factual. I found out some interesting things I didn't know about Yellowstone Park. I've been there several times but this book has made me more aware of the dangers in the wilderness. It was worth the read."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"My dad bought this book years ago in a bookshop in the park and I read it aloud while stuck in bear jams. Really fascinating read that is still filling us with caution when we're in any national park/wilderness area more than a decade later. We still bring it up whenever we see someone doing something stupid and touristy.You have to be a little morbid, though, to enjoy it. But really, where else in the world do you have to worry about dying from falls, drowning, an array of wild animals, poisoning, boiling, noxious fumes, forest fire... and the list goes on."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Whether you plan to drive, hike, swim, fish, camp, take children, take dogs, take pictures, etc; you really should read this book before proceeding with your trip to Yellowstone State Park. A healthy dose of caution never hurt anyone. Excellent narrative, sobering facts, and a quick read. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"The author paints a picture of fatalities in Yellowstone which ,for the most part,shows the foolishness of some visitors to this beautiful national park.Whether it be animal attacks,falls,drownings,thermal scaldings or just plain carelessness Lee Whittlesey relates over 100 years of what can happen when humans don't respect the dangers of a wonderful natural environment.It is a fine historical account taken from an unusual persective.It is worth reading for those who have been to Yellowstone or are planning a trip there in the future."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I'll say at the outset that while I liked certain aspects of ''Death in Yellowstone'', it was published more than a dozen years ago and contains no updates. Anyone searching for information on recent deaths in Yellowstone will not find anything in this book. With that out of the way, I did find the book interesting although somewhat macabre.''Death in Yellowstone'' contains details on the more than 300 unexpected deaths in the park other than traffic accidents or those of natural causes. Many of the stories are very tragic, but it underscores the fact that visiting a wild, natural area contains some risks. And those risks increase if people do not pause and think about what they are doing.The most engrossing (and most detailed) deaths involve visitors who have fallen into the hot springs and other geothermal pools within Yellowstone. I found these compelling because I could almost put myself in the place of these unfortunate souls who either ventured too close to danger or, in the case of children, wandered into boiling hot pools not realizing how treacherous they are.The rest of the book covers bear attacks, lighting strikes, falls, poisonings from eating plants, burns, and even plane crashes. It may surprise readers that deaths from animal bites or attacks (usually bear or bison) are extremely rare, and drowning deaths are the most common. It's worth noting that most drowning deaths seemed to occur when a sudden storm overturned boats or caused rivers to run swiftly.The author spells out the stories in plain language. There is not much buildup to the event - he often discloses the end result up front then fills-in the story that led to someone's tragic death. While some of the stories (mostly the hot springs and bear attacks) are detailed, in many cases the author is just plucking slim details from newspaper stories published many decades ago. I got little sense of what actually happened and after awhile it was just name after name, death after death.The book is heavily footnoted and thoroughly documented, but there are very few pictures, maps, or charts. I would have also liked to have seen more details about the landscape or geography covered. I've never been to the park and had time visualizing what the scenes looked like. I'll recommend the book but only rate as 3 stars."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Book starts out great with an incredible story about a mishap in a hot spring, unfortunately most of the remaining stories of disaster are no where near as colorful. There are way to many names thrown around in the various stories for me to keep track of.Not a long read, 200pgs but after about 150 I found myself just wishing I was done with it.Great for kind of a historical document about deaths in the area, but since no maps of the area were provided it means almost nothing to me (I have never been to the park).Average book, just not great like i was hoping."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"If you are interested in the outdoors and camping in parks you will probably find this book interesting. Many typos in my edition. You can read it pretty quickly if you skim some of the sections that seem to be there just to fully document deaths in Yellowstone. Many sections just aren't that interesting, but where else are you going to find this info.One thing I was surprised to learn from this book, is that grizzlies will actually come attack and eat people. Never knew that. Always thought they just defended.I am dismayed at how park rangers seem to assume people being at fault in some of these tragedies. It seems very presumptuous. Like the cameraman bear attack, they just state he was probably too close to the bear, with out any REAL proof. Other accounts of other tragedies have this same ranger disposition."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Great book. It has been passed around to many people. I'll make a trip there to find all the cool spots of bear attacks, cooked humans, plane wrecks and other weird deaths. Book is humerous and points out people are far more stupid than you thought. Most of the deaths were from stupidity. You never put your kids on the back of of a wild 2000 lb buffalo."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK. Our family doesn't know the veracity of the other accounts narrated, but in the case of my relative, there are some inaccuracies and speculations in the text. Eyewitnesses to the accident have been available both for the initial publication and subsequent re-printings of this book; however, to our knowledge, no one has ever been contacted to provide first-hand information. Even at this date (2012) one eyewitness of the accident is still alive. Our family (who lives a couple of hours away from Yellowstone National Park so is in fairly close proximity to be interviewed) is unaware of any attempts by the author to seek out all details and provide completely researched information on what occurred.Additionally, I can't find any indication that the author researched nor took into account official U.S. publications with well-documented descriptions of the terrain and other features of the accident site that existed prior to the 1959 earthquake in Yellowstone. It is also possible some medical records may be available from Mammoth Hospital (now called Mammoth Clinic) to more completely narrate what contributed to my relative's injuries.Based on incomplete research and speculation in the text, I wouldn't be able to recommend this book as being completely factual with any level of valid scholarly research."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I read this book after my fourth visit to Yellowstone Park. It is so scary that it made me wonder how I survived four visits! Various manners of death throughout the history of the park are described in a not unnecessarily exploitative manner. I say not unnecessarily because the author includes gruesome details because he thinks it's important to shock people out of their complacency - he's trying to save lives and avoid over-regulation due to visitor carelessness. Those of us who only come to the wilderness on vacation need to be aware that when we are in a National Park, we are not in a theme park - the environment has not been sanitized for our safety. The opening chapter on death in hot springs is the most horrific in the book, in fact it's one of the most horrific things I've ever read anywhere. This is unfortunate from a literary standpoint as it makes the rest of the book somewhat anticlimactic, but it's probably the most important chapter and that's why the author put it first. The hot springs in Yellowstone are very beautiful, very deadly, and the landscape they're in is very alien to what most of us will encounter in our lives when we're not in Yellowstone so it's important to understand what can happen. I recommend this book to anyone who is planning to visit Yellowstone, even if you're not a first-time visitor, and especially if you are going to bring children."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"My husband and I purchased this book before our 3 week camping trip to the Zion, Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks in early June as I was fascinated by the reviews and subject matter described in this book. Generally I do not sleep well in tents, so I was able to read this book while trying to sleep when the temperatures reached the lower 30's in Yellowstone. Did not help me relax (!), but provided an added sense of adventure and danger....of course our experiences and wonder of the parks were excitement enough!The stories and history of the park were interesting as we explored the park each day and remembered the events described in the book that occured at some of the sites. We did observe quite a few episodes such as \\"foolhardy\\" folks who walked off of the walkways (someone with kids and a small dog walking in the Midway Geyser Basin area!), or someone who turned their back to an elk! We were shocked that people could be so foolish...Since our return home, there has been a freak thunderstorm in the Tetons causing lightning strikes to several climbers (with one death) ,a tranquilized bear attacked a hiker near Yellowstone, flash floods in Zion causing 3 hikers to be carried down 40yds, then 60yds down a river,a woman gored and tossed by a Bison when she got too close in YNP, and most recently a fatal bear attack (rare for a bear to attack multiple tents with food stored as directed) at the Soda Butte campground near the NE entrance to Yellowstone! (We had travelled to all of these areas in our trip)The danger of the beautiful wilderness is unpredictable and man's interaction with it can be disastrous. There were even reports of Grizzly bears in our campground. Many of us have positive experiences, but a certain respect for nature and common sense can help.This book was fun to read and share (i finished it when i got home to the comfort of my own bed!).I also orderedYellowstone Treasures: The Traveler's Companion to the National Parkfrom Amazon and this book was helpful in navigating our way through this beautiful park and its varied treasures...from geysers,fumaroles, paint pots,expansive green valleys, canyons, waterfalls, bison \\"jams\\", and yes, a Mama Grizzly and her cubs-were greatly apprciated and respected by these two \\"happy campers\\"! Sharing some of the stories from this book with fellow campers was kinda fun, too! Especially at night around the campfire..."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"The author has a long history with Yellowstone National Park, working initially for Yellowstone Park Company as a bus driver and tour guide in the early 1970s. He continues working in the Park today as the Yellowstone National Park historian. He has made the Park his life's work and has a great passion for it. I, too, worked for Yellowstone Park Company as a bus driver and tour guide during the 1970s. Lee describes deaths from many causes during the early days of the Park when it was administered by the United States Army all the way through the present. He gives detailed accounts of deaths that occurred while I worked in the Park although I learned from his book that the circumstances of several of the deaths were a little different from what workers in the Park heard by word of mouth. Everyone wants to hear about the deaths by bears and other large critters, but there have been only a few such instances. Many more people fell to their deaths or made spectacular exits from this life like the French lady who managed to fall over both the Upper and Lower Falls of the Yellowstone during my time in the Park. His accounts of the many drowning deaths in the Park and the tales of the few survivors of such incidents were amazing. So many of the people who went boating and canoeing in Lake Yellowstone obviously had no idea how fast a sudden summer afternoon thunderstorm could turn a placid lake into very turbulent waters. And did they have any conception of how cold the water is even at the height of summer (mid 40 degrees)? It is inconceivable to me that anyone could survive as much as twenty or thirty minutes in these frigid waters and live to tell about it. But some did and Lee tells their stories in a very entertaining way. He also describes some of the frivolous litigation brought by survivors of some very foolhardy accident victims. This is a good summer read and good prepartion for anyone planning a wilderness experience in our first national park."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"This Yellowstone cult favorite is both chilling and engrossing. Each chapter covers a different cause of death: There's death from poison gas, wildlife, tumbling over cliffs, hot springs and just about any other fatal turn one can imagine. Each death is covered in a careful, detached style that provides enough details for the reader to draw the very important conclusion that the wilderness is not always kind. Of course that, in itself, is part of its allure."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"This book details deaths in the park, from accidents in hot water to falls from thousands of feet. This book will definitely inhance your awareness of danger and pleasure in the park. Will keep you on the edge of your seat, and scare you to death at the same time.

I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"This book reminds you exactly how dangerous paradise can be. A must have for Yellowstone historians. If you like this book, you must also check out Lee's other books. At this time, I believe he is the number one authority on Yellowstone history in the world!"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Just like watching a car crash. That's how I would describe my interest in this subject. I have never been to Yellowstone, but I love nature and I am very aware of what can happen to those who are careless. This book chronicles all (and I do mean all) of the deaths that have happened in Yellowstone park since it was founded. The first chapter is about deaths due to people who have fallen into hot springs and lakes. I was horrified at the accounts of people who were careless enough to fall into one of them. Just imagine sticking your hand into a boiling pot of water on your stove. Then imagine sticking most of your body in there and you will have an idea. People actually fell into these things and managed to crawl out just to exist in pure agony until they died of dehydration from not having any skin. Another chapter which caught my attention was the one pertaining to drowning. Campers would get into a 40 degree lake in a canoe loaded with hundreds of pounds of equipment with the edge of the canoe just 4 inches above the water (a picture is included), tip over, freeze and drown. There is a particularly gruesome story about a young woman who was camping alone and attacked by a bear. They found parts of her face near her tent and the rest of her strewn for some distance.This book is extensively researched and documented. It does bog down a bit in death after death in the 1800's, and there is a body count on each page. It is morbidly fascinating and there are definitely lessons to be learned here. The author was a park ranger and steadfastly defends the park as family members of the deceased seek to blame, sue and otherwise disparage the park and its wilderness when the vast majority of deaths were inflicted due to carelessness and drunkenness. The book is very well organized and well written. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys the outdoors."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"After visiting Yellowstone for the first time in my life I wanted to know more about it. After reading this book I was first amazed at the stupid things that people have done with total disregard of the warnings posted everywhere, and in the information that is given to them at the gate. I can not imagine anyone taking their child and setting them on the back of a bison, or trying to pet a bear. I will never fish in Yellowstone Lake, or in any of the rivers even though I saw people doing that. I will never camp there. My future visits to the park will be in the day time and totally in obedience to the rules of the park. I think everyone should visit the park at least once in their life because there are wonders there that you will never see any where else....but, follow the rules people! They are there for a reason. Read this book first and you will see why."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"While we were in Yellowstone, there was a fellow in West Yellowstone who got clamped by a bear, a black bear. This guy will have quite a story to tell for the rest of his life. he got a slight bite from a black bear. He didn't get chomped or gnawed by a grizzly. His bear decided that he wasn't worth more than a taste and then moved on. Lee Whittlesey's message is clear in this book: accidents and foolhardiness do occur in America's first national park. Over 300 people have lost their lives. To use the words of the author: Yellowstone is not Disneyland; the park is raw nature ... and ... it can kill.In 1981 two buddies from California parked their truck at the Fountain Paint Pot. While the men were looking at the hot springs, the dog belonging to one of them jumped out of the truck and rushed into the Celestine Pool which has a temperature of 202 degrees. The dog began yelping. The two buddies rushed to the edge of the spring. The dog's owner began to go into the pool. A bystander yelled, \\"Don't go in there!\\" But in dove the dog's owner. The dog never survived. The owner came out of the pool blinded. \\"That was a stupid thing that I did, \\" said the dog's owner. Within a few hours he would succumb to third degree burns over 100% of his body.In 1975 a \\"savage\\" went \\"hot potting\\" near the Nez Perce Creek. A \\"savage\\" is a park employee. \\"Hot potting\\" is taking a dip into one of the park's hot springs. Some of Yellowstone's hot springs have tolerable temperatures. Unfortunately this park employee chose a pool whose temperature was 179 degrees. When his body was found, it had been *cooking* for two days.Notices around Yellowstone warn against approaching any wildlife. One fellow was attempting to show his buddy how tame the buffalo/bison were. One Saturday morning while feeding his bison, one of them inexplicably became enraged. The bison gored him and tossed him into the air. Then when he came down, it tossed him into the air again. And again.Do not feed the bears. They don't know when to quit and they get used to picnic baskets and the like. The park has relocated bears who got use to eating picnic baskets and brought in some who don't know the habit. Hikers and campers are encouraged to cover their food so that a bear does not get the scent. By all means, do not put your children on the backs of bears to have their picture taken. One fellow had his wife putting their child on the back of the bear so he could take a picture.Accidents or bad judgment? Hot springs or animals or water falls or whatever. Yellowstone is a wildland and not just Disneyland"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"My wife wasn't sure that this was a good use of my reading time. While in Yellowstone, I was able to point out the geysers where people were boiled alive, regions where grizzlies had dismembered their victims and buffaloe had gored ignorant tourists. If you enjoy reading about stuff like this, this is a good one to have...maybe just keep it to yourself while your out with the family."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Why would you want to read this book?You could be morbidly fascinated by stories of people's demises. You'll enjoy the book. Whittlesey provides a rich collection of stories, no two alike.You might enjoy reading about stupid people so that you can feel superior to them. If you like the \\"Darwin Awards,\\" about people who improve the gene pool by dying as a result of their own mind-boggling stupidity, you'll like this book. My favorite was the swan dive into the hot spring pool.You might be thinking about going to Yellowstone, and you didn't realize that it might be dangerous. Well, it might be. So is life. Whittlesey includes heart attacks, auto accidents and murders, all of which might occur anywhere. Some stories are good cautionary stories about the dangers of being unprepared in the outdoors. He also includes those stupid people I mentioned in the last paragraph.If you didn't know that bison are Very Large Animals Who Could Hurt You, you might want to read this book so that you don't fall over a waterfall.Don't play with the bears, either. I've seen people try to play with two mating bears, while two rangers chased the idiot across a hillside of fallen trees. We don't pay the rangers enough.It's hard to put this book down. I'm ashamed to admit that I read it entirely in Yellowstone bookstores, but I'm atoning for that by telling you to buy it. I wish I had bought it, so that I could read it again right now."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I picked up this book after our visit to Yellowstone. It is very factual, not sensationalistic or grizzly. The author has done a great deal of research into, as he says \\"accidents and foolhardiness\\" in the park. All of the accounts are interesting, but should be considered a must-read for visitors to Yellowstone. While Yellowstone is a \\"park\\", it is not your neighborhood park. This is nature, and along with nature comes perils. As the author details, there are about 25 different ways to die in Yellowstone, almost all preventable if you are careful and use common sense. During my trip to Yellowstone, I saw two boys around age 10, completely unattended, step off the boardwalk at Grand Prismatic Spring and literally run around the edge of the scalding sulfuric spring. Despite my family and other visitors yelling for them to step away, they paid no heed. Their parents came around a few minutes later and ushered them away from the spring - and then told them to go to the next spring! I wish I knew who they were so that I could mail them the chapters on \\"Death by Drowning\\" and \\"Death by Scalding\\"."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Given my odd sense of humor, I wasn't suprised that I liked this book. While tragic, the deaths accounted for remind us that when we're dealing with nature, we must deal with it on its own rules. The \\"pedestrians have the right-of-way\\" attitude won't cut it out there, folks! Of course some deaths were not the result of the individuals foolishness, but also by accident or bad luck."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Interesting writing and very detailed - almost too detailed.

Nurse and a wilderness medicine enthusiast, but this book interested me after several trips to Yellowstone wondering just what the actual statistics were of accidents and the surrounding circumstances. The verdict? You can't keep foolish people from being foolish. No amount of signs, guard rails, warnings, etc. will protect or deter some. Makes me feel much safer camping in Yellowstone knowing there are deadly dangers but with common sense we can still enjoy the beauty of this national treasure."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Books has intresting historical and current data regarding accidental, foolish and chance occurences resulting in death and injury to park visitors and residents.

As an NPS volunteer and frequent hiker in Yellowstone Park, which has very real hazards, I think this book will make your trip more fun and much safer"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I first bought this book before I got married and we were deciding where to Honeymoon. We were deciding between Hawaii, Yellowstone, and overseas - we ended up going to Hawaii. A few years later I finally got the opportunity to go to Yellowstone and then I returned the following year again and I hope to go back in a few years. I've only been to Hawaii once (ha, I'd rather go to Yellowstone). That said, it is extremely important to stay on marked trails and this book DRIVES this point home. The buffalo are not domesticated dogs, don't try to approach them. The book is full of mishaps, unfortunate events, falls, suicides, animal attacks, murders, and just plain stupidity. The first story (or one of the first) is about a guy jumping in a hot spring after a dog. Other people think they can win the &#34;father of the year&#34; award by trying to place their kids on top of a buffalo for a picture. Other people have been badly burned falling through the sinter by walking off trail. Recently (within a few years ago), a woman was actual badly burned ON TRAIL when she broke through to hot mud at Artists Paintpots. The landscape constantly changes and you will see steam at the side of the roads, and there are parking lots with sections blocked off because steam vents appeared under the asphault and broke through. The boardwalks are there for your safety. Stay on them. Read this book because nothing drives home the point like &#34;Stay Away From The Animals&#34; and &#34;Stay On the Boardwalks&#34; like reading about the deaths resulting from not heeding that advice."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Whenever I mention this book to anyone, they are horrified by the title. It is not a &quot;Faces of Death&quot; book of gore. Obviously, the book chronicles deaths within the Park and is therefore not exactly light reading. But, Mr. Whittlesley (the official NPS Yellowstone archivist) tells the stories of the deaths with a historian's tact. There are few - if any - people on earth that know as much about the park as Whittlesley. One version of his &quot;Yellowstone Place Names&quot; (the longer version of the one sold in tourist stores and on Amazon.com)is so comprehensive it is (only?) available on microfiche!Having lived in the Park, I know it's a very different world. (The story noted by Rhonda, another reviewer, about the bison goring a car - a Lake Lodge employee's Geo Metro in 1991 - is actually quite true.) Many of the deaths are from things you might think of - like climbing falls, eating poisonous plants, and hot pot incidents. Even as I am writing this, another Old Faithful employee died yesterday (8/22/00) in the Park after falling into Cavern Spring in Lower Geyser basin (see Idaho Statesman, 8/23/00, p.2A). But, the book is also full of deaths of the kind you find everywhere else in the world - like heart attacks, suicide, murders (yes, several!), car accidents, plane crashes (six of them - one site of which I've visited - with 20 deaths!), etc. The earliest chronicled deaths are in 1839 and continue through 1994.Some of the over 300 incidents are briefly related as the facts are slim. Others are told in great detail with quotes, newspaper stories, cemetery inscriptions and exact place names. The simple chronology takes up 5 pages, while the meat of the text takes 198 pages! If you are expecting John Grisham's spellbinding fiction and twists and conspiracy, then this book is not for you. If you want a very well told, fascinating historical look at Yellowstone from a different point of view, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"At first glance, it sounds like a morbid book. Two hundred seventy six pages about people who have died in various ways in Yellowstone National Park. In reality, it is a fascinating book with an underlying message of safety and caution in National Parks. You might expect a book which is written by an historian to have an academic tone and be full of footnotes and an extensive bibliography. &quot;Death in Yellowstone&quot; by Yellowstone National Park Historian, Lee H. Whittlesey, does have the footnotes and bibliography. It also reads like a Stephen King novel, drawing the reader to the next page. Whittlesey even used a King technique of quoting song lyrics or some other source to introduce his chapters. Even many of the footnotes and bibliography entries are annotated with additional, interesting information.The book's subtitle, &quot;Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park&quot;, sets the tone. Nearly every chronicled death in the book really is due to carelessness on the part of the deceased; or on the part of someone else.The historian's perspective gives Whittlesey the opportunity to dig into the archives of Yellowstone as well as newspaper accounts in cities in the area taking him (and the readers) back to the 1800's and the park's earliest deaths. For recent events he often spoke with &quot;primary sources&quot;, witnesses and family members.Each of the 25 chapters takes the reader to a different and bizarre way that death has occurred in Yellowstone National Park. The chapter titles, themselves, often give a light hearted and much needed break from the serious nature of the overall work. Chapter titles include: &quot;I Think I Shall Never See --Yellowstone's Deaths from Falling Trees&quot;; &quot;Malice in Wonderland --Yellowstone Murders&quot;; and &quot;The Gloom of Earthquakes --Shaky Breaky Park&quot;.The opening chapter deals with deaths by falling (or jumping) into hot springs and geysers. The first incident in the book sets the tone and the overall theme.....&quot;Don't do stupid things in Yellowstone&quot;. It is the 1981 account of David Allen Kirwan, who dove head first into the 202 degree water of Celestine Pool of the Lower Geyser Basin to save a friend's dog that had also jumped into the boiling water &lt;---YOU DID read that correctly --a witness described Kirwan's dive as a flying, swimming pool type dive. Among his final words after his friends were able to pull him from the water.....&quot;That was a stupid thing I did&quot;.In most instances, it was s &quot;stupid thing&quot; that caused a death in Yellowstone. Usually, it was because a visitor did not heed a warning, or made a conscious decision to ignore the warning. In &quot;Death in Yellowstone&quot;, Whittlesey repeats those warnings...over and over again. He also explains in fairly graphic terms the consequences of ignoring them.&quot;Death in Yellowstone&quot; may save lives. There are few history books, so entertaining and so engrossing that can claim that.The Wyoming Companion"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Having visited the park i can see how foolhardy accidents happen but don't understand why they happen since all kind of warnings are given out by rangers when entering the park and sign posted with same messages. This book goes into as much detail as could be found about various deaths in the park, geyeser, drowning, bear, bison, hiking, murder, plane accidents etc.. Its strange to be looking at a particular geyeser or steaming pool to know someone died there and how and when it happened. To see a bison walking closely by and giving proper respect for the animal only to see a father trying to put their child on the bison for a picture (saw this myself). This book will give you a different perspective about the park and help to identifiy potential dangers for foolhardy behavior."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Growing up in southeast Alaska, I've heard stories of tourists chasing a bear cub down the road near the Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau as well as a tourist getting bitten while trying to feed a sandwich to a bear. I've been yelled at by a tourist for clapping and making noise to alert bears to my presence while hiking because they were concerned they would not see a bear with all the noise I was making (well, that is the point). With my experience with how dumb tourists can be in Alaska, I was interested to find out stories of tourists and others in Yellowstone.This was a book that I had mixed feelings about. The first three chapters were the best. These chapters were on deaths from hot springs, death by park animals (except bears), and death by bears. The remaining 22 chapters range from death by poison gasses to death by vehicles. I felt these chapters while factual, were not very exciting.Overall, I found the book decently researched, but overall I found it kind of depressing. I found the first chapter on the hot springs quite horrific (especially when some of the victims were young kids like my children and a couple involved dogs that just wanted to go swimming). As I read the book, I kept thinking the victims were someone's children, spouse, SO, friends, or other loved one. With this being said, I did find the book respectful and tasteful.This is a book I think people can take a lesson from. Nature is real and while it should be enjoyed, people need to be reminded that it can be dangerous."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I picked up a copy of Whittlesey's book while on vacation in Yellowstone in July of 2000. The cover captured my attention because the day before two of my kids narrowly escaped becoming statistics.We had just entered the park through the northwest gate when, as we were driving along, we spotted our first plumes of steam. Anxious to begin exploring we eased the camper onto the side rode and drove to a parking spot, pulling off the road near a dirt trail that led to the hot spring.As usual, my kids were out of the car in a flash and dashing down the trail where they immediately set up a game of tag, darting around the edge of the boiling water. Also, as usual, I got out of the car and hollered after them to &quot;get back here and settle down.&quot; This time, though, I was a bit more concerned because as I drew near the hot spring I could see it bubbling and steam was rising off the surface. Again, I yelled after the kids to settle down, but they just ignored me and continued their game of tag.Knowing the water was probably hot I decided to test it. With calculation I quickly dipped the index finger of my right hand into the pool up to the first knuckle, withdrawing it as fast as I could. What I felt sent terror up my spine - it was the cutting pain and persistent dull ache of scalding, boiling water.My perspective changed in an instant. I no longer saw the water as a clear, sparkling, blue-green emerald, but as a death trap more dangerous than a gaping hole thousands of feet deep. Just then Jacob and Christopher flew around the corner, and darted between the pool and me. Jacob tottered but regained his balance and, with a holler of delight, and scampered quickly to escape Christopher who was in hot pursuit.Using the most authoritarian and urgent language in my vocabulary, I shouted at the kids to get away NOW! Jacob and Christopher stopped. They recognized that tone of voice and the twitch that develops in my left eye when I mean business. They moved away from the hot spring, and for the next 15 minutes endured a parental lecture on what it would mean to be dunked in boiling water. I described third degree burns over their entire bodies, flesh that comes off the bones like a boiled chicken, a scalded esophagus, blindness and certain death after languishing for hours in the hospital's burn center as parents and siblings wept in the waiting room.Being kids, they looked at me askew, doubting my warnings and admonitions while calculating the price of defiance. They obeyed, if not with reluctance, and stayed by my side as we visited the rest of (a small sampling of) the park's geothermal features. Wanting backup, however, I was immediately convinced when I read the first few pages of the first chapter in Whittlesey's book. I bought it on the spot, and read it in less than a week. The kids read it too, and finished it with a new appreciation for minding their father's warning in the wilderness.The book is divided into two parts. Part 1 talks about how people have died in the park from nature. This includes things like falling into hot springs, getting killed by wild animals (bison and bears, mostly), poisonous plants, noxious fumes from geothermal vents, lightning, falling trees, fires, etc. Part 2 describes how people have died from human-related causes such as accidents, fights, murder, getting kicked by horses, and even suicide.Prior to reading Whittlesey's book I'd established a mental picture of Yellowstone as a place that's dangerous because of bears. Bears are dangerous, of course, and must be respected, but there are lots of things in the park that are far more likely to get you killed than bears. Some of the most likely ways to die are from drowning, falling, or boiling to death.It's true that some of the book's material can be tedious - especially when it consists of lists of fatalities and related statistics. However, much of it consists of some pretty interesting stories in which Whittlesey does a respectable job of bringing together a human-interest narrative that treats the tragic end of the story - which almost always ends in human death - with a remarkable mixture of interest, dignity, and respect. I found him compassionate in the telling of particularly tragic accounts of death, and rather blunt about those that might have been a candidate for the Charles Darwin award. In spite of the subject matter, this is not a book filled with sensationalism. Neither is it a book that glosses over the gruesome facts of death. Rather, it is a book that accurately portrays the dangers within the park and the unforgiving consequences of ignoring those dangers. Sprinkled throughout the text are reminders that wilderness is dangerous, but to make it benign would be to destroy one of its essential characteristics. Yellowstone cannot, and should not, be made perfectly safe. Rather, those who visit it must respect it for what it is.Overall, this is a nice book, and it was just the ticket for a relaxing evening in the camper at the day's end. The kids loved it - they were so engrossed - and I frequently found myself in a war of wits trying to keep it hid and available for my reading pleasure. The pages are dog-eared, covered with dirt, and folded back. The spine is broken. It's one well-read book and appreciated by many people. I'm sure you will find the same enjoyment. If you are going to Yellowstone, you really must pick up this book and read it first. It literally could save your life - and it's not bad reading to boot."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Having visited the park several times, I can attest that even the seemingly most bizarre examples of death an injury found in this book happen all the time. People act as though Yellowstone is a theme park when in fact it is the wilderness - beautiful, amazing, but certainly dangerous. The park rangers at the entrances hand out literature warning visitors of the dangers, but many do not even read the materials, much less heed the advice. The last time I visited, I saw the following:1) A man climbed out onto a slippery rock at the base of an enormous waterfall, with an infant strapped to his back. His other child was scrambling over dangerous rocks to join them.2) A bear cub was rolling in the grass of a meadow, and a man got within 5 feet of the cub, trying to &quot;play&quot; with the cub. As if Mama Bear was not far behind!3) A woman stepped off the wooden pathway at the Old Faithful Geyser basin, standing on the thin, crusty earth in order to hold her hand over a steaming hot pool.4) A car abruptly swerved around a pack of bison that were walking down the road, and a large 18-wheel truck proceeded to blow his airhorn at the bison, distressing them and driving them off the road. They were travelling with calves and heading in my direction - I just prayed that they would not get upset enough to ram into my car as they attempted to get out of the road!And on and on...fortunately, I've never seen injuries or death while visiting the park, but you look at the behavior of some visitors to the park and know that they are just accidents waiting to happen. This book is engrossing because it's full of real-life accounts of what can (and does) happen when people fail to heed common sense. Do people really need to be told not to feed bears? Not to step into boiling pools of water? Not to run along dangerous paths? Sadly, the answer to these questions is yes."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I grew up near YNP. I have worked at Old Faithful Inn. I've visted the park so many times I've lost count. And during my most recent visit in Aug 05, I saw a whole assortment of tourons behaving badly. I've seen people walk up to geysers, stick their hands in hot pools, attempt to pet elk and bison, and drive like they're weaving around LA. For some reason, it never sinks in that Yellowstone is not a rocky mountain Disneyland.This book has always been one of my favorites about the park. I think it should be given out at the entrances. However, most folks don't read the pamphlets handed out in the first place. Death in Yellowstone, while morbidly entertaining, is a book that has to exist in the hopes that someone may take a lesson away from it.It is my hope that the author will put out a second edition sometime soon, as I know of a few interesting deaths that have happened not only the summer I worked there but others as well.This is a must read for anyone who loves Yellowstone."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"The last decade has seen a slew of books dealing with deaths in the national parks. The authors assure us that they publish these volumes to warn visitors of the dangers they face in the parks. The reality of course is that many in the literate public are fascinated by death, especially in unusual or exotic circumstances, and these books cater to that morbid demand. Nonetheless, they make for interesting reading and serve as a cautious reminder that visits to the wilderness, while safer than certain neighborhoods in major metropolitan areas, still contain very real hazards. This volume by Lee Whittlesey, was one of the first in this genre, and is still one of the best.From grizzly attacks to death by poisonous gasses and murders, Whittlesey exhaustively covers all known deaths in Yellowstone from before the founding of the park to 1995 when the book was published. For me the descriptions of people falling into the hot springs were by far the most riveting, and the most grusome, portions of the book. Cooked alive, the victims of these accidents rarely died quickly, but often instead lingered on for many hours, a pretty horrific way to go. Whittlesey also catalogs the many mistakes victims and some lucky survivors made to help visitors to the park avoid similar fates.One thing that sets this book apart from others in this genre is that Whittlesey, in addition to experience as a park tour guide and ranger, is a lawyer. This background shows itself in various ways. The book includes, for example, extensive discussion of court cases that resulted from fatalities in Yellowstone and how they have influenced park management. It also shows in the author's broader philosophy about the deaths in the park. True accidents, he argues, are rare. For the most part, people who have died in the parks were, he argues, actually negligent when it came to their own safety and sometimes the safety of others. This attitude towards the victims shows itself throughout the book, and most of the time Whittlesey makes a pretty convincing case.But not always. When discussing the 1986 death of William Tesinsky (by mauling from a grizzly bear) Whittlesey notes, \\"Bear 59 was a semi habituated bear, ... But she had never even approached a human aggressively.\\" This is not entirely true. I should know, because I was chased by Bear 59 on June 20 of that very year while hiking (alone) between the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River and Yellowstone Lake. Indeed, it was my report to the Lake ranger station that led to the temporary closure of that trail, and the bear's eventual relocation by the Park Service. At that time, Bear 59 had two cubs and a large person walking nearby was, as the ranger explained to me, considered a threat. But 59 no longer had the cubs with her when she killed and partially ate the unfortunate Mr. Tesinsky. No doubt, as Whittlesey says, he was too close for 59's liking while trying to get the perfect photograph. But the retelling of this story, that follows the park's official report which I saw a few years later, is interesting in that it does not mention my earlier encounter with 59. Whittlesey the lawyer argues that, much as we don't want to admit it, negligence is more common than accident. He forgot to add that humans, including park rangers, might sometimes unintentionally omit certain bits of information that do not fit their preconceived notions.(I asked a ranger about what had become of my incident report during a 1998 visit to the park. She said that it had not been included since the bear had not actually come into physical contact with me. I understand that answer, but it certainly does undermine the claim the bear had never before shown aggressive tendencies. In my case, I was unaware of her existence till I saw her charge out of the woods, two cubs at her heals, and easily 50 yards away.)"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"We picked this up on our last trip to Yellowstone. I visited when I was in the 4th grade and then again at 26. After reading the book I decided to wait until my kids were a little older for their first visit.After readind this book I was amazed at some of the dumb things people do. They leave their brains home while on vacation. I recommend this book to anyone going to or visiting Yellowstone. I was amazed on my trip at how many people go near the bison, stray from the paths or even drink from the run off of Old Faithful. Read this book and you will have a better understanding of the natural magnitude of this truly unique park."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I read this book in a few days this summer while in Yellowstone after a friend picked it up in the bookstore (I pilfered it from him and would not give it back until I was finished, despite his pleading.) Reading this book could absolutely save your life in Yellowstone (and other wilderness situations); as other reviewers have mentioned, some of the possible dangers don't truly seem life-threatening if you haven't thought about them as such.I must admit that before reading this I was hanging a bit over the hot spring boardwalks to take better pictures (I was *never* dumb or careless enough to actually step off or stick my hand in!!), but after reading the absolutely horrific accounts of death by boiling alive I was almost reluctant to even get out of the car at any springs afterwards! I learned from this book that something as seemingly-innocuous as lip balm can attract bears - I therefore spent a few sleepless nights in my tent listening for bears entering camp and waiting for them to rip into me (melodramatic, perhaps, but quite scary when you're in a tent in the middle of the wilderness.)Anyway, this book was gripping enough to keep me engrossed for days on end while in the park, and certainly gave me a refresher lesson about respecting mother nature."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I read this book on a road trip to Yellowstone and count it among one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read! Having been to Yellowstone in 1972, I remember it without all the railings and caution signs, I remember walking terrified on planks. The stories in the book show why the park is so cautious today with visitors. There is no doubt in my mind that dogs have NO business in the park at ALL, read the book to find out why!"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I bought this book while at Yellowstone and was able to go to each place (for the most part) where these accidents took place. It was wonderfully written (though sometimes a little gory) and instills a healty dose of fear about not being aware of your surroundings. Yellowstone is raw and untouched as possible from its original state. That being said, many travelers still walk around believing Yellowstone is a \\"park\\" (in the sense of an amusement park or city park as opposed to the untouched wilderness that it is). The vast majority of the deaths in Yellowstone were due to visitors' (and at times employees of Yellowstone)ignoring warnings. This book reminds you to always be aware and heed warnings. On a side note--I made friends with a Park Ranger who also believed the book was a wonderful read for visitors."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Like some of the others reviewing this book, I too worked and lived there in 1999, and saw people do things just as dumb as listed in this book, and they were lucky to have survived. I watched a co-worker (and I've got photos) go and climb Castle Geyser!As to why I think this well written, well researched, cautionary tale should be required reading (complete with quizes) is that there shouldn't be a lot of the deaths related in this book. If people would just follow the rules and not pet the bison, go hot-potting, try to get closer to the rim of the canyon. climb over barracades, because they got a dose of the reality that is our country's first national park, there may not be enough incidents to fill several more volumes.Speaking of several volumes, Mr. Whittlesey, if you read your Amazon reviews, is there any chance of a follow up? Possibly a More Death in Yellowstone?"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Very interesting, especially the chapters on hot springs and wild animals. Having never been to Yellowstone (going Sept 2005) this book really opened my eyes to the potential danger and care that should be taken in the &quot;park&quot;! Although it does seem that a lot of the deaths were a result of the person's stupidity or carelessness, I do agree with an earlier review that the author has an annoying habit of always blaming the deceased - even when there were no witnesses! The later chapters were pretty boring."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"This book should be required reading for anybody going to Yellowstone National Park. Especially if you are a parent with children. We visit Yellowstone somewhat regularly and you would not believe some of the idiocy displayed by park visitors. This book puts enough of a scare into you that you will definately think twice before doing some of those things that little voice in your head says not to do. Be warned, this book is not for the faint of heart. It tells it like it is and often times I found myself almost in tears. While some of the stories are amusing, many are flat out sad. But the stories drive home the point that you have to obey the rules, which are put in place for specific reasons. Each time we go to Yellowstone we have a safety talk with our children on what you will not be doing. After my wife read this book to us on our way up to Yellowstone in 2009 the safety talk took on new meaning. And as one reviewer has already said, we began to watch people and would comment to ourselves, \\"And then they stepped over the barrier.\\" I do highly recommend this book. Just understand that it does not pull any punches."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend to anyone interested in Yellowstone. Also, can serve as a safety book to read of the dangers before going to the park."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"We bought this book during our first family trip to Yellowstone. In the evenings after going back to the cabin I would read portions to our children. They were ages 12 and 14. It showed them that we were not just being over protective parents by telling them to stay on boardwalks, etc. It taught them that accidents really happened to people that thought they were safe to break the rules \\"just a little\\". I have loaned this book out to many friends that have made the trip - we wanted them to understand the importance of safety in the park. It is a beautiful place, if you respect it."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"We are going to yellowstone this summer so I thought this would be a good read, as sad and gross as some of it is, it was a real eye opener and I think anyone with kids should read it before they go. I will be taking a child and I will be watching him like a hawk. The book itself starts out well but it does putter out towards the end like other readers reported. Still worth a read."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"As the title suggests, many stories are recounted in detail. Some of these stories are a bit shocking, and we are reminded that the wildness of nature knows nothing about the sanctity of human life. The book would be especially interesting to prior visitors who are somewhat familiar with Yellowstone National Park."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"As anyone who spends most of the year here in Yellowstone will tell you, it's not surprising how many people have died in Yellowstone--what's surprising is how many people have survived through no intelligence of their own. Not a day goes by when we don't see complete stupidity in action: approaching wild animals as if they're in a petting zoo, sticking a hand in water to see if it really is as hot as they say or if the rising steam might just be a mirage, stopping cars in the middle of narrow winding roads, ignoring signs about not stepping off boardwalks. The list goes on and on. Last year's deaths included drownings and car accidents.Frankly, it gets damned frustrating to witness this behavior every day. So educate yourself--read this book and don't be a touron (tourist/moron). The life you save could be your own or your child's. Yellowstone can be every bit as dangerous as it is beautiful. Knowing that someone died in the hot spring you're looking at creates a level of humility, respect, and attention to detail which adds to the experience of being here.It's not great literature, but it is very interesting. After reading it, I looked back through photos I'd taken of headstones in the graveyard near the Mammoth corral and found I'd taken shots of the final homes of a couple of the more gruesome deaths covered in the book."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Saw someone reading this book while we were in Yellowstone. Got our own copy and found it quite interesting"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"This book is excellent! I've read it many times! Lee Whittlesey is one of my most favorite authors."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Had some good stories for sure. Getting lost and dying in the springs was amazing. Worth buying, but the same title for the GCNP was really amazing."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"If you have been to Yellowstone for a few days, you will love this book!"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"While the content of the book was interesting, the actual writing to deliver the content was cringe worthy and unbearable. I felt as if I was reading a report written by a C+ average 4th grader at times. I realize the level of detail necessary to draw out the story behind some of the deaths was not and could not be gotten, but the book reads like a laundry list for extended sections. While I did learn from the unfortunate mistakes and accidents of others by way of this book, I simply cannot recommend this book for any entertainment value you may be seeking from a well constructed series of sentences and/or paragraphs."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"Excellent - arrived fast. Very pleased. Description was accurate and was delivered as described"},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"I found the beginning to be very repetitive and boring. I really figured I would like this book. But I read about 1/3 of it and stopped. I guess all the deaths in the hot springs are pretty similar how they happen and what happens to the people .... but it was just getting old after the 10th or 20th similar story."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"This book seemed so interesting on the shelf...but it wasn't. Instead of telling good stories - the author just chronicles the &quot;stupid&quot; deaths in Yellowstone National Park over the years. Yes, some of these are truly astonishing, but most of them are rather unremarkable.Whittlesey loses his way and the book becomes merely a listing of the deaths. It is so exhaustive that he fails to ever go anywhere with his material.If you are looking for a comprehensive listing of foolhardy deaths in a National Park with no overarching narrative, that reads like a dictionary at times, then you've found it. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park","review":"This pales after you've read OVER THE EDGE: DEATH IN THE GRAND CANYON. A fact is given but not details. The author cannot just say someone died falling in the pool when they got got off the path and not fill in the facts. A person was killed by a bear. Where is the rest of the story? I put the book down & maybe I'll finish it, someday."},{"Title":"Over the Edge: The Growth of Homelessness in the 1980s","review":"From an economic perspective, thisis the most complete book on the homeless. Other titles worth reading are Jencks' &quot;The Homeless&quot; and O'Flaherty's &quot;Making Room.&quot; As is the case for most books on the homeless, the statistical analysis leaves something to be desired."},{"Title":"The Giants and the Joneses","review":"My girls - 5 and 8 - love this book. I read it to them three months ago and we still talk about \\"igglyplops\\" and \\"bealy\\" things. The story is compelling -- three kids in a world of giants. The giants have their own language, but kids can identify with the giant childrens' normal everyday lives. There's an imagined world, suspense, and siblings who grow to love one another -- who could ask for anything else?"},{"Title":"The Giants and the Joneses","review":"The Giants and the Joneses begins where Jack and the Beanstalk leaves off. In our time, the Giants of the land of Groil still tell the story of \\"Jack and the Beanstalk.\\" But no one really believes in the \\"Iggly Plops\\" or the Little People. No one except an eight-year old giant named Jumbeelia. Jumbeelia drops a bean over the edge of Groil and the next day she climbs down a giant beanstalk where she collects a few new toys - including the three Jones children.This is a fun story with the added challenge of a make-believe giant language to decode. (A dictionary is included.) The story does get a little scary when Jumbeelia's brother captures the Jones children and mistreats them, but this shouldn't be enough to put most children off. In addition, this story may lead readers to contemplate sibling relationships, treatment of smaller, helpless creatures, and whether there may be truth in legends."},{"Title":"The Giants and the Joneses","review":"The book Giants and the Joneses was great. I liked how the book was based on Jack and the Beanstalk. I liked how the book had its own dictionary too. I recommend this book to a lot of people. I hope she writes a sequel. I can't wait to read her other books."},{"Title":"The Giants and the Joneses","review":"This is an incredible book! I teach 2nd grade and used it to teach about context clues. The kids were mesmerized!!"},{"Title":"The Giants and the Joneses","review":"A treasure. We listened to it on tape first. Absolutely captivating, both clever and charming."},{"Title":"The Giants and the Joneses","review":"I just read this to my 7-year-old, and we both found it to be a charming tale filled with adventure, suspense, imagination, and creativity. My daughter couldn't wait to see what would happen next, and I found this to be a fabulous read-aloud that didn't bore me either. The giants' language was simply enough formatted for me to fully understand the meaning, and my daughter loved the Groilish-English Dictionary located at the back of the book; she's been busy learning their language and is becoming quite fluent from \\"bealy\\" and \\"aheesh\\" to \\"blebber\\" and \\"bimplestock\\"! The soft pencil illustrations are engaging rather than distracting, the chapters only 8-10 pages in length, and the words chosen by Ms. Donaldson enabled me to explain and enlarge my child's vocabulary without it feeling burdensome. This is a wonderful children's story that I give 5 stars to and encourage you to not only purchase it but to sit down and read it together with your own favorite 6-10 year olds! Delightful!"},{"Title":"The Giants and the Joneses","review":"My 7-year old daughter checked this book out at her school library and it quickly became her constant companion. She loved the book so much that she begged us to get her own copy of it. Not only does she like the story of little people, but the characters have their own language ('Groilish'). It has inspired her to come up with her own language ('Isabel-ish')."},{"Title":"The Giants and the Joneses","review":"I read this to my daughter aged about 6 and thought it was great - so good that I bought a second copy and am currently reading it to my school class (aged 7-8). There are short chapters and \\"silly\\" giant-language, the characters are children aged from teenage to 3 so all ages are involved, and a great plot tying it all together. Well worth it."},{"Title":"The Giants and the Joneses","review":"If you love the B.F.G by Roald dahl, if you like stories about \\"little people\\" like The Borrowers and The Littles, if you are in search of a great read aloud for your seven year old, this is the book to choose! As you know, there are no such things as giants, and the giants tell their children there are no such things as beanstalks or iggly plops. Or are there?"},{"Title":"The Giants and the Joneses","review":"This is what I wish I had known about this book before reading it to my children: After the children are abducted from their home they are subjected to various tortures which include: being almost intentionally drowned in a bath and sucked down the drain, being buried in sand up to their heads and threatened with giant insects, being juggled, being forced to eat giant hot peppers, used as crash-test-dummies in a remote control car, dangled out of windows, locked in jars with giant wasps and a pin for defence, and forced to do other things.Here's a quote: \\"This miniature girl was the perfect victim for the experiments and tortures that he could only dream of inflicting on his life-size sister. He sqeezed her more tightly as her carried her into his room. Still smiling, he zipped her up in his gym bag...\\"As an adult, I found these occurences - some of which were particularly, vividly protrayed through the eyes of the tortured children - rather upsetting and it was upsetting to my children as well.We also found the constant Groilish a little annoying at times, just wishing for some plain english.It is a well written book however but may not be enjoyable or appropriate for all children. I just found it depressing if anything."},{"Title":"The Big Book of Teen Rooms","review":"I am a 13-year old girl (I really am 13, I just didnt understand the adult reveiw system) re-doiecorating my room, and I needed a book for ideas.

I wanted something hip and current (like most teens want), but that book really wasnt that at all."},{"Title":"The Big Book of Teen Rooms","review":"I do not think that this book had a lot of crafts that many teens would like. One of the rooms was so childish and colorful that I could not imagine many teens wanting. There were a couple ideas that were okay, like table covers and lamps, but not a lot of the crafts were things i would imagine a lot of teens wanting. The title is also misleading - it's not really a big book of teen rooms - it's a small book of out-dated pre-teen rooms."},{"Title":"The Big Book of Teen Rooms","review":"I got this book to look for ideas for re-doing my 14 year-old son's room. He has not had an update since 4th grade and wanted to move beyond his &quot;cowboy cats&quot; theme. This book had several VERY DO-ABLE rooms. Each room gave you detailed instructions on how to create the different looks.

It does not waste your time but gets right to the point. You must establish SMART (specific, measurable, achieveable, related/relevant, and time framed) goals for yourself and then prioritize them using Lakein's A/C system. &quot;A&quot; goals are the most important to you and you must plan on spending 80% of your time to achieve them. &quot;C&quot; goals (TV, lawn care, shopping, etc.) are the place where most people &quot;waste&quot; their lives and spend 80% of their time. This ratio must be reversed, according to Lakein.He would agree with e.e. cummings that &quot;To be nobody but yourself in a world that is night and day trying to make you just like everybody else means to fight the hardest fight any human being can fight, and never stop fighting.&quot; Once we have set goals that utilize our unique talents and abilities, we will have the will power and determination to do the work necessary to achieve them.To accomplish our goals Lakein recommends that we make a daily &quot;to do&quot; list and always start with &quot;A's,&quot; not &quot;C's.&quot; Most of our time is spent working harder on things that don't matter. We may be efficient, but Lakein suggests that our goal is to do what matters most and become effective. &quot;Work smarter, not harder&quot; is the mantra he wants us to repeat and couple that saying with his last piece of advice --&quot;Do it now.&quot;Stick your finger into this small book and any page you hit will have wise words to put into action. Learning comes from daily practice and developing habits that &quot;put first things first,&quot; taken from Stephen Covey's best seller, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People -- also recommended is Covey's fine book on effective living appropriately titled First Things First.Rarely has a book that costs so little paid such rich dividends. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"How hard is it to write short? And to think smart? Lakein manages both in this brilliant, slim volume which goes beyond productivity tips (though great ones abound) by first guiding you to the right path for you - so your new-found efficiency will propel you down the road of most satisfaction. One of my top favorite books of all time, all subjects. I revisit it frequently, after twenty years- and it never disappoints."},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"When I got the book, I was somewhat sceptical that a book could teach me what I already knew. (Make lists of to-do items etc) But this book is really amazing. It will tell you how you end up wasting time and what to do about it in a positive way. I would like to mention a couple of ideas that I found in this book: a) No matter how silly, do something related to work with a high pay-off. b) Effectiveness (doing the important things) should be preferred over efficiency (Doing something of not much importance very well)I read this book every week and have got an additional copy to carry in my bag always to get these excellent ideas entrenched in my head."},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"The only drawback of this wonderful book is that Lakein doesn't consider the special problems of the 2 career family. This book was definitely written in the time period where men didn't have to come home and do the dishes and women stayed at home and raised the kids. He gives great tips for overcoming procrastination (my personal problem), but he leaves out one very good technique which Barbara Sher gives a solution to in her book &quot;Wishcraft&quot; - to actually schedule your avoidance behaviours. If you are going to indulge in playing on the net, emailing jokes, watching TV, reading the paper, cleaning, instead of digging into the work you should be doing, you may as well make being allowed to engage in that behaviour your reward for finishing the job you set out to do."},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"Lakein wrote an excellent book giving advice on how one can effectively manage time. From studying this book, I have learnt how to effectively use my time and live the way I want. By following Lakein's advice, one can accomplish a lot on a given day and thus be able to enjoy life.Poor management of time prevents most of us from reaching our full potential. Many conflicting demands are made on us every day. This can result in long, tiring and frustrating day arising from poor planning and people controlling our time and work. We waste time doing things that can be done in a few moments or should be ignored. All of us have the same amount of time in a given day but the difference is that those who know how to effectively use their time can achieve the most during this time. Lakein provides advice on how we can more effectively use time to achieve optimum performance. We need to avoid crises and only do things that benefit us or our organization. He advises us to live life to the maximum by doing only things that matter.Among the major time wasters are unclear objectives, failure to set priorities, failure to plan, failure to delegate, attempting to do too much at once, too many unproductive meetings, excessive paperwork, crisis management, poor scheduling, lack of self-discipline, procrastination and lack of relevant skills.I have now learnt to set clear goals as this helps me specify my destination before I begin, thus ensuring that I make the best use of my time. Without goals one becomes sidetracked easily and waste time. I make these goals operational by following Lakein's advice of making a daily \\"to-do\\" list. I take heed of the Pareto Principle that 80 percent of all that happens at work is really the result of 20 percent effort.This is recommended reading for all those who wish to learn tips of managing their time more effectively and thus lead happier, more productive and contended lives."},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"One of the best. and I do mean BEST, books on how to manage your time and life.

I believe one of the hallmarks of a good time management book is that one shouldn't have to spend a lot of time reading it. This book is brief, concise, and just about every sentence is useful. If you need to improve your time management skills start with this book.Implementing just a few of the author's ideas will make your life more relaxed and enjoyable. However, beware of attempting to implement all of his ideas at once; this is bound to overwhelm most people and you may end up quiting your attempt at time management. Instead pick the top three or four suggestions the author makes, try them out for a few months, keep the ones that work for you, then read a little bit of the book again, pick some more ideas, try them out, and so on. After some time your life will be much better off for implementing the ideas in this book that work best for you.After incorporating some of the ideas in this book into your life, I highly suggest moving on to David Allen's \\"Getting Things Done.\\""},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"There's a lot of dated stuff in the book--the author assumes you're either a housewife or a white-collar worker with a secretary who types your correspondence for you--but just ignore that and profit by the timeless techniques. The hardest and best part was setting your priorities--turns out you have to know what's most important to _you_ before you can figure out how best to spend your time. This book will help you even if the main thing you want to do with your life is build your bottlecap collection. Time management is _not_ just for corporate freakazoids in this book--unlike most of what's available now."},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"Alan Lakein's book on time management is one of the fundamentals in this field. Even though I would recommend you to also read at least one other book on time management, this book is as good as it gets. Some of the ideas that are presented here may seem a little extreme, but of course they are only ideas of how to improve the way you manage your time. The fundamental lesson is this: time is a limited resource and we can either waste it, or we can use it in a sensible manner and then enjoy the fact that we have free time on hand. In that logic, the author is presenting time in the same way in which your financial advisor would talk to you about money. It is a limited resource and in order to enjoy as much as possible of it, you need to invest it carefully.The style of the book is easy. Sometimes, however it is not immediately clear what the author is getting at, but in any case you can read the whole book in a matter of hours. Five stars are awarded to this book, as you'll find it very useful to start off with the concept of time management. It also extremely good value for money!"},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"The one thing that we all have but use differently is the 24 hour day.

The ones that use time wisely get more done and are more successful."},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"Yes it's dated and sexist, but Alan Lakein's book is still chock full of time management and procrastination advice. His advice is quick, clear, and direct in it I found numerous immediately useful techniques.I've read several other Time Management/procrastination books and Lakein's, despite its small size, really stands out. The only book I'd recommend more is Neil Fiore's \\"The Now Habit.\\""},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"To say that this book can change your life might seem like hyperbole. Yet this book teaches you to make decisions in a way that certainly can change your life. It is so much more than time management, it is a practical approach to psychology, philosophy and business. It is a well written book, to the point and interesting. There is so much in this little book that it is difficult to summarize. The Contents pages shown on this site give you a good idea of what Lakein covers so very well. This book isn't just for professional people or business people, but for everyone who wants to live a rewarding life. I highly recommend it to all my friends and employees."},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"I bought this when I was struggling to hold 18 credit hours, a part-time job and a life together and I credit it with helping me turn things around and graduate from college.

I used to be a business consultant for a large stock broker firm and I alway purchased a copy of this book for any salesperson who needed to tighten up their lost time. You can open this book at any page and learn something even after you have read it for years. I just ordered another copy after giving away my present copy.

It doesn't make any sense to say anything about time management other than what Alan Lakein has already said."},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"I believe that it is very hard to find a book which is more important than this book. This book is a must for anyone in any field who wants to achieve much more than s/he did before reading it. It may be not but is very close to the bible of time and life management. Being too far away from ideas inside this book, you will be very hard to achieve anything in your life. The time you read it will be paid off several times. Its ideas are worth reviewing several times."},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"This book has been around forever (apparently Bill Clinton mentiones it in his autobiography), but the ideas are solid, good ones. I agree with the other reviewers that it is dated, that's true, but get over it, it's still a good book. So many other \\"modern\\" approaches like Covey and Tony Robbins borrow a great deal from Alan Lakein.Well worth the money."},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"Critics will claim that this book comes off as dated, and it admittedly does, but I'd argue that the wisom within this book holds up 100%. The authors ideas are extremely pragmatic and universal, to the point that they can easily apply to any lifestyle. Give this book a chance. Read it with enthusiasm, and it will undoubtedly change the way you plan and behave in everyday life. I read it about 6 months ago and without conscious effort, I tend to apply aspects of Lakein's philosophy to my own life every single day.

I've picked up &quot;The Time Trap&quot; by Alec Mackenzie after this reading, and in comparison, this book is much more thorough. The best part about this book I think is the simple idea of prioritizing your to do list. I have started to do this and found myself to be able to get more important things done.

It builds your willpower from the way it's written. But the suggestions it offers can make a difference for those of us who are having major scheduling problems.

Many of the ideas in this book are centered on how you might manage your time in the 80s, but regardless of the technology used, the concepts are still sound.

This book SPOKE TO ME! There are 2 types of perfectionists: those who do everything, and those who do nothing.. I'm the latter. Through the straight-forward, tell-it-how-it-is approach, I felt like somebody else related to me! I've read time management books before, but it's no wonder this is a national best-seller. Honestly, I haven't read it all the way through, since it motivates me to get going, but I enjoy reading it! Also, it doesn't get old like most things do for me! That's because &quot;I&quot; get to decide what my priorities are. These last few weeks since I've found this book have been so sweet. It's not the kind of book that makes you feel you're not doing what's the most important thing (and what you WANT to do! ). Also, the swiss cheese idea really stuck to me. It says to just spend 5 min. on your A-1. There were goals I had, but never recognized them as such or gave them the attention they deserved. Just last week, I was so thrilled and felt so alive to not just worry about a particualar goal I had, but instead, to take action. Um, the BEST part (or one of the best parts! ) about this book is coming up with your A-1, A-2, A-3... goals! I had my mom do it, as I read off from the book how to, and she was so thankful. It was just amazing! This book has changed my life from the moment I picked it up. I used to feel like doing Homework and Projects and such at the very last minute, since I knew it would get done, and I'd be forced to turn it in as is. Now, I see that I've changed in such simple, but helpful ways! I actually started on a project a week before it was due! Simply amazing. My life was a constant running from one crisis to the next (all-nighters common). I'm almost dumbfounded at how NORMALIZED it is. I never knew this bliss.."},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"I first read Alan Lakein's book in 1982. I picked it up 10 years later and was amazed to see how many of the principles had become so much a part of my life I. I was living the book and hadn't even realized it until I picked it up again.One of my favorite principles in the book is to start working on something that's important to me now, even if it's for only 15 minutes. I've done this with activities/projects I originally didn't think I had time for. What I found is when it's something I really want, the momentum of just starting it builds, and I end up finding more time for it and being really happy I did.This book has helped me get in touch with what's really important to me and has helped me live a life I truly love.Thank you Alan Lakein!!"},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"This book by Lakien is the best I have read on time management.

It is essential particularly for the busy executive who wants to work smarter rather than harder. Alan Lakein offers straightforward, no nonsense advice on how to manage time more efficiently.There are many good points in this volume, and to mention all of them would require a lengthy review. A few of the most outstanding nuggets are as follows:Set priorities.Ask Lakein's question - &quot;what is the best use of my time right now?&quot;Use the Swiss cheese method to reduce intimidating tasksEmploy &quot;The Magic If.&quot;Cut off your escape route.Since I am a person who savors managing time as wisely as possible, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

What I want to add is my own personal experience using these principles. In short, they work and this brief text can really make a difference in how you manage your time and your life.I was first exposed to this book when I attended Xerox International Center for Management Development in 1988. At that time, Xerox was giving a copy of this to every marketing employee who attended their leadership training. I used the methods in this book and still do today.

While I had already been using some of the techniques Lakein recommends, he has plenty more that I hope to incorporate into my daily life.For instance, I already knew to use those free minutes that tend to crop up, such as when waiting in line -- usually by carrying a book with me at all times (I once finished a whole book when I was stuck in a three-hour traffic jam on a highway in England).But his take on to-do lists -- he recommends them but has a method of ranking each items -- is something I will try to incorporate. Also, his emphasis on breaking big tasks down into little ones, and focusing on those rather than less-consequential tasks, is a good idea.There are many more such ideas that Lakein explores simply and quickly in his book. I truly recommend this for everyone who wants to manage time more effectively.For more in-depth book reviews I've done, search for goldenrulecomics on the Squidoo.com website."},{"Title":"How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life","review":"What do you really want from life?

Other time management books. I did buy an unusual one. Published originally in German. It was so cool! Until I figured out that all your activities were supposed to be coordinated with your, ahem, biorythms. Those charts that were a fad about two million years ago. Not the medical ones now. I was not terribly delighted. I'm not sure that Edison was the first to discover electricity. It might have been the Arabs. But Lakein got time management into book form.

Lakein is considered to be the godfather of time management by the business community. His popularity was so enormous in the mid to late 1970s that he even appeared as a guest on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. The information presented is sound, in that even to this day, manycan benefit from reading this book. Indeed most of what has been written on time management since Lakein's book largely rehashes what he said.Time marches on. Lakein wrote the book at a time when the world population was a little more than half of what it is today. Understandably, he doesn't address the changing structure of the family, the problems of the two-career family, or rearing children. Also, there is little coverage of the impactof technology on the use of one's time. Lakein offers masterful tips for overcoming procrastination, but he leaves out a variety of new approaches that could make profound differences in readers' lives.

Almost every other book on time management I have seen has rehashed what was written in this book over 35 years ago.In my opinion this book still stands head and shoulders above other books of the genre because it says it all and it says it briefly without sacrificing content.Though some of the examples sound quaint I think they are still relevant to the needs of contemporary life.Some reviewers mentioned that Lakeins examples are sexist. Lakein drew his examples from his clientele which included stay at home wives, wealthy socialites, IBM, and Gloria Steinham, one of America's leading feminists.This book was mentioned in President Clinton's biography as being one of the things he read that helped him with his success.This book has been in publication for a long time.

The modern household and the roles of women in the workplace have changed dramatically in the decades since Lakein wrote this book. The men in my class LOVED the book, but we women found it to be irrelevant and, quite frankly, patronizing to women. To follow his extensive steps consistently in prioritizing life's responsibilities would take more time than actually DOING those things.

The authors avoid the easy out of blaming things on politically motivated journalists, and take a more interesting path. Sometimes what we read in the press is the result of poor reporting; sometimes it's poor science; and, on occasion it may be the reflection of a writer's personal agenda. The book tells the kinds of errors that occur (confusing correlation with causation, poor sampling, etc.)What makes the book compelling is the anecdotes used to make the points. The stories of contradictory reporting of scientific make for peculiarly amusing reading.By understanding the types of reporting problems and their causes, people can be more intelligently skeptical about what they read or hear."},{"Title":"It Ain't Necessarily So: How Media Make and Unmake the Scientific Picture of Reality","review":"There have been several books out lately about bias in the news, but they tend to focus on political bias. This book instead looks at the same concept--how news media have unwritten scripts that determine what is and what is not news, and how it is covered--but instead focuses on the reporting of research, both scientific and sociological. That's what makes this book worth reading even if you've read some others on media bias.It was interesting to read about various reports on research, how seemingly conflicting reports came into being, how reports that are on the same topic would seem to get equal coverage but don't, how research with barely detectable results ends up being reported as earth-shattering discovery, and other such topics. The examples were informative, and the authors gave some tips on how to decipher what you read in the news...how to read between the lines, so to speak.Some reviewers have dissed this book because the examples used are those which conservatives would find most satisfying to learn how media distorted research. Fortunately, most such reviewers have also acknowledged that the book is still worthy of reading due to the way it points out general methods for discerning accuracy in reporting. Still, I feel the &quot;conservative bias&quot; charge is unwarranted. Other books have documented well the powerful politically liberal scripts of mainstream news media; is it any surprise that there are so many examples of such bias in scientific reporting too? If news media carefully filter societal issues to only make their side look good, why would this not be done in reporting on research too? What I'm trying to say is, I am certain there are much more plentiful examples of this kind of thing for the conservative side. I would gladly welcome a book, though, that would reveal such shortcomings that would similarly satisfy liberals, for I simply want to know how things get distorted, whichever direction they get distorted.My ranking of this book is a 3, which is &quot;good&quot; (see About Me for a complete description of my rating policy), meaning this is a book worth reading. Its weakness is that the authors' writing style is a bit dry and sometimes they repeat their point too much, making me mutter, &quot;Okay, I get it already!&quot; But these are minor drawbacks; the book is something consumers of news should definitely read."},{"Title":"It Ain't Necessarily So: How Media Make and Unmake the Scientific Picture of Reality","review":"This is one of the most-used lies in the English language, and these authors demonstrate that another often-used whopper is &quot;Studies Show That...&quot; This book is a well-balanced and sensible expose of junk science and the misuse of &quot;facts,&quot; especially by researchers and the mass media. But the authors do not claim anti-corporate bias as the only possible explanation. They show how the demands of journalists' jobs give them incentives to be lazy, careless, and all too quick to hype dramatic bad news in place of good news that isn't so interesting. Many actual facts are cited to prove the authors' points. One of the points they make by logical argument rather than factual proof, however, may be the most important of all: the intolerable smear that a researcher's &quot;corporate funding&quot; (which is often very tenuous, exercising little or no actual control over the researcher's activities) automatically invalidates his research! This tactic is often used today (as can be seen in one of the reviews below), but the only honest approach is to question a researcher's FINDINGS, not his MOTIVES. After all, as the authors point out, journalists (and certainly political activists) have their own agendas that give them strong incentives to fudge the truth; and the fact that their motivation is not pecuniary matters little to the only important question: how much truth is in what they say. Also, many researchers DO have a sort of vested interest of their own: they know that if their studies &quot;prove&quot; that a pressing problem exists, they'll get more funding to do further studies, so they won't actually have to go out and WORK for a living! Not surprisingly, their &quot;studies&quot; tend to find terrible problems everywhere. One gets the impression that there are so many new, horrendous health hazards now that a person would have to be lucky to reach old age. So why are people living longer and longer, if there are so many health dangers lurking everywhere? Read this excellent book and you won't be so quick to believe that all the junk science hype that's being quoted everywhere actually proves what it claims to prove."},{"Title":"It Ain't Necessarily So: How Media Make and Unmake the Scientific Picture of Reality","review":"Don't believe what you read in the popular press or hear on the media - that's the lesson affirmed by the authors. They review a gaggle of cases where the reportage of some issue or event was obviously filtered, through intent or incompetance, to fit the story the author wanted to state.Rabid liberals who don't realize how far left the media has seemed to come will view this book as a subtle right-wing treatise. However, these are people who, like their reactionary counterparts, internally filter out anything that doesn't fit into their own paradigm, and they are better ignored. Nothing will help people who are too tilted in either direction, but this is not a reason to dismiss important work.In all, this should be required reading for every newspaper and television reporter and editor and journalism student, not to mention every adult who wants to think independantly."},{"Title":"It Ain't Necessarily So: How Media Make and Unmake the Scientific Picture of Reality","review":"The media has an awesome power to mold public opinion and shape policy. This book not only sets the record straight on various issues through its examples (worth the reading just for that), but shows how to become better news consumers. The research is impressive, the writing made the reading easy and the perspectives gave me a whole new view of what I am reading, seeing and hearing in the media. This is a real eye opener."},{"Title":"It Ain't Necessarily So: How Media Make and Unmake the Scientific Picture of Reality","review":"Apparently some readers above do not like to have their own delusions pointed out. Anything that contradicts their cocoon world of warped &quot;science&quot; is the result of a vast conspiracy of corporations. Actually much of the so-called &quot;science&quot; baloney that is used to justify ever greater statist depredations works to diminsh the our freedoms.The book is an excellent resource for the open minded to learn how to analyse pseudo-science. However, if you are already committed ideologically, like a number of the reviewers, to junk science justifications for having the State muck things up even more than they already are, I doubt that this book will change your mind.That is because that is how science works. Any scientist of real integrity holds all beliefs tentatively. Any conclusions are held because the preponderance of evidence to that point suggests that it is the best current explanation. But real scientists are willing and able to change that belief if further evidence develops that contradicts their original conclusions. That is the scientific method. That you will learn about. That is what should be understood.Not some dopey sophomoric myopic &quot;true belief&quot; in a politicized scare story on the environment.Read it with an open mind. You may be surprised and actually learn something of lasting value about how to analyze stories about which you may not already have a firm prejudice in place."},{"Title":"It Ain't Necessarily So: How Media Make and Unmake the Scientific Picture of Reality","review":"....until you do a bit more research using numerous sources. This enlightening book serves to open one's eyes regarding polls, statistics and claims you'll hear on the nightly news, radio and newspaper. The authors' main thrust is that people should look into and understand the *methodology* of any such research/poll claims. \\"Be skeptical,\\" in other words. Peer review of statistical/research claims should be evident in order for any such claims to hold some validity. Various case studies are used throughout the book -- the \\"rise\\" of rates of infectious diseases, spouse \\"abuse,\\" education \\"results,\\" the environment, racial issues and \\"poverty,\\" just to name a few. Probably the most interesting chapter is the one on polls. The authors meticulously demonstrate that the mere *wording* of a poll can produce results that no one in their right mind would expect. (For example, a poll about the Holocaust that was worded with double negatives \\"revealed\\" that an astounding number of folk doubted the Nazi extermination policy.) So, when you see those latest Gallup results, be sure to check out the poll's questions!"},{"Title":"It Ain't Necessarily So: How Media Make and Unmake the Scientific Picture of Reality","review":"PROS: Reminds people (over and over again) to be skeptical.

The first two pages of each chapter was all I needed to get the point. The rest is just details.CONCLUSION: For those who love the details of how the media can mislead the public, this is a great book.

(They ignored, quite properly, electronic \\"journalism.\\") Many stories were covered (in their view) adequately in one sheet and deplorably carelessly in another; and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was as likely to outperform The Washington Post as the other way around on a particular story.The book is arranged in chapters of case studies, each chapter illustrating a different way news supposedly based on science can be misreported.Topics include why worthy stories sometimes get little attention, why news mountains are heaped up out of research molehills, how statistics can be cooked, the pitfalls of surveys and of drawing conclusions by measuring proxies rather than the real thing, and various statistical alarums and excursions.Their orientation is that the situation is not nearly as gloomy as we have been led to think.\\"What if,\\" they ask, \\"the magnitude of our daily dangers has been considerably overblown? What if, in fact, neither the underlying science nor the overlying headline . . . was quite what it seemed to be?\\"Murray is director of the Statistical Assessment Service in Washington, D.C.; Schwartz is a senior adjunct fellow at the Hudson Institute; and Lichter is president of the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington.Although their studies are of how news was covered, their method has the effect of also presenting evidence debunking various stories. (It is essential to read the endnotes, which make up nearly a fifth of the book and contain important details not in the main text.)Most of these doused stories are what might be called green panics: silicone breast implants, electromagnetic field poisoning, etc. Other stories having their significance devalued here are leftish ideas, such as that minorities are discriminated against in getting mortgage loans or that poverty is a cause of elevated infant mortality.There was room for a postscript (but there is none) considering whether they chose their examples because a) they had another agenda besides the stated one; or, b) editors run a lot more dubious panic stories from the left than from the right.I'd put my money on b if I had to guess.Anyhow, their analysis of what kinds of misreports were made is solid, and their understanding of the pressures on reporters is profound.\\"Despite our criticism,\\" they write, \\"we nevertheless have an abiding respect for the journalists who serve us in a vital capacity.\\"True enough, people who don't get their science filtered through reporters are not going to get any science in their intellectual diet at all."},{"Title":"It Ain't Necessarily So: How Media Make and Unmake the Scientific Picture of Reality","review":"The book is very informative, and fairly concise, which is probably my only criticism of it.

And, these &quot;reviews&quot; are from the usual suspects (places): Cambridge, San Jose and other bastions of leftist university cant.Well, as a person with a BS in math and both as MA and Ph.D in psych--the authors are dead-on in the misues of stat by both the media and the junk scientists the media are so fond of.Try not to present your thinly-disguised PC/Leftist ideology as a &quot;review.&quot; It is but a knee-jerk reaction to the cognitive dissonance produced when the truth invades your little world.

In particular, issues that are dealt with include, but are not limited to, misuse of statistics, exaggeration of minor facts, weaknesses and misinterpretations of surveys, possible motives to deliberately mislead, etc. I must agree with some prior reviewers that the book does contain a certain amount of repetition. Although some of these replications appear to have been made to cast a somewhat different slant on a given issue, they have been a bit overdone.Some books on this topic tend to be rather light-hearted and even humorous and are likely aimed at a very bread readership. This one, on the other hand, has a much more serious tone and, as a result, may be most appealing to the more seriously interested readers. The writing style is authoritative, focussed, scholarly but, at times, rather dry. As pointed out above, the occasional repetition that it contains has already proven annoying to some readers."},{"Title":"It Ain't Necessarily So: How Media Make and Unmake the Scientific Picture of Reality","review":"Lately there have been some books on grammar that have been international bestsellers. Makes sense to me, because lot's of people stuggle with grammar but are afraid to admit it. On that same line of reasoning, this is a \\"sleeper\\" book that ought to be bestseller. In America almost every day we are bombarded with statistics that allege to explain to us the state of the world around us. Sometimes these statitistics prompt us, either as individuals or a nation, to take immediate and sometimes drastic action. Billboards that tell us \\"1 in 4 Children are Overweight\\" attract the attention of even our top policy makers in Washington, prompting them to consider mandating wholesale reform in school lunch menus. Examples like this are replete. But how much can we trust those statistics? Are they always fair and objective? Have they been vetted by an independent body befor they are broadcast to the general public? Do some organizations that publish life influencing statistics have hidden agendas? It would be my guess that: ONLY 1 in 5OO AMERICANS HAVE A CLUE HOW BADLY THEY ARE BEING DUPED BY THE STATISTICS MERCHANTS.I think you better read this book.

The authors cover ground that will help you to think twice the next time you read about results of surveys or studies. My favorite advice that is given is to look for both raw numbers as well as percentages when being presented with results of an investigation. It's easy for somebody to raise an alarm by saying that such and such has increased by 100 percent in the last year, then you find out that that actual numbers were an increase from 1 out of a billion to 2 out of a billion. Not such a big deal after all!I would have given this book a higher rating, but the slant to the right in this book was too much to take. It seemed like just about every case study that they examined and tried to afix the book title to was a cause that is not favored by conservatives. You get the feeling that if this book came out 15 years ago that they would have used the smoking/cancer link as a case study, and would have hacked away to suggest that there may be other explanations other than the obvious one.The good news is that once you get a feel for being more critical of how data is presented, you can apply this to any data; it makes you a better consumer of the news."},{"Title":"It Ain't Necessarily So: How Media Make and Unmake the Scientific Picture of Reality","review":"This is a very well-documented book....

It hasn't aged very well, has it?"},{"Title":"It Ain't Necessarily So: How Media Make and Unmake the Scientific Picture of Reality","review":"This book is not riddled with factual errors, but information is presented in an extrememly misleading way. For instance, in its treatment of climate change, a long section (pp. 49-52) criticizes the media for reporting a story on the northward range shift of a California butterfly. \\"One swallow does not a summer make,\\" the authors state, and argue that the media should not jump on a story like this in association with climate change because it reports information from just one butterfly species. This sounds reasonable, but there is a problem.The book ignores a study that was published only a year after the original butterfly report, in 1999, by the same author in the same journal. This second study reported that in a total of 35 butterfly species examined, 63% showed a poleward shift (indicative of climate change) while only 3% shifted toward the equator. (Parmesan, C, N et al. Poleward shift of butterfly species? ranges associated with regional warming. Nature 399:579-583) Since this study was published 3 years before my 2002 edition of \\"It Ain't Necessarily So\\" these authors have had ample time to update their discussion of this issue. That they have not would indicate that they are incompetent, inattentive, or biased, none of which flatters their overall reliability.In a wider sense, the butterfly range shift is one of the most innocuous issues the media could have possibly addressed regarding climate change. As a instructor in environmental science at the University of California, I am well-read in both the primary scientific literature on climate change and the media's coverage of climate change, and overall I'd argue that the media has failed to raise sufficient awareness regarding the dangers of climate change, which by any scientific consensus will dominate human affairs in a very detrimental way for years to come.The butterfly example is symptomatic of most of the book. A political agenda is suggested instead of mere incompetence by the authors' affiliations. One author, Joel Schwartz, is a fellow at the Hudson Institute, which PR Watch ... says has an \\"agenda of (its) own: debunking global warming, extinction reports, and other issues that paint an unflattering issue of their corporate sponsors.\\"Another author, Robert Lichter, is president of the Center for Media and Public Affairs (CMPA), which PR Watch calls \\"a deeply hypocritical organization that pretends to be objective, empirical, and impartial when in fact it is a right-wing organization with a permanent agenda of hostility to environmentalists and consumer advocates.\\"The book is not bad in the sense that most of us think of the word; rather, it is bad in a calculated and negligent fashion, pushing what can only be interpreted as an agenda that matches that of the groups that employ its authors.

Almost all the cases the authors have selected are examples of the \\"liberal news media\\" misinterpreting or exaggerating the results of scientific and sociological studies.But in general the authors don't actually show that the media's interpretation is in fact wrong, they just try to cast doubt on it or they argue that a particular problem might not be as bad as the media would make one believe. I don't recall a single example where the authors actually show convincingly that an alternative - and in all likelihood politically conservative - view is correct, although that is clearly what the authors are trying to imply.I can't help feeling that the authors weren't honest about their intentions. If they have a conservative world view and they want to show that their view is correct and that the view presented by the allegedly liberal media is wrong, then they should say so and set out to prove it. If the book truly were a neutral analysis of the accuracy of news reports, then it would have to contain examples of outrageously inaccurate reports in the right-wing media P>Readers interested in a conservative examination of environmentalist and other claims might be better served by a book like \\"Apocalypse Not\\"."},{"Title":"It Ain't Necessarily So: How Media Make and Unmake the Scientific Picture of Reality","review":"The premise of their book is a good one: teaching readers to be more skeptical of what they see in print and showing them how to weed good scientific reporting from bad. I would welcome a serious book on this subject. The problem is, the only thing serious about these authors is their hidden agenda, which becomes clear if you read their book with the skeptical eye they encourage. They devote much of the book to &quot;debunking&quot; news they say has been slanted inaccurately by liberal and environmentalist journalists. Interestingly enough, these &quot;debunkings&quot; all come out in favor of what many would call a radical conservative agenda (anti environmentalist, anti gay, anti minority, etc.). The authors argue that readers should question all sources and statements of facts, yet in debunking these supposed media-perpetuated myths, they consistently make statements of fact without supporting them. The authors also rake journalists over the coals for questioning scientific funding sources: They believe that if coal industry-funded environmental research finds that global warming is a farce, the funding source shouln't raise any questions about the research conclusions. To some, this may sound crazy, but when you look at their own affiliations, it's no wonder they argue this point: The authors are connected with organizations known as the staunchest conservative think tanks in the country. But clearly, that's no reason to question the fact that all their research shows that conservatives are right and everyone else is wrong. Yeah, right. If readers learn anything from the premise of this book, it's that they should approach all news with a critical eye, which is good advice.

I own many, many of the books and magazines published by Taunton Press, and have been almost unfailingly pleased. I own all of the \\"Outstanding Projects from... \\" books in the series that they have published and have been very impressed with the quality of, and the wealth of information contained in, \\"Beds,\\" \\"Desks,\\" \\"Tables,\\" etc. Unfortunately, \\"Chests of Drawers\\" falls well short of its siblings, for the following reasons:1) Fewer projects. With the exception of \\"Desks,\\" which also has seven projects, the other books have from 8 to 11 projects each. This isn't a huge deal, except for the fact that many of the projects are virtually identical (see below) and there is not much coverage of the many design options that a reader could use, going forward, to make his or her own, unique chests of drawers.2) Projects advertised on the cover aren't in the book -- a real problem, in my mind. The back cover says \\"The projects range from a Shaker four-drawer dresser to a chest-on-frame or chest-on-chest.\\" Well, unless I'm missing something the book does not contain a four-drawer dresser in any style (although one or two, because they have simple lines, could be seen as Shaker-influenced) and there is no chest-on-chest at all. (However, there is a brief, two-sentence reference in the opening chapter on the use of molding to keep a top chest in place on a lower chest.) There is a Queen Anne-style chest-on-frame, but one out of three advertised projects is a terrible percentage. Perhaps the cover was written before the book was completed; the author himself admits, in the \\"Acknowledgments,\\" that he wrote this at a very slow pace.3) Minimal project variety. Of the seven projects in the book, four are more or less variations on the same theme. With the exception of the above-mentioned Queen Anne, the Pennsylvania Dutch, and the bow-front cover chest, the rest are simple boxes with very little unique detailing or methods: one each of a \\"contemporary,\\" double, triple and tall dresser. The tall dresser goes a bit further than the other three, with some raised frame-and-panel construction and stylized hardware... but they're really just variations on the same theme.(Now, one could argue that chests are very simple objects, just boxes in boxes. But the same argument of \\"simplicity\\" could be made for tables, beds, desks, bookcases, etc. -- yet this didn't seem to stop the authors of those books from choosing unique and interesting projects that provided new learning opportunities and a variety of styles to choose from. Further, Taunton has published another book, \\"Treasure Chests,\\" which -- although focusing more on chests similar to this book's Pennsylvania Dutch chest -- is chock-full of novel pieces. Note: this is NOT a complaint about the craftsmanship that went into designing, and goes into building, the pieces. There's just very little variety.)4) Somewhat sloppy, poorly edited writing. Burr-under-the-saddle phrases such as \\"It's got\\"; references for further information that either take you to the wrong page or -- when you get there -- don't provide you with the information you expected to find; and instructions that read \\"Decide how you'll join the corners of the inlay,\\" without explaining the advantages and disadvantages -- if any -- of the subsequently offered methods, are fine in a first-draft document. In later drafts and the final, published version, these sorts of errors and inadequacies should have been corrected and/or edited away.Again, I'm fairly distressed at having purchased this book and at feeling compelled to write this review. The rest of the books in Taunton's series are excellent, well-written and offer many design styles and project levels to choose from. I purchased this book, \\"Chests of Drawers,\\" on the strength of that series, and I'm sure others will, too.In the future, or in a re-issued version of this book, Taunton should not only make sure that the cover promises are fulfilled in the book itself, but it should also go back to what made the other books so successful: crisp, solid writing and great projects in a variety of styles and skill levels. Taunton generally does a great job of providing great information and education for woodworkers at almost all levels; it just fails to do so here. I'm still deciding whether or not I'll send the book back."},{"Title":"Chests of Drawers: Outstanding Projects from America's Best Craftsmen","review":"I consider myself an &quot;advanced beginner&quot; as a woodworker. I own Desks, Bookcases, and Beds in this series (and have completed projects from the latter two). Chests of Drawers does not live up to the high standards of these titles for two reasons:1. Intentional difficulty-It almost seems as though the author tried to come up with the most complex solution to any joinery problem. For example, is there not an easier way to do the joinery for the Contemporary Chest (a beautiful piece, by the way) besides making 180 loose tenons and 8 dozen mortises? The triple dresser is gorgeous but I am not sure that could be made to the same quality outside of the Thomasville factory.2. Lack of variety-I am sure that many of these projects can be modified but if I wanted to substantially modify them, I would just design something myself (something I don't feel comfortable doing yet on a project of this magnitude) and wouldn't need the book. The Pennsylvania Dutch chest, though nice (I mean, I am Pennsylvania Dutch) probably isn't something that needs to take up space in a book called Chests of Drawers. Something in the Arts and Crafts style would have been nice as well as a true Shaker project. Beyond that, one or two variations of a simple, but well constructed chest would have been helpful.I was disappointed in this book and cannot recommend it. I probably would have given it one star, but most of the projects are truly beautiful. I am sure someone can make 'em!"},{"Title":"Chests of Drawers: Outstanding Projects from America's Best Craftsmen","review":"What's wrong with this book?1. Most of the projects in the book are for the very experienced craftsman. The projects seemed complicated just to be complicated. I'm not saying they should be super simple either but I think Taunton missed the mark on these.2. These projects are for the woodworker who has a full set of power tools in their workshop. I also purchased Tauton's \\"Tables\\" book and loved the fact that many of the projects where done with minimal power tools. In this book the concept of \\"hand cut dovetails\\" are dovetails done with a jigsaw and a router. Way too many expensive jigs, routers, biscuits and pocket joints.Since my next project is a chest of drawers for my son, I was really hoping to find inspiration in this book based on my other purchases of Taunton's books. Unfortunately I found none in this book. The ultimate test for me is to show my wife projects from books to see which one(s) she likes. She also found nothing in this book that we would want to build. Hopefully further book's released by Taunton can avoid these mistakes and make a book which most woodworkers can enjoy."},{"Title":"Chests of Drawers: Outstanding Projects from America's Best Craftsmen","review":"I'm new to amazon, but do a column of book reviews on Wood Central.com for woodworkers. My reviews are a little different, because I take time to really read the volumes I select to write about. Reading Bill Hylton is like having him in the room beside you while you are learning. He has a down home, friendly writing style that anticipates the beginner's deficiencies and guards against errors that might become costly. I bought this book instead of waiting for a review copy to come my way, because I know Hylton's work from his router and cabinetry books.'Chests of Drawers' is one of a series of 'Projects from America's Best Craftsmen' by Taunton Press. It includes seven projects, which doesn't sound like much, but in those seven projects, Hylton succeeds in getting across the basics of a variety of chest constructions, including bowfronts, triple dressers, blanket chests, tall chests, a Queen Anne chest on cabriole legs, and sheet-goods casework. It would be easy to take any of the seven projects presented, and adapt their construction to a wide variety of chests of drawers.The discussions of built-up moldings and how they are made is a lesson in woodworking in general. These ideas would be usable on other types of furniture pieces, as would the instruction in bent laminations, string inlay and shop-made pulls. Hylton is an authority with the router, and in this book he gives many hints and tips on using it to complete drawer construction, mortises, base moldings, and dovetails.Not all the projects are centered around expensive solid hardwoods. One double dresser, which could be adapted to a single chest, uses veneered sheet goods with biscuits, pocket-hole joinery and commercial drawer runners to keep down the cost, but you wouldn't know it to look at it. Simple, clean lines in an understated style lend it a spare elegance akin to Shaker furniture.At the opposite end of the scale is the Qeen Anne chest on stand, with dovetailed case sides, dovetailed drawers resting on web frame infrastructure, and molding attached with sliding dovetails cut to allow for wood movement. The stand is an ogee profile, spline-mitered frame with pinnned tenons attaching rails to the bandsawn legs. When I'm ready to attempt that project, I'll be glad Bill Hylton is within reach. His step by step guidance through the complicated procedures is easily understandable, and well illustrated with clear color photos.Of the many, many books I am offered to review, this one is definitely a 'keeper.' It is clear enough in its procedures to encourage a beginning woodworker, and has enough advanced pieces in it to serve as a skill-building exercise for the more experienced woodworker. I give it five stars. Written for the serious woodworker wanting to improve his or her skills, this book deserves every one of them."},{"Title":"Chests of Drawers: Outstanding Projects from America's Best Craftsmen","review":"This book has its good points and bad points. I bought because I was really interested in the chest on the front cover. This chest is probably the most difficult project in the book and it has some very good points.But other things are lacking. For example, the author doesn't explain how to make the \\"stiles\\" of the frame (which are curved in the front plane) flush with the \\"rails\\". This is an important aspect that is simply overlooked.But the most glaring omission is how to finish the piece. The author writes \\"Apply a finish of your choice.\\" I almost returned the book! The beauty of the chest is that there are two shades of mahogany. The author completely ignores this. Uggh!! (I plan to use potassium dichromate to darken the wood where appropriate--I hope it works.)Also, I think the author should have given alternative methods for accomplishing the curve on the front. You can make the drawer fronts from thick stock that is curved on the front and flat in back using a bandsaw to make the curve. This eliminates the need for angled dovetails. This method would *greatly* simplify the construction and make it appropriate for intermediate woodworkers.I certainly would tell a beginning woodworker to stay away from this book. I'd give it a lukewarm recommendation for the intermedate woodworker."},{"Title":"Chests of Drawers: Outstanding Projects from America's Best Craftsmen","review":"I liked this book!

Lots of practise and review examples at the end of each chapter. Good examples of how loops, arrays, conditional statements, etc. work. Once done, you will know the basic terms for using Java. Unfortunately, no answers for the questions are given, but that shouldn't discourage anyone from TRYING the programs. A good book, but a little expensive. The only other critism i have is that to learn more about just the basics of Java requires that you buy even more books that are about the same in price."},{"Title":"Computing Concepts With Java Essentials","review":"I used this book in my intro to programming class that I took in college. I already had taken a programming class while in high school, so the concepts in programming were not new to me, but Java, being an object-oriented language, was new to me. As such the class was new and introduced a lot of concepts which I was not familiar with. This book was good; fairly easy to understand, and the sample problems were good and balanced. I could not find any grammatical, spelling or other mistakes, so kudos to the editors. Overall, it is appropriate for college students and older, though I would not recommend it for high school students learning programming for the first time."},{"Title":"Computing Concepts With Java Essentials","review":"I used this for my Computer Science I text at North Dakota State. It gives a solid intro to COMPUTING CONCEPTS, hence the title. It makes no attempt to teach every detail about Java, but if you have a good professor they'll let you know about the Java API documentation, from where you can explore everything about it. The book is riddled with errors, but Horstmann lists them on his web site and has made and effort to correct them in subsequent printings. The first chapter on applets (Ch 4) is horrible, though, and that really drags down my view of the book. It gives people a bad feeling early on and drives some people away. Also, arrays/vectors should be covered earlier because they would make some things a lot easier to do."},{"Title":"Computing Concepts With Java Essentials","review":"I bought this book a couple of months ago and was on and off studying Java on my own, but I must say, overall its an excellent book if you are a novice to object oriented progamming.

Like anything, if you don't make an effort to understand whats in the book and pratice the problems given, its useless."},{"Title":"Computing Concepts With Java Essentials","review":"I read this book in a bookstore, so this isn't based on deep experience with it. What I liked about it was that it was a programming primer that used Java as its example language.

The use of provided classes delays the need to learn difficult concepts (i.e. the provided ConsoleReader handles keyboard input) until basic programming concepts are learned."},{"Title":"Computing Concepts With Java Essentials","review":"This book's main purpose was to teach the computing concepts using a little bit of Java. Don't plan on learning enough about the Java language itself to make something useful. I was deceived because I saw the words &quot;Java 2&quot; on the cover in big print. I guess one really can't blame the author for it because it does say &quot;Computing Concepts w/ Java2 Essentials.&quot; It was still a disappointment to me since I wanted to learn Java from this book first. Of course, the price of this book is WAY too much for what it teaches.

I've taken quite a few programming classes and have never received anything less than an A.But I've never touched Java before, and this book totally confuses me. It keeps referencing back and forth different classes/methods with similiar names, and in the end I'm completely lost.Even at the beginning of this book, it discusses some concepts that just wouldn't make sense at all to a beginner. I'm glad this is not my first programming book, or I wouldn't have any idea what the first chapter is all about.Too bad for me, this is required for my Java course, so I'm stuck with it.

The title of this book has neither '..in a week', nor '..in 24 hours and certainly not '..while you drive to work' in its title.It teaches you the 'concepts' and 'essentials' of Java programming. It doesn't cover IO in detail nor threads, nor games programming. When you've finished this book then you will be ready to tackle those difficult topics that are well covered by Reilly's animal series. The main theme running through the book is the progressive development of an interactive bank account. I can recommed this book to absolute beginners or those not familiar with object orientated programming.Bonus points go to the first half of the book. Minus points go to coverage of IO."},{"Title":"Computing Concepts With Java Essentials","review":"There are lots of people dissatisfied with this book, myself included. I really don't understand how anyone can find this book cohesive, and the little bit of information you get out of it you have to dissect the text for hours to get any meaning from it. This book loves to give you code to use and not tell you what in the world it does, just that you need it. So you use it for chapters then boom, in chapter 9 your finally tells something about it. That is not constructive. The learning process does not work this way. Most of the time the book hardly tells you anything. You can see that certain things must come before others, but not told why and with out being told what the code really does; its mostly just guessing why. I understand that the goal of the book is to teach programming and not a specific language, but this book does not successfully do that when it doesn't tell you what is going on. In my opinion, it confuses you to what is going on and you have to \\"unthink\\" what you've learned to actually progress with another book. I gave up completely on the book for my class and turned to outside sources to pass. Most of my classmates have been forced to do the same."},{"Title":"Computing Concepts With Java Essentials","review":"If you've read \\"The C Programming Language\\" and enjoyed the style of its presentation, you'll likely find this book appalling. The book is neither concise, nor lucid; you wade your way through endless explaination and come out with little understanding. I've found the examples and the presentation on Sun's website to be much easier to understand, simply because they start with a clear example, discuss it a bit, then give the details of each statement (much like Kernighan's book).Also, some of the code can't simply be typed in and compiled. In one section, they fail to mention, either in the text or in the example, that you need to import a certain class. The documentation on Sun's website is excellent, but that shouldn't make it acceptable to leave details out of the text.Finally, the price is a total rip-off. I was fortunate enough to get the book used for under $20, but I would feel cheated if I had paid more. A lot of the information can be gotten for free, and that the quality of the free information often exceeds that which is in the book. Sadly, this book seems to fit the \\"intro to programming\\" niche, and a lot of students will be forced to buy it for those classes, allowing the publisher to get away with the high price."},{"Title":"Computing Concepts With Java Essentials","review":"This text is a nightmare.

It is meant for a beginner who has not previously been exposed to programming. This book is not meant to teach the details of Java. The author even tries to hide these details by providing a package that helps with some of the more difficult areas of Java.

Unfortunately, the examples have not been ported. The book comes with a CD that supplies some classes which can be included in student's code, so that the C-like examples and assignments will compile and run.Nowhere in the book will you find a mention of applets or running Java in web browsers, where 99.9% of Java use today takes place. The classes supplied with the book allow students to write programs that operate like command-line Unix programs from 20 years ago, and only interact with the user through the debugger's console window. When was the last time a Java program from a website asked you to type three numbers and press return?From the point of view of the professor and TAs, this book may be ideal. The twisted pseudo-code submitted by their students for marking will look just like the same old C source code that they have been marking for years. From the point of view of students entering the real world at some point, things could get ugly. I can picture a student's first day in a co-op placement. &quot;Java? Sure I can program Java, just let me install these third-party classes so my pseudo-code will compile, then I'll get started writing programs that no-one but me and Cay Horstmann will understand, and will probably break with the next update of the Java JDK.&quot;To my professor's credit, she has been pointing out these problems with the book, and has forbade anyone to install the classes, or the demo Microsoft development environment that comes with it. I think that she should take the next logical step, and replace this turkey. Luckily for me, I already learned Java from &quot;Learn Java on the Macintosh&quot; by Barry Boone &amp; Dave Mark. I suggest you do the same."},{"Title":"Computing Concepts With Java Essentials","review":"This is a very good book to use as a teaching tool in a classroom, but unfortunately unless you are very aware of what you are typing and have a good understanding of the language this may become troublesome because of typos in the code.

It explains the basic concepts of programming, so if you have previous exerience with Java, you might not find it useful. On the other hand, if you do not know Java at all, this is a great book to start with - it translates the concepts of programming (loops, conditionals, string treatment, recursion and more importantly: object oriented programming) into Java and explains how to use them effectively. It is written in a quirky manner that will make you chuckle sometimes hence making even the boring parts somewhat enjoyable.I recommend it for beginners in Java with not much background in programming in general.

Being in multiple APs, I obvisouly cannot read every single word and frequently have to sort out what information is relevant in a book. In most of my textbooks, this is rather easy. Horstmann's book is, however, quite the exception. The author literally interupts his own sentences and sections with dozens of \\"Random facts,\\" \\"Productivity Hints,\\" \\"Advanced Topics,\\" and many more of these callouts. One chapter, I forget which one, actually has three of these strung in a row, manking this book incredibly hard to read.

Such topics are covered equally well or better in dozens of other computer science books (less expensive ones, I might add).However, I was new to Java, so I had hoped that this book would teach it to me. I was disappointed. The book uses its own package of classes which teach the student nothing of real Java. After using this book, I found that I had to start all over again when I wanted to learn Java, and it took me several months to unlearn the material in this book.

My only problem with this book is its price and outrageous selling strategy. This book, as well as Big C++ and Big Java sell for 80 to 90 bucks in the US, where they can be imposed to college students as textbooks. Here in Italy, where this trick can't work they sell for their real value, that is from 40 to 50 bucks.So, exploiting the enthusiasm of the student buying his new textbooks (I know how it feels I have been there myself) or just the plain fact that it can be imposed as required reading in some classes this text is oversold at almost double its real market value.

The Read the Tarot book is also very limited. If you want a shortcut to reading the tarot, this is it. But be warned that such topics are much better read at their length than some quick read scheme. Its the black and white version of things, so to speak. This is this and that is that, where really we begin to find that the tarot has so much grey space, and other colors that there is no finite definition for anything. Her review of sword cards are the most frustrating, because she assumes that all swords are problems, cut and dry. So if you look up the five of swords, for example, she goes with her key word system of \\"I believe\\"and swords is problems, so the five of swords you would have to remember always is \\"I believe in problems and troubles.\\" Such an analysis is both extremely weak and pitiful, doing little to really understanding a card. Better said, these books by Abraham are appalingly lacking in substance, and her idea is to be quick because time is money, you get the sense that its all about rushing and making money, where in reality the Tarot is about timelessness, and slow methodical learning, to grasp the nuances of each card and spread to really understand the complexity of human nature!"},{"Title":"How to Use Tarot Spreads","review":"If you want to try new spreads, this book has lots. However, I thought the explanations and uses of the spreads were too specific and not flexible enough. I don't use any of them, because I find these particular spreads confusing and difficult to use. It also gives short and simple meanings for each of the cards, including the numerological, elemental, and astrological associations, which is helpful and convenient, but not detailed enough if you don't have a more comprehensive book or a detailed understanding of the cards. There are better books out there on non-traditional spreads. I only use this one when I need a quick reminder for a card's meaning."},{"Title":"How to Use Tarot Spreads","review":"I bought this book for the unique spreads and read it thoroughly. I would have liked to see explanations for why the cards are laid out in certain order and places. I thought the questions were too specific and would be difficult to answer with numerous cards. Interesting spreads, good subject matter, not well executed or explained at all. Please rewrite the book, Ms. Abraham and I will buy it again."},{"Title":"Ghosts of London","review":"I originally bought this book as, when considering the title, it my interest in the Paranormal (given the title). Whilst slightly disappointed that the book is not about ghosts in the I-see-dead-people-sense but relics of a rapidly forgotton age, I was happily suprised with the content.Written originally in 1939, the book essentially tells the tale of the author's journey to uncover and discover the mystery behind certain quirks of the old city of London. Romantic historical things like the Lamplighters, the Hansome Cab, the secret ceremonies within the Tower of London, The Beefeaters and Yeomen and street lights made from the laps of Nelsons Flagship in the battle of Trafalgar. All these old stories that will slowly fade away unless passed down. It may sound a bit \\"Blah\\" but given the popularity of the old-English themes running through Harry Potter, I would be surprised if most didn't find this intriguing if not captivating.For me, this is a rare gem that I've found and have enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"You're a Real Hero, Amanda","review":"This book may be out of print, but it is a wonderful story about a 5th grade girl who wants to rescue her pet rooster Mazda. She has troubles along the way and has triumphs, and in the end, everything works out. This story sometimes leaves you in suspense, other times, making you laugh. You're A Real Hero Amanda seems like a real perspective of a child."},{"Title":"Elder Law in a Nutshell (Nutshell Series)","review":"The latest publication of Elder Law in a Nutshell was, in my opinion, an easy read and a thorough and comprehensive explanation that should appeal to both the lay person and someone in the legal profession."},{"Title":"Elder Law in a Nutshell (Nutshell Series)","review":"Reports of guardians stealing from their wards' bank accounts and other wise abusing guardianship powers are surfacing with disturbing regularity.

It seems to me that Pratchett has invested more in Vimes and in Vetinari than in any of his other characters, and it shows. This glimpse into Captain -- sorry, Duke -- Samuel Vimes's past, present, future, and soul simply astounded me. Simply put, I hope to see more Discworld books like this."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"The Duke of Ankh Sir Samuel Vimes knows that in his role, as Commander of the Watch, there is never a dull day on Discworld. Usually Sam stays off the street and works behind a desk, but when a particularly vicious psychopath kills one of the men under his command, Vimes is determined to find Carcer and bring him down. He corners him near the university but just as he is about to apprehend him a freak occurrence sends them back in time.Carcer kills John Keel, the man who taught Vines how to be a good copper, and it is up to Sir Samuel to find a way to teach the young Samuel Ivens how to bring honor to a job. Before he can think of returning to his present, he must also take care of Carcer, show the Watch that it needn't be corrupt, and find a way to put history back on track.The Discworld novels are always interesting and humorous and Night Watch is no exception. The hero is thrust back in time and into an organization that is corrupt, inept and inefficient. Using the knowledge gained in the thirty years on the job he brings a sense of honor and fair play to the NIGHT WATCH, which makes him very appealing to the readers. Terry Pratchett has written a fine well-rounded novel that will please his fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"With Terry Pratchett as my favorite author, I really looked forward to Night Watch, especially since out of Pratchett's wide range of characters and character settings, my favorite is about the men, troll, dwarves, werewolf, etc, in the nightwatch division of the police force. It is so easy to escape into a Pratchett book, with the characterizations so well done and the humor intoxicating. I would recommend Jingo, Men at Arms, or Feet of Clay over Night Watch though. It was not as humorous as I would have liked, except for the parts with Nobby Nobbs as a young street urchin. Those parts were excellent! Overall, the book is a good fantasy with Vimes going back in time and seeing things from a slightly differnet perspective than he had experienced them before. Cleverly written, just not quite the caliber of previous books. Still very much worth reading."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This is, so far, my favorite book by Terry Pratchett (and i've read all of his Discworld books plus a couple more) It's funny, has awesome characters (Vimes! The History Monks!), a great plot, isn't increadably cliche, and actually stands ok on it's own. IT would help if you have read at least one other book with the night watch in it, so that you can fully appreciate the characters, but I think that you'd be OK if you hadn't.I totally recomend this book, it's well worth buying!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat \\"Bite me!\\"I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"While his wife is in labor, Vimes accidentally goes back in time while chasing an arch-criminal and meets his younger self, taking on the role of an unsung hero of one of the revolutions in Ankh-Morpork. We meet a young Patrician and Nobby. The Monks of Time make cameos, but are under-used. This book is more serious than the usual Discworld novel and contains a lot of meditation on the nature of duty, responsibility, and heroism. It would seem that a whole book going deep into Vimes' past and psychology would be interesting, but I agree with one of the reviewers on Amazon; if you already know Vimes, you'll find that he never really surprises you in this book. I'd give it four stars if it were either funnier _or_ a better serious novel. As in a lot of Pratchett, many scenes in this story cry out for a stronger sense of place and evocative detail; there's too much telling and not enough showing. It wouldn't make a good introduction to Discworld; for that, try _The Truth_."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I'm sure there are many, many people who will love this book. After two reads, I don't think it likely my opinion - that this is one of Pratchett's lesser efforts - will change.The central idea of &quot;Night Watch&quot; is that the individual matters; that an individual and the actions their character leads them to commit can be central to history's progression. Fine. However, my feeling was that &quot;Night Watch&quot; did not illuminate Vimes' character - as opposed to his personal history - beyond what had been established in previous books, notably &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;. What is the point if we already know just what Vimes is like and can predict what he will do in every situation? And despite the continuous reminder that, yes, he has his dark side, Vimes never steps over that particular line. Not once. Again, what is the point? Whatever Pratchett may have thought he was doing with this book, what I found it to be was a slightly tedious tale re-treading the familiar territory of Sam Vimes the slightly-grimy-but-honest copper. There's too much baggage for the new reader; all the cameos have no resonance unless you're already familiar with the characters, and the lack of humour in &quot;Night Watch&quot; somehow leaves the Ankh-Morpork of this book adrift from the city as it appears in Pratchett's previous books.This is a well-written, well-crafted story with some interesting issues to think about, if that's your cup of tea. But for me, Pratchett's real talent is for comedy, and I think that's where he should stay."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"While Night Watch is one of the best of the Terry Pratchett novels, this reading of the book is completely disappointing. Although I have read the book with enjoyment many times I can barely tolerate the audio version. The reader's voices and manners are deep and serious with a downturn to their phrasing which is in total contrast to the tone of the book. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the timing of the changes between readers, attempts at british accents are weak and erratic, and the brilliantly written unique characters have no distinction as read. This is especially disappointing because of the excellence of Terry Pratchett novels read by Nigel Planer. I regret purchasing this item."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Let me say that I love Terry Pratchett, and for over 10 years I've eagerly awaited each new book. I've read some of his early discworld books so many times I've lost count.Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to to really like this book, it was very disappointing. Another reviewer got it in one when they said, &quot;just not funny&quot;. Yes, all of his books are social satire, but this was verging on just 'social'. Even the jokes that were attempted seemed forced and unoriginal, like I had read them in his other books before. I even read it again (because I always read ever new Pratchett books several times right away since there is normally so much I miss the first time through), but it never 'caught' me, I never laughed, and I just set the book aside.I have been disappointed in the last two Pratchett books, and while I'll be certain to pick up his next book as well, I really hope to see some new, refreshing material in the future."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This is a strange book, quite good, but it reads like well-informed fan fiction, not at all like Terry Pratchett himself (i have read all of the Discworld series, some titles several times over).The style is dry, the characters non-developed, the pacing and structure do not have the same feel as other works, and it lots of ways this story is flavorless.It doesn't feel right...."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Night Watch gives a view of Sam Vimes and the events in his early life which molded him.

As his wife Sybil is about to give birth to their first child, Commander Samuel Vimes of the City Watch heads to the cemetary of Small Gods, to commemorate the day Sergeant John Keel, his mentor, and six other coppers died some thirty yeas ago.Later, arriving at the Patrician's Palace, he hears that Carcer, a serial killer who's been wreaking havoc around town lately, has just been cornered. This might be his only chance to arrest the murderer.Outside, there's a storm brewing. After a chase in the streets of the city, Vimes and Carcer end up in the tower of the wizards' University, a highly magical place. And as the Commander is about to catch his prey, lighting strikes, and both are transported back in time, some thirty years earlier... Soon Carcer commits another crime and kills John Keel.Night Watch has a strong &quot;Back to the Future&quot; theme, where changing events in the past... well, the now, of course affects those in the now... well, the future. Many things have changed in thirty years, and Vimes struggles to put his own past back on the track. It won't be long until he encounters his younger self. Passing himself off as Sergeant John Keel, not only will he have to teach young Sam to be a good copper, but he must also survive the oncoming Revolution.True to form, Terry Pratchett gives us yet another witty, intelligent, hilarious Discworld novel of the City Watch, with its traditional footnotes and tongue-in-cheek humour, and some cameo appearances of Death... what more could we possibly ask for?"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Terry does it again with this tale of a time-travelling Samuel Vimes looking to keep his other self out of trouble during the Ankh-Morpork rebellion.

His wife will be in labor any moment and there is a vicious killer loose in the city. It is also the anniversary of a pivotal point in his career and the city.Vimes corners the killer on the roof of the library of unseen university and a lightning bolt sends both of them back 30 years (monks do not do this like stated on the back of the book).Moments after their arrival in the past, history has been changed. Carcer (the killer) has killed a man that helped Vimes learn how to be a copper. But the Monks of Time, at least a certain monk with a broom from THE THIEF OF TIME, wants to set things right in an unusual way.Pratchett is in top form as he pokes fun at just about everything while keeping the dark things dark (after all, there is nothing really funny about a serial killer). All of this is done in a Les Miserables setting of impending revolution.I do not know how Pratchett feels about Vimes. He has said that Granny Weatherwax was his favorite character but it is obvious that he really cares a lot about Vimes. If you are new to the series, you should read the other night watch books first in order to get a firm understanding of the watch and the city."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I'm going to keep this short because so many other people have already highlighted the book. I agree with all the people who said this is not a good starting point for new readers. There is more character development here than in any of Pratchett's \\"watch\\" novels since Guards Guards!This book was so good that I missed several meals because I didn't want to put it down, and when I did finish I just sat there and let it all sink in.

I adored this book and I'd rate it 15 stars if I could. If you enjoy Terry Pratchett, you will not be disappointed. If you enjoy scifi/fantasy period,and don't like this book,then you're just an uncultured lout."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Attempting to assign a genre to Terry Pratchett is like trying to identify the parentage of a rescue league dog. As you get to know the beast, there are so many fascinating possibilities and ancestors evident that finally you just throw up your hands and say, \\"Who cares?\\" If you enjoy it and want to keep it around for company, why not just let it be called whatever it answers to.I am not a fantasy reader, nor am I a sci-fi fan. There are exceptions of course, but neither genre label will draw me inexorably down a bookstore aisle. A voracious reader friend who rarely leads me astray first introduced me to Terry Pratchett a few years ago. Now, just let me spy a Terry Pratchett Discworld novel I haven't read (a rare commodity these days since I first started collecting these deliciously droll satires) and it's mine. Snatched up, bought, wrapped and out the door.For the uninitiated, Pratchett has discovered a planet, perhaps in our solar system, perhaps not, called Discworld. It is a strange, flat planet inhabited by humans --- more or less. It's also inhabited by trolls, dwarves, witches and wizards, the occasional imp, (useful creatures for picture taking and reminding its owners of important appointments) werewolves, vampires, zombies, gargoyles, a talking dog and, ultimately, the Man in Black, the Grim Reaper, the Keeper of Personal Hour Glasses --- DEATH. The humans are under the impression that they rule Discworld, which amuses the other beings to no end. It also amuses the millions of fans who devour each book as it hits the shelves.NIGHT WATCH adds an element never before encountered in a Pratchett book --- time travel. Commander Samuel Vimes of the capitol city's City Watch, is in hot pursuit of an arch criminal threatening Vimes' home and wife, who is in labor with his first-born child. As they grapple for control of a deadly crossbow in a thunderstorm on the roof of the Unseen University, home of Discworld's Wizards and source of poorly controlled magic at times, a lightning bolt catapults them 30 years back in time.There, Sam finds himself in the body of a legendary hero, Sergeant of the Night Watch John Keel. An alarming discovery, for Vimes knows full well that Sgt. Keel lies in a hero's grave, the result of brave action in the bloody 25th of May Rebellion. The date is the dawn of that fateful day and Sam realizes, once he assesses his situation, that he has not only unwillingly become a part of his own history but, when he looks around the watch room, he sees Young Lance Corporal Sam Vimes, a raw recruit of a few weeks. He will have the opportunity to mentor him and what a disappointing prospect Young Sam seems to be.\\"He wondered if it was at all possible to give this idiot some lessons in basic politics. That was always the dream, wasn't it? 'I wish I knew then what I know now'? But when you got older, you found out that You Now wasn't You Then. You Then was a twerp. You Then was what you had to be to start out on the rocky road of becoming You Now, and one of the rocky patches on that road was being a twerp. A much better dream, one that'd ensure sounder sleep, was not to know now what you didn't know then.\\"NIGHT WATCH delves deeper into the philosophy of war and leadership than most of the Discworld books. It also offers more action than any others in the collection. For the initiated, you will discover how Reg Shoe becomes a zombie, you will meet Lord Vetineri as a young and promising student of the Assassin's Guild and discover how Knobby Knobs becomes a faithful follower of Commander Vimes in later years.Series books should stand alone so that new readers can follow the story. NIGHT WATCH no doubt succeeds in this. Perhaps because it is almost, but not quite, a prequel to the rest of Discworld's adventures, readers new to Pratchett will haunt booksellers for previous editions.--- Reviewed by Roz Shea"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"and that's saying something. The books just keep getting better and better, and after so many novels, Pratchett has yet to repeat himself or slip into the all-to-easy fantasy stand-by of ripping of Lord of the Rings (unless you count the cameo appearance of Golom in Witches Abroad.) Commander Sir Samuel Vimes, by far my favorite Discworld charactor, is the focus of this latest instilation of the Discworld series. He's mean, violent, tough and increadably endearing. A devoted husband, soon-to-be father and workaholic copper, Vimes finds himself in what seems to be a no-win situation when a magical experiment gone wrong sends him back in time to the world of his youth. He arrives to find that the same accident has caused the death of his childhood mentor, John Keel, and now, if he doesn't want his life to be destroyed, he must assume the mans identity and teach young Sam what it means to be a good copper. Unfortunatly, as Vimes recalls, Keel is destined to die in a few days time...This book is a perfect example of Pratchett's trademark combination of action, witt and philosophy. Old fans will adore meeting Nobby Nobbs as a street urchin, Havelock Vetinari as a student assassin, and Reg Shoe as a young (and very much alive) rebel-without-a-cause. As for new readers, just read the first sentence and see if you don't like it. Go on, I dare you. Here it is:\\"Sam Vimes sighed when he heard the scream, but he finished shaving before he did anything about it.\\"Curious? Interested? I hope so.Terry Pratchett's writing style is so vivid and elegant that the reader is pulled right into the story. His writing is so good in fact that I think a reader would be justified in saying \\"I was there.\\""},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"If you are new to TP, the quoted remark refers to what some people slightly slower on the uptake might regard as a definition of \\"irony\\".I include it because that's where Terry went with Night Watch. NW is the most serious TP book yet, and yet it's still funny all the way through. It's just that the humour is more than ever firmly rooted in the City Watch style of humour (irony, cynical asides, sarcasm) and less in the wizardly style (bickering, puns, one-liners etc. - although there is a great exchange between Ridcully and Stibbons early in the book) It's like Terry decided to slow the jokes down and spread them out. It could almost be a kind of deliberate differentiation - most of the quick-fire humour is in the present-day, while the past is a more cynical time, which I suppose is appropriate for a city on the brink of a revolution. Of course, one constant throughout is Sam Vimes's eternal exasperation, which is always good for a laugh.Should you buy it? Yep. But if you've read the earlier Watch novels first, you'll have more laughs in this one as you spot all the series regular's younger versions..."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I've read pretty much all of Mr.Pratchett's books (except some of his children's books) and have loved all of them.As brilliant as he is,I still prefer some of his books over the others,specifically his Lancre-books and his city-watch books.Well,Night Watch just moved to the top of my list.It has everything we have come to expect from his books and more.If you've never read any of his books before,this may not be a great place to start,as it includes characters well-known from other books,but to everybody else:read it!And to those of you who have never read Terry Pratchett before;get started,you have a lot of catching up to do."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"As some astute readers have figured out by now, the title of this review is What Would Vimes Do? That is, What Would he Do if he was thrust immediately thirty years into the past, on the cusp of a great tragedy that he already survived once? This book deals with exactly that scenario. As previous reviewers have said, this book is far more serious than Pratchett's usual fare. However, that does not mean it is not funny. It is lacking much of the lowbrow, slapstick humor that acts as a &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; of humor in other Pratchett books, but his characteristic intelligent, satirical wit is alive and well, and uproariously funny. The book deals mainly with powerful themes: responsibility being the preeminent one. Responsibility to a community, to a society, to one's self. Prathcett goes deep here; the book left me thinking. The chracters are not developed as much as in other books, but since there are very few new ones (and the biggest new character is extremely, spookily well developed) this is no great loss to old readers of Pratchett works. To new fans, I would recommend Mort, Guards! Guards!, or Pyramids as a first read; progress to this one later."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I admit to being a little disappointed that this story didn't turn out to be a look at the original Stone Face Grimes -- given the hints given out in the city watch stories, another time travel story may be in Grimes' future -- but that disappointment was quickly blown away by one of Terry Pratchett's best novels to date.While recent city watch novels have strayed ever further afield -- &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot; doesn't even take place in Ankh-Morpork, for instance -- &quot;Night Watch&quot; returns to the group's roots with a vengeance, showing us an even harder-off Night Watch than we saw in the first watch novel, &quot;Guards, Guards.&quot; Life is brutish and short in the watch, and morale and corruption are even lower than we've ever seen them before. In many ways, Grimes is more at home in this environment than he is in the modern day. We see him dealing with truly bad figures -- with and without badges -- as a future massacre and coup rush towards him at a headlong pace.(Fans of &quot;Thief of Time&quot; will be glad to see the time-twisting Monks of History have a supporting role in this magical tale of time travel, but readers by no means need to have that read novel to enjoy the Sweeper in this book.)The cameos (younger versions of established characters) in the book are natural and work well in the story, and fans of Nobby and Venitari should especially be pleased. The new characters, including Lord Winder's secret police, the Unmentionables, are all vividly drawn and feel like they've always been a part of Discworld.While the novel has its share of laughs -- many of which spring from seeing the origins of established characters, and Vimes' perhaps unwitting nudging them towards their destinies -- it's also one of Pratchett's more serious works, with meditations on gun control, community policing and, as always, the role of the law and police officers in society.&quot;Night Watch&quot; is best enjoyed by readers familiar with the other Ankh-Morpork stories, but is strongly recommended to any Discworld readers looking for a return to what is becoming fantasy's best-drawn cities. An unqualified success."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Night Watch, the newest discworld book, features the Night Watch when Vimes joined. It is not only funny, but interesting and really fun. It has more of a concentrated plot than some of the other books, and ties together the story of the City Watch, and also includes Lu Tze, Qu, Lord Vetinari as a student assasin, and other well loved characters. Anyone, even if they haven't read other Discworld or Pratchett books, will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"A comparison between a Discworld novel and the Star Trek TV series would not usually come to mind. However, in NIGHTWATCH, we are discovering something like the program's temporal prime directive. It is one thing to be transported 30 years back in time through some magical fluke. It something else to ensure that events there do/will not distort the present. The present is a past and will lead to a future. What would you be coming back to?Sir Samuel Vimes, the Commander of the City Watch in Ankh Morpork, is catapulted out of the present at a sensitive and important moment in his personal life. Together with the criminal Carcer, who he was about to arrest, he is transported into an earlier, smaller and much less organized city. It would not be true to his character if he just laid low while waiting and hoping to get back to the present/future. Disguised as another copper, he involves himself in the city's business. He meets a number of well-known Discworld luminaries in their earlier selves, from Nobby Nobbs and Fred Colon to a smart young Havelock Vetinari and learns how Reg Shoe becomes a zombie. And, of course, we encounter the young Sam Vimes who is still very nave. He is in need of a role model and hero and Vimes, the older and still disguised, has to step into the part. Suffice to say, that the events are unfolding in good Pratchett fashion. Sam Vimes is in the thick of it - a rebellion to be precise.As a result of Vimes and Carcer's presence, events happen not quite as they were suppose to have happened. That is where the temporal prime directive becomes an important aspect leading us to a more reflective and pondering Sam. He knows how history will report the past that he is reliving, but not as himself. Will he jeopardize his own future if he tweaks reality in the past? Will there be his wife, Sybil, and the child yet to be born?... Those familiar with Pratchett's Discworld will remember time shifts and alignments and those who tinker with them in THIEF OF TIME. Not surprising therefore that the Sweeper has to make an appearance, this time accompanied by a character similar to one in Star Trek - playing with time and space. To find out about the importance of lilac, you have to read the book.NIGHTWATCH is a great book - rich in the story and the reflections on politics, power, violence and teamwork. And of course, Pratchett's famous and unsurpassed one-liners, such as, when referring to the old Watch &quot;in the sea of adventure, you're bottom-feeders&quot;. It is one of those P'Terry books you want to read in one go. On reflection, it is also recommended to newcomers to the Discworld. You don't have to read all 28 Discworld novels first... you will certainly read more of them after you started with this one."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I'll tell you this - when I wanted to explain to my parents what I thought of my career in policing, what it meant to me and how best to understand it - I bought them this book.Pratchett continually amazes me. If I didn't know any better I would swear he was a cop, or was one in a previous life (that one I don't know any better about at all, but still....). He captures the mindset perfectly. He KNOWS. I don't know how he does, but he does.Wrap up Pratchett's absolute precision in capturing the essence of a cop in a tale whose prose does nothing less than make me think of Jonathan Swift at his best, transport this perfectly captured and beautifully told tale to the imaginary Discworld, and you have, in my eyes, another Instant Classic - my favorite Discworld tale of all, and that's tough competition.In this book the esteemed Duke Vimes (don't call him Duke!), Commander of the City Watch of Ankh-Morpork, has been transported back in time. He's chasing a stone killer, all the while trying to show his younger self The Ropes, shape up the old Watch into some sort of passable force, stay alive, stay sane and, if he has time, keep the threads of time from unraveling. All while impersonating a lowly Sergeant.Oh, and try and make it back to his own time in time to witness the birth of his child, while fighting through one of Ankh-Morpork's less glorious but no less dangerous Revolutions. It's enough to make your head hurt, so you can imagine how Vimes feels. Consider it a full day's work.Will he keep the Trousers of Time from tearing? Will he make it back in time, in one piece, with his man, and see the birth of his child? Get the book and meet the Night Watch as you've not met them before.Funny, sad, irreverent, reverent, violent, peaceful, tragic and glorious - yep, Pratchett summed it all up pretty well."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"In the 28 other Discworld books a lot of sci-fi/fantasy staples have already been lampooned: heroic quests, magic swords, wizards, witches, vampires, werewolves, elves, and so forth. The one staple not yet really tackled has been time travel. \\"Night Watch\\" takes care of this glaring error in relatively entertaining style.As his wife is involved in a long labor to give birth to their first child, Commader Sam Vimes of the City Watch is involved in cornering a cop-killing madman named Carcer. In hot pursuit of Carcer, Vimes climbs up onto the roof of the library for Unseen University (the school for wizards) during a thunderstorm. When a bolt of lightning strikes the library, Vimes and Carcer are transported back in time 30 years.And of course it is a pivotal moment in the history of the metropolis of Ankh-Morpork. The brutal Lord Winder has been heavily taxing people and rounding up any who dissent. Revolt is fermenting, all it needs is a spark.Vimes takes on the identity of his mentor in the City Watch, John Keel, after the real Keel is killed by Carcer, who joins a secret police force known as the Unmentionables. Vimes has enough time to teach his younger self a few lessons about policing before that spark hits and the entire city erupts in violence. Now Vimes has to somehow keep the peace, keep himself (both of himselves) alive, and bring Carcer to justice. A tall order to be sure.This book is an interesting addition to the series because it provides a little more background on some of the Ankh-Morpork characters like Vimes, Lord Vetinari, Nobby Nobbs, and even Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler the crooked merchant. I was disappointed there was really nothing included about the wizards, especially the Librarian--who was turned into an orangutan in a magical accident; I kept waiting to see if there'd be an appearance by him in human form.My biggest complaint though is the story drags a little. Part of that is the nature of time travel stories like this. We already know there's going to be a riot because technically it's already happened. And we know in that riot there's going to be a final showdown between Vimes and Carcer, just like you knew Marty McFly would have to have it out with Biff Tannen in \\"Back to the Future.\\" It's inevitable, so let's just cut to the chase.Still, like most of these books, there's a good message underneath the action. In particular is the concept that the reason they're called \\"revolutions\\" is that they typically go in a circular fashion. Or in other words the new regime is rarely better than the old one. The main point of reference in the book is the French Revolution, only in this case no one loses their heads--literally at least.That is all."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Terry Pratchett has written over 30 books and Night Watch is, without a doubt, his best. A book that spins together wonderful intrigue and mystery in a way that would make Agatha Christie sit down and weep, and humor so witty and clever that Wodehouse would be rolling in his grave.If you're looking to find a great new book then check out Pratchett's Night Watch; it'll keep you hooked and probably cost you a lot more money as you end up buying the rest of his books!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This is the first Pratchett book I read. He has a great writing style that at times is hilarious and others deeply touching. There are two great \\"so you would like to...\\" lists out there that give the exact chronology of the series. The Night watch section of the Disk World Series is the only one I've started but I can honestly say I would rank this up there with Robert Aspirin's \\"Myth-\\" series and is almost as funny as Adams' Hitchhickers Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"A Tale of Two Cities falls through a crack in the space time continuum and lands in the hands of a very strange librarian. One with orange hair. All over. I have read as much Terry Pratchett as I could get hold of. No, this is not like his other books (with the possible exception of Maurice and His Educated Rats). Both have a stream of darkness running through them which lends them a totally different flavor (air, ambiance, meaning?) I have just finished reading this book again and I have to say that I think it is one of his finest. \\"I laughed, I cried, I fell down....\\" Get this book and read it. Then read it again. It grows on you. Sort of like Nobby. Of course, Nobby looks like all sorts of things grow on him..."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I love a funny book that really examines what it means to make difficult choices. Even though this book is set in a fictional world, which is usually not my thing, the dialogue and situations make me feel completely at home. Pratchett's dialogue is great. the characters really come alive. Just a really funny and moving book. I'm picking up the others in the series!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"As a relatively new reader of Disc World, I thought this may well be one of the best. Of course, it is funny. Pratchett's humor never fails. The story line is compelling, and gives us the back story of Sam Vimes and the mysterious Lord Vetinari. But we also feel the passion of Sam Vimes, and his fierce struggle to reform the Night Watch, fighting the forces of evil, and making Ankh-Morpork the city we have come to know and love."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Like all Disc World stories this is great reading, effortlessly transporting the reader into another world and time. It is a pity that more of Terry Pratchett's novels aren't made into movies."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I loved this book and have re-read it several times as it never gets \\"old\\" for me. Classic Pratchett Characters and subtle barbs and jokes, but all the while sufficient tension to keep you looking for more and looking for the next surprise or revelation. One of the Best, I thought."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Although there isn't a Terry Pratchett book that I don't like, this one is special because we are given glimpses into the early lives of characters that we have previously only known as adults.The reader does an excellent job and this is a recording that I will listen to over and over again when I want some humor in my life."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Sam Vimes, commander of Ankh-Morpork's City Watch, is chasing a killer named Carcer during an intense storm. During the pursuit, both Vimes and Carcer become the victims of a magical accident that transports them back in time 40 years. If Vimes wants to return to his rightful time and rejoin his wife who's expecting their first child, he must make sure things happen the way they originally did 40 years ago.That becomes very unlikely when Carcer murders John Keel, the Sergeant responsible for training Vimes to be a good copper 40 years ago. Now Vimes has to take on the identity of Keel and train his younger self, uh himself.Night Watch is Pratchett's 28th story which takes place on Discworld, a flat world that rests on the shoulders of four elephants which in turn are standing on the shell of A'Tuin, a giant turtle swimming through space.The books have ranged from good to fantastic and Night Watch is one of the best so far. I thoroughly enjoyed the chance Pratchett gives with this one to see what many of his characters were like 40 years ago.As always, Pratchett's humor is there, but it's no longer the primary reason I read his books as it once was. With each successive book, it's more apparent just how brilliant he is. On the surface his books are lighthearted fantasy novels. But deeper down, they're amazingly insightful social commentaries. They're the types of books that should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"The great thing about Discworld is that time is of little consequence to Pratchett's universe and because of this fans are treated to a little history lesson in how the Night Watch became an important part of how Ankh-Morpork functions. Vimes in hot pursuit of maniacal killer is transported back to the watch of his youth and he in essence becomes his own mentor. A young Nobby Nobs, who becomes a much more sympathetic figure when Pratchett reveals his past, a rookie Sam Vimes, and a young assassin named Havelock all play a role in this adventure as Vimes desperately tries to keep time from fraying by playing the role of the hero of the events that are to come. This Ankh-Morpork is different than the one the readers are familiar with, it has a darkness that ways heavily on the novel. This ones for the real fans who want a glimpse of Ankh-Morpork's past and while a few loose ends are tied a bit too quickly NIGHT WATCH is another enjoyable addition to the series."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Night Watch is part of the extremely successful Discworld novels by Terry Pratchett. Though it is still satire and fantasy comedy, it has a noticeably different tone from any other novel of his. While the majority of the books are fairly light in tone, and sometimes quite fantastic in plot, this novel is very different. There is a darker shade to this story, and some more violence than is common in these novels. There are less full on laughs here, mainly serving as off-shoots from the generally serious plot.This of course is a good thing to my mind. Discworld, and satire in general, can be serious while at the same time being good.Most of all though, this is a story about Vimes. He's really the only main character here, and the fact that I like the character makes that a good thing.On characters, the villain of the piece, Carcer, is a bit of a cardboard cutout. Unlike Vimes he has no real motive, personality or story, except to be the stock maniac. In an odd way this almost works, since it allows the reader to focus entirely on Vimes.The portrayal of the city thirty years before is one of the best things about this story. The change between the two is highlighted, as is the subtle brilliance of Vetinari in both past and present.Overall, I like this the most of any of the Discworld books for its story. It's not the funniest of them, but I think it's the one I've enjoyed the most."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Certainly one of the stronger Discworld books, and plays with some more potent emotions than usual. As well, the whole device of using the city past as dystopia was interesting, quite different from the norm for genre writers showing an oppressive setting. There's a lot to like scene to scene, with atmosphere and direct moments. The book also benefits from one of Pratchett's epiphanies (Vimes's recognition of Ankh-Morpork as a process, and then later ensuring Carcer would get a fair trial in the same spirit) and, in Carcer himself, one of the series' more creepy and plausible villains.One implicit strand on this novel is that while earlier versions of most of the usual Ankh-Morpork cast show up as younger versions--Vimges, Colon, Nobbs, Vetinari--Carrot is completely absent. This makes sense, after all he arrived at the city in Guards! Guards! and this work obviously needed to be set before that, but it also fits with the general atmosphere of the piece. This is an environment where naive optimism gets hammered out more than it changes the world, where political change derives from back stage political decisions that doesn't alter essentials.Still, for the hype I've heard of this book I was left a bit disappointed, and it perhaps indicates some of the aesthetic limits of the Discworld, that for all of Pratchett's good comedy and neatly rendered ideas he's not on the level of writers like Mieville, Valente or Kiernan. It seems Pratchett holds back at crucial points, and will go for the bit of satire or historical parallel over full emotional commitment to his invented situation. Specific things that bugged in Night Watch:-It seems Pratchett gave in too much to the temptation to make cute continuity references. Was it really necessary for Vimes to encounter younger versions of as many people as he did?-Vimes himself has grown to be a bit tedious, post Men at Arms. Too self-assured and self-righteous for it to be great fun spending a few hundred pages in his head, and his struggle with his urge to rage is rendered over-simplistically ('the monster inside him stirred')-Vetinari's presence was largely a wasted opportunity, making a lot of jokes on invisibility and rendering him as unexplainedly helpful rather than showing him developing towards the political thinker seen in other books. Given the most looming contrast between the Night Watch era and \\"modern\\" Ankh-Morpork is Vetinari's role as Patrician, that seems to leave a bit of a void at the heart of the politics in this work.Still, overall quite enjoyable and interesting, and I found it far more satisfactory than Unseen Academicals.Similar to and better than: Terry Pratchett's Thief of TimeSimilar to and worse than: Yevgeny Zamyatin's We"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"A Discworld novel that goes beyond mere comedy fantasy. This is Terry Pratchett at his literary best. When Pratchett is reassessed by critics and writers in the future, not just as a satirist or a fantasy writer but as a novelist, this will be regarded as his best achievement and the quintessence of his psychological story-telling style."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I am a fan of Discworld and I honestly believe this is the best of the Watch books and of all of Pratchett's work. Night Watch hits all the proper notes: it's funny as heck, has great character work (especially with Sam Vimes), and can get quite emotional."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"There was one really fatal flaw in Night Watch. It just wasn't funny. Instead of the usual hilarious humor, we had Terry Pratchett pontificating on revolution, repression and who cares? This may be an occupational hazard for best-selling authors: deciding that they have a mandate to Share their Views.There was one good joke at the start of the book, where Vimes get depressed because the Guild of Assassins is no longer trying to kill himl, but that first joke was the last. I was used to laughing out loud at Discworld, but this time I barely smiled. Calling the secret police \\"The Unmentionables\\" could have set off a satire on The Untouchables, but no such luck. Just one more missed opportunity."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"First of all, I would like to point out this is a very good book (at least in my opinion). Second I would like to point out that I was relieved when I finished this book. Lately in many of Prachett's books (and also books by Neil Gaiman) that I have read, I felt a feeling of regret, partially because of the ending of such an admirable book, but partially because of a feeling that the imaginative world that was created was now closed. I did not get that feeling while reading this book.Now I would like to point out my views:1. There have been a few views that this book is not as funny as some of Prachett's earlier works. This is not exactly true. There is as much humor in this book as the others, it is just mostly crammed into the first 50 pages or so. After that the book is mostly more serious until the last twenty pages, when it gets more humorous2. I found the book rather inspiring on its views on how government and law actually work (at least here)3. I just found it very cool that you can glimpse younger versions of certain characters, including Nobby as a young street urchin, Colon as an uncertain corporal, Vetinari as a young assasin with revolutionary ideas on camuflage, Rosie Palm as a middle rank &quot;seamstress&quot;, Reg Shoe alive, and of course Vimes as a young, naive recruit.4. However, if you don't know who the older versions of the above characters are, this is not the novel for you. Read the other Watch books and Theif Of Time to get the full experience of reading this book5. The very last joke in the book, in the last two paragraphs or so of the entire book(the one about Vimes's cigar, which is saying a bit too much about it) is both extremely funny and casts new light on a scene which happens much earlier."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Night watch is just my thrid pratchett book after the Science of Discworld 1 and 2, and the Amazing Maurice. As reviewers pointed out the story may not be as hilarious as earlier pratchett books, and this book did not get me laughing many times. What I appreciate about this book the most is not the laughs (there are many other books if you want just brainless comedy), but the fact that this book is trying to present a morality issue about what is bad and right in times of crisis. This is very evident about the decisions Sam Vimes had to take during the revolt. The summing moment to me was when the madam asked Vimes on whose side he was on the revolutionaries or the current patriach. Vimes said neither. I don't know if these morality issues have been touched before in earlier books but I do find that it makes this book worth its salt."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"The best Discworld novel I've read to date, and I own them all....and have read most of them three or four times. Consistently funny, as well as emotionally powerful and philosophically both deep and sound (although you can read it as a straight, non-philosophical story, too, if you're tired).Buy this book. Now. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Another solid effort from Terry Pratchett. The Discworld novels that revolve around the Watch are undoubtedly my favorites. If you're familiar with the series you'll recognize the cast of this novel immediately. Commander Vimes (the central character) is second only to Corporal Carrot in terms of my favorite Discworld protagonists. &quot;Night Watch&quot; takes us back (literally) to the beginnings of the Watch, how it was formed and the politics and intrigue behind the government of Ankh-Morpork as we know it in all the other Discworld novels. Hilarious, well-thought out and at times even downright poignant. If you've never read a Pratchett novel you may want to start earlier in the series, this one's got some inside jokes and some plot points that will be unfamiliar to &quot;newbies&quot;, nevertheless highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Forgive the corny joke. This is a marvelous book, the first that really focuses completely on Sam Vimes. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is somewhat more serious than previous Discworld books. There is still a lot of dark humour (and how can you not laugh when Nobby reflects upon Keel giving him a spoon?) and tonnes of laughs. At the same time Pratchett makes you think about the &quot;might-have-beens&quot; in life. It's a marvelous book; READ IT!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"The conundrum here is-1) Yes it IS the best Pratchett yet that I've read (though I haven't read them all)2) If you've never read Pratchett before, don't start here.Sam Vimes is my favourite character...any guy who can run naked in the snow with nasty things after him has my admiration...Jingo is a good book to read to get know this most excellent of Pratchett's characters! Night Watch focuses on Vimes quite a bit and readers might miss Carrot and other more recent characters. It was really interesting to see Vimes young and Vetinari makes his usual cool-as-ice appearance. I wish HE had a book all to himself!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"It is currently a quarter till 3AM, and I'm putting off bed for just a little longer just so I can share what I feel about this awesome book. Skimming over a few reviews, I have noticed that there have been a few complaints that this book isn't as funny as the others. This is true.However, this doesn't mean it's a bad book. Far from it. While it has comedy (I, personally, love Detritus' jody at the beginning of the book), this is a much more serious book about a new father trying to get back home to his wife and newborn baby, while practically impossible odds face him.What's also interesting about this book is that we learn the origins of a few older characters (Nobby, Colon, and Reg Shoe for example) and why they are what they are today.My only complaint is that, while it has improved slightly, the book covers are still hideous. I don't see why we can't receive the Brit covers. But that's hardly worth demoting a star from the rating.I'm a slow reader, and I finished this book in an approx. total of 9-12 hours. It is an adventurous page-turner that'll keep your heart pumping and give you a laugh when needed."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Excellent work; tough to put down long enough to sleep; actually rates about a 4.7. I suspect TP was a murder mystery writer in another life. He opens Night Watch well, with a question and a few clues &lt;lilacs?>. Throught the rest of the book he proceeds to allow you to uncover the answer.The technique works for me, although, as in most of his recent books, TP gives in to the temptation to substitute irony for comedy. STILL:Vimes is his usual fuming, funny self, out to keep the peace and everyone's body parts where they belong. I particularly enjoyed Detritus' marching song (true to the troll) in the beginning, though I missed the 'whiz-BANG' of Lady Ramkin's dragons, and Carrot's silly, noble 'dudley doright' attitude."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"It's rare that an author can keep writing one series, churning them out at speed, and still keep the novels fresh! Pratchett's secret seems to be that he doesn't spit out novels about the same characters over and over: he has essentially split the Discworld into many almost completely separated series, connected only by cameo appearances of some favorite characters.Night Watch focuses, not surprisingly, on Captain Vimes the Night Watch. This particular story reads much more like a science fiction novel than many of his works, with a pretty common sci-fi theme, but made fresh by Pratchett's perspective.The reuse of such a common theme was why I only rated this a 4, not a 5. However, this book is a great read, totally worth the money, and the time!!!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Mr. Pratchett does it once again. Any fan of his should not, and will not be surprised. What does he do? Well, since you ask....In this his 28ath novel of the Diskworld series; Mr Pratchett gives us a very healthy dose of philosphy disguised as a humorous (actually humorous is too tame a word) novel.In this particular novel Sam Vimes (my personal favorite of all of the diskworld characters) is the central character in a tale that deals with the potential problems that could ensue if you are able to travel back in time and be there at a pivitol moment in your own life. Also included is a healthy dose of the nature of right and wrong, and good versus evil.While the above sounds rather heavy, it is delivered with Mr. Pratchetts world class humor and an eye for fleshing out his characters and the world they inhabit.Sam Vimes is fast becoming one of the most \\"real\\" characters to ever inhabit the world of fiction. We see him complete with all of his character traits, both the noble and just, as well as some of his less admirable traits. It all serves to make him a real person. In this novel we are also treated to glimpses of Sgt Colon, Nobby Nobs, Lord Vetinari, Reg Shoe, Mrs Palm (rad the book to find out her first name), as well as some of the characters we have only heard about in the previous novels.The book is 338 pages and they turn one after the other almost of their own volition. This is one of those (rare) books that just grabs you and won't let you go until the last page is read.As for myself, as soon as I am done writing this, I am going to sit down, and re-read it, for I find that with any of the Diskworld novels, each re-reading brings new and deeper joys."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Here we find Vimes vaulted through time, inadvertanly following Carcer, one of the smartest and least moral of any criminal. Vimes must teach his young self the ropes of being a copper while trying not to mess up the time continuum, Althewhile bringing some much needed wisdom to the watch and the past.Page 125:'Like petty criminals everywhere, the watchmen prided themselves on there being some depths to which they would not sink. There had to be some things below you, even if it was only mudworms.'Page 136:'It wasn't that the city was lawlwss. It had plenty of laws. I just didn't offer many opportunities not to break them. Swing didn't seem to have grasped the idea that the system was supposed to take criminals and, in some rought-and-ready fashon, force them into becoming honest men. Instead, he'd taken honest men and turned them into criminals.'Page 255:'Who knew what evil lurked in the hearts of men? A copper, that's who. After ten years, you thought you'd seen it all, but the shadows always dished up more. You saw how close men lived to The Beast. You found that people like Carcer were not mad. The were incredibly sane. The were simply men without a shield. They'd looked at the world and realized that all the rules didn't have to apply to them, not if they didn't want them to. They weren't fooled by all the little stories. They shook hands with The Beast.'Seems pretty deep, and it is. However, would you believe that most of the book is actually funny? I'd started reading Pratchett a year ago and I'm still amazed that he can infuse laughter with so much wisdom. Though, I suppose you'd go crazy if you couldn't laugh at this mad world."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This is the best Watch book yet. I would give it more stars if I could. It isn't a good place to start reading either the Disc World books or the City Watch series. While this book does contain the expected funny satire and puns they are for the most part found at the beginning of the book. This book is a darker, more serious look at the characters and the city. The book introduces the younger selves of many of the older watch members and Vetinari. It explains how Vimes went from an idealistic newbie to a disallusioned drunk. This transformation isn't spelled out but can be discerned from what the older Vimes sees in his younger self and what we know of him from the previous books. It is a book about heroes, redemption, evil and the price of freedom."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Terry Pratchett takes readers to Ankh-Morpork past in this installment of the Discworld series.

Not only does he encounter himself as a young watchman, but he also arrives on the eve of a revolution.

Even if you've never read any of the Discworld books, you can't help but enjoy Night Watch. Terry Pratchett has a way of making us look at our world and ourselves through the eyes of wizards, trolls, gnomes and other characters from a disc-shaped world that flies through the cosmos on the back of four elephants and a giant turtle.Sam Vimes (Duke, Knight, and Commander of the Ankh Morpork City Watch) travels into the past to a darker, meaner Ankh Morpork on the edge of change. In this Ankh Morpork, revolution (or at least the threat of people throwing rocks) is in the air. The old regime (a paranoid madman) is on the way out and the new (a slightly less paranoid, not-quite-as-mad man) is on the way in. To make it back home Vimes just has to make sure nothing changes. And yet, he just can't let things happen the way they did the first time.This isn't one of Pratchett's funniest books. But I think it is one of his most meaningful. I can't say enough about this book. (not for lack of trying, though...)"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Whilst about to apprehend a homicidal maniac called Carcer, Commander of the Watch Samuel Vimes is caught in a funny sort of magical storm and wakes up - naked - back (about 25 years?) in his own past, when the mad, bad and paranoid Lord Winder is Patrician, Vimes' wife Sybil is a 16 year old girl living at home with her father, and Vimes himself is a young lance-corporal: inexperienced, and not a little idealist.Those were... These are, troubled times. A rebellion is getting ready bubble up and when it does it won't be pretty. Vimes knows how it's going to turn out, and who's going to die. Trouble is, if he manages to save them, then the future he came from might not exist. And then there's still Carcer, who's loose and dangerous in this past version of Ankh Morpork.Certainly the most sombre Discworld novel ever, Night Watch is still very funny and never for a moment lost my interest. This book shows you one of events that make Anhk Morpork the functioning-against-all-evidence metropolis that it becomes; and it will give your the answers to, among others, these questions:Just who - that is if you can see him - is that young Assassin in the (non-Guild regulation) dark green outfit? Why is Nobby, of all people, wearing a lilac blossom? And how exactly did Reg Shoe become a zombie?By the end of Night Watch, the reader will never be in doubt of what any reader of Pratchett's phenomenal series would already know, that, both figuratively and physically, Vimes and Vetinari rule."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Night Watch (2002) is the twenty-ninth novel in the Discworld series, following The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents. In many ways, this work is a prequel to the other night watch novels. It has many familiar characters as well as some of their 30 years ago selves, including Fred Colon, Nobby Nobbs, Reg Barclay, Havelock Vetinari, and even a younger Sam Vimes. There are also numerous new characters of interest. And then there are those madcap Monks of History.Sam Vines, now Duke and Commander of the night watch, is accidentally conveyed into the past while chasing a cold-blooded cop killer. Vimes is injured and both he and the killer are snatched up by a time storm and land in the Shades of 30 years past. Vimes has been knocked out by the time travel experience and is robbed while unconscious. He is found by one of Anhk-Morpork's street seamstresses and taken to a pox doctor for treatment. Upon awakening, Vimes hides his own name, taking the identity of John Keel. Then he tries to find the watch house and his own home with confusing results.After floundering around, he realizes his situation and tries to contact the wizards at Unseen University in order to be returned home, but is arrested by the night watch for disturbing the peace. Later, he discovers that Keel is a former watchman from Pseudopolis who was planning on becoming an Ankh-Morpork night watchman, but who was killed immediately upon arrival. Vimes convinces the captain that he is the real John Keel and is hired on as Sergeant-at-arms, thereby becoming the second-in-command of the night watch.As usual, Pratchett takes a serious plot, adds zany twists and nontraditional characters, and then mixes in philosophic observations on thinly disguised modern foibles. At one point, I laughed so hard that I couldn't read and, for several minutes, I couldn't even look at the page without re-triggering the laughter. Luckily, I was reading in bed rather than in a chair.Selection of the best Discworld novel would be very difficult; Night Watch is just as good as the previous books, but is it better? Since I have enjoyed each one in the series after multiple readings, maybe whichever you are currently reading is the best at that time.If you are a Discworld fan, you will enjoy this book. And if you are not a Discworld fan, what is keeping you; go out and buy The Color of Magic and start the experience. Let the laughter begin.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Terry Pratchett reinvents Sam Vimes, his finest creation, in this stunning work. Gone, to a large degree, are the puns and comic events, and in their place is a gripping and occasionally melancholy tale of Ankh-Morpork's past. Vimes is forced to relive the days of his youth as the man who trained him, and sees those diffuclt times through new eyes. Along the way, we meet many characters in their youth, learn a lot about the city, and get very much inside Vimes' head.The result is a work of near-brilliance, an examination of the human condition, the cities we build, the evil and the good in our world, and the role one man can play. Vimes has evolved over the years from a rough-hewn satire of a beat cop to one of the most intriguing and human of heroes. Here, without Vetinari or Carrot or Lady Sybil to play off of, he dominates the story as he never has before, and a rich tapestry becomes that much richer.If you've never read a Discworld book, best to start with the earlier ones. But if you've been to the Disc before, you must come back again and read this thriliing, gripping, sad, funny, heartrending, heartwarming and amazing novel."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"While chasing a psychopathic mass killer, Night Watch commander Sam Vimes, and the killer, are plunged into the past of Sam's youth. Once there, they can't help change history. The killer murders the man who taught young Vimes what he knows about policing. Unless he can apprehend the killer and return to the present, Vimes risks the destruction of the city he loves. But even if he succeeds, he knows that his actions in the past will change everything--including his marriage and his prospective child.Author Terry Pratchett has carved out a reputation as a writer who both makes you laugh--and think. The Discworld fantasy series is uniformly excellent, but NIGHT WATCH rates near the top of even this fine series. Vimes is a fully realized character. It is interesting to watch him relate to his younger self, and to the men who will someday be his leader and most faithful followers. Philosophical questions about fate vs. choice, and the nature of evil are disguised in witty dialogue and introspection.Pratchett's Discworld world is silly and funny--with its unseen University, the seemingly omniscient Vetinari, the mostly incompetent police force that nevertheless manages to keep order in a disorderly city, and its treckle mines--but it grows on you and Pratchett moves beyond absurd to deliver some real insights.All right, this review was a bit of a rave--I'll admit it. I picked up NIGHT WATCH expecting a laugh and put it down with a deeper appreciation of Pratchett as an author and of the world I live in--no reader can ask for more."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"The best Discworld to date. That means, it hits you very hard under the belt. It's all been said in the other comments, except I just wanted to pick up on the word poignancy, and link it back to one of Pratchett's inspirations for this book, the Paris Commune. For 'the wearing of the Lilac', read 'cherries behind their ears', and idealist revolutionaries barricaded in the Montmartre cemetery who know they will soon be dead. Anyone touched by this novel could read up on that particular passage of history. Poignant."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I first read \\"Night Watch\\" when I was 12 years old. I loved it then, but it wasn't until I grew older that I fully understood the book how I think Pratchett intended certain people to understand it. And only certain people can (i.e., those of a Vimes-ish disposition). I must've read it maybe 10 times growing up, but even these later readings didn't hold a candle to the epiphany of this book after I became a prison guard. To re-read these pages from a guard's perspective is a completely new experience of the Vimes series, and \\"Night Watch\\" is by far the most profound, while also cheering the tarnished souls guarding..whatever. Who guards the guards, indeed.. On a final comment: one of my favorite new experiences with the Vimes series is reading about Nobby Nobbs or Carrot or other characters and SEEING THEM AROUND ME AT WORK. It adds a whole new level to such genius humor."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This book takes your favourite characters in the night watch and lets you see them as they were before you know them as they are. A brilliant book with inevitability and surprise that takes your for a ride you didn't know you didn't expect."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Revolution is coming to Ankh-Morpork, as the city rises up against Patrician Lord Winder, who runs the city with a gang of secret police at his disposal. The would-be new Patrician, Lord Snapcase, turns out to be no better. Setting himself against these vicious rulers of the city is Sam Vimes, commander of the night watch, who gets dropped 30 years into his own past via means of a magical bolt of lightning gone awry. Sam must try to shape up the deeply corrupt night watch and get them ready to take on Lord Winder's forces, even as he worries about how he's going to get back home to his wife.This book moves at a fast, exciting pace and keeps the action coming in heaping doses. Sam Vimes has his work cut out for him as he shapes up the night watch and takes his younger self under wing and prepares for the big battles he knows are coming. He is assisted in his endeavors by a couple of monks who are experts on time and who are trying to help Sam get home again. Otherwise he is pretty much on his own, surrounded by various fools, lazy types, sadists and idiots who make his life interesting. To top it all off, a dangerous psychopath named Carcer has come through time with him and is pursuing his personal vendetta against Vimes. Sam has to deal with all these balls in the air and do it fast, because history is coming, and it will not be pretty.This is a darker book than most in the discworld series. Sam is dealing with matters of life and death, and while there is plenty of humor in this book, it is muted by the many tragedies that Sam must handle during his exile in time. The time period he has gone to is a grim time of unrest and outright revolution, and good men are going to die no matter what he does or how well he does it. This sense of doom hangs over the entire novel, and as it slowly comes true one wonders if Sam will be able to hold it all together long enough to get home again. A good read, but a thoughtful one."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I've been a big fan of Pratchett for a long time now and I've re-read most of the discworld books.

Iam particularly fond of the satire on political and socital issues of our modern times."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I come pletely enjoyed this book. This was the third book that I have read about Sam Vines and I have enjoyed everyone of them."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Always one of my favorite Discworld novels. This one does as much asGuards! Guards!to develop the story of Sam Vimes.It also features the recently-introduced History Monks and plays out Pratchett's sense of time travel in one of the most narratively-satisfying ways I've seen in fiction. It's amazing how many different kinds of story the man can incorporate into his core series, and even more amazing how completely he masters the format. And rather than diluting or breaking his story world, it only gets richer every time."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"The Discworld books are always entertaining. They make me laugh a lot, and amazingly for such funny books, they occasionally make me cry. Of all the Discworld series Pratchett has, the men of the Night Watch are my favorites. (This group of characters start off in \\"Guards, Guards\\" a wonderful book.) This is a great addition to the Night Watch and the life of Samuel Vimes."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Amazon listing for this states Sept 30, 2003 printing. The copy I received is the Oct 2003 printing in which pages 169-200 are completely missing. I read to page 168 then it skipped to pages 217-248 and then it repeats with pages 201 to 248. If it had restarted from page 169 after those two errors at least I could have read through & it would have been merely annoying, but there's a chunk of 32 pages of the storyline completely gone. Perhaps there are other errors but I was so disgusted after the 2nd mistake I borrowed the hardback from our library and it was fine. So if you purchase this book check it to make sure your edition doesn't have these errors."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Not a typical Watch book. Our hero Sam Vimes accidentally slips about 30 years back in time in pursuit of a criminal, only to encounter his younger self as a wet-behind-the-ears Lance Constable. Will he find a way back to Sybil? Will Carcer (our criminal villain) kill him first? Can Vimes prevent an uprising of the common folk from turning into a massacre? Moving back in time leaves Ankh-Morpork free of many (but not all) Watch favorite characters (the book is quite Carrotless, troll, dwarf, and almost zombie-free). This reduces the slapstick and rat-pie quotient significantly but if you prefer Vimes' hardboiled cop to those hijinks, you will like this a lot. It's quite thrilling, actually, and a lot of fun seeing many of the Watch series' human characters in younger form."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Overall this is a good book. The characters are interesting, and I definately loved seeing the young versions of some of my old favorites. However, I couldn't help but feel that a lot of this novel was just a rehash of some of Pratchett's earlier works. The whole rebellion thing, for example, is very familiar to the events of &quot;Men At Arms&quot; where Carott turns the Watch into a makeshift militia. Still, I enjoyed reading this book, and I would definately recommend it to any fans of the series (like you haven't already pre-ordered it)."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This is one of the best Pratchett books I've ever read. I don't need to go into details, they're already mentioned, suffice to say that I read it in one sitting, lent it to one friend and got it back from another. One thing annoyed me though, anorak that I am; at the beginning of the book Keel is buried under a 'simple wooden cross' but at the end Vimes finds himself pinned up against Keel's 'headstone'. Aaargh! Where have all the copy-editors gone? 'Nuff said. Read, enjoy and become enthralled by the Discworld."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I rate books on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is terrible, 5 is an average book that may still be worth a read, and 10 is a book that breaks on you like a religious experience. Very few books, in my opinion, would warrant a \\"9\\" or \\"10\\".Writing Quality: 6/10.I waffled a little on this score. If you watch the Academy Awards, you may have noticed that comedies almost always get snubbed. Put simply, critics like to see drama, heartbreak, and poignancy. Funny literature gets snubbed too, especially when the funny isn't just funny, but silly, too. Pratchett has no problem with getting silly for a laugh. He loves puns, and silly names, and the book is full of them. Ultimately, I worry that I am snubbing Pratchett with this score...maybe I should have given it a \\"7.\\" But I didn't because there was rarely a phrase that really stood out to me as exceptionally subtle or beautiful, not like I found in The Once and Future King, or even Neil Gaiman's The Graveyard Book. Certainly not like Moby-Dick or Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. Just lots of descriptions that made me smile while reading, and made me think, too. But making me think is a different category.Depth of Concept: 7/10.If I may have scored the writing quality a little low, then maybe I scored this a little bit high (I also scored The Once and Future King a \\"7\\" in this category). But I decided on a \\"7\\" because Pratchett incorporates satire about citizenship, government, and revolution that is at least insightful and clever, even if it is not brilliant. There is no question that Pratchett is a thinker, and that he wants his readers to think as well. Here's a passage that gives a good sense of Pratchett's more sober musings about society, and while it's a little biased (you'll not be surprised to know that Pratchett won a libertarian award for this novel), it's still intelligent, which is a bit of a breath of fresh air for a fantasy best-seller:\\"There were plotters, there was no doubt about it. Some had been ordinary people who'd had enough. Some were young people with no money who objected to the fact that the world was run by old people who were rich. Some were in it get girls. And some had been idiots as mad as Swing, with a view of the world just as rigid and unreal, who were on the side of what they called \\"The People.\\" Vimes had spent his life on the streets and had met decent men, and fools, and people who'd steal a penny from a blind beggar, and people who performed silent miracles or desperate crimes every day behind the grubby windows of little houses, but he'd never met The People.People on the side of The People always ended up disappointed, in any case. They found that The People tended not to be grateful or appreciative or forward-thinking or obedient. The People tended to be small-thinking and conservative and not very clever and were even distrustful of cleverness. And so, the children of the revolution were faced with the age-old problem: it wasn't that you had the wrong kind of government, which was obvious, but that you had the wrong kind of people.As soon as you saw people as things to be measured, they didn't measure up.\\"Rounded Characters: 5/10.I don't exactly fault Pratchett for his characters...frankly, they don't need to be incredibly ambiguous and realistically intelligent in order for this novel to work as a funny book, and as a thinking book. The protagonist is the strongest character, and he thinks a lot of thoughts about society and revolution that seem a rather thin stand-in for Pratchett's own thoughts. Other characters are mostly described for the sake of funniness, or to move the plot along. The emotional trajectory of the main character sometimes seems a little contrived for similar reasons. For instance, we learn at the beginning of the novel that Vimes is just hours away from becoming a father, but none of his introspective musings touch on this fact, not even when it appears he may never make it home to see his wife or baby. Why? Because this novel isn't about fatherhood. It's about revolution, and leadership, and duty, and preserving order.Well-Developed World: 6/10.If I were thinking about every discworld novel (there's what, 39 of them?) as a whole, probably I'd need to score this a little higher. But I like to think a book should be able to stand on its own. As a standalone book, it does a respectable job of presenting a distinct world and inhabiting it with distinctive characters of different classes and political persuasions. There are some good reasons to recommend this book, but \\"world-building\\" probably isn't at the top of the list.Page Turner: 8/10.Perhaps I could have scored this one point higher. It is probably the best-paced Pratchett book I have read, with a sympathetic protagonist and a real emergency situation that appears early and culminates near the end of the novel, in a mostly gripping series of tense, but still frequently humorous, scenes. The only reason I don't score it quite as high is that I didn't quite feel as connected to or as worried about the protagonist as I could have been. I pretty much assumed that in the end, everything would turn out all right, and that the process of completing the novel would be one of unraveling a mostly pleasant time-travelling puzzle. Still, at 8/10, this definitely qualifies as a page-turner.Kept Me Thinking: 7/10.Pratchett intersperses his humorous and action-oriented scenes with thoughtful musings on the part of the protagonist, just enough to keep me thinking about the political and social ramifications of the revolutions occurring in the book. I'd hardly say that it prompted any epiphanies, but I'd say that any thinker could be engaged by this book and have a good discussion with a friend or book group about it.___________________________________________________Overall Recommendation: 7/10.There are two reasons to suggest this novel, and the reasons apply to every Terry Pratchett book that I've read. First is that he's dang funny, and he creates some characters that are just a blast to read (although this book, probably more than the rest of his novels, delves into some of the darker recesses of how people can go bad). Second is that he also writes intelligently, and there's respectable satire and clever thinking scattered amongst all the silliness. The story zips along, and by the end of it, you've both had a lot of fun, and thought quite a lot more than you might have expected. This, as with most Terry Pratchett books, would make a great page-turner to read on the plane that you shouldn't feel at all guilty about. Not all Terry Pratchett is equal, and this is probably one of his best, but even the worse ones I'd still give a 6/10 recommendation for. What sometimes surprises me is how few Americans are really aware of Pratchett. He was the best-selling British author before J. K. Rowling came along.*I should be clear that I have not read the great majority of Pratchett's novels, and also that this novel, while perfectly entertaining as a stand-alone (the way I read it), would not be the recommended first place to start in Pratchett's DiscWorld cosmology.See my profile web page for an expanded review and other thoughts."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Very enjoyable.

If Sam Vimes is a favorite character of yours, or you don't mind the occasional serious books, then buy...*drum roll* NIGHT WATCH!!!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"First, the story. Commander Sam Vimes is blasted back in time along with a demented killer to take part in the revolutionary years of his youth. Assuming the persona of Watch Sergeant-at-Arms John Keel, Vimes guides his younger self in the ways of honest policing and tries to keep history on track so that he can get back to his wife and soon-to-be-born child. We see Ankh-Morpork in an earlier era before the rule of Vetinari, and come across many well-known characters still finding their place in the Discworld.This is a well-executed story and has enough to keep you interested. However, it lacks any real inventiveness and spark, instead relying on elements from previous Discworld novels; Carcer is a clone of Teatime, Captain Swing harks back to the villain of 'Guards! Guards!', all the supporting cast do and say largely what they have done in previous stories, and we get exactly the same wry descriptions of the denizens and neighbourhoods of Ankh-Morpork. And Sam Vimes. Oh, Sam Vimes. I am so tired of the man and hearing how wonderful he is. It is just bearable in this novel, but even here we have the set up for the infuriating way he is described in 'Thud!'. We need a humorous and rough copper, not a tragic hero.Pratchett also shows a little too much preoccupation with his social commentary on repression and democratic government, at the expense of having fun with the story. We will be able to draw real-life parallels ourselves without too much help, if we are given an engaging satire. After a while it feels less like a parody of 'Les Miserables' or 'A Tale of Two Cities' and more like an homage to them.I think the best years of the Discworld are behind us, but this is one of the stronger novels from the latter part of the series."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I don't know where this one fits in the Discworld series. Some of the (I think) 22 rate higher than others with me, but all are \\"4's\\" or \\"5's\\", so this one is among the \\"5's\\". Pratchett is an updated Johnathan Swift."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"The novel, Night Watch by Terry Pratchett, may not be a Shakespearian tragedy, but the books concept along with Pratchett's wit and humor make it well worth reading. Night Watch is one of Pratchett's Discworld novels. It tells the story of Commander Sam Vimes of the city watch. Vimes goes back in time and is forced to go back in time to revisit one of the dark parts of his life, when he was just starting out as an officer of the night watch, only this time his current self must play the role of the sergeant that taught him everything. Since Vimes already knows what is going to happen he has a lot of trouble figuring out what actions to take as he finds that it's harder to fix history than he thought. Vimes has the constant longing for his future, \\"He wanted to go home. He wanted it so much that he trembled at the thought\\" (273). And he fears that his actions in the past might change his future.Pratchett's excellent writing style held up to this slightly more serious book than he usually writes. Although Vimes's observations of the world around him do provide ample humor, Night Watch does have a more serious aspect to it, since Vimes is trying to ensure that his past self survives and that the future he left behind will not end up to only be a memory. It makes a person really examine his or her own past and realize how important the people in your life now matter to you. Pratchett skillfully weaves in this more serious side of the story with his usual assortments of puns, plays on words, and jokes. Pratchett really examines how hard it is to let the mistakes of the past happen all over again when Vimes is confronted with the choice of letting seven men die or trying to find a new past which may lead to a new future, \\"Supposing we don't lose? All they had to do was hold out...And there's seven unfilled graves in the cemetery...Would he be able to go back then? Supposing Madam was right, and he got offered the post of commander not as a bribe but because he'd earned it? That'd change history\\" (p273). Vimes has to wonder if taking the harder road of defending his men to try and keep them from being killed will end up erasing his happy future as a Duke with a loving wife, but his sense of humanity predetermines the choice he must make. This is one of the better parts of Pratchett's writing style, that his characters have such set, strong personalities that they never disappoint. Although Pratchett's endings are not always the perfect Disney endings where the charming prince marries the damsel in distress, the prince's squire will probably end up saving her and finding a suitable place for her to live.The novel, Night Watch, is sometimes confusing. That is one down fall of Pratchett's writing style. His characters are so well developed that in order for his books to keep from being predictable, his plot lines tend to be interesting, but fast moving and at times confusing. For instance from the beginning of the book to page fifty seven, the character of Vimes is knocked out and wakes up again several times. This can be confusing because Pratchett does not explain Vimes' passing out very much, or always give a cause for it immediately, making it hard for the reader to determine what happened and where Vimes is. Also since during most of the book there are two Vimes, past and future Vimes, it can sometimes be confusing who Pratchett is talking about, \\"Vimes patted the man's belt. \`Oh dear, what have we here a very nasty dagger. See this, Lance Constable Vimes?\\" (p138). It gets complicated since Vimes usually uses his last name when referring to his past self, while Pratchett always refers to Vimes' future self as Vimes as well and referring to past Vimes as Sam, and future Vimes is calling himself John Keel. When reading sometimes it take a moment to remember which one is being referred to.Despite the slight confusion, the book is very well written. His characters are well developed, and his plot lines are fun and interesting. If you enjoy any of his other books about the Ankh-Morpork city watch or if you found one of his other Disk world novels too slow of a read, I would highly recommend reading Night Watch."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"With \\"Night Watch\\" the Discworld series comes of age. The whimsical, humourous stories gave birth to a baby who matured into a dark, though-provoking novel. Don't be fooled, there are laughs aplenty, enough to satisfy any fan of slapstick, but this novel tackles broader themes and does so using intelligent tools. What is the nature of a policeman? Are they there to protect the people or uphold the government? And, when the government and the people end up on opposite sides, where does a policeman make his stand?Pratchett's novels have always flirted with social commentary. Night Watch, however, goes so far beyond flirting that they were already choosing drapes.A well-crafted tale, and a more mature take on the issues than many so-called 'serious' novels."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I would crawl through broken glass to get to read anything by Terry Pratchett---and this is one of my personal favorites of the Discworld novels!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"\\"Night Watch\\"This book stands out as an interesting change to the up till then series of DiskWorld novels.It focuses on one of the Diskworld's regular characters..\\"Samuel Vimes\\", the Chief of the \\"Watch\\" in the capital city of Ankh Morpork.In past novels, the references to how great a \\"copper\\" Sam Vimes is tends to be more past tense. The current Vimes, is a well to do Lord, a manager and the top of the food chain in the City's police force. He drives a desk most of the time. (between the adventures we get to read about of course)We know he was the best cop in Ankhs history, we saw him take the bedraggled Night Watch and transform it into the respectable force it is today, but we never saw first hand the part about him being this amazing flat foot.We've met him many times before over the course of the DiskWorld series, but this time things are different. The tone and atmosphere are somber from page one.In \\"Night Watch\\", we open with an anniversary of an undisclosed to us tragedy that befell the Watch in it's past, many officers were lost, and a quiet ceremony of the surviving officers \\"who were there on the line\\" attend,...This is not the typical Disk World Mood. We can sense the building tension long before the true meaning of this event is revealed.Next scene, Vimes is chasing a real bad guy across the roofs of Ankh, and end up on the roof of the Library of the Unseen University,.

I could not help but be convinced that the author has a true close relationship that inspires his reverence of the Police Force.And just getting to see Vimes in action,. as the \\"legend\\" was a great.Despite the familiar character names, we have the Diskworlds biggest departure in this Book, and the first time we truly see Vimes at his best.I can recommend this book to any one,. not just fan of the Disk."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This is the most coherent and believable (if you will) Discworld book I've yet read.

However, you need to have read some of the series in order to get all the little things about the different characters. The only bad thing about this book is that I don't really like the whole time travel concept of it. I liked seeing the characters when Sam Vimes is just starting out and is young and impressionable, but I didn't like having to go back in time and pretend to be someone else to do it. I love how Mr. Pratchett takes what's going on in our world today and gets his characters to make fun of and make statements about it. I really loved his social commentary about rebellions and political changes, not to mention how when a new man comes into an organization and slowly takes it over. I just find his series revealing about how others may see us and how we do what we do. How funny it really sounds to others. I would highly recommend this book to others who have read the series. If you haven't started the series then you definitely need to get on it."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This is the second Pratchett Discworld book I've read, and while I wouldn't say NIGHT WATCH was \\"a book I couldn't put down\\", it was \\"a book I enjoyed picking up\\". I rate it 4.5 stars - oh, what the heck, round it up to 5.As far as I'm concerned, time travel is always a bit gimmicky; but, in NIGHT WATCH, it plays only a background role, and it is done in a unique way... anyway, with Pratchett, you know going in that you aren't going to be dealing with reality.I'm impressed with Pratchett's ability to make me laugh, or at least chuckle, so many times while reading his books. This is truly a unique gift. I'm also impressed how much I get taken in by his main characters - you can't help rooting for these guys... and the Vimes main character in NIGHT WATCH is no exception; I found myself really pulling for him when he deals with the REALLY bad guys (like Carcer, and The Unmentionables). And, besides the good guys and the bad guys, there is also all the usual assortment of oddball characters thrown into the mix, and you don't know what side they will end up on, in the final big struggle at the end of this book.For my next Pratchett book, I intend to read MONSTEROUS REGIMENT... I had lent three Pratchett books that I'd picked up from Amazon, and other sources, to a friend at work, and he has since become a HUGE Terry Pratchett fan - I expect he will be loaning me some of the books he's picked up soon (although he tells me the earlier Discworld books aren't as good as the later ones from the series)."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Night Watch is a funny novel filled with serious messages. The book is reminiscent of Joseph Heller's Catch 22 and Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales in that it is trying to convey the author's opinion on things that happen in their respective worlds. However, all three of these books mask their opinion (frequently criticism) with an amusing plot.The beginning of Night Watch introduces us to the character of Sam Vimes. It is the eve of the thirtieth anniversary of a small but memorable revolution. Sam Vimes is the Commander of Ankh-Morpork's City Watch. Ankh-Morpork is a fictional city in Pratchett's fantasy world, Discworld. Vimes is a practical \\"copper\\" (policeman). He bends the rules when he needs to, and heeds them when he doesn't need to bend them. For instance, he isn't afraid to fight dirty, with brass knuckles and such. The criminals he's fighting do it, so \\"fight fire with fire\\". He's not afraid of taking risks, especially when those risks can further a good cause. In fact, he showed annoyance at being taken off the Assassins Guild's register, \\"it [being on the register] showed that he was annoying the rich and arrogant people who ought to be annoyed.\\" Vimes also won't hesitate to chase after a murderous criminal himself, even if he is the Commander of the City Watch. Vimes is obviously one of those characters that feel he has ascended too far, and he yearns to go back to the time when he was doing the dirty work on the streets; not sitting at his desk pushing papers. Ironically, his wish is granted. On his ill-fated chase after the homicidal criminal, Carcer, on the eve of the revolution, Vimes is transported back in time thirty years, along with Carcer. Vimes is also aware of the events that will occur in the near future. Many unnecessary deaths occurred as a result of the revolution. And so he is faced with a hard choice. Does he allow things to occur the same way they did the first time around, which will allow him to come back to the future he once knew? Or does he change things, and prevent the needless deaths of some of his compatriots? Does he even have a choice? Or has the path of fate already been laid out?Terry Pratchett is no stranger to fantasy books. Night Watch is one of Pratchett's thirty Discworld novels, which are all fantasy books set in the same world with the same characters. All of his books have a purpose, and using Discworld, Pratchett has said many things about the state of our world. In Night Watch, this is most certainly the case. Pratchett tells us his thoughts on revolutions and social unrest. The book is written in the third-person, but it is focused on one central character...Sam Vimes. Pratchett uses Vimes and the plot around him to portray his own personal beliefs. For example, on page 249 he writes, \\"...Some had been idiots as mad as Swing, with a view of the world just as rigid and unreal, who were on the side of what they called \`The People.' Vimes had spent his life on the streets and had met decent men, and fools, and people who'd steal a penny from a blind beggar... but he'd never met The People. People on the side of The People always ended up disappointed, in any case...And so, the children of the revolution were faced with the age-old problem: it wasn't that you had the wrong kind of government, which was obvious, but that you had the wrong kind of people.\\" This is one of the few occasions in which Pratchett actually spells out his beliefs for the reader. Most of the time, you are meant to discern it from the actions and words of the fictional characters in the fictional plot.Because of this, Night Watch is a versatile book in terms of reading level. It is a light and amusing read if you want it to be, and this is perfectly all right. However, if you aspire to, you can choose to truly think about what's happening in the book, and try to connect the events occurring in this fictional world to events that occur in our world. Much of the material in the book can be related to revolutions like the French Revolution of the late 18th century and the Russian Revolution of the 20th century.Night Watch is a thoroughly enjoyable book with a fabulous balance of laughter and serious contemplation. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading in general and feels the need for a split side combined with a splitting headache!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"No need to write much -- this is far and away the very best of Pratchett's discworld novels. This pulls away from the series novel onus -- oddly enough, though, it is the one book in this series that requires that you have read one or more of the others to fully enjoy.It is witty, melancholy, rompous, gently cynical, open-hearted and loving toward its characters -- even the bad guys."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Sam Vimes has quite a lot of problems - his wife is delivering their first-born and a maniac killer attacks his watchman. And it is *the* anniversary. Small wonder the man wishes to be back in those beautiful old days of his youth, when everything was simplier.But it's Discworld. Such thoughts are dangerous - they may too easily turn true. And they do.Cast thirty years back, without money, weapons, friends and with the maniac killer wanting his blood, Vimes is forced to fight against everything - time, history and rapidly multiplying enemies. And it turns out that the anniversary he was hoping to celebrate might be the one of his own death.This book is much darker than the previous ones. We learn how Ankh-Morpork did look like without Vetinari in charge, and it is an ugly sight.The city is about to change one mad Patrician for another. People are moving, revolution rises its head, decent folks place all their hopes in an unworthy man. Only Vimes knows better.It is an absolute must-read for all the Watch series fans. Just don't expect as many jokes as usual, though the book *is* funny at times.It offers an unique insight into many characters' youth. You'll meet quite a lot of old acquantainces - young Vimes (promising lad), Dibbler, Colon and Nobby (check for character development here!), Mrs Palm without the Seamstresses Guild, Lord Downey (a bit of a surprise), Lord Rust (no surprise whatsoever). And, of course, Vetinari - the lad does deserve a solid kick for the &quot;boo&quot;.A must-read. Repeat - a must-read. Just read all the Watch books earlier, you'll get too much confused if you don't."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Once again Terry Pratchett has written a masterpiece. This time it is about the commander of the watch going back in time trying to catch a killer and running into himself as a young copper. Because he has gone back into time, Vimes has to set the past right again or risk damaging the future. The reader gets to meet many of the beloved cast of characters that have emerged from the diskworld series over the last twenty years. The reader meets everyone from Nobby to the Patrician as a young man.The book is as funny as always although it does have that serious undertone that Pratchett has developed over the last couple of years. He explains the reasons to be honest when everyone else is crooked and some of the bad guys get their comeuppance in the usual ways. This is a great book for the Pratchett fanatic, but not for the new reader because there is too much to miss by not knowing the characters from the earlier books. Read the older ones first and you will love the action in this new one. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"First, if you haven't read the other books in this series, then don't start with this one. You don't need to read the other books first to understand what's going on, but nonetheless this one is a backstory for several of the series characters and you'd enjoy the story more if you learn about the character's present before you learn about their past. Second, if you're already a fan of the series, you'll either like it a lot more (which I did) or a lot less, because it's different from the other books in the series. Depending upon how you look at it, the book is either the most serious or the least funny of the series. There's still humor throughout the book, but in a setting where the dramatic edge of death is usually upstaged by the appearance of Death greeting the recently departed, this story has real tension. In a nifty time travel story, Sam Vimes is transported back to the past, where he must deal with the difficult issue of preserving the future at the cost of lives in the past. At the stage of a series where most authors would be rehashing the same old formula, Pratchett has shown that he still has new ways to tell a story. In summary, my rating for this book is an average; three stars if you're new to the series and five stars if you're not."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Though a bit lighter on his trademark humor, Night Watch is a surprisingly engrossing read that reveals a great deal of the back-story for several characters from previous novels.Duke Samuel Vimes, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, finds himself flung into the past where he must mold his past self into a good cop and prevent the city from destroying itself in a bloody revolution. While this book is a poor jumping-on point for new readers, it quickly becomes clear that Pratchett wrote this with the series fanatic in mind. Past characters from the \\"City Watch\\" sub series make appearances here and there much to the surprise of Vimes and the delight of readers. His future senior corporal is a street beggar. The future ruler of the city is a student at the secret Guild of Assassins. And several young coppers, who Vimes knows are doomed to die, are under his command.If you are new to Discworld, it would be in your best interests to jump back to \\"Guards! Guards!\\" and start reading from there. If you have already been following the series, you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Let me start this review by saying we (the American Terry Pratchett fans/buyers) are being cheated. That's right, cheated. It seems that over in jolly old England they get really, really bloody cool covers for their Discworld books. We get stupid, stylized (spelling?) covers over here. They get the books first there, too. Which is why the last couple of Pratchett books I bought (Last Hero, Thief of Time) online have been from Amazon UK. Thanks to the exchange rate, I have actually gotten the books cheaper, too!Anyway, my review. This is a great read. It is hard to put down once you stop. Pratchett is on his game, again. This is not one of the wizard series where anything can happen and it is a laugh a minute. The book has its laughs, boy does it ever. But a lot are actually mean, kind of in your face laughs. It is a Night Watch book. By their nature (crimes, Ank-Morpork at night!) they have to be kind of dark, mean little books.Sam Vines, on his way to a ceremony, gets pulled into the chase of the city's most notorious (only because the city knows about him) criminal, Carcer. Seems Carcer has just killed a member of the Watch. During the chase Vimes and Carcer get sent back to AnkMorpork of twenty years ago. A dark, dreary, dirty place, good old AnkMorpork! Vimes takes the place of his mentor and, while trying to catch Carcer must: teach the fresh, green Lance Constable Sam Vimes how to be a 'good' copper; lead the watch; and fight a rebellion. All while trying not to change history! Of course he knows what happens and so does Carcer. Carcer, however doesn't care about the future and attempts to change the future by killing the past which is now the present which will only lead to the future. Got it? Want a smoke and a tea while you think about it and then re-read it?We get to see the original members of the Watch before they became 'honest' coppers: Ned Coates, Nobby, Reg. There are no Trolls, Dwarves, Werwolves, Vampires. Uberwald is not even talked about, the wizards are not fun. This is old AnkMorpork.Buy the book (either the US or UK version) read it, then re-read the many sections you didn't get the first read through, and anjoy another great Pratchett book!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I tried to read this novel as my first Discworld novel many moons ago. I couldn't get into it. Having now read all of its precursors the book is FABULOUS. It will stand up as probably one of my favorite all time Discworld books (and let's face it they are my favorite books period). I love Vimes and the City Watch so that helps. This is, in addition to the standard humor, a really touching story. (yes, I used that description about a Discworld novel. really.) The lead up to the end is not quite satisfactory, but I've realized that when humor is the primary purpose the plot will, unfortunately, have to serve the humor rather than itself... and anyone complaining about holes in a story about a world revolving on the back of a turtle (not forgetting about the elephants as well) probably needs to take a harder look at their expectations."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Night Watch is my favorite book in Pratchett's Discworld series. It's definitely not, however, the book you want to read first in this series. As it's a time travel book, too many of the giggles for it come from seeing the many characters you know in the current-day city of Ankh Morpork as they were years before.It's a book that deals much more heavily with morality, humanity (or whatever you would call it that also includes trolls, dwarves, etc.), and doing the right thing when authority or fear says you shouldn't. It also deals with loss and sacrifice. It's much more poignant than previous (and later) books in the series, and the laughs are much more subtle. I still managed to chuckle and laugh and enjoy myself while being emotionally moved, however.If you're a fan of Commander Vimes and his world view, this should be another good book for you.So it's not as flat-out funny as other Discworld books, but sometimes a change of pace is a good thing. However, if you're just starting the series, make sure you read at least Guards Guards and Men at Arms before you get to Night Watch. (The more books, the better your appreciation as you'll know more characters and enjoy seeing the changes or origins.)"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"With each Discworld novel, Terry Pratchett has expanded his already vibrant environment bit by bit, but altered his writing approach and plotcraft quite a bit. Night Watch, in that light, is the return to a comfortable set of established characters, set in a new, dramatic light.Sam Vimes is hot on the trail of a dangerous psychopath who has just killed an off-duty Watchman. During the ensuing chase, he's propelled back in time to the early days of the Night Watch, where the psychopath is finding a perfect social outlet for his er, interests: as a member of Lord Winder's sadistic Particulars. Vimes has to tread pretty lightly between not disutrbing the natural course of events - which are leading to his eventual rise to Dukedom and - ulp!- fatherhood, and fighting the psychopath Carcer with every tool at his disposal: a corrupt and disorganized Watch; much younger and slovenly versions of Fred Colon and Nobby, and one, very green and naive ... Sam Vimes.Night Watch's plot is a clear extension of Thief of Time, with the presence of the Temporal Monks, and The Sweeper, with some real great action and interplay between the Vimes of the Future and the Inhabitants of the Past. Unlike Thief of Time, howvever, the plot is a little clearer, and the urgency of the situation is much less contrived. And who hasn't indulged themselves in the fantasy of returning to their past with all the benefits of decades of hindsight? While the plot is a little reminiscent of Men at Arms, and the movie Killing Time - it could be observed that one doesn't really expect a completely original starting point with Terry Pratchett: it's what he does with all those hackneyed setups and stock fantasy scenarios that keeps us coming back again and again.Night Watch is a terrific return to Discworld: familiar characters that you like; plenty of good laughs at The Assassin's Guild, Sam's grudging rise to greatness, and Nobby and Fred; and an inventive and interesting plot. I feel, however, that even with all its backstory and description of the Good Ol' Bad Ol' Days in Ankh-Morpork, it reads better after you've read Men At Arms, The Fifth Elephant or Feet of Clay. But Pratchett continues to improve with each book, so hurry up and read those, then read Night Watch."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Not as funny as some of his other works.....hence my 4 star rating.....really it deserves 4.5, but that is not an option.Let me say that I have read all of his books more than once. He is, by far, my favorite author. This book is not typical Pratchett, but needs to be read, especially if you are a fan and have read the series.....the plot itself is nice, and works fairly well, but more enjoyable for me was seeing so many of my favorite characters &quot;in their early years.&quot; It kind of gives you a view of their past, and how they became what they are.I do not want you to think there is no humor in this book, there is. However, it just was not as funny as I am used to, and that is because the story is a bit different, and takes on a different theme. If this is your first Terry Pratchett book, DO NOT read it until you have read a few others, especially Thief of Time. I think this book will be better appreciated having read at least ToT. I see that others have mentioned what the book is about, well, you can read that anywhere, and you never know what someone else thinks is a bummer to find out before reading a book....I just wanted to give you my opinion before you spend the money....but do spend the money, I thought it was worth it. :-)One last thing, and for me it is a real annoying thing.....there are SOOOOO many typos in this book, that it actually throws off your reading at times.....I almost forgot to mention it...but be ready, I have never encountered so many in one book before. It kills the flow, especially in some of the more important moments in the book. What makes it worse is that in this day and age, there is really no excuse for so many errors in grammar and spelling....at least not at this price level. Knowing this before hand may make it easier.Peace,Morley"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"One of Terry Pratchett's knacks (he has several) is the ability to take an essentially serious theme and mine it for countless funny bits, but never losing sight of the larger themes that lurk behind his wry tales. Sam Vimes, once a patrolman in Ankh-Morpork's Night Watch, now Duke of Ankh and Commander of the City Watch, thought his world was becoming reliably predictable. And in law enforcement, this is considered a 'good thing. Especially when one's wife is expecting, immanently. So Vimes was ill prepared when a bolt of lightning catapulted him and the psychotic he was trying to arrest, straight through the roof of the Unseen University and into the past.Vimes has a long history of coping. Now he took in stride the discovery that he had suddenly become the man responsible for showing himself how to be a good cop in the first place. He takes the place of Sergeant John Keel (conveniently killed by Carcer, the psychotic who started all this) and sets about trying to teach young Sam Vimes how to keep the peace. Distracted only by the fact than Ankh-Morpork was about to experience its own version of the French Revolution - The Glorious People's Republic of Treacle Mine Road. And if Sam (the elder) doesn't get it all to come out right, he has no hope of returning to his own present and his newborn son.This is a complicated tale. Even the basic plot - making sure that history happens as it should - is an enormous task. Nor has Pratchett chosen a narrow stage on which to enact the plot. You will find almost every key Ankh-Morpork character (and just a few others) running about the scenery acting 30 years younger. Except Death, of course. He's there, but he is never gets any younger. You will meet Reg before he becomes a zombie and 'Cut my own throat' Dibbler before any of his great failures. And even Lord Vetinarii before he... Well, that would be giving away too much of the plot.Pratchett makes this all weave together as if it really happened. Alternating between characters full of self-effacing humor and grim determination in equal parts. Revolutions, after all, are not funny business. 'Night Watch' is less of a lampoon than a social commentary with a twist. It comforts us little that all this is happening on a turtle far away. This world has no lack of characters even grimmer than the villains of this piece (security officers and greedy politicians). Pratchett provides a gentle reminder that the business of keeping the peace takes hardnosed determination.Perhaps because of the ambivalent mood of the book, it seems a bit more than many of its predecessors. This wasn't dashed off, and the characters are all filled in some detail. It asks questions, and doesn't always offer an answer. Pratchett is noted for bending people's minds, but less for making the reader think. I like the change. This is a book to be read slowly and relished."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"His Grace The Duke and Commander of the City Watch of Ankh Morpork, Sir Samuel Vimes is an angry man. He's angry because the world which never seems to conform to his sense of what is right and wrong. But this sense of justice has driven him and his organization, the Watch, to become the premier law-keeping force in the city, so respected that they have become grudgingly accepted as a normal part of the city's functions.Yet things were different once. Once the Watch was split into two - Day and Night Watches. Both were havens for misfits and losers. Once the Night Watch was an inept one - afraid of the shadows in the dark. Once Vimes was no more than another copper, trying his best not to see the things that were wrong with his city. Things were different once.In the present, Vimes is called away as his wife is giving birth. The Watch is closing in a dangerous psychopath, a cop killer, a brutal and calculating murderer and Vimes needs to be there to arrest him. But there is a storm brewing, and as Vimes faces down the fugitive, there is a lightning strike that hits both men. And they vanish.Vimes finds himself 30 years in past, facing an uncertain future. For the fugitive has escaped and murdered Sgt. John Keel, the younger Vimes' mentor. To preserve the future, Vimes must masquerade as the dead sergeant and must teach his younger self how to be a policeman, in the eve of a bloody revolution. But Vimes remembers how the past will turn out and he finds himself having to make a choice: if he changes stops innocent men from getting killed in the revolution, he will change his future. But if he does this, he will never get back to his wife and never see his unborn child. Because if he changes the past, there will be no future for him, nothing but a lost memory.Grittier than most of the Guards series, this new entry spoofs elements of time travel in movies including Terminator series, the Back to the Future trilogy as well as the more classic \\"Tale of Two Cities\\" by Charles Dickens. As with the rest of the Discworld series, Terry Pratchett once again merges humor and intelligent satire with a pragmatic but optimistic view of humanity. Pratchett's trademark tongue-in-cheek wit is still prevalent, but it's far more subdued than usual. However, long time readers will appreciate the first glimpses of such characters as Reg Shoe, CMOT Dibbler, Nobby Nobbs, Fred Colon and the deliciously machievellian Vetinari. In any event, even new readers could appreciate the tightly drawn plot of a man trying to do the right thing in the middle fo revolution. All in all, a heartily recommended read and another fine addition to the Pratchett pantheon."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"If you're already a Pratchett fan, this book will give you an opportunity to see some of the most prevalent characters in their younger years, something I found delightful. If you're new, this book is a great way to get hooked, as it supplies enough basic information about the previous books that one can keep up.My favorite set of characters is the Watch, so reading about the city in its more corrupted days, when Vetinari and Vimes were very young man, is grand.I read this book in one sitting."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This is my favorite book in the City Watch book and quite possibly my favorite book in the entire Discworld series.

I think that it was listed so on a page here at Amazon. And so I started this long series with the 28th book. But you know what, I still enjoyed it very much and was left wanting more. I don't think that I needed other books in the series in order to place a context exactly for what Pratchett offers up here.All in all \`Night Shift' was a pretty interesting read. I think that fantasy/science fiction allows for the author to be more creative than other genre writers. Thus Pratchett delves into a scenario and plot structure that while being in essence simple and accessible to younger readers also reads as original and fresh. The story was a fun time puzzle with interesting characters.I would not stop anyone from picking this book up."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I have been an avid Terry Pratchett fan for just a little while now, though I have read all of his books and own most of them (I am currently working on purchasing the rest). I am deeply in love with Pratchett's writing and his superior characters. I started reading his novels in order but quickly began to jump around as fewer and fewer were available in my local bookstore. Thus, due to the relatively widespread nature of Night Watch, I read it before reading most of the other ones. After reading Night Watch, it immediately became my favorite Discworld novel and has remained there ever since.This book is darker than some of the other ones, but rest assured it has plenty of humor as well. It seems more rooted in real life than many of his others (except for the whole traveling in time thing), but still remains classic Discworld. This is probably the only novel I know of his that covers so many emotions so well. The plot is great, and the deeper meanings are... well... deep. There is weeping as well as laughter, honesty amidst treachery, morality in a dark place.I enjoyed this book throughout my first read, and I enjoyed it even more the second time.If you are going to read a book by Terry Pratchett, make it this one. You won't be disappointed. Seriously."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Terry Pratchet's twenty-seventh Discworld novel returns again to the world of Ankh-Morpork's City Guard. As usual, in the City Guard books, the central character is His Grace the Duke of Ankh, Commander of the City Watch, Sir Samuel Vimes. Except...well...in this book he isn't quite Sam Vimes...The book is set in late May, with Sam is about to become a father for the first time. The lilac is in bloom and some of the city's most notable - including Sam, Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, Nobby, and Vetinari - are wearing it in memory of a John Keel. Keel, as it turns out, was something of a mentor to Sam at the beginning of his career. Nobby had never forgotten how Keel had given him his first spoon. Dibbler seemed positively touched that Keel had once eaten one of his pies - without spitting any of it out whatsoever.There are some in the city who don't even know who Keel was, never mind caring about him. The book kicks off with the City Guard hunting a homicidal maniac called Carcer. In the course of chasing him across the roof of the University's library, a huge magical storm strikes and sends both Vimes and Carcer into the past. That's when things start getting awkward. Suspicious that no-one recognises him - he is an important public figure, after all - Sam gives assumes the name 'John Keel'. It's only later that he discovers when he is and that Carcer has killed the real one. So, to ensure his life develops the way it should, he now has to catch Carcer, teach his younger self to be a good copper, survive a revolution and, somehow, eat one of Dibbler's pies. And if everything happens the way he remembers it happening, surely that means he'll have end up in John Keel's grave. Doesn't it ?Just like everything else I've read by Pratchett, this is a great book. Like all of those others, it's easily read, funny, with likeable characters and, at times, a little sad. It's also interesting to meet the 'younger' versions of some of the characters who have appeared in earlier books of the Discworld series. For this reason, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book as a starting point for someone who hasn't read any Pratchett before. It's not that the book wouldn't be enjoyable - just that the better you know the characters, the more it'll make you smile !I always feel a bit sorry when I finish a Discworld novel, knowing that I'll have to wait so long for the next one to come out. This one is no different - but just like all the others I know I'll still enjoy it hugely when I re-read it."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This is the 27th book in Pratchett's Discworld series.

It's a masterpiece, but, unfortunately, if you haven't read all the earlier Watch books (and, possibly, \\"Thief of Time\\"), the book will mean nothing to you. Also, it's not a hilariously funny book (though it is funny in a darker way). It extends the trend toward seriousness present in his other books of the Watch. I think what Pratchett's done in this book is where he'll be going for future books: he'll fill in the far past of his characters. The humor will be there for other characters (like the Witches or the Wizards), but for the Watch, I think he'll maintain a more serious, darker, police-work feel with dabs of humor here and there. Really, an excellent book that requires the background of his previous works. I rate it at 5 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"In Night Watch, Terry Pratchett has a second (and more successful) go at time. It's predecessor, Thief of Time, starred Lao Tzu and his monks (who keep the threads of time running smoothly on their spindles most of the time)trying to thwart a plot to stop time.Night Watch is a more conventional time-travel story. Watch Commander Vimes, one of Pratchett's continuing characters, is cast back to the Ankh-Morpork of his youth by a lightning bolt just as he is arresting the most-wanted criminal in the city, a stone-cold killer named Carcer. Carcer shares Vimes' fate, escapes and sets about to create a future more to his own liking -- one that does not include Commander Vimes. The time in which they find themselves is a pivotal moment in Ankh-Morpork's history and in Vimes' own development as a police officer.Pratchett finesses the paradox of having the youthful Constable Vimes encounter his more mature self by having Commander Vimes assume the identity of John Keel, a sergeant of the watch he remembers from his youth. As Lao Tzu labors to bring Commander Vimes back to his proper place in time, Vimes struggles to keep Carcer from killing either of his selves and turning Ankh-Morpork to the dark side. Along the way, we encounter the future ruler of Ankh-Morpork, Lord Vetinari, in his youthful form as an apprentice in the Assassin's Guild.Much of the action in Night Watch takes place in Treacle Road, which is perhaps unintentionally appropriate. There is a vein of sticky sentimentality running through this story that makes this reader's teeth ache. It needed more of the wry humor with which Pratchett seasons his best books -- like The Word. Night Watch is, nevertheless, an entertaining fast-paced adventure that will please Pratchett's legions of devoted fans."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"The guards in general, and Sam Vimes in particular, are real heroes, in the meaning that you really feel that this is how real heroes would handle the tough calls, the conflicting interests, the raw chaos of unclear loyalties etc. and walk away with their integrity intact. He has succeeded in creating distilled reality, and that is magical, as magical as the making of fine malt whisky and as the library at the unseen university. He can even paint personalities with a one-liner, and that's bloody sourcery. I wonder about his ancestry, surely he must be the eighth son of an eighth son...The guards are hist best creation, and they were never better than here."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"One of the tricky parts of a time travel novel is explaining to the traveler (especially if his journey is inadvertent as it is in \\"Night Watch\\") and the reader just what the heck happened.Luckily, in a previous Discworld novel, \\"Thief of Time\\" (2001), Pratchett invented Lu-Tze and the Time Monks, so that when Sam Vimes travels back to his own past while chasing a cold-blooded murderer, a little bald wrinkly smiling man (Rule #1: \\"Do not act incautiously when confronting little bald wrinkly smiling men!\\") rescues Sam from the clutches of history's cowardly, badly run Night Watch, and explains what has happened.Basically, young Sam Vimes has just joined the past's Night Watch and the older Sam Vimes must teach him to be a good cop while disguised as Sargeant John Keel, newly arrived in Ankh-Morpork and ready to kick some sloppy, sadistic cop butt.If 'old' Vimes doesn't make sure 'young' Vimes becomes a decent cop, his future, his wife, his position as Commander of the Watch will be lost to him. Good men will needlessly die.Historical Ankh-Morpork is also gearing up for a revolt against a Patrician who is propped up by a really nasty secret police gang. Once 'Sargeant John Keel' gets himself clothed, out of jail, his plight explained by Lu-Tze, and is put in charge of the Treacle Mine Road Watch House, he must train up young Sam Vimes (as well as future-Sargeant Colon, and Nobby Nobbs), capture a killer, and make sure the Revolution is won by the right people.Only then Vimes will get to return to the 'future' where his wife is about to give birth.I enjoy all of Discworld novels starring the redoubtable Sam Vimes, but \\"Night Watch\\" is something special. The plot zips from beginning to end, never slowing down except for the mandatory insertion of the Time Monks, who have to explain the how and why of Sam's excursion into his own past. Many of the loose ends from previous Night Watch novels are tied together and neatly tucked in. Most of all, I was delighted by a deepening illumination of character--not just of Vimes, but of the Patrician Vetinari, Sargeant Colon, and Nobby Nobbs. While you read, you'll be thinking 'of course they started like this.' Pratchett is that good.If you'd like to read the Sam Vimes/Night Watch books in order of publication, they are: \\"Guards! Guards!\\" (1989); \\"Men at Arms\\" (1993); \\"Feet of Clay\\" (1996); \\"Jingo\\" (1997); \\"Night Watch\\" (2002); and \\"Thud!\\" (2005)."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Night Watch is the 27th, or 28th (depending on how you count them) book in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. The Discworld series takes place on the flat world of the Disc which is carried on the backs of four elephants standing on the great Turtle, A'tuin, as he (or maybe she) swims through space. On the Disc mariners who attempt to sail over the horizon, in fact, sail over the edge. The Disc is home to magic and many magical creatures and beings abound, gods, dwarfs, trolls, vampires, zombies, werewolves, wizards, witches and more. Terry Pratchett's Discworld books can be grouped into categories depending on who the primary characters are. I tend to think of the categories as the Wizards of the Unseen University, the Witches of Lancre, Death, and the City Watch. Most of the Discworld books fall into one of these categories although a few like Pyramids, Moving Pictures and Small Gods don't. Night Watch though is definitely a City Watch book.In Night Watch, we learn how Samuel Vimes' character was formed. His Grace, the Duke Samuel Vimes, the commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch is dispatched back in time (along with a ruthless killer) to the waning days of the corrupt Lord Winder's reign as ruler of Ankh-Morpork. Vimes must assume the identity of John Keel, a guardsman recently recruited to the Ankh-Morpork Night Watch as a Sergeant at Arms. In the Night Watch he finds his earlier self, takes him under his wing and teaches him how to be a good copper. In his jaunt back to the past Vimes meets earlier versions of Fred Colon as a corporal, Nobby Nobbs as a street urchin, Reg Shoe as a non-zombie revolutionary and a young new street vendor named Dibbler just starting out. Lu-Tze, the sweeper monk of history, makes an appearance trying to get Vimes to accept his role in the course of events leading up to the revolution that ousts Lord Winder. A young Vetinari, as a senior at the Assasins Guild also takes part in the plot.Terry Pratchett's Discworld books are jewels of humorous fantasy and Night Watch is no exception. The most enjoyable Discworld books involve the City Watch, Guards, Guards, Men at Arms, Feet of Clay, Jingo, and The Fifth Elephant. Night Watch continues the story of the City Watch characters by going back in time to explain how the central character, Sam Vimes, came to be. However, Night Watch, is not the typical hysterical Pratchett romp through the fantastic world of the Disc. This book, while still funny, is a little darker than the average Discworld book and a little bit deeper, which makes it a very nice change of pace. The older Sam Vimes as John Keel, teaches the younger Vimes the meaning of being a watchman, doing the job that's in front of you and keeping the peace. It's in some ways a sad and trying story, but it opens up tremendous insight into one of the most beloved Discworld characters. This book probably is not the best choice for your first Discworld book, but if you are a fan of the Discworld and enjoy the books about the City Watch, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This is the Discworld version of a time machine story. I think it's the best written of the entire Terry Pratchett library, but I only give it four stars.The thing about any time machine story is that you already know how it comes out. And, for me at least, that takes a bit out of Pratchett's toolbox. Pratchett novels in the past have been a wild ride where you were never completely sure how it would all work out. \\"Night Watch\\" is a wild ride, but it's a roller coaster ride, and you know at the end of the ride you'll be, more or less, back at the starting point, breathless but okay.There's also a bit of a character development issue. Maybe it's just the Monks of History having problems again, but how did eager young nightwatchman Sam Vimes - not John Keel, but Sam Vimes - turn into the lush we know and love in \\"Guards! Guards!\\"? We first met Sam Vimes, remember, lying drunk in a gutter in a rainstorm...Still and all, this is an excellent addition to the Night Watch series. Not an introduction, mind you. I think you need to meet Fred Colon and Nobby Nobbs in \\"Guards! Guards!\\" or \\"Men at Arms\\" to appreciate those first, earlier encounters here. Especially to ah... savor the meeting with Nobby. Longstanding mysteries are solved, and half the fun is knowing they are mysteries in advance. Why Reg Shoe is a zombie. Whether Vetinari is indeed an assassin.Pratchett's wordcraft is as good or even better than it has ever been. He is particularly deft in seamlessly intertwining the linked story threads and his message, which he slips in as craftily as any assassin. The party at which Mad Lord Winder is not assassinated is particularly well done.I'm not rabid about Pratchett - I'm not a chronic hanger-on at L-Space, and there are some small sections of The APF I've not committed to memory. But any Prachett book is cause for keen anticipation and delighted, delightful reading. \\"Night Watch\\" is no exception. Oh, and stay off the Library dome in lightning storms..."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Night Watch is Terry Pratchett's consummate masterpiece. He applies his insights into politics, ambition, loyalty, commitment, love, duty, sacrifice, and human fragility in a powerful, frequently entertaining, and ultimately overwhelming story. Pratchett shines when he fills each page with something to make it worth inclusion in the whole, and he does so brilliantly in Night Watch.On my first reading, I carefully avoided reading ahead, and although many of the book's conclusions were clearly foreshadowed, I was near tears at the book's final revelations. The book sharply contrasts the potential for great natural bravery among the streetwise downtrodden with the potential for casual cruelty among the powerful elite. Not that the elite are typecast as cruel - several major characters among the \\"elite\\" are written with great depth, and the future Patrician of Ankh-Morpork finally has his moment to shine, albeit as a young man.My favorite Pratchett novel, bar none. Worthy of many rereads."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Ah, yes, Terry Pratchett. Comedic genius. This should be a fun read, with sidesplitting jokes and wry observations and slapstick, everybody goes home happy...wait, what is this? oh. oh god...How do they rise up?As a Discworld novel, it doesn't compare; Hogfather or The Truth or Jingo, those are all top choices, all hilarious. This is the one you read when you've got a good bottle of wine, a box of tissues, and \\"Le Temps des cerises\\" on infinite repeat (a song about the Paris Commune, one of the main inspirations for this novel; that right there should tell you a lot). It's dark, it's depressing, it's not particularly funny (although it does have its moments). What it is instead is beautiful.Truth, Justice, Freedom, Reasonably Priced Love, and a Hard-Boiled Egg!This was written in 2002. Douglas Adams passed away in 2001; does anyone think that May 25 (Towel Day) is a coincidence? I don't, and to be honest I don't care, either. I need to find a lilac towel.It takes a special kind of comedian to make you cry. Night Watch is on the short list of my favorite novels of all time."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This is another excellent book in the Discworld series. It's not the best, by some way, but it's still an incredibly good read.Sam Vimes is cast back in time to old Anhk-Morpork. Whilst there he must drag a vicious killer back to the present, stop a bloody revolution, and teach the young Vimes how to be a good copper, otherwise when he returns, he may find himself faced with no future at all.This book is considerably darker than some of Pratchett's works, and there's not quite as much humour as normal, which doesnt really matter, because it is still there in part. (Indeed, the way Nobby Nobbs imparts news of husband's death's to their new widows is posibly the funniest thing i have ever read.) However, it's still absolutely chock-full of the philosophical musings which lift his books so far most fantasy novels, indeed, almost ALL novels. Not only are his books immensely enjoyable, funny and well written, they make you think, and they say a great great deal about the world we live in today, by using the Discworld societies as mirrors of our own.Some people say that some of books of the last five or so years havent been as good as some of those from his &quot;middle period&quot;, i however, couldn't disagree more. In the past few years, terry Pratchett ahs produced some of his absolutely best work, from the best of the entire series, &quot;The Truth&quot;, to the cleverst work of detective fiction i've ever come across, &quot;Feet of Clay&quot;.This book has another cracking plot with some excellent characters (it was great to see some of the characters we now know so well, in their younger days. Nobby, Fred, etc. Indeed, the young Havelock Vetinari provides an absolutely brilliant performance.) and it's nie to have a window into Anhk-Morporks history, however, after the excellent first 200 pages, the book slows down a bit and gets slightly, dare i say it, mundane, for a very short while, before it picks itself up again and goe son to another great ending.Terry Pratchett really deserves some kind of award for this, and every book he's wrriten. Indeed, with Terry Pratchett writing a book a year, no other fantasy/sci-fi writer would stand a chance."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them. Sam Vimes, the commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, falls into the third category. From his first appearance as a tarnished copper in \\"Guards, Guards\\" to his most recent outing in \\"Thud\\" as \\"not-the-sharpest-knife-in-the-drawer-but-straight-as-an-arrow\\" Sam Vimes, he has risen above his mediocrity, overcome his tarnished nature, and done great things.In \\"Night Watch\\" we learn how the foundation for this heroic everyman was laid. Commander Sam Vimes, seeking to arrest a serial killer, finds himself thrown back into time, becoming a Sergeant on the old Ankh-Morpork Night Watch. He seeks to de-corrupt the Watch, whip it into a professional law enforcement agency, and guide the career of a rookie officer, Lance Constable Sam Vimes. The future isn't fixed, and if Vimes is ever going to get back home to his wife and newborn son, he must set things right in this same-but-different world.In addition to exploring some of the implications of quantum theory and parallel time lines, Pratchett manages to give us a nice meditation on what moves some of us to self-sacrifice above and beyond the call of duty."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"While Terry Pratchett is always funny - and one of the wittiest writers in fantasy (if not all of publishing) - many of his last ten books seem a little short of the sparkle that his earlier work had. This is certainly not a problem for \\"Night Watch\\", though. In fact, it's his very return to many of his old formulas that, surprisingly, makes it such a success.As with all the Discworld books, \\"Night Watch\\" takes three or four popular themes in literature - or fiction or science fiction or whatever - and plays with them and their conventions. For this book, he's taken the idea of everybody's reminiscences of the 'good old days', time travel stories (especially those like \\"Back to the Future\\") and revolutions (specifically the French Revolution and at least a couple of Roman revolutions I can think of). All of this is, of course, woven into the story of Sam Vimes, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, being thrown back in time thirty years to a pivotal revolution in the city when he was just starting as a recruit.All the stereotypes are there: from the dingy, cowardly watchmen that he must whip into shape to the know-it-all monitoring wise people (monks, in this case) and the young versions of many of the other Ankh-Morpork denizens we've met in the past five Watch books. What really makes this great, though, is that he has fun with all of these stereotypes and still manages to tell a story that's both engaging and like going back to visit old friends (albeit cowardly, somewhat-corrupt ones).I wholeheartedly recommend this book to the Terry Pratchett fan as well as to the fantasy fan or even just the humor fan. While going back to \\"Guards! Guards!\\" (the first Discworld book about the Watch) may be helpful for those of you that aren't familiar with the series, it's still strong enough that it can hold it's own. If \\"Night Watch\\" is your first Terry Pratchett book, you may miss a lot of the references, but you'll still be in for an excellent read."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Night Watch, the 27th (and brand new!) Discworld novel by Terry Pratchett, is a wonderful character study of Samuel Vimes, the head of the City Watch of Ankh-Morpork. In this one, Pratchett turns kind of serious, though there are some amusing bits. Unlike Small Gods, it appears to work in this one. Maybe I just wasn't ready for it before. Or maybe Vimes is such an interesting character that I was willing to forgive. Whichever way it is, Night Watch is yet another masterpiece from Pratchett.Carcer is one of Pratchett's best villains, I believe, because he's \\"normal.\\" Yes, he's insane, but he could very well live in the world we live in, unlike some of Pratchett's other bad guys. Not to say that they weren't good as well, but Carcer adds that extra bit of chill. He's a survivor, able to adapt to many different situations. It takes some time for Vimes to adapt himself to what he has to do once he discovers what has happened. Even when the Monks of History (the main source of any humour in this book) tell him what he must do, he is still reluctant. Carcer, on the other hand, jumps in with both feet, ingratiating himself with the higher-ups, and starts establishing himself. Once he realizes what the situation is with Vimes (and the younger Vimes) it gets even chillier. He's very effective, and the reader is often left wondering just how Vimes can beat him.This book, however, is Sam Vimes' book. I've always found Vimes to be a fascinating character, throughout all of the City Watch books, and this book just builds on those. Every City Watch book is really about the development of Vimes, and Night Watch takes it to the next level, with an in depth character study, where you get under his skin and find out what makes him tick. When he's taken out of his element and dumped back in time, he has nothing to go on but his copper instincts. Times may change, politics may change, but coppers are coppers, and they just have to do what is right. Catch the bad guys, keep the peace. He sees himself as an extraordinarily simple man, and in a way, he is. But he's very dedicated to what he does, very strongly determined to do what's right, no matter what the consequences. When rebellion is flourishing all over the city, and the Unmentionables (the current government's secret police) is fomenting even more, Vimes is determined to make sure it doesn't reach the area of the Watch house. He uses some very unorthodox methods to make sure this happens, which doesn't put him on the good side of the Unmentionables (especially a new member, who has seemingly appeared out of nowhere). Vimes continues to show his intelligence, as well as his moralistic thinking. He's put through the ringer in this one, and a very interesting character throughout the previous books becomes a fascinating one instead.The relationship between him (as John Keel) and the young Sam is a joy to watch. The young Sam is very impressionable. He wants to do the right thing, but he doesn't really know what that is. He took part in the round-ups of curfew-breakers (and delivering them to the Unmentionables) only because he didn't know any different. When Vimes arrives and sees what Sam is in danger of becoming, memories flood over him, and he becomes determined to ensure that Sam becomes what Vimes is. He also tries desperately to keep him out of danger, because he has to keep history going along the path it did before. The relationship is wonderful, and really aids in fleshing out the character of Vimes that we all know and love.The plot is very interesting as well. Rebellion against the current Patrician of Ankh-Morpork is hitting the city all over the place. It is touching to watch the tragic inevitability of what happens, knowing that as much as Vimes tries, he really has to ensure that history repeats itself. The Lilac rebellion must occur in some fashion, and some good people, who he is getting to know again, are going to die. Carcer is going to do his best to make Vimes' life miserable, and if that involves changing history, too bad.Pratchett ties everything together nicely into a tight plot with no holes that I could see. The story contains some interesting time travel theories, wonderful writing by Pratchett, and interesting characters. Fans of the series will be glad to see that not only are the Watch back (though they are only there in the present-day sequences), but also the Wizards play a small role. The Monks of History are around, trying to make sure that History is not damaged too badly by what is going on. Also, we get some history on Nobby Nobs, Sergeant Colon, Reg Shoe, Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler and we find out a very interesting aspect of the current Patrician, Vetinari. I've noticed that in recent books, Pratchett picks and chooses characters from his series to throw together into a book, and I think it really works.But make no mistake. This book is about Samuel Vimes. He carries the book on his shoulders, and he does it very well. I wasn't sure if Pratchett could do much more with Vimes other than just another \\"adventure of the City Watch,\\" but Pratchett proved me wrong. In spades. This is a wonderful book. While it's certainly readable as a first Discworld book, it loses a lot of its impact that way, so I would not recommend starting here. Get some background, then come back to this one. It's a keeper."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"And then nearly didn't get up for work the next day!!I eagerly look forward to every Terry Pratchett book I can get my hands on. The man has made such a wonderful contribution to the literary world that, as an American, I am thunderstruck by how few people seem to know his work over here. With the relatively recent stateside success of the Harry Potter books and Lord of the Rings relaunch (well I'm sure the films helped, too *grin*), I think Terry Pratchett is primed to continue to become more well-known here.Onto the book . . . Loved it. Sam Vimes is a wonderful character. He has made great strides since his first appearance in &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;. Good story for fans, maybe not as friendly to new readers as &quot;The Truth&quot;. I must confess that I wish Carrot would get to shine some more. I sometimes wonder if Terry hasn't been sure how to advance the character (I'd hoped for more from &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot; in regards to Carrot's character development). But these are all fanboy geek wants. I'm not going to replay the story of &quot;Night Watch&quot;. That's been done enough here. However, if you're a fan of the series, especially the &quot;Guards&quot; books, definately pick it up. If you haven't read a &quot;Discworld&quot; Novel before, then I suggest you try these first, &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;, &quot;Men at Arms&quot;, &quot;Feet of Clay&quot;, &quot;Jingo&quot;, then &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;, before picking up &quot;Night Watch&quot;. My thinking is, if you try the first one and aren't hooked, then you're better of with another series and possibly another writer. My belief is that you will be hooked, then just follow the list I gave in order to read the &quot;Guards&quot; books in order."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"It's hard to know where to recommend that newcomers start with Discworld. On the one hand, this is the best Pratchett yet (and that's saying something). On the other hand, although it stands alone it's better appreciated if you've read some of its predecessors. Perhaps the ideal compromise is to read Night Watch, read everything else chronologically, then read Night Watch again. It will certainly repay the time.Its unfortunately true that many humorous authors never again rise to the level of their first breakthrough, and spend the rest of their careers fending off remarks like &quot;it's good, but it's no 'How To Be An Alien'&quot;. Not so with Pratchett. Over the span of the Discworld series he has constantly grown as a humorist and, even more, as an author. From the moment I read the first few pages of the first book in the series it was clear to me that something special was going on here, and Pratchett has avoided ever becoming stale even as his skills have grown.Pratchett is at his worst when leaning too heavily on parodies of other forms and relying on stock characters (&quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, &quot;Soul Music&quot;), although it should be acknowledged that his worst is still pretty good. He is at his best when he lets his universe largely stand on its own merits, even when populated with figures familiar from earlier stories, as he does here and did before in &quot;The Truth&quot;, for example.For those familiar with Pratchett, this is a no-brainer: buy this book and read it immediately. For those new to Discworld, by all means start here as the book stands on its own two feet. Then go back to the beginning and discover Discworld from the very beginning while at the same time tracking Pratchett's growth from &quot;good&quot; to &quot;great&quot;, all the while knowing that the treat of Pratchett at the top of his game is awaiting you when you work your way back to re-reading Night Watch."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Terry Pratchett is a paragon among writers. While some authors achieve a peak and slide away, even if only temporarily, Pratchett climbs upward, one step [book] at a time, reaching new crests. This work is indisputably his finest endeavor. Unlike other &quot;fantasy&quot; [ugh!] writers, he is able to draw on scientific sources to support his stories. In this instance it's quantum physics, time travel and probability. Oh, yes, and people. Plot and environment are set gently aside in Pratchett's quest to portray folks. Real people in real circumstances. Or at least as real as living in Ankh-Morpork, the Discworld's major city, will allow. We are once again confronted with the puzzle of how much is Sam Vimes Pratchett's idol and how much is Pratchett himself?All Terry Pratchett's characters are fascinating in their own way. Rincewind, a spectacular coward, expresses a survivor's continuing agonies of fear and distrust. Esme Weatherwax dons a cape of firm self-assurance you could roof a shed with - until she's alone and surveying her frailties. In Sam Vimes, however, Pratchett produced someone special. In his own view Sam sometimes strides on feet of clay. Plagued by self-doubts, worrying about problems often not his, beset by hordes of enemies and unpredictable circumstances, Vimes manages to trot up to the finish line soiled but sturdy. We live in an era when &quot;character&quot; is a disreputable phrase. Still, Sam Vimes arrives at each finale by employing resolute self discipline, applying it to himself or imparting it to others. In this book, that example becomes bifurcated by Sam's knowledge that he's coaching his younger self. Maintaining his own standards while imparting them to young Lance-Constable Vimes is a challenging situation. He was pursuing a killer in his own time - he continues the pursuit in the past. He's also, once again, caught up in Ankh-Morpork politics.Transported back in time, Vimes remains burdened with memories. Sybil, his wife, is about to produce their first born [promised in Fifth Elephant]. A Watch mainstay, Fred Colon, is an established Corporal, while Nobby Nobbs, a social stain, is a street urchin seeking the main chance. Sam encounters old friends and makes new ones. Some don't survive. Pratchett's ability to give life to each of his characters brings a sense of grief at their loss other authors fail to achieve. You cannot prevent a pause in your reading when you learn of their deaths. There is one character you're eager to see &quot;pass on,&quot; but Pratchett denies you that comfort. Fantasy or no, reality is firmly established here. As always with Pratchett, the characters are your neighbours and family. You know them intimately, never mind their distance in time and place. You rejoice in their successes and mourn their losses. It's all part of Pratchett's ability to capture the reader - new or long- standing.Back in an earlier Ankh-Morpork, Vimes assumes the identity of John Keel. In this role, he establishes new standards in the Watch - dress, behaviour, skills, attitudes. Those who can't conform are eased [at least] out. Inevitably, the role of the Watch in relation to the military arises. Pratchett has addressed this issue before, of course, and it remains unresolved. Especially in times of civil unrest and resentment over government and taxes. The old labour movement refrain &quot;Which Side Are You On&quot; might have replaced the tune running through this book.Clearly, Pratchett is far more interested in helping his readers confront the world than in carving himself a comfortable niche among escapist fantasy writers. Those who bemoan the loss of &quot;humour&quot; in his recent works [although the asides in this book are among his best], are ignoring the message. He's a serious thinker imparting his ideas using the methods at his command. To pigeonhole him is to ignore his message or reject it. He deserves better. The next &quot;critic&quot; who labels Pratchett as a &quot;humorous fantacist&quot; can meet me in Sator Square. Bring your own weapons, but be advised my chosen second is the Commander of the Ankh-Morpork Watch . . ."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Being a prison guard (no, not like the ones in this book, a REAL one) I find great comfort in Sam Vimes. Moralistic humor, nice twisty view of the world, yet always trying to do right - even to himself. This book has gotten me through hard times when I needed to be reminded to be true to myself, to do what I know is right, to look to the greater picture. I adore Terry Pratchett's view and agree wholeheartedly with it. Acceptance that people are who they are, but we need to be who we need to be also. I believe all his books are quite readable, enjoyable. I am currently in the process of reading the entire discworld series in chronological order and am impressed to watch not only the characters grow, but the author also. Thank you sooooo much Mr. Pratchett! Not only are your books entertaining, but provide the view more of us need to see the world through."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"The story here is a nice addition to the Discworld series, and Vimes is a great character, though I felt Carcer was underdeveloped and a bit one-dimensional -- would have been interesting to get more background on him. My three stars are for the readers on the Book-on-tape. They all do a good job, but I desperately miss Nigel Planer as narrator and hope he will be back for future Discworld titles. Hearing Vimes and company in someone else's voice(s) just seems *wrong*, Planer is such a talented reader and has such a tremendous range, I just couldn't get used to hearing anyone else. Please bring him back!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Pratchett's latest Discworld installment neatly ties in the time monks from the previous novel and with his overtly satirical mind he proceeds to delve into quantum physics with a sense of irony that is as subtle as it is brilliant. This time Sam Vimes is our protagonist, the brassed and reluctantly polished watch Commander sidetracked during a routine meeting with Lord Vetinari into a copper-roots level chase across the Unseen University rooftops after a murderer by the name of Carcer. During the storm-tossed chase he falls with Carcer into a rift in the time continuum and finds himself back in time with the villain in Ankh-Morpork just as hise younger self was making his first forays into the Watch. All of which gives Pratchett the perfect excuse to dredge up a whole lot of new characters and still remain in his glorious Discworld capital.Once Lse-Tsu, the Sweeper, has explained the science behind the events Vimes (now known as John Keel) finds he has four days in which to educate his younger self and locate and take Carcer back with him, all before the revolution. However, he has the major advantage of a)being intelligent, b)knowing all about what should happen. So he inveigles his way into becoming a Nightwatch sergeant-at-arms, promptly shakes up the accepted corruption within its ranks and then sets off on his mission. Fairly quickly he manages to upset the course of history by ensuring the Morphic Street Conspiracy didn't end in a massacre before realising that Captain Swing of the Unmentionables has now recruited Carcer as a sergeant.We plung headfirst into his efforts to ensure that the Treacle Mine Watch House doesn't get burned in the general looting and his struggle to create a sphere of normality in the revolution to prevent the amount of historical deaths his future self knows happened. He manages to gain revenge on the Unmentionables down in Cable Street, all the whilst keeping his younger self by his side gaining valuable experience. Eventually it all resolves itself in a manner that is truly remarkable and we see a side of an older and more anarchic Ankh-Morpork in the process.We get to see glorious cameos from younger selves throughout. The ones that stick in the memory are: Vetinari's unfazable younger self as an assassin in training, the street urchin, Nobby Nobbs, Fred Colon and a superb pre-\`Cut-Me-Own'Throat' Dibbler. All of which lends itself to a Discworld novel back to its very best. The previous offering tended to flounder a little in the sheer volume of irony and satire at Pratchett's potential disposal and ended up being a trifle blunt, but this volume returns our author to the safe Night Watch which have such brilliant characters. Given the next two also focus on them, it means the latest installments are a must read."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Without a doubt, Terry Pratchett just keeps getting better. I can no longer simply describe his books as &quot;fantasy, but funny&quot;...because they're just so much more. The last few, especially the last few about the watch, have grown increasingly more meaningful. 'Night Watch' more than continues that trend. The inherent contemplations about the nature of time that were introduced with the History Monks in 'Thief of Time' are added to the depth that has become ever more present in the watch books. At the same time, 'Night Watch' provides some truly wonderful background on Vimes, Vetinari, and the rest of the original gang, while being far more than a simple prequel.I disagree with any who felt this book was not as funny as others; there were parts that made me laugh for minutes on end. Many of those parts involved humor anyone would understand, while others were so amusing simply because they involved characters that we're used to seeing decades later. What's even more important to me, however, is not that this book made me laugh -- Terry Pratchett has never written a book that has not accomplished that. This, however, is the first book he's written that has ever made me cry.One of the things I most admire about Terry Pratchett's writing is that he draws so much from history and from our own world, yet does so in ways that you never notice until you have learned the history elsewhere; I discover a new reference every time I read or reread a book. 'Night Watch' contains some truly striking commentary on war and revolution, as well as on a myriad of other topics. Do not begin the series with this book, as much of its value derives from the framework provided by previous books. With that said, I recommend this book to all and offer my applause and thanks to Mr.Pratchett -- he deserves them."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This book is more on the serious side of Pratchettt yet it still has the wit and the charm of all the other books.

Vimes going back in time 30 years and reliving a key moment in the current Watch of Ankh-Morpork's history could have been another sad attempt at a back-story type book with time travel elements. Pratchett turns the entire premise into a gorgeous roller coaster of Morporkian history mixed with a closer look at some key players. Wonder how Reg Shoe became a Zombie? Why did Nobby join the watch? Did Vetinari really go to Assassin school? All of these questions and more are answered masterfully along with a slight parody of fascist governments and a nod to John \\"Duke\\" Wayne. This book has to be one of the best Pratchett has ever written, and I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This was the 2nd of Pratchett's books that I have read, and I liked it even better than Monstrous Regiment. Commander Vimes is thrown 30 years back in time, and is now the mentor of his young self, though he takes the name of another copper. He and his cast of watchmen, or coppers, manage a rebellion similar to the French Revolution, though just in the city of Ankh-Morpork. His type of management skills are sorely needed by the inept, bumbling powers that be. Pratchett's spoofs are wonderfully done! A must read for Pratchett fans."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Sam Vimes is my favorite Discworld character, and this book is his triumph! I've read all of the Discworld books to date, and this one is my favorite. Keeps the reader in suspense, and I couldn't put it down. Great characters from the Discworld are seen in their younger days. A must read for all Discworld and Pratchett fans!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"...without Rincewind. Rincewind is definity my favorite, but this book clearly proves that all of his books are awesome. I'm a huge fan of Discworld. I am slowly collecting all of Terry Prachett's books, and his writing couldn't be more enjoyable. I was looking for a good Discworld novel to give to a friend, so I started reading Night Watch, to see if it would make a good gift for a fellow Discworld addict. It blew me away! Vimes is truly a spectacular character. The comedy in the book is outstanding, and the plot is superior, e.g. Qu of the Time Monks making the technology. If you haven't read any of his other books, you should not read this one, for it builds off his other work. But if you are an addict like I am, BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I love Terry Pratchett. This book is not like most of his other ones, but it is good all the same. It is very dark and has a strong message. Don't expect this book to be like all the other Terry Pratchett books, but I recomend it all the same."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"To me Night Watch is one of Terry Pratchett's best works yet. While a little darker then his previous ventures Pratchett demonstrates his remarkable talent of combining humor and poignancy into one incredible mix. His grasp of his characters is to be commended. He knows what he's doing with them and he does it well. One warning though, to those not familiar with the Ankh-Morpork crew(ie.Dibbler,Nobby,Reg Shoe,etc.)should probably read other \\"City Watch\\" novels before this one. It is definetley more enjoyable this way. Trust me."},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This is mainly a book for the die hard fans of Discworld. As one reader commented here, the cameos and some briefly seen characters are mostly enjoyed by those who have already met them.I personally love Vimes, even back when he was portayed as a drunk (Guards! Guards!), I feel he is a very human hero (and cynical, disgruntled, rumpled, etc.).In this book Pratchett delves into destiny, fate and the individual, something he had not done since &quot;Small Gods&quot; and carries it out succesfully. I look forward to his next book.I agree this might not be the best book to start the series with but there are plently of others to chose from. Just pick one.For new readers I say: &quot;What are you waiting for?! Get yourself into gear and visit Discworld&quot;For the die hards: &quot;Aren't we lucky? Pratchett continues writing for us.&quot;"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"This book is a riot. I have not read all of the Pratchett books, but I am steadily making my way through them, and besides the collaborative &quot;good omens&quot; this is my absolute favorite. For a work of comic fiction, there is a masterful portrayal of a psychotic French Revolution which has all the charm and sentiment of Les Miserables, which I appreciated all the more since I was having trouble keeping my car on the road (The audible.com version in my CD player, laughing so hard my eyes were watering.) Immensely amusing, and enjoyable in the deeper way than many of his other books, this makes a fantastic read"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"I've heard (read) many people say that Night Watch isn't one of Terry's better novels. I, however, feel that this is blatantly untrue.Night Watch is the book in which we learn all about how the characters of Sam Vimes, Vetinari and various other people developed. It is filled with humour, with classic lines such as, when discussing whether or not anybody has been to inform the parents' of a recent death; &quot;Anyone been to tell them?&quot; he asked. &quot;And don't say it was Nobby. We don't want any repeat of that &quot;bet you a dollar you're the widow Jackson&quot; nonsense.&quot; Night Watch is very emotional, though, as we read about the bloody rebellion that Vimes has been sent back to re-witness. Since I read my first Discworld book, I knew that Terry Pratchett was a wonderfully humourous writer, but I didn't know that he also wrote books that can invoke such a large amount of emotion as Night Watch does.And of course, it is practically Paradise for all Sam Vimes fanatics; two Sams in one book!"},{"Title":"Night Watch: Discworld #27","review":"Terry Pratchett doesn't seem to be able to write a less than wonderful book. Night Watch is another installment in the popular Discworld series and is a perfectly plotted adventure for Sam Vimes, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork Night Watch. The plot starts simply enough, with Vimes having a conversation with a hapless assassin. Thereafter however, the we follow Vimes back in time to the day that he joined the Watch.This is one of the more moving books Pratchett has written. It fleshes out even more the characters we are growing to love and gives us some peeks into some of the origins of these quirky folks. Pratchett is a master satirist and plotter. If you want some entertaining reading that will still move you and make you think, here it is."},{"Title":"Removing the Mask : Giftedness in Poverty","review":"This book addresses the differences between gifted students who are wealthy, middle class and poor and how they interact with their world. It further helps educators to meet the challenges of identifying gifted students of poverty through interviews, inventories and guidelines. While putting all the templates to use for every possible gifted child would be daunting, if not impossible, a gifted educator would be remiss in not using them for highly verbal or creative students of poverty. The book is well worth it for the teacher inventory alone."},{"Title":"Removing the Mask : Giftedness in Poverty","review":"This book is insightful about the community of learners who are often overlooked as gifted and talented. The book gives an analysis of a diverse group of students.I had several aha moments while reading this book."},{"Title":"Removing the Mask : Giftedness in Poverty","review":"The argument that growing up in poverty causes one to be overlooked with regard to giftedness doesn't fly with me. The author lays it on pretty thick about how poverty negatively affects how teachers view giftedness in their students. There was little in this book I found noteworthy when read with common sense as my guide. Our American educational system needs a serious overhaul and the focus on \\"feeling good\\" simply because you're in the classroom needs to go by the wayside. Poor or rich, all students are capable of giftedness. They just need to apply themselves and make the necessary effort to achieve success."},{"Title":"The fighter kite book!","review":"This is the book that kept my enthusiasm up while learning to fly a fighter. It's no coffee-table book, with simple line drawings only, but it does the trick at the right price.If you already fly well, or have a group of friends to help, then this is still a good book because David Gomberg is a well-travelled kite-flyer, and there are snippets of fighter information here that you'll be unlikely to come across elsewhere. Fighter kites are multifaceted, quirky and unique, and he gets this impression over well. One of the best aspects of the book is the many many quotes/tips from flyers all over the world.If you're looking for plans, then this is *not* really the book (there's just one simple plan, with little in the way of construction advice), instead look at the plans on the net or search for Philippe Gallot's classic book - and for a coffee-table book I'd choose Tal Streeter's &quot;A Kite Journey Through India&quot;.However, although both of those two books are also good at conveying the fun of fighters, neither gives anything like the practical information that this slim volume does on the actual techniques of *flying* a fighter.PS: As well as the classic small fighters, there is also a short chapter on fighting with larger &quot;Roks&quot;"},{"Title":"Venus on Top: Women Who Are Born to Lead and the Men Who Love Them","review":"In the franchising business, franchisors have long known to look for husband-and-wife teams where the wife runs the marriage and the business . . . and keeps the books while the man follows her orders ungrudgingly until he drops from fatigue. If you recruit dominant males instead, the wife stays at home . . . and you get only one person working on the business rather than two. The only downside to these hard-working couples is that when the men hit their 50s, they often run off with a submissive female employee and stop working on the business. Smart franchisors help these couples sell their franchise businesses at that point to pay for the divorce settlement.What's that story got to do with Venus on Top? More than you would expect. Many women are born to lead in their work, their businesses and in their marriages. Pair those women with men who want to lead in the same ways . . . and you have one leader too many. Pair them with a man who wants to follow and please them, and you can have a recipe for more successful marriages.I decided to read this book to gain more perspective on my great grandparents and parents . . . where in both generations the women led. The men followed silently in their wake . . . but not always happily. This book echoed one phrase the males all learned early in our family, \\"When the women are happy, the men are happy.\\"Ms. Abernathy describes her experiences with three failed marriages and her conclusions about how women who want to lead at work and at home can find compatible males who will enjoy that kind of relationship. She also provides advice for those who are willing to be a woman who follows her husband's lead . . . but the primary value of this book comes for those who want to know how to get what they want . . . and know what that is.Much of the book is based on Jung, studies of ancient goddess-based religions, positive thinking and self-help methods. If you are familiar with those subjects, you won't find anything new in those sections. If you would like to learn a little in those areas, the material is accessible.Most women I know would call this a five-star book just for chapter 10, Training Your Man or Why Real Women Don't Do Housework. That section provides the best explanation I've ever seen of how to help men take on household chores in ways that will be pleasing to women. The essence of the advice is to provide hands-on demonstrations, answer questions, observe, correct and provide encouragement. Now, was that so hard? Men can learn. Every household chore that I do now was learned through that process.The book veers off in a few places that can be misunderstood by being too literal about what she says. Ms. Abernathy, like a large percentage of women, has a thing about men leaving the toilet seat up. She does go on in addressing that problem which really bugs her. This is a litmus test of a man's devotion to her. She also makes it sound like giving or withholding sexual favors in some random fashion is great for a marriage. On closer reading, I think her message is a little different from her words. The real message, I think, is to create a positive relationship through personal warmth and mutual sexual gratification that relies as much on flirting and surprise as it does on accommodating men's desire for sex.Overall, I found the tone of the book to be refreshing coming from a woman in her 50s. If something's important to a woman in a relationship . . . why shouldn't she be on top (which Ms. Abernathy means both literally and psychologically) in the relationship?I suspect that many younger women will wonder what all the fuss is about.Ms. Abernathy describes her philosophy with enthusiasm. I suspect she would be an entertaining speaker on this subject."},{"Title":"Venus on Top: Women Who Are Born to Lead and the Men Who Love Them","review":"In my search for new information on dating, romance, and love relationships, I've come across a real winner for women and men who don't fit the traditional Mars-Venus stereotypes.First of all this is not a book that recommends that all women should take the lead (Be on top!) in their marriages. In fact, women who are more the \\"Surrender Wife\\" types should probably stay away from this book unless they want their belief systems shaken and minds opened up.But for women who are naturally dominant, this is a unique book with information and strategies for creating a happy marriage with a different kind of man than they were originally taught to desire. The fact is that there are some men who enjoy a strong, powerful woman and such a woman should not be discouraged from being her natural self in the relationship world. Instead, she should retain what makes herself special and look for a different kind of man who appreciates and likes the way she is.Women will especially like:* An entire chapter on how to train your man to do housework.* Interviews with men who enjoy being in a women-led marriage.* The 4 Essential Characteristics of a Good ManThis book is an interesting and enlightening mix of solid spiritual principles and heartfelt personal experiences. It offers a simple but effective recipe for take-charge women who want to succeed in romance as well as career. It is a welcome break from the Mars and Venus strategies that don't apply in some romantic situations."},{"Title":"Venus on Top: Women Who Are Born to Lead and the Men Who Love Them","review":"I finally reached the point of giving up. How much longer did I want to make myself suffer? ~Barbara Wright AbernathyBarbara Wright Abernathy is a true survivor of love. Her dreams of marriage and love were destroyed three times and in her new book, she speaks from a life of experience. She was born to lead and yet she still enjoys men opening doors and makes excellent points about the increased demands on a working woman.Venus On Top is a book for women who have grown weary in the unsatisfying presence of mediocre men. The type of men who are still floundering about trying to discover purpose or who have not yet come to the realization of love as a gift to humanity itself. These types of men can at times take you to hell and leave you there. They destroy you financially, physically and emotionally and then leave you to burn out or use up your resources and walk away, leaving you barren and vulnerable. Barbara finally found a man who could show love instead of destroying love.Barbara writes beautifully about her relationship with her husband and he seems more than willing to allow her soul's beauty to shine like the star she was born to become. She believes women are either star women or earth mothers. You can also enhance the good qualities of each female archetype. The shadow elements are enlightening.As she weaves stories from mythology and explains ancient goddess civilizations, she explores the possibilities of the modern goddess lifestyle. This goes beyond the basics of feminism and gives you ideas on how to allow men to pleasure you in ways you may not have imagined they could. I have to agree with the author about the erotic nature of a man helping with the housework. There is something exciting about a man participating in a relationship and caring for you and showing a desire to be a true partner.I have noticed that my husband loves to go the store to purchase food he thinks I will enjoy. So, while this book promotes the idea of a man cleaning the house, this might not be your husband's style. You may have more success hiring a housecleaner. Your husband may want to show his love in other ways.This book is mostly for Star Women who are in a relationship with a Comet Man (Was this pun intended?). This becomes more apparent as you read the book in depth. Comet Men are men who experience great pleasure from pleasing a woman and from loving a woman. They are the poets of the world, the men who make you breakfast in bed...and sigh... it is a thing of beauty.I do have to make a few comments about why a goddess should stop worrying about toilet seats and laundry and consider giving her sex slave his own bathroom. I mean common, all this power and money and the man can't have his own space? If a man hates doing the laundry, why force him to learn how to sort the laundry so he doesn't color your panties pink with red socks? I mean, at some point you have to realize that some men will resent having to do all the housework.Barbara does provide quite a few realistic guidelines like \\"8 Steps to Power\\" and even shares many \\"top secret\\" male fantasies. If you are thinking this book is all about pleasing a woman, then you might be surprised to find information on how to unleash your sex goddess so you can please your um \\"sex slave\\" and drive him crazy with your womanly powers.With all this said, I don't understand her comment about the idea of \\"learning how to please a man\\" being an idea lurking in our minds. To me, this is a good idea, not something to be tossed out into the cold. Do men really give love to get sex or are they getting love by having sex? Barbara also cautions against withholding affection and explains how this damages your relationship.The thoughts in this enlightening manual for \\"Star Women\\" will show you how to take charge of your happiness. If you have tried living the life of the submissive housewife and you are tired of being powerless and controllable, then this book could encourage a more peaceful life and you may discover your hidden female power. All relationships are unique and if your man enjoys being more submissive, then this book could encourage more romance and less stress in your relationship. If you are a working woman, this book may give you ideas about the type of relationship you have always desired.To me, the ideal man is the man who does the laundry without you having to ask. He knows when you need his assistance and takes pride in the power he has in regards to your happiness.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Venus on Top: Women Who Are Born to Lead and the Men Who Love Them","review":"Review:Venus On Top is an easy and provocative read offering lots of insight and good advice from an author whom adversity has clearly taught some of life's most important lessons. A quick trip through history shows us that Goddesses ruled until male dominated empires and organizations usurped their power and stole their crowns. While men eventually gave up their swords for a seat in the Senate, men continued to dictate policy and procedure with little consideration for the \\"weaker sex\\" - father knows best, after all. Organized religion seems to appear as a major culprit in any historical account of the suppression of women's rights and the author builds a case to substantiate that point of view. While this historical section appears to have been carefully researched and might be of interest to those scholarly types who appreciate a sense of the past, I had a tendency to scan this material eager to get back up to date.Typically, Web sites promoting relationships where the female is the dominant mate or partner rely more heavily on graphic examples of how a man's constant craving for sex can be used to a woman's advantage. When you consider that men seeking fulfillment of their submissive desires generally read these books and sites, the style and content is most appropriate for the audience. However, Venus On Top takes a kinder, gentler, saner approach, which not only reflects the author's point of view, but also seems more in keeping for a book designed to reach a female audience. This book represents a more palatable way to introduce a reluctant mate or partner to the concept of a \\"Wife-led\\" marriage or Female-led romantic relationship. However, while I found the author's account of this lifestyle to be both fascinating and informative, what I personally found most insightful was her account of the personal events that led her to where she is today.After forty-seven years, which included three divorces and two bankruptcies, she found something that many of us (male and female) continue to seek - a way to break a cycle of self-destruction by following a path of positive enlightenment. To me, that insight is worth the price of admission. The clarity provided left me feeling much more optimistic and hopeful that there is a reward at the end of the rainbow, if we're willing take the time and make the effort to accept responsibility for our own happiness; by so doing, we control our destiny.I highly recommend this book. It contains a lot of good advice and information. Whether you are dominant or submissive, male or female, straight or a little bit Rock \`n' Roll, Venus On Top appeals to a wide audience on many different levels."},{"Title":"Venus on Top: Women Who Are Born to Lead and the Men Who Love Them","review":"This book was given to me as a gift. A male friend had heard Barbara Wright Abernathy at a speaking engagement and told me \\"She says the same things you've been thinking\\". With the book in hand I also took the time to visit the authors website.Have you ever heard someone say \\"She wears the pants in that family\\", or \\"She's one bossy/powerful/in control woman\\"? Well, that is the type of woman this book was written for. Barbara had failed relationships and didn't know why. This book details her experience and what she and her husband, Stephen, learned together. Relationships like this aren't for everyone, but there are a lot of us who needed someone to put the idea into writing.No one talks about power levels between partners. Some partners argue all the time about finances, even though one is clearly more adept at managing money than the other. With help from this book, I can see where it's possible to have a relationship with clearly defined roles. Perhaps I get an extra vote when we're tied on a decision. Or he agrees to always check the 'Honey-Do-List' first thing on a Saturday morning. If you're a strong woman, it helps you figure out how you and your partner can simply clearly define your roles in the relationship.It's been my experience that men love to please their women. This book just brings certain aspects to light and helps women to see and acknowledge the power we DO have..and how to use it in a healthy way for creating happiness in our relationship.This book isn't about living with a Female Dominatrix or involving heavy 'kink' into your home life. If that's your choice, fine. But this book is more for the average folks - of which I am one - who would simply like to have their relationship be closer and more loving.There are more of us powerful women out here than you would think! This book gives me food for thought .. and action. Thanks Barbara and Stephen!"},{"Title":"Venus on Top: Women Who Are Born to Lead and the Men Who Love Them","review":"Barbara Wright Abernathy has written a wonderful guidebook for women and men that offers a blueprint for a happy marriage and/or romantic relationship. Ms. Abernathy's message to women is to not be afraid to assert yourself within a romantic relationship-communicate to your male partner exactly what you want. Then show him how to give you what you want.Ms. Abernathy's message to men is to not be afraid to give a female partner exactly what she wants--pleasing a wife/girlfriend can be a wonderfully happy experience for a man--especially within the framework of a romantic relationship.Written in a friendly, familiar style, Ms. Abernathy's book encourages women to insist that their men treat them with deference and respect.Men are likewise encouraged to be sensitive to their wives/girlfriends needs.Women are encouraged to seek out male partners who will support them in all their endeavors. These men exist and are eager to provide their girlfriends/wives with this kind of affection.This is a GREAT BOOK. It is very practical and reflects real world experience. I have found that the approach Ms. Abernathy outlines really works. There are many suggestions on how to put these principles into practice. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in enjoying a happy, long lasting romantic relationship."},{"Title":"Venus on Top: Women Who Are Born to Lead and the Men Who Love Them","review":"I liked this book.

The husband is a very kind hearted person, who has always been one to pull his own weight, with the children, household chores, shopping, etc. But, no, that wasn't enough for her. The wife runs her own business, and has decided that he needs to buck up and do more. While she sits on the phone with her clients, he has to jerk around his own office schedule to meet her needs. I have seen him go from a pleasant, smiling person to a sad, exhausted, numbed robot. His wife has zero empathy for his needs, or those of anyone else, for that matter.

Either a man dominantes a woman and basically has her serving him at home or he then essentially runs a buisness and is the work horse while his \\"working\\" wife \\"runs\\" the buisness but proves more a show horse than anything else and then the man suddenly swtiches over from being \\"cooperative\\" (i.e. submissive) to running off with what Mitchell calls a submissive wife.Yeah this makes lots of sense. A woman is either a bossy twit that doesn't see it coming or a guy is a boorish brute or a milquetoast.Please this book is not a serious academic or analytical take on a supposed natural inclination of leadership--regardless of gender. Rather it is clearly a fantasia catering to the female domination fetish. Any author or idiotic reviewer with such a black and white view of human interaction is fundamentally jaded, narrow-minded, and nearsighted.Mitchell, for example, sounds like a man with much want to have the opportunity to run off with any woman and most likely has had little interaction with the opposite sex to know anything of value to pass along to a reader.The bottom line is that leaders are more made than born. There are an endless supply of people with raw talent. The world is overflowing with them. What it lacks is those with the discipline and not just the \\"drive,\\" which is so often chimed as a great attribute. The dedication to grooming oneself and staying focus on long-term goals that can literally take many years to attain is a requirement few with all the talent in the world are ready to undertake.In our me-me, show-me-the-results-right-now demanding, impatient, immediacy, few men--or women--have what it takes to be a leader. Men have suffered from this for decades, namely believing that they can do anything simply because they think it. It takes work though more than anything to make it. Women today, however, have caught up with male ego and vanity in that now women genuinely beleive this is \\"their time\\" and they have an inherent right to claim the future without actually doing what is required to truly make it and have earned that right. Birth and gender and all that glorious talent alone do not make it in the world.This book only caters to the the insecure and delussional."},{"Title":"Basic Essentials Archery (Basic Essentials Series)","review":"Children and adults who are new to the sport of archery will find this book extremely helpful. This brand new, reader-friendly paperback by Habeishi and Mallory includes a variety of information -- from a brief history of archery to the tools you need to get started in the sport, practice safely and effectively, and properly use, care for and store archery equipment. I highly recommend this read to anyone who has never picked up a bow and arrow or to those who haven't attempted a shot since 7th grade physical education."},{"Title":"Basic Essentials Archery (Basic Essentials Series)","review":"This book is excellent for someone who is just starting the hobby of archery and who has not yet learned ANYTHING about different types of bows, arrows, and shooting stances.

I wrote this review which was published in the October 2002 edition of the Usability Interface, the quarterly newsletter of the Usability SIG of the STC.Don&#65533;t be fooled by the somewhat unmemorable cover of Usability Testing and Research. Carol Barnum combines research findings with practitioner experience to produce probably the most comprehensive but concise resources on usability testing now available.This book is part of the Allyn & Bacon series in technical communication. Designed in part to fulfill the needs of students in a graduate-level class in usability, it is also a great resource for usability practitioners as a tool to update and upgrade their skills. The structure of this book should suit both neophytes and the experienced. Each chapter and its subsections are well structured with a logical progression from one section to the next. The table of contents is well organized and very readable so that a knowledgeable individual can scan to find those sections that are of most immediate interest. The index is likely to be a great reference tool as it was created by a professional usability tester, someone who should know what a reader is likely to need.Dr. Barnum, a usability consultant and professor to graduate usability students, draws upon nearly every prominent usability authority to build a comprehensive bible of usability testing. The author&#65533;s academic background is evident in the careful footnoting of every page and the detailed listing of scores of references at the end of each chapter. If there is an issue the reader wishes to further explore, the source is cited for ready access. The findings from top usability professionals are distilled to their essence and woven into comprehensive work on usability. The reader gains the primary benefit of hundreds of books, papers, and articles without having to filter though this sea of information. There is little if anything of importance that is left out of this 448-page book of concentrated wisdom and knowledge.The reader, whether a student or an experienced practitioner, gets the benefit of both analytic research and its practical application. Many examples of actual real-world, usability test plans, data, analysis, or summary reports are reprinted. These examples are great models for the practice of usability. This book has not just general how you might do something but also how it was actually done &#65533; not just theory but actual practice.Anyone interested in the usability of hardware, software, computer games, Web sites &#65533; any product that has a user interface &#65533; will find a great wealth of information. The first chapter starts off defining usability and explaining usability testing models and theory. It also provides a methodology for cost justification and the basis to proselytiz for usability.In Chapter 2, the author should be commended for taking a holistic view of usability and discussing how heuristics, surveys, and focus groups play a role in the design of a usable product. Chapters 3 through 7 explain user and task analysis as a precursor to designing, planning, preparing, and conducting the test. Chapter 8 details not just the analyses of the collected data but also different methods of reporting the findings to obtain the best result. The final chapter builds on everything before and discusses those issues specific to Web usability. Nearly every chapter has an appendix with real-world examples specific to that chapter. The end-of-the-book appendix discusses how to make usability testers work as a well-functioning team.Some books are chock full of scholarly research and empirical data and great for academia. This book has a solid base in research but was written for the real-world practitioners of usability. It&#65533;s this steady focus on practical real-world application that most impresses me about this book.Still not convinced this book is for you? Check out the companion Web site, ..... Download material from the book&#65533;s appendices and sidebars. Peruse the many usability tools and link to other usability resources on the Web.Usability Testing and Research is not only of great value as a resource of practical information to usability professionals but also as a tool to explain the benefits of usability design and testing to skeptical management. Carol Barnum should be congratulated for a great job in bringing together in one book such a complete, well-organized compilation of usability theory and practicality."},{"Title":"Usability Testing and Research (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","review":"It's been a long time since we've had a new textbook on usability testing. Dumas and Redish came out in 1993, Rubin in 1994 and although I still use both of them constantly, I've been looking out for a solid textbook that has more awareness of the web in it. Carol Barnum's new book meets that need.The book opens with chapters on \`What is Usability and What is Usability Testing', \`Other Methods for Getting Feedback About Product Usability', \`User and Task Analysis', and \`Iterative Testing for User-Centred Design'. I can see that Carol wants to set user testing in context, but I was concerned that if you're really new to usability testing then you might be put off by Chapter 2 \`Other methods', as it is a very densely written chapter that describes many techniques very briefly.The meat of the book starts at Chapter 5 with \`Planning for Usability Testing' and continues through \`Preparing for Usability Testing', \`Conducting the Usability Test', and \`Analysing and Reporting Results'. The book then changes course slightly with a chapter on 'Web Usability', giving some design principles as well as details of applying the methods to the web.Our Open University students love the plentiful examples in our course on User Interface Design and Evaluation. Carol Barnum's book should also appeal because of its extensive use of examples. She gives lots of detail from a student team's test of Hotmail (Microsoft's web-based e-mail service) so you can see the process as they tackled it. I found it a little frustrating that there weren't any screen shots of Hotmail as it stood at the time of the test. As well as the Hotmail example she uses excerpts from a test of a University web site, and has lots of anecdotes and smaller examples as well, many of them aimed at testing documentation - a neglected area. Perhaps the amount of space taken up the examples means that there is less meat in the core of the book, but if I were a beginner I'd find it very reassuring. Conversely, though, experienced practitioners might find Chapter 5 onwards a bit basic.Academics and practitioners who like to follow up interesting ideas will be glad to know that there is extensive referencing. The appendices placed in context with the chapters broke the flow for me somewhat when I was reading the book at a sitting, but I think they would be more convenient placed where they are when using the book to actually plan and conduct a test. Each chapter closes with questions/topics for discussion and exercises which looked helpful to me if you were planning to use this as a textbook, or if you are a new practitioner who is using the book as a guide through your first usability tests.Carol Barnum's style is clear and easy to read as you would expect from a Professor in Technical Communication. She often uses comments from Chauncey Wilson, a very experienced practitioner to give some practical tips and insights, but I sometimes found myself wishing that she had put more a more personal touch, more of her own practical experience, explicitly into the book. Apart from a couple of anecdotes, the word \`I' hardly appears until we get some of her own opinions on web usability at the end of Chapter 9. We can guess at one of her concerns because she includes an interesting appendix on \`Making it work as a team', which I though was a good, concise introduction.I would recommend this book as an introductory text for undergraduates because of the extensive examples, fairly reasonable price and referencing. I think it would also be good for practitioners - for people who are getting started with user testing - to help them through their first test. I think that I'll find myself recommending that readers should start with Chapter 5, and then come back to Chapters 1 to 4 later.(This review was written for 'Interfaces', the magazine of the British HCI Group)"},{"Title":"Usability Testing and Research (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","review":"Usability Testing and Research (UTAR), by Carol M. Barnum,is a book that every technical communicator should have on his or her bookshelf. Although written primarily as a textbook for college courses, UTAR is an excellent introduction to user-centered design and usability testing for those in industry who have had no formal training in the area, or for those who would like a refresher. The book is designed so you can read straight through, skip around and read topics of interest, or dip into for specific information. An excellent table of contents and thorough index make topics immediately accessible and make it easy to follow them through the book. It shouldn't be surprising, however, that a book about usability that is this good would provide excellent access.The very brief summary of the highlights of UTAR are:* A structure that moves from theory to practice in every step of user-centered design and usability testing* Well-written text with lots of heads for easy navigation* Anecdotal and humorous information in sidebars to make the theory real* Great descriptions of low-fidelity usability testing with examples of how to do it* Samples of the artifacts of usability testing such as plans, forms, reports, questionnaires, testing questions, and checklists* Real case studies with their artifacts that are threaded throughout the book in the appropriate chapters and appendixes* Discussion questions and exercises for those who want to teach from the book* A chapter on Web usability testing* An appendix on creating teams to do usability testingThen, as if the book weren't good enough by itself, Barnum has included the URL of a Web site that provides resources, templates, forms, and other support. The PDF templates and forms are useful as models for developing your own or to print and use as is. They fit nicely into the structure and content of UTAR. A support link on the Web page provides PowerPoint presentations and charts a teacher could use in the classroom or a technical communicator or manager could use to educate decision makers about the benefits of usability testing.One of the buttons on the home page is \\"About the Author,\\" so I clicked it to see what Barnum's credentials are. She a Fellow of the Society for Technical Communication (STC), and a recipient of STC's Jay R. Gould Award for Excellence in Teaching Technical Communication. That explains the excellence of Usability Testing and Research.I manage a group of technical communicators in a large telecommunications company, and I'm getting a copy of Usability Testing and Research for our library. We'll use it to help with our usability testing and to mentor those who have little or no experience in that activity. My suggestion is to buy it, read it, refer back to it often.Art Elser, PhDManager, Information Development"},{"Title":"Usability Testing and Research (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","review":"As a Usability professional, I have the opportunity and obligation to keep current on the literature surrounding usability research. Usability Testing and Research not only meets those criteria, but also gives readers the opportunity to delve into and understand the usability testing process.Carol Barnum's book is at first a typical academic textbook that explains not only the principles of usability, but also the argument for usability and user-centered design. However, it is the presence of appendices at the end of most chapters that will help readers perform usability testing.The appendices are detailed copies of documents and protocols used in previous usability tests. The aforementioned principles and arguments would stand on their own merits, but the added appendices give context to the principles and arguments, thus giving the reader the opportunity to see the principles and prototypes in action.From my standpoint as a professional in the field, valid usability testing starts with careful, in-depth preparation. Usability Testing and Research handholds readers through this process, starting with objectives and ending with participant recruitment. This is a very important aspect of testing, as poor planning always equals poor results.Barnum devotes several pages of the book to a very overlooked aspect of usability testing: reporting the results. Besides the detailed attention given to writing the results in a formal report or a quick report (or roadrunner as the book explains), the book also explains how to present and prepare for an oral report. No matter how valid the test may be, without an accurate, to-the-point report that gives the audience what it needs, the test results and associated costs are wasted. Barnum even discusses visual aids and the importance of the highlight tape. This, of course, is paramount to the report's success, since seeing is believing.The book even contains a chapter devoted solely to Web usability that details common Web problems as well as insight into the Web's goal-driven users. Although research on the Web is constantly changing due to the experience level of the user base and innovative technology, the Web chapter offers an easy to understand benchmark for all usability professionals who evaluate the Web.All in all, Usability Testing and Research covers everything that an individual new to the field needs to know. It also contains practical advice and how-to that even seasoned usability professionals need to review from time to time.Ken KelloggManager - Usability Research"},{"Title":"Usability Testing and Research (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","review":"I'm frankly startled at the universally positive reviews for this book. As a full-time usability researcher and an alumnus of Apple's human interface technologies team, I felt this to be one of the worst books on usability I've ever read. I could not possibly recommend it for either academic or professional purposes.I'm going to limit specific comments to just the first 10 pages of this book. Critiquing the remainder would warrant a full dissertation, not an Amazon review.1) Subpar fact-checking.For example, on page 3: \\"Alan Cooper, a usability specialist who did pioneering work at Apple...\\" Alan Cooper never worked for Apple, let alone perform pioneering work there. Alan *Kay* worked for Apple. And Alan Kay's most significant work was by far at Xerox PARC; his Apple work with the Vivarium is rarely cited in comparison.2) Too many overstated claims lacking conclusion validityGiven the author's own academic background, I'm startled by the poorly grounded research-based claims littered throughout the book. For example, on page 5: \\"a belief confirmed by a study that shows that '27% of all Web transactions are abandoned at the payment screen.\\" ''This claim, as presented, is indefensible: no study author would have access to every single web transaction to perform such an categorical assessment. Were it even true at the time of the study, who's to say it's true now? Presumably she meant \\"27% of Web transactions *sampled*...\\"?Especially given the author's added responsibility in writing for students who are likely concurrently learning basic research methods skills -- including assessing conclusion validity -- this book's own research claims should be responsibly situated. This aspect of the textbook disturbed me the most, because it presents the moral hazard of students tacitly learning to make similar such overreaching and false claims from their own work as usability researchers.3) Author pushes usability testing as it may have been 10-15 years ago, not as it works today.For example, on page 10, she quotes usability testing salesman Jakob Nielsen: \\"If no [usability test] information is available, you might as well choose by tossing a coin, and you will have a 50% probability of choosing the best interface\\".Go tell this to Apple: there was not any formal usability testing on the iPhone, and yet reviewers hailed it as the most usable (and best interface) ever shipped on a phone. Instead, Apple iterated designs rapidly, and relies upon extensive use of peer cognitive walkthroughs and an emphasis in employee recruiting for good usability sense. By blindly dismissing the value of other methods of getting to good design, the author presents a skewed and misleading image of usability practice in reality.Beyond countless such \\"yowser\\" moments in reading this book, it's just a mediocre book attempting to straddle the line between a practitioner book and a student textbook - while ultimately failing to meet the needs of either audience.For practitioners, it's far too verbose and lacking in visual design affordances to use in practice; you can't scan a section for a few seconds before a study, because the book largely consists of paragraph after paragraph of text with the occasional bulleted list and header.For students, it's just a low-value textbook: the printing is cheap (on-demand), and the price is high. The book's content suggests that author received no significant editorial or professional design assistance. The most important messages key to designing one's first usability study are buried in paragraph after paragraph of academic tangents. The author's widespread use of overreaching research-based knowledge claims makes it hard to know which assertions to trust, and which not to trust. Publishers should be investing a lot more resources into a book if they're charging such a high price (contrast with Baxter & Courage's beautiful user research book, which sadly omits usability testing).Students - and practitioners - deserve a better usability testing book than this one."},{"Title":"Usability Testing and Research (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","review":"Most of the existing books about usability testing are ten years old. While these books have a lot to offer a current student of user-centred design and usability testing, some students find them too out-of-date to be taken seriously. This book addresses that issue. The audience for the book is clearly for those who are new to usability and usability testing. However, experienced professionals will find a fair amount of information that is useful to them as well.The first four chapters form an introduction to user-centred design: definitions, testing models, other methods for gathering usability data, user analysis, task analysis, and prototyping. The remaining chapters discuss the process of usability testing itself: planning the test, preparing for the test, and conducting the test. One interesting chapter discusses a topic that is usually overlooked in the other usability literature: analysing the data and writing the report. This chapter also discusses the Common Industry Format for reporting usability results. The inclusion of this discussion increases the usefulness of this book for usability professionals.Dr Barnum devotes a chapter to the sometimes nebulous topic of usability testing for the web. Although there are other books that discuss this topic alone, the inclusion of this material in this book is excellent. Students who are new to usability testing will find this book more useful than a book devoted solely to web usability testing. After completing this, a student can then go on to read web-specific books such as Nielsen's recent &quot;Designing Web Usability&quot;.Students and others learning about the field will find the extensive examples used throughout the book to be extremely helpful. Together, these examples provide sufficient material for a student to model their complete usability test, from planning to reporting the results. Additional examples are available on a website maintained by the publisher. These examples are less useful for current practicioners, but do not detract from the overall text for this audience.For those who are interested in this field, this book an excellent introduction. It is well-written, and the examples provide a cookbook for students to emulate. Experienced professionals will probably not find this book to be as useful as a new student, although it is a very useful refresher.Disclaimer: I am a past student of Dr Barnum's, and the work that my student team produced for her class is used in this book. I am now a human factors engineer for a large corporation. I keep this book on my shelf in my office, and often lend it out to our interns who are learning about this field."},{"Title":"Usability Testing and Research (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","review":"It's been a while since there's been a new book published on usability testing. It isn't a topic that gets dated, so the books that have been out there a while are still great ones. But it's good to have a new one too. This one by Carol Barnum is a thorough, practical, highly usable book on Usability Testing. Carol starts the book with chapters on user centered design. These chapters are pretty good, but the real value, I think is the detailed chapters on how to plan, carry out, analyze and report on usability tests that are really excellent.Besides a lot of detail on usability testing protocol (well written and highly readable) there are lots of examples of facilitator scripts, recruiting and screener forms, Think Aloud instructions, etc.I wish the book itself were of a higher quality. The binding, paper, and printing seem low budget, yet the price is not low! No matter, buy it anyway.

Heidegger regarded himself as a thinker on being, and made use of the term Sein (a German word translated roughly as \\"the act of Being\\") which he believed was concealed in being. To Heidegger, the Western metaphysical tradition had forgotten about Sein and it was to this forgetting that he turned his attention, in for example his greatest work _Sein und Zeit_. According to Sacchi, this revilement of classical metaphysics and first philosophy in fact rests upon a misunderstanding of Heidegger's. Thus, much of this work is spent defending the classical tradition from the light of Thomistic philosophy against Heidegger's radical critique. Sacchi argues that Heidegger's understanding of Sein degrades reason (calling to mind Luther's remark that reason is \\"the devil's prostitute\\" - recall that Luther was an important influence on Heidegger) as a means for ascertaining truth and turns towards a revelation in the thinking of Martin Heidegger himself. Heidegger rejects metaphysics as onto-theology (echoing the critique of Kant in his _Critique of Pure Reason_); however, Heidegger's thinking itself would come to reembrace metaphysics. Sacchi argues that Heidegger attempted to revise the paganism of Parmenedes against the Christian understanding of classical metaphysics in the form of Thomism and that Heidegger's insistence that his Sein is not to be understood as God, makes his thinking fundamentally atheistic. Here, the idealist/realist divide comes into play, and Sacchi will argue that Heidegger's thinking turns invariably towards idealism (e.g. Hegelianism) as against the realism of classical metaphysics and first philosophy. Heidegger's later thinking under the influence of poetics (ranging from Rilke to Holderlin's pantheistic neopaganism) becomes increasingly convoluted, and Heidegger himself will begin to emerge as an esoteric gnostic proclaiming a special revelation and un-concealment of Sein within history. Sacchi makes some interesting parallels between Heidegger's particular formulations of language and those of apocalyptic (apocalypsis: meaning \\"to reveal\\") writers of the first and second centuries AD and BC. This book is interesting in that it provides a fascinating critique at a figure who has remained problematic for many. Sacchi maintains a Thomistic outlook and thus shows that although Heidegger's thinking must ultimately be rejected (as possibly incoherent as well) it does contain some interesting insights into the un-concealment of Sein."},{"Title":"The Apocalypse of Being : The Esoteric Gnosis of Martin Heidegger","review":"I waited at least 6 months for this book to finally become available. My anticipation was magnified by the remarkably cogent and faithfully Thomistic essays written by Mario Enrique Sacchi and posted at the Jacques Maritain Center. I still consider him to be one of a handful of the sharpest Thomists out there.But, alas, the book fell far short of my expectations. The previous reviewer mentioned in a review of Caputo's Book on Aquinas and Heidegger that Thomists might prefer this more polemical work by Sacchi. Unfortunately, I think that the only people who will wade through this book at all are dyed-in-the-wool Thomists, which, given the capacities of the Argentine author, is a real disappointment. In fact, I now wish I had rated Caputo's book more highly, so that I would not equate the level of argumentation in the two by a common three-star rating.This book, short as it is, could have been a lot shorter still. It seems to circle about in the same polemical tracks without showing for this any significant gain in understanding. In fact, Dr. Sacchi really missed the point on which the debate between Aquinas and Heidegger turns. Using Heidegger's terminology of the &quot;ontological difference&quot; between &quot;being&quot; and beings and the &quot;theological difference&quot; between the First Being (God) and beings, the two thinkers give a different priority to them. Aquinas makes the &quot;ontological difference&quot; subordinate to the &quot;theological difference&quot;; Heidegger does the opposite. So the burden of refuting Heidegger is to show that the &quot;ontological difference&quot; is indeed subordinated to the &quot;theological difference&quot;. And that would require a deep investigation of the meaning of the &quot;analogy of being&quot; in Saint Thomas. That really does not take place, and I do not recall so much as a single productive reference to Thomas' &quot;analogy of being&quot;. Rather, there is too much circular reasoning of the sort which says that Heidegger's mistake was that he was not a Thomist and did not understand the centrality of the act-of-being (&quot;esse&quot;). I think that Caputo in his own work showed decisively that repeating this word like a mantra does not really get at Heidegger's critique, because act-of-being (&quot;esse&quot;) and essence (&quot;essentia&quot;) would be another pair of poles in which &quot;being&quot; reveals itself, but in no way capture &quot;being&quot; exhaustively. Esse/essentia would merely be a temporally conditioned revelation of &quot;being&quot;, but &quot;being&quot; itself withdraws from us.Perhaps I will read the book again at some point to further sift his arguments. But I am far more inclined to reread Caputo at this point."},{"Title":"The Apocalypse of Being : The Esoteric Gnosis of Martin Heidegger","review":"Sacchi competently shows how Heidegger's use of the term \\"Being\\" is so nebulous that it cannot function as a sufficiently refined notion for a truly penetrating \\"thinking on being\\". By contrast, Sacchi explains, Aquinas' doctrine of \\"esse\\" (the act of existence) serves well for deep metaphysical reflection on God and His creatures (angels, man, animals, plants, minerals). Heidegger erred in departing from the traditional Scholastic machinery of potency/act, essence/existence, matter/form, substance/accidents. Only with these concepts ready at hand can one lay a firm philosophical foundation for theology and apologetics.It seems to me that Heidegger's \\"critique\\" of the so-called \\"oblivion of being\\" by the Scholastics can be answered with a mere shoulder-shrug.

There is no need to seek refuge in a notion of Being as \\"unconcealment\\" or \\"emergence into the clearing\\" or \\"presencing within absencing\\".

However it fails ultimately because of some bad choices in terminology, light scholarship, and a narrow understanding of metaphysics. The author doesn't quote any work by anyone written in the last 30 years and focuses only on a few lines of Heidegger ignoring some clear statements by Heidegger that would have resolved issues that trouble Sacchi. Not only that, but a more careful reading of Heidegger would show that his views are not as radically opposed to metaphysics as Sacchi understands it. Sacchi rejects the metaphysycs of \\"pagans\\" like the pre-Socratics, and while it would seem he represents Scholasticism, he will further claim that medieval Scholasticism is decadent. What we are left with is Aquinas's metaphysics alone, perhaps some Aristotle by extension. Not a word on whether Plato's ontology is to be rejected as well.What is most frustrating about this book is how the word \\"being\\" is used. The ontological difference is clear and simple. There are beings and there is Being. Sacchi transforms this into \\"being and Sein\\". One has to read then the word \\"being\\" as \\"beings\\" most of the time I think. For Sacchi, Sein is a fabrication of Heidegger's mind and a replacement for god. So there are beings (being in Sacchi's terminology) and god. Fine. He also speaks of \\"being as such\\" and it is unclear if this means beings as such or something else. Then he introduces the act/process of entification which he later terms the act of being. Presumably one is to read this as \\"act of beings\\". The problem is that Sacchi assignes as the source of this act sometimes beings and sometimes something else, (god?). Beings, the act of being, and that which is by virtue of itself and nothing else all relate by participation-- reminding us of that pagan Plato. While I don't know Aquinas as well as Heidegger or ancient Greeks, Aquinas does not seem as complex as Sacchi makes him to be. Heidegger's phenomenology would be a great resource the think about this curious and almost Platonic in-between: the act of being. Chapter V is the most metaphysical but it's almost unintelligible by virtue of Sacchi's interpretation of Aquinas. Had this work been better organized it would have started by elucidating what the metaphysics that Sacchi defends looks like. Instead he starts immediately with criticising Heidegger and giving us only bits and pieces of what his \\"scientific\\" metaphysics is. When we finally get there in chapter V, it turns out to be more convoluted that anything Heidegger would devise.Although Sacchi knows of Heidegger's Being of beings, he claims that Heidegger's Being is extra-entitative and has nothing to do with beings. Moreover, he is completely unaware of Dasein's fundamental ontology or doesn't want to accept Dasein as a being. He wants analytic scientific metaphysics to study beings to get to god syllogistically (no leap required) but he is silent on Heidegger's method of studying Dasein first instead of tables and chairs. Rather, he claims that Heidegger is an immanentalist idealist (and a transcendentalist at once) and neo-pagan for concerning himself with Dasein's thinking to get to the \\"essence of Sein\\" (according to Sacchi) and for accepting Parmenides's notion of the identity of Being and thinking.This book has a great title, but it turns out that Sacchi claims that Heidegger saw himself as the only prophet to manifest in history the revelation of the essence of Being. A strange notion since Heidegger is not concerned with the \\"essence\\" of Being but with the meaning of it. Further, as far as I know, he never claimed to be the only human to reveal anything about Being, let alone its essence, especially when Heidegger shows such deference to Greek thought. Finally, the difference between history and historiography escapes Sacchi entirely, for he believes that Heidegger's Sein will reveal its essence in a specific event in human history.For anyone worried that Heidegger is a Catholic thinker trying to introduce God in the guise of Being, Sacchi sets the record straight, in his mind, and claims that Heidegger removes God and introduces Sein instead! Moreover, he labels Heidegger as a Lutheran, atheist, agnostic, neo-pagan, barbarian, idealist, immanentalist, transcendentalist, poet, nominalist, gnostic, non-philosopher influenced by madmen like Nietzsche and Hoelderlin and who succumbed to his own affects.Frankly, it behooves those like Sacchi who think that god belongs in metaphysics to make a case for it and explain what is gained by such a move. His answer is to repeat Aquinas that the uncaused cause is what \\"everyone calls God\\" , which clearly is not the case. Either that move brings a host of problems that are unresolvable by metaphysics and have lead to what Heidegger described as the history of philosophy, or it turns metaphysics into theology and answers all questions and thus constitutes the end of philosophy, for all loving search for wisdom has concluded.It also noteworthy that the back cover of this book promises that Sacchi will address the issue of Nationalsocialism. Fortunatly for the reader and unfortunately for the reputation of the publisher, this topic doesn't arise at all."},{"Title":"Love is...a Wild Ride!","review":"This is a cute paperback version of the hardcover cartoon collection that is also sold on Amazon.

Cranborne (the future Lord Salisbury) and Lyttelton were members of the aristocracy. Macmillan and Crookshank were from newer wealth, known then as \\"new men\\". The four entered Eton together in 1906. They all joined the Grenadier Guards in 1914 and saw service during the First World War. Conservatives all, they each entered politics in the 1920s. They all held positions in the British cabinet under Winston Churchill during the Second World War. One of the group, Harold Macmillan served as Prime Minister from 1957 until his resignation in 1963. Although Macmillan may be the only one of the group familiar to American readers they each were very well know figures in Britain during their time.The Guardsmen's story really begins not on Eton's playing fields but on the killing fields of World War I France. Lyttleton, Macmillan and Crookshank fought with valor and distinction. On the same day, September 15, 1916, fighting with a mile of each other in the trenches, Macmillan and Crookshank were horribly wounded and Lyttleton was awarded a DSO (a medal for valiant service) for his heroic acts. Macmillan and Crookshank's injuries were catastrophic. Macmillan right arm and left leg never worked properly again. Crookshank was castrated by shrapnel. Cranborne served only briefly at the front.Following the War the Guardsmen made their way into Parliament. Ball's exploration of the parallel lives of the Guardsman enables the reader to get a bird's eye view of British political life from the 1920s through the 1960s. Ball's treatment of the saga of these men is intriguing in many respects. Ball's examination of the parliamentary experiences of these four men in the 1930s, for example, provides a unique perspective on British political life in the years leading up to the Second World War. It is easy to forget that during the premiership of Neville Chamberlain that it was not Winston Churchill who stood out as a threat to Chamberlain's appeasement policies but Anthony Eden. Churchill was thought of by all as a has been. The Guardsmen were considered \\"Edenites. Eden, for all his intelligence, comes across as a timid and vacillating political rival notoriously incapable of making tough political decisions. Referred to by his foes and friends as Hamlet he reminded me more of Leon Trotsky in that both managed to fall ill or absent themselves from the center of action at critical moments in time and were made to look like political amateurs by men who, though perhaps less talented, had no compunction about grasping for power.The Guardsmen, all on the anti-appeasement side of the aisle, found roles in Winston Churchill's war-time cabinet and the book takes us through their (second) war years. The Conservative Party's return to power in 1951 saw the Guardsmen reach the peak of their achievements. The story here centers around Macmillan, who served as Minister of Housing under Churchill and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Eden until becoming Prime Minister in 1957 after Eden's Suez Canal fiasco. Macmillan fought his fellow Conservatives and insisted on an economic policy that promoted employment rather than monetarist policies likely to create higher unemployment rates. Macmillan's tenure was also marked by the commencement of independence for former British colonies in Africa. He angered white settlers in Rhodesia and South Africa and their English allies (including a profoundly bitter Cranborne) by noting with no small degree of accuracy that \\" The Africans are not the problem in Africa, it is the Europeans who are the problem.\\" This was followed in short order by his famous \\"Winds of Change\\" speech in which he noted that: \\"The wind of change is blowing through this continent. Whether we like it or not, this growth of national consciousness is a political fact.\\"As he notes in his conclusion, by the end of their lives the notion of public service (at least by the upper classes) was quaint at best and worthy of scorn at worst. These men are thought of, to the extent they are thought of at all, as antiques from an age long gone by. However, even while showing us their many flaws, Ball makes it clear that there was a certain sense of honor and integrity about these men. (This is particularly true of Macmillan.) It was once said sarcastically of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that she was not noblesse and was disinclined to oblige. Ball takes us back to a time and place where the concept of noblesse oblige still had some residual meaning.In the hands of a lesser writer \\"The Guardsman\\" might have come across as merely a wistful yearning for \\"the good old days\\" of Conservative Party aristocratic rule. Instead, \\"The Guardsmen\\" paints a literate and informative portrait of the lives of these men and the impact the searing experiences of the First World War had on their public lives.\\"The Guardsmen\\" left this reader wondering why and when we stopped expecting our leaders to possess core values of honor and integrity and as such it has value far greater than a mere look back in time."},{"Title":"Today's Handbook for Solving Bible Difficulties","review":"Authors (and preachers) are often accused of answering questions nobody's asking.

The commoners, having seen their worst fears being realized, become more resolute, thus calling down even harsher measures. Thus is born a vicious spiral.Add to this mix, the covert movements of several 'Secret' societies, such as the Beltaine Blade, Shadow Court, Monkey's Paw, etc, and you begin to see the chaos that WiC strives to span. Included are the current, up-to-date status of many of the Kingdoms and people of note, strategies (some fairly ruthless)...that a Fae may employ in War, and the prevailing attitudes one may meet.The things that detracted from the book, to me, as always; Contradictions, and ruined mood.In one case, 'war letters' between a pair of lovers, a commoner sluagh and Noble sidhe (Whahuh?) ...fell somewhat flat by stretching credulity in just that mix alone. In others, strategies involving destroying Freeholds and using Cold Iron seemed to me almost as if the authors were trying to outdo themselves in 'How bad can we make it seem'? Add to this, that printing delays left the timeline of events as presented a year out of whack, the last recorded event occuring in late 2000.To their credit, they left the book metaplot progression somewhat open, for ST's to add flavour and details, but being one who likes to know exactly what to do next, and where things are going, it can be a bit frustrating, to be left with such uncertainty.And while I may long for a return to the Changeling of yore, when battles fought were against frailties of the human spirit, it seems a decent, if not 'necessary for play', book by Arthaus for the Changeling line, and a heroic attempt to stir interest in the game once more."},{"Title":"War in Concordia (Changeling: The Dreaming)","review":"Another inferior product for changeling from white wolf, this one is supposed to be a guide to the &quot;war of concordia&quot; but all it contains are the reactions of the kith and assorted houses, a few new art's,weapons,and treasures. It never really states how changelings make war in the 20th century. Things like tactics, what happen's when ordinary people happen across the rather large battle's are all glossed over if they are mentioned at all. One thing I have held that was unbeleiveable about the world of darkness is how people could remain ignorant about the vampires, changelings, wraiths, werefish ,ect around them when there are constantly large to small scale conflicts going on all around them. This book has no information on that or on the war in concordia in any meaningful way so I can't recomend it."},{"Title":"The Play's the Thing: Teachers' Roles in Children's Play (Early Childhood Education Series (Teachers College Pr)) (Early Childhood Education (Teacher's College Pr))","review":"This Jones and Reynolds book has become a classic in early childhood circles.

It helped me distinguish between what is my responsiblity and what is not. It helped me stop trying to be Super Stepmom."},{"Title":"The Stepmom's Guide to Simplifying Your LIfe","review":"Typically I am spurred to write a review after just finishing a book, all flush with excitement and eagerness. This review is being written a few years after reading the book for the first time. I was recommending it to a friend and found myself wanting to know what other people thought of it.Here's what I thought: it's excellent. No, as the 2-star reviewer pointed out, it doesn't contain checklists and specifics for the nitty-grittys of blended family life. It does something much more important--it addresses the frame of mind from which one approaches stepparenting. When the frame of mind is right, then you don't need a checklist. You'll be operating from a healthy (not needy, or pressured, or critical) place and you'll do things in such a way that will build, rather than break, your blended family.My copy is underlined (in different colors from different times when I was reading it) and dog-eared. The book caught me on page 3, where Goodman writes, \\"...my focus is on the stepmom because she often is the spouse who is caught in the middle of nearly everything that happens in her family. She is hearth and home, yet she keeps time to another mom's schedule. She is nurse and nurturer, yet she is neither first nor favorite. However devoted she may be to her stepchildren, her embrace of them is interrupted by another mom's grasp.\\"That paragraph shows both the wisdom and the flaw in Goodman's thinking. The flaw is that she assumes the stepmom has already had a child or more before becoming a stepmom, and for me that wasn't the case. I found the assumption a little annoying, but not enough to cause me not to pay attention to what she has to say. [My situation: I purchased the book when my partner and I had been together for 2 years; his daughter was 12 at the time and turning into someone very strange to me. She's 15 now and I think we were on track to be in pretty good shape by the time she is 18 (Goodman says to expect 8 years for a blended family to blend). However, her father/my partner died a month ago and that seems to be accelerating the progress.]Aside from Goodman's thoughts, the book also includes quotes from other stepmoms. My favorite is from Kathi O, and I like to read it before a family gathering that will include his ex:\\"Realize that your presence is painful to the ex-wife beyond anything you can imagine. You have taken her place. That hurts. Her children will talk about you when they go home to her. That hurts. Her children may be affectionate with you in front of her. That hurts. Her children may prefer to sit on your lap instead of hers at a function you both attend. That really hurts. As annoying and bitchy as she may be, remember that almost everything that you do with her kids is a threat to her and hurts her. Some moms are more mature than others, but all are hurt by the presence of the stepmom at some point. You must be compassionate.\\"If you're looking for \\"How to be a Stepmom for Dummies,\\" then don't buy this book. If you're looking for a thoughtful approach to the mantle of stepmotherhood, then do."},{"Title":"The Stepmom's Guide to Simplifying Your LIfe","review":"First I want to start by saying that the book is probably geared better for a woman who already has at least one biological child of her own, coming into a relationship where her partner's biological child/children are being added to the picture. Also that in the relationship, the step children or the step-parenting experience is from the custodial perspective.I would also like to add that while my review isn't a sparkling one, this book would seem to work for someone who is brand new to a relationship where the partner has kids and you want to know about things to consider before the relationship gets serious. If you are that person this book will only scratch the surface of what you are getting into, and in no way is any of this even the half of it, no matter how non-confrontational the dynamic of you/husband/stepkids/biological mother may be.For myself, as someone who is already in a serious relationship trying to smooth out a lot of wrinkles with this situation, the book didn't fit what I was looking for. And really the book didn't provide any new information to me that I hadn't already considered.Onward with the review:The book's contents were motivational and coming from the perspetive to think positively, but the concepts and ideas were very cliche. I wasn't expecting anything profound since the reviews here on this book were mixed. There wasn't much that really jumped out at me as far as what to do differently to make improvements.Many of the topics I would have liked to see were missed. Making life simpler for handling BM issues, visitation/non custodial things, are critical points that were not included in this book, and many stepmothers could use support with this.Much of the content is a no-brainer for any adult, let alone adults dealing with stepparenting issues.I was nearly offended at the suggestions of how handle discipline with children. The concepts that were presented were so incredibly simple, anyone WITHOUT kids would know to do these things. --Well at least I would hope! So the advice about how to handle particular situations in regards to discipline was of no service.-Respect is paramount between all adults and children.-Both parents can expect obedience from every child regardless of biology.Each of these and many more concepts are summarized in a short paragraph (three sentences?) about what those things mean. They weren't presented as reminders or refreshers, in my opinion, but with the heir of assumption that most people don't already know these things or don't already have these ideas in place.There are a few questions listed in the book to ask yourself to get grounded on and gain some clarity from;-List the 5 biggest complications in my life.-List 3 expectations for my step family.Listing these things out is helpful, so I give the author credit for writing from a solution oriented-standpoint and wanting to help stepmothers keep their chins up.But really, unless you're just really at a low point and could use some motivation, just save your money and write out a list of your griefs and ways to be solution oriented about them.

He goes on several adventures which result in a comical, exiting atmosphere for the book to take place in. I didn't particularly like this book for a couple of reasons. First off, none of the jokes are funny. This might be because it was writtern in the 19th century. The author (Mark Twain) was probably cracking jokes from the time it was written. Some times the jokes dept on repeating themselves. Morgan kept on using slang from the 19th century; of coarse none of the medieval characters were understood him. The book also got really boring, really fast. There was really no action in it. It seemed like the author was trying to make it funny, but couldn't.

There were a lot of things that happened suddenly and were not sufficently explained-like when Hank got married. Overall there were to many details where they didn't need them and not enough details where they did need them. The book was also very unrealistic. If Hank knew all that he did in the book, he would have probably rivaled Einstien's IQ.

The main characters were Merlin, King Arthur, Clarence and the main character Hank Morgan. I did not like this book. I think the book is very boring because it is hard to understand the complicated text. The way that the text was complicated was Mark Twain was writing how Middle Ages citizens would talk and one of his sentences went like this, &quot;Graddually as the time wore down one annoying fact still borne upon my understanding&quot;.

I found this book very boring because it didn't have much action to keep my attention. The reason why it was so boring is because the guy just sits around all day feeling proud of his high status. The story also doesn't have many characters, which would have made it more interesting. The book was also hard to understand.

For example, he blows up a tower by connecting gun powder to a lightning rod during a storm. Amazing....I think not. I thought this book was boring because there are to many unnecessary details. Who cares what each prison cell looks like? One whole chapter was on the prices of food and how they vary from town to town. Another reason I disliked this book is because it was hard to follow. All the different knights names are so hard to remember and its so slow paced that if you put the book down you can't remember what was going on and you're not interested enough to care.

His writing, always funny and warm, tells us first of the history and stories of his beloved river, and then of his experiences learning the steamboat trade. I found his description of being a steamboat student very similar to being a medical student: two-hundred years later and in completely different trades, route memorization and gradual responsibility for people's lives still have much in common. This book made me want to travel the Mississippi, not as it stands today but as it appeared to Twain in his youth. I feel the same way about Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his Magdalena river. I think it is amazing how these inspired authors can make me love a river I have never seen."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Few books exist that speak thru the ages by examining themes and situations that confront people of all time. This is one of those books. Unlike Twain's other classics, the focus of this piece is not America, or topics from American history (i.e. slavery), but more general themes such as industrialization, freedom, religion and religious dogma, government control, the meaning of progress, and individual aspirations versus peer pressure.In short, this book focuses on the adventures of Hank Morgan, a Connecticut Yankee who falls asleep one day, and wakes up in England during the reign of King Arthur. This world of knights, damsels, poor hygiene, and overbearing Christian dogma seems ripe for change for our protaganist. Hank proceeds to introduce \\"progress\\" to this new (old) world in the form of practices, knowledge, and inventions he is familiar with from his time; post Civil War USA. He does this in the name of bettering the lives of those around him, both physically, and emotionally. The result is utter chaos, the destruction of the existing social order, and lessons in colonialism, nation-building, and culture shock that all missionaries, soldiers, politicians and businessmen should heed.Along the way, the book brought both tears and laughter to this reader. One of Twain's strengths is his ability to bring emotion to commonday events by portraying them from various viewpoints. This trait is on display here in its most tragi-comedic form. Overall, a great book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"There is no denying that Mark Twain is one of the best American authors. His wit and caustic style is just one of a kind, and his novels, with the in depth plot and yet witty and sardonic characters and the episodes that are at times comic and serious, is what defines that man and author that you either love or hate. In \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" it may leave some ambiguous. First of all, the idea is clever: making a man from the 19th century go into another time and era in 6th century Britain so he can critique, satarize, and change the lifestyle of it, therefore creating a \\"frame\\" that helps us to view how synonymous the time era back then somewhat reflects the 19th century. However, the main problem is that it's not consistent. Diving in the first few chapters is just fine, but then the story goes along a bit too slow and becomes too difficult to digest. In other words, it doesn't get to the point, and quite frankly it gets kind of dull. At times i would read one chapter and stop, feeling as if i read over 100 pages in half an hour, exhausted. I can understand why many would enjoy this novel, but it personally didnt do anything for me. If there was more action, movement, and a more firm plot (at times i didn't really understand what stance Mark Twain was trying to make, he seemed to try to make a satire on the society of the 6th century in England but it becomes ambiguous and lost throughout the story), perhaps i would give this book at least 3 stars. Apparently Mark Twain wasn't at his best when he wrote this book. Sure, the wit and humor is still there, but the excitement that drove the reader to keep on reading just isn't there. Not highly recommended, but if you are interested in it, go for it. Regardless, it's still a good story, just didn't work for me."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Mark Twain is indisputably the greatest writer in history, and his wisecracking sense of humor reached its pinnacle in Connecticut Yankee. Far more than a simple time travel book, this book will keep you thinking. One minute the hero is trying to end knighthood once and for all by taping ads to suits of armor and the next minute he is trying to explain supply and demand to an ignorant farmer. The best part of this book is Hank Morgan's journey through the countryside with King Arthur. Though Twain uses his typical sarcastiic tone throughout the novel, it has a very serious, satyrical meaning. I would also like to show that some of us under the age of 18 can still appreciate great literature. Mark Twain was truly a genius, and being a fellow journalist, he is one of my heroes. It is truly a tragedy that other kids cannot recognize the significance of Twain and his works. The only book of his people seem to want to give credit to is Huck Finn because it dealt with racism. Nowadays people think a book can't have a serious meaning unless it involves the persecution of blacks, but Connecticut Yankee is simply a whole lot better than Huck Finn. Every American, every lover of literature should read this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"In Life on the Mississippi the steamboat is depicted as the workhorse of Midwest expansion. Prior to the advent of the railroad efficient inland transportation was confined to waterways and the Mississippi river basin , with \\"about 1,250,000 square miles,\\" was the \\"Body of the Nation.\\" (Twain, preface) Mark Twain fulfills his boyhood dream of becoming a river boat pilot and, returning some twenty-one years later, writes of his youthful experiences and later observationsThe steamboat was a technological phenomena. The vehicle that evolved to meet the unique demands of this particular environment was a special design of river boat. In his own inimical style Mark Twain captures both the excitement of the riverboat's arrival and describes its essential components:\\"She is long and sharp and trim and pretty; she has two tall, fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded device of some kind swung between them; a fanciful pilothouse, all glass and \\"gingerbread,\\" perched on top of the \\"texas\\" deck behind them; the paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the boat's name; the boiler deck; the hurricane deck, and the texas deck are fenced and ornamented with clean white railings; there is a flag gallantly flying from the jack-staff; the furnace doors are open and the fires glaring bravely; the upper decks are black with passengers; the captain stands by the big bell calm, imposing, the envy of all; great volumes of the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the chimneys...the crew are grouped on the forecastle; the broad stage is run far out over the port bow, and an envied deck hand stands picturesquely on the end of it with a coil of rope in his hand; the pent steam is screaming through the gauge cocks; the captain lifts his hand, a bell rings, the wheels stop; then turn, back, churning the water to foam, and the steamer is at rest.\\" (27)Within a period of ten minutes the boat has been offloaded, loaded and departed. It is an efficiency of system and design ideally suited to its unique purposes, but as the Civil War looms its days are numbered. By then the steamboat had already evolved to it most advanced state and the steam locomotive has become the dominant form of transportationAs a literary piece by a \\"brilliant travel writer and incomparable humorist\\" (Kaplan, in Twain, xvii) Life on the Mississippi earned its accolades, but, as a window into a period of time, one can extract an eyewitnesses truth. In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain describes the latter period of the steamboat's heyday dramatically cut short. Wartime technology did not improve the riverboat other than to convert it into an instrument of war. What doomed the steamboat to oblivion was the advent of the steam locomotive and the railroads. The steamboat well served the purposes of river life in its time but was eclipsed by the railroad.That the steamboat was functional is indisputable, but if form determines function, it was a perfect adaptation of a water craft in conformity with purpose and contemporary technology. Combined with light weight and flexible wood construction the steamboat evolved into a shallow draft, wide beamed, low freeboard hull propelled by stern or side paddle wheels. The overall size of a steamboat was a compromise between maneuverability and economy. Power plant, fuel, cargo and passengers were accommodated within a superstructure rising above the hull. Bulk items, machinery, deck hands and low fare passengers were located on the main deck; superior public and private accommodations at higher fares were on the upper decks. Here travelers could enjoy incomparable luxury.High on top of all was the pilothouse. River pilots, by necessity of their position earned through their experience and knowledge of the river, had the best view. By status, they were the pinnacle of river hierarchy. Mark Twain, on his 1882 return to the river, quaintly asks of a fellow passenger he suspects of being a river pilot: \\"Have you ever traveled with a panorama.\\" The passenger responds, \\"I have formerly served in that capacity. [Twain's] suspicion was confirmed.\\" (315) Only higher than the pilothouse were the tall stacks made so for the purpose of disgorging noxious black smoke and dangerous smoldering ash to the wind.All components contributed to functionality, but perhaps the \\"stage\\" or ramp which bridged the gap between the boat and shore, contributed most to its versatility. It enabled the boat to be hailed from landings along the shore without the aid of a dock. As an apprentice, Mark Twain is left alone on the bridge for the first time by his mentor. His initial proud serenity is broken by a sudden awareness that the boat is heading for imminent impact with a \\"bluff reef.\\" His panicked reaction throws the ship into reverse, but he is saved by the return of the pilot who calmly restores order and chastises him. \\"When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap the big bell three times before you land, so the engineers can get ready.\\" (53) The \\"bluff reef\\" was actually a wind reef (from the effect of wind on the surface) and they sailed uneventfully through it.The romance of the steamboat era is tarnished by frequent tragedy. Mark Twain loses his brother Henry, a cabin boy on the Pennsylvania, who died when the ship's boilers explode in June 1858. The hazards of operating year round and during night and day, plus the varying river conditions contributed to mistakes of judgment and probably just bad luck too! The pilot may have been king, but he was still human and suffered from the human faults of vain glory, unrealistic confidence, ego, and infallibility.When he returns to the river in 1882 after an absence of twenty-one years, Mark Twain notes the changes that have occurred on the river. There are very few ships left in operation. Passenger travel is limited in frequency and destinations. The romance he once knew is gone, but a new one is beginning, the romance of the rails.Today we know that the railroad too would have its heyday and, in time, its romance would also wane. But has the romance of the steamboat and rail eras disappeared? Today you can take cruises on Mississippi riverboats and luxury train trips across the continent. The difference now is that trips are for novelty and not necessity. The romance only comes from the remembrance of a time past and not the needs of the present."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I know this book was boring and humorless to a lot of students and I can understand why. Things like the telegraph mean nothing to us now, but in Mark Twain's time it was hot technology like a rocket or the Internet are to us today.Mark Twain was saying, what if we took our modern technology back to a time when people believed in magic and faught with swords and armor. Whoever did this could probably convince these people that the technology was a superior magic and could use this knowledge to dominate them.This is what happens in the story, but only for awhile. Eventually, even the people in King Arthur's court adjust to having the new technology and no longer see it as magic. For example, the people running the telephone exchange don't care about the Connecticut Yankee's &quot;magic&quot; they just want to keep the lines of communication open with Camelot.This kind of story is called &quot;satire&quot;. It is basically a story that teaches us something by making fun of something else. In this story, Mark Twain makes fun of the kind of people who think they can accomplish anything with technology. The Yankee thinks that he can use technology to trick the nights of King Arthur's court and to manipulate them. At first he succeeds, but gradually they become so immersed in the technology that they don't care about magic and legends any more. Once their mental landscape changes, the Yankee has lost the context he needed to control them. The main argument here is that technology does not solve everything, it just produces new problems. And the kind of people who worship technology are bound to fail in one way or another.Hope this helps."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This is Twaine at his best. The book provokes thought, draws sympathy, and is downright hilarious. It also reads smoothly and at a brisk pace. It's a quick, fun read. I should also emphasize that while this is frequently labelled as children's literature, I find that label to be completely misleading. While it can no doubt be enjoyed by children at their level, there are a number of subtleties, particularly in the humor, that will be beyond the comprehension of most 13 year olds.The most pervasive feature of theme of the book is the ignorance of people in the sixth century. The Yankee is constantly dazzling both king and commoner with all manner of \\"miracles\\" (really just works of engineering or culture that he has as a result of his 19th century education). The people are the most easily duped idiots imaginable, and hold the most base conceptions and prejudices, and have no conception of justice. Twain believes these shortcomings are a product of their environment and education, rather than inherrent deficiencies (\\"training, all is training\\"). He also tackles slavery (an institution out of practice by the time of this book's writing), draws sympathy for slaves, and advocates the equality of all humanity. All pretty simple stuff. At a slightly deeper level, he tackles economic policy, namely protectionism vs. free trade, a debate that raged into his day and even into our own. He ridicules the views of the protectionists and their inability to understand the meaning of real vs. nominal wages, clearly a slap at certain arguments of his own day.Though the social commentary is interesting, if elementary, the satire is by far the best part of this book. Twain takes so many shots at so many targets that it's difficult even for the careful reader to notice them all. By far the funniest character is Alisande, a charicature of Arthurian women, who the yankee pejoritively nicknames \\"Sandy.\\" When she rambles on for hours to no apparent purpose \\"running her mill,\\" by whihc Twain pokes fun both of women in general and of their style of speech in Arthurian literature. A very funny scene is when Sandy relates a story from Thomas Mallory ver batim, with the Yankee constantly interjecting with suggestions to improve Mallory's arid writing style. \\"The Irish guy sounds like all the others, Sandy. You ought to give him a brogue, or at least have him say something like 'be jabbers' so that you'd know it's him speaking,\\" which of course is a suggestion Sandy takes.Another great piece of satire is Twain's commentary on the yankee himself. When he defeats opposing knights, he makes them sell all sorts of trinkets and products, from top hats to soap to stoves, as his way of spreading civilization. Of course these goods don't make a nation civilized, but that the yankee thinks they do is Twain's pejorative commentary as a westerner on eastern materialism. Twain's way of telling it is very funny stuff. There's much more excellent humor that can't be mentioned for the sake of space.The ending is another excellent commentary. The yankee's beautifully crafted civilization crashes down because of the irrascible prejudices of the people, which the church uses to its advantage. Twain's negative view of imperialism is here reflected, in how he depicts the folly of elevating a society by outside influences. A civilization must grow at its own pace, developing its views and values through a long process of trials. Attempts to import institutions from without are bound for failure. Though relevant in Twain's day, this is equally applicable in ours.So, if you want the whole package: a quick, easy read that also provides thought-proviking commentary and great humor, I'd recommend reading this. It would be hard to find a better book that has everything this one does."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Although I usually enjoy Twain's writing style, and his sense of wry humor, there was something about A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court that was less than satisfying.Some of the situations that the protagonist gets himself into are \\"classic\\" Twain. When the narrator is transported back to the time of Camelot, he begins to speculate about rituals, customs and general style of life. There is one part where the townspeople are convinced that he can perform great magical feats (he actually has Merlin as his rival), and when they corner him about performing one, he has to think of a way to please them or face punishment. He realizes that he can remember when an eclipse is going to come, and there is the way out of his situation. There are many adventures, where the narrator becomes critical of their ways, as a time warp will do. He is a fish out of water in many ways in this new world, not understanding, for instance, their need to have extravagant adventures: \\"Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving; and generally loaded with some tale about some princess or other wanting help to get her out of some faraway castle where she was being held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel...\\" Because of his ability to perform great acts, he becomes known as the Boss, and helps to free some poor peasants from terrible punishments.Maybe what made this less of a story was that it became too \\"preachy\\" and filled with social commentary. Although this is what usually makes Twain's novels, here it seemed to detract from the over all story. I was much more interested in hearing about the next adventure, but the narrator continued to rattle on and on about what he felt was wrong with this society. You get the feeling that Twain, not the narrator, is speaking after awhile. In the end, I guess it wasn't really the book I expected it to be. Still, it has its moments, and there are some parts that will have you chuckling to yourself as you read.I consider Twain to be one of my favorite authors, but this is one of his lesser achievements."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The title also happens to be the plot outline. Elements of the plot have been duplicated in countless books, TV shows and movies. Army of Darkness and MacGyver leap immediately to mind. The book is a fantasy, and if haters can set aside its numerous anachronisms (A man from 1900, for example, would never be able to understand the language of 6th century England), it's quite enjoyable.The novel is considerably more adversarial than one might expect. The main character is uncouth, obnoxious, and a jerk, even more so than is necessary given the immensely frustrating ignorance of the 6th century people. I suspect Twain plugged himself in to the Boss character, and had a good old time writing this one.The main character is out to get the established Church, not in a no-holds-barred, Philip Pullman way, but in a logical way that recognizes the value of faith while tearing down the humanistic and suppressive political and economic machinations of the Church.Twain also takes shots at England through the ages, at its historically oppressive caste system and at the English people's long-running love of hereditary nobility.Commentary on politics and on human nature abound, but A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is still a great adventure story. These two elements step on each other's toes sometimes, but Twain pulls it off.Clunky title.

All the original illustrations are here, with the text wrapped around them marvelously. A true pleasure to read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"**This review may contain spoilers.\\"Cursory reading of Twain's quasi-satirical \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" suggests that the author was simply interested in lampooning the blue whale-sized targets of Arthurian characters, chivalry, knightly ideals, tyranny, religious hypocrisy, ancestral elitism, and ignorant superstition. The novel does, but I believe Twain's satiric scope was much broader. \\"Connecticut Yankee\\"'s target is humanity and the human condition itself, with Hank Morgan as its ironic prism.Superficial readers of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" are wont to cheer for the protagonist Hank as a droll, unflappable champion of progressive economic, social, and cultural freedom. On the surface, he is. But Hank is subtly more sinister than that. All his improvements and ameliorative actions throughout the book only seem to benefit the British populace. Instead, everything he does is ultimately self-aggrandizing and self-serving, not to mention manipulative. He constantly and contemptously plays upon the British population's (from serf to King Arthur) fearful ignorance and superstition to achieve his paradoxical goal of conquest. His purported dream of converting Britain into a republic is undercut by his \\"hankering\\" to be its first president. Hank's subtle imperialism shows through the seams. Even Hank's name is ironic. His last name, Morgan, reminds you of King Arthur's malicious sorcerous half-sister Morgan Le Fay, who also had designs on Arthur's kingdom.Hank manages to lay a veneer of 19th century \\"civilization\\" upon 6th century England, but as the Catholic Church's interdict towards the end of the novel proves, that veneer is transient. I believe the prominent theme of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is that human betterment must be inherent and developed from within by honest and genuine moral means, not imposed adventitiously from the outside. Furthermore, younger, pliant minds not marinated in superstition are more likely to retain these lessons better than their mentally intransigent elders. That's why the former page Clarence and fifty or so young men remained loyal to Hank even after the rest of Britain plunged back into the Dark Ages after the interdict.However, Hank manipulates even these followers in a desperate attempt to preserve a vestige of his republic. Like a modern fortress, Hank and his followers protect themselves with moats, electric fences, and Gatling guns and exterminate all the opposing English forces. However, it is a Pyrrhic victory because the mound of putrefying knightly corpses threaten to asphyxiate them. Merlin, who is portrayed as a buffoonish charlatan throughout the novel, suddenly displays his true powers and puts Hank in a deep sleep in a cave, to awaken 1300 years later. Hank does wake up, but, perhaps remorseful over his deeds, pines away for the noble, romanticized England he dismissed at the beginning of the novel.Successful satires about the human condition have two primary characteristics: 1) Humans and humanity have many flaws, sins, and vices and 2) Humans and humanity very seldom correct those flaws, sins, and vices. By these standards, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is a largely successful satire. Ultimately, there is no one really worthy of admiration, not the conniving Merlin, not the noble but dunderheaded King Arthur, not even young Clarence (though he comes reasonably close), and not the devious Hank. Perhaps \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" was the harbinger of Twain's increasingly dark and cynical attitude towards humanity in general."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I bought the book for a trip I was taking down the Mississippi River during the summer of 2010.

What surprised me the most was that it was in the junior fiction section of my local library, and the more I read, the more surprised I was. I was an advanced reader when I was young, but I would have been hard pressed to understand or get much out of this book anytime before high school. That said, I was fairly riveted throughout the novel. Hank Morgan's character was amusing, resourceful, and altogether human. After reading so much about the \\"perfection\\" of Arthurian and Round Table society, it's nice to hear about what life would have been like even if King Arthur and his Round Table did exist. The ending was distinctly bittersweet, and I can honestly say that this has become one of my favorite classics."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I've seen all of the one-star reviews of this book and they all seemed to be done by fourteen year olds with no imagination, and no understanding that bad grammar is to be left at AIM.

If you like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it makes the book doubly interesting, because you can see how a person from the 1800's parodied medieval times versus a person from the 1960's. The only reason I gave this book four stars is because sometimes Twain did go on a little too long with the details.I really think you should read this book if you haven't had your mind melted by video games and graphic novels.

In particular, my first thought upon opening the book was as noted above. I fancied myself the sovereign of knowledge, a throne which holds much promise and much responsibility as Twain demonstrates throughout the book. This mental exercise led me to the same conclusion and results as Hank.I perhaps disdain the collusion and alliance of the church and monarchs as much as Twain who is particularly acrimonious of these institutions. I therefore identified with Hank readily and enjoyed reading as he organized and recruited among the populace those who would be most loyal to his cause. Gradually with education, toil, leadership and a bit of luck he finds himself at the helm of new political and economic system buttressed by a technological revolution.A lesson here perhaps for our \\"modern\\" leaders?A great bedtime story for your children as well as a disguised critique on monarchy and theocracy."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I've been reading a lot of classic literature recently, and I also recently saw the Mississippi River for the first time...so this book seemed liked the perfect one for me to read right now.This is a \\"non-fictional\\" book by Mark Twain.

Then he suddenly jumps forward many years in the book to when he is an older man. As an older man, he decides to go back and travel on the Mississippi River again. He finds the river much changed. The course of time (the Civil War has come and gone, the expansion of the railroad, and the forces of nature) have greatly changed life on the river. The once thriving steamboat trade has almost disapeared.Besides his personal recollections, he also includes other interesting stories,history,folklore, talltales, and such.

I went into to it expecting a humorous, light-hearted Mark Twain book. However, this was far from what I got. The story begins as a narration through the eyes of Hank Morgan, a 19th century factory manager. The plot starts when Hank is knocked out by an employee and wakes up in the 6th century. After dropping the idea that he is in a dream, he tries to make the best of the situation by improving the lives of the people. Using the knowledge he has of the future and his formal education, he wins the social rank known as &quot;The Boss&quot; and begins to educate a small group of people. His goal is to set up a republic and to destroy the overruling church officials. As time progresses, he sees the life of the people through their position (sees the life of a knight as a knight) and his desire to create an equal, yet effecient civilization increases. He tries to introduce the new ideas of his present time to them and the effect is something to read about. In the end, he learns that trying to change the atitude and customs of a large group of people is not as easy as he at first thought.

The story starts out talking about a young man named Hank Morgan, who was somehow transported back to the 6th century in England. He started out thinking that he arrived in an asylum, where everybody thought they were in the time of King Arthur. He later proved himself that he was in the 6th century by witnessing a total solar eclipse which he knew it was going to occur on the twenty-first of June A.D. 528 at 3 minutes after noon. After that event, he was given place in the government, and continuously used his cleverness and knowledge he learned in the 19th century to improve and prefect the country he was living in, during the 6th century. He used his knowledge in the field of science and performed what the people in the medieval times, called magic; and as time progressed he became the country&iexcl;s most powerful advisor. During this period of time, he kept a journal, which is what most of this book is.Unlike most of the other stories, the plot of this story was consisted of two time periods, the modern 19th century and the medieval 6th century. The main character, Hank Morgan, was mysteriously sent back and became someone like Jesus because he knew what was happening and what is going to happened already in the history lessons when he was still in the 19th century. A literary device Mark Twain used in this book that made this book very amusing was all the satires Hank used to mock the people in King Arthur&iexcl;s court. For example, when a page was introducing himself to Mark, Mark said, &iexcl;Go &iexcl;long, you ain&iexcl;t more than a paragraph.&iexcl;I recommend this book for people who want something light and less serious, because this book will give you a good laugh."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court gives the reader a feel for how someone must adapt to a new surrounding they are put into.

Jokes are being thrown, and people are having fun times. Thenn the mood of the book starts to get darker. The flaws of Camelot and the King start to come out. Twain does a great job using detail in the story, setting, and characters. He must have done some research while writing. The beginning of the book will hook you in to keep reading.

Using modern technology, he becomes more famous than evil Merlin the Magician. Hank, titled the Boss, meets humble friends like Clarence and Sandy who help him get accustomed to the Medieval Period. Hank travels around the English countryside with a down-to-earth man, King Arthur. I liked the story because it was interesting and unique. I found the story to be interesting because the 19th century meets the 6th century. Hank brings electricity, personal hygiene methods, and other modern conveniences with him to the Medieval community. It is interesting how the Middle Ages people get acquainted with these technological advances. The book also gives you insight and a new point-of-view on famous Medieval legends. King Arthur dresses up as a peasant, his sister Morgan Le Fay overturns hanging sentences, and Merlin becomes a deceiving, unfriendly magician, all as a result of Hank's magical powers and his influence on them. There are a few very intense and suspenseful events that make you wonder the fate of Medieval myths. The book has a complicated plot. There can be parts where there is little or no eventful action for a long time. However, when there is an action, it is intense and happens quickly. If you like fantasy and/or myths, you will definitely love A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. It is a mature, insightful book.

Many interesting points were brought up and even when Twain addressed serious issues of class and self and society, his humor shined thru. It is nineteenth century technological reliances meeting sixth century codes of chivalry. Of course it is all very anachronistic, but instead of hurting the work it helps Twain prove his points. I don't agree with those who consider it chaotic, although I do see that some may find it so since Twain attempts so much.

I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used to describe anything, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This novel by Mark Twain tells the story of a man who is swept back in time to the Dark Ages, the supposed period that Arthur and his round table existed. The story seems light hearted and fun throughout most of the text, but it was also written to make apparent the problems of medieval socity, specifically the form of government, which was feudalsim. Fuedalism's downfalls are thoroughly ecplored all throughout the novel by hank Morgan, the main character, as he thoughout the land trying to show the people of the time how wrong the way they live is. mark twain's writin style comes through very stronglyin thsi novel. Like many of his other books (Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn) CYKAC at first glance looks and reads like a children's story. but as further reading and closer study show this is not correct. Several times very graphic descriptions of death and fighting are used and many of the issues addressed by Twain take a knowledgeable mind to be comprehended. This style of writing is misleading at times, because of the way the author describes people and things in a light hearted an almost comical manner. He also labels characters throughout the story with odd names and titles. The light-hearted nature soon fades away when the author paints a picture of families being separated by slavery or the injustice of the Church to the people it is supposed to serve. Twain's writing style may be misleading, but it adds flavor and diversity to the text that is hard to find in other novels. The story That Twain writes is really a parody of the Arthurian legends we all know. Twain keeps the same names and positions of the characters, but completely changes their personalities from what we are used to. Many times when a character is into\\\\roduced it is shocking to think of them the way Twain wants us too. But what he really is doing is showing us realistically what King Arthur and his knights would be like if they had existed in medieval times. The author's perception of the characters real, more human selves was believable, but in contrast the exploits of hank Morgan were astronomicaly unbelievable. hank's adventures throughout the kingdom were entertaining, but were bogged down by the issues that the author wanted to bring across to the reader. more comic relief was needed to keep the reader from becoming depressed and to keep the story moving. Over all CYKAC was fun to read and well written, even though it could have done without some of the lectures and soul grabbing that the author throws at you. The ideas taht Hank comes up with are fascinating and totally unbelievalbe, but I still enjoyed them. The change in the characters personalities were a welcome change form the traditional &quot;knights in shining armor&quot; mold used in many other Arthur novels. It gave the story a new boost and helped separate it from the rest of the Arthurian legends.

The book is presented as a kind of diary of his experiences there.Hank is able to use his modern knowledge to perform feats which awe the locals and their king and is promoted to being the king's right hand man. Hank goes about making various improvements, with an eye toward eventual revolution to free the common people from the oppressive social system. He starts secret &quot;man factories&quot;, recruiting those real men (and women) who seem to have an inkling that they can and should break free of domination and live in freedom and independence.A main thrust of the story is to disabuse the reader of any romantic notions he may be harboring about this era of history. The author clearly portrays the barbarism, filth, injustice, senseless violence, backwardness and brutality of this time and these people, often mocking their ignorance and superstition in the light of our more enlightened ways.A particular gripe is the humble but ignorant reverence of the common folk for King, Church and nobility. He vents that the terrible violence of the French Revolution pales in comparison to the centuries of depredations imposed on the common people who, in his view, were fully justified in that bloodletting. He rails against the Catholic Church of the day as a chief enemy of the freedom of the common people, encouraging them to remain humble toward authority (however unjust) and comtemplate the higher, God-ordained reasons for their sufferings.Among my favorite of the host of bit-part characters to make an appearance in the book is Sir Ossaise of Surluse, &quot;a brave knight and of considerable celebrity&quot; resulting from significant skill in past knightly jousting tournaments. He is one of the many knights that Hank has put to work as traveling salesmen, wearing bulletin-boards front and aft advertising Hank's many innovative products, such as tooth-wash and soap. Hank explains that Sir Ossaise was &quot;of a light and laughing disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious,\\" which is why he has chosen him to advertise his stove polish (there are no stoves yet). When we meet him, Sir Ossaise has played a trick on another salesman (of toothbrushes) by sending the latter after a group of \\"likely customers.\\" After a long, hard chase, that energetic knight discovers the group consists of five poor souls released the night before from a long dungeon imprisonment, it having been &quot;all of 20 years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth.&quot;One touching scene happens when Hank and King Arthur disguise themselves as commoners and travel throughout the kingdom to assess what's really happening there. Along the way, they are captured for the purpose of being sold into slavery (since they cannot prove their status as freemen and the ancient Roman law holds that they are slaves until proven otherwise). Hank is able to play along, knowing he'll eventually work out a way to get free. The king, with his high-born pride, keeps his chin up and maintains an attitude of resistance and defiance, refusing to yield to the abusive slave trader. Hank observes that the king truly knows how to act like the free man he is, regardless of circumstances.While early in the book it seems we are headed in a promising direction toward a happy and virtuous end, Twain later turns the plot in darker directions. Hank stages a &quot;final battle&quot; between the forces of Chivalry (about 30,000 knights) and his own forces of republican progress (himself and 52 boys!). The Battle of the Sand Belt is an outright slaughter of the larger reactionary force. Unfortunately, the evil Merlin has the last laugh and puts Hank into a 13-century sleep, even as his co-conspirators are trapped in their cave fortress and being sickened by the 30,000 decaying corpses of the opposition (so much for a light-hearted and happy ending).In the last scene, Twain has finished reading the manuscript given to him by Hank back in the 19th century. It is toward morning at the lodge where they are both staying and Hank is sleeping fitfully and making noises in the next room. When Twain checks on him, Hank is muttering about his beloved 6th century life (including a wife and child), apparently relieved that his 19th-century experiences were &quot;just a dream.&quot; We, of course, are left assuming that Hank's 6th century experiences were the dream (but of course, there IS that written record ... hmmmm). Before he wakes up, Hank dies in his sleep, so we'll never know for sure.The author clearly holds the misguided assumption that religion is hostile to freedom (see The Theme is Freedom by M. Stanton Evans for a full treatment of this error). He sees morality, human nature and society as being malleable by human reason, rather than as following fixed norms created by God. This way of thinking sees a strong affinity between the (very different) American and French Revolutions and interprets both as a throwing off of the shackles of religion and tradition which are believed to encumber the pure, relativist, rationalist and optimistic vision of liberty. In summary, its a fun story, but suffers from incorrect assumptions about reality."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The name of the book I am critiquing is A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur&#65533;s Court by Mark Twain tells the story of a Connecticut man who is thrown back in time to the King Arthur time period.

This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people, who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize its faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time was very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods, which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it is a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way that puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur.BY: Christian J. Vazquez"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Mark Twain was one of the United States' greatest writers, but not one of its most brilliant novelists. A case in point is this 1889 novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court.\\"The plot has been redone so many times as to make a synopsis here seem pointless. The title character is a practical-minded factory superintendent from Hartford laid out by a crowbar-wielding worker and transported to the time of King Arthur. After conning the locals by anticipating an eclipse and pretending he has blotted out the sun, the Yankee sets to work reforming Arthur's kingdom in slow degrees, earning the wrath of the wizard Merlin among others.The novel's defenders point out that while written in the guise of a children's novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee\\" is a cleverly subversive satire that ridicules tradition and progress simultaneously. For seven-eighths of the book, however, it is neither a fair nor a scintillating fight. Our hero, Hank Morgan, is the book's narrator, and perhaps unreliable, but Twain offers no hint of this as Morgan and Twain mock the customs and puncture the myths of this bygone day, informing us whatever existed then couldn't hold a candle to the present day.\\"Somehow, every time the magic of folderol tried conclusions with the magic of science, the magic of folderol got left,\\" Morgan explains.As the book develops, Morgan builds up the society he finds with modern conveyances, including trains, guns, and telephones. At one point in the story, knights ride to battle on bicycles.Anachronism soon devolves as the main source of humor for the book, along with the narrator's off-handed way of telling us about the people he meets, none of whom impress him. One maiden proves such a windy bore it is a surprise to find Morgan later married to her, and quite a fond husband at that. There is one fellow named Clarence who becomes Morgan's chief acolyte, but he only shows up to help Morgan out of the various minor jams that form the narrative thrust of our story.Much of the time, Twain uses Morgan's experience as an excuse to launch into some invective, particularly involving institutions like slavery and the Roman Catholic Church. Critics talk about this as a slam against capitalism, too, but for the most part Twain presents capitalism as a fine and noble thing, ruined only by the blinkered idiocy of Arthur's subjects.Whatever point Twain had in setting this story in Camelot goes by the boards after 50 pages. He references Malory but demonstrates little interest or fondness for the subject. Arthur goes on one meandering journey with Morgan disguised as a serf, Twain borrowing from his own \\"Prince And The Pauper\\", but Arthur otherwise registers little in the story and his court even less. When Arthur's fate is sealed, it occurs off-stage and is presented in the manner of a second-hand report.I got the feeling that Twain had a good idea for a novel but no notion what to do with it. This happens with his novels, like \\"Pudd'nhead Wilson\\" and \\"The Gilded Age.\\" His best-known novel, \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" has a famously disjointed ending, though that wrapper is a regular prize compared to what he does here. It's one of the big \\"huh\\" moments in American literature, exceeded only by those critics who explain why it is so brilliant, because it satirizes the whole message of the rest of the novel or anticipates trench warfare or shows why suits of armor are a bad idea when worn in battle against an electrified fence. To me it's Twain clearly throwing up his arms and leaving his reader in a hole after being dragged around for over 300 pages.Twain knocks off some good one-liners, and does enough with the concept in the beginning that you wish his heart had stayed in the venture. It didn't, but fortunately for his legacy academia has been more than willing to make up for his lack of patience or effort."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up so now that I own a kindle I can reread and enjoy it all over again.

I'm glad it was available on Kindle for his last-minute reading."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Mark Twain's time-machine drops the main character in this book in the 6th century of King Arthur's Great-Britain.What he sees is a nation of slaves under the heel of king, Church and noble ('a privileged class is but a band of slaveholders'): 'sweat blood for them, starve that they might be fed, work that they might play, go naked that they might wear silk and jewels, pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them.'But the slaves were so poor-spirited that they took the thanks (cuffs and contempt) and the attention they got as an honor. They were completely under the spell of the Church: 'a united Church means death to human liberty, and paralysis to human thought ... in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms... she invented 'divine right of kings'; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice, non-resistance under opression and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies.'No wonder that the nobility, 'tyrannical, murderous, rapacious and morally rotten as they were, were deeply and enthusiastically religious.'In order to fight against the forces of darkness and to free mankind Hank Morgan creates teacher factories.But he is confronted with the problem of heridity and social conformism: 'There is no such thing as nature; it is merely heredity and training. All that is original in us can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest inherited from a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years.'His teacher schools liberate only a few dozens of pupils. With their help, he has to dynamite the whole British aristocracy in order to install his ideal of universal suffrage ('when every man in a State has a vote, brutal laws are impossible').This comical science fiction story is ultimately a very actual political diatribe against exploiting privilege, pure indoctrination and class (in)justice.A must read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"It is possible to understand what someone is doing, to sympathize with it, and yet not particularly enjoy it. The whole mode of this work, the fantasy, the bringing the Bridgeport foreman Hank Morgan back to medieval England and King Arthur's court as a way of discrediting inherited monarchy, the aristocratic institutions of the past means that the work is on a playing field and in a mode less 'real 'to me than that of 'Huckleberry Finn' 'Tom Sawyer' ' Life on the Mississippi'.Instead of the rich colloquial language of the American worlds Twain grew up in we have here a stilted formal language. True there is something of interest in seeing how the practical, technical, innovative 'modern Yankee' deals with the archaic reality he is presented with.But to my mind the book does not have the real Twain humor, and is more an excursion in 'ideas' than in real three- dimensional characters shaping their lives in the world."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Its theme is the superiority of reason, technology, and intelligence over mysticism, ignorance, and religion. The battle in the closing chapters is spectacular. Gatling guns against a horde."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Who has not wondered what they would do if sent back centuries earlier armed with the knowledge of modern life? Mark Twain is perhaps the first writer (at least the first that I know of) who makes a serious effort (with much comedy thrown in) to consider this question.The main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the then modern age of the late 19th century into the land of Camelot, with King Arthur and his knights. Although the story is well known for the comedic stories within the book, less known is the author's serious statements about human frailties such as prejudice (this book is an outspoken criticism of slavery at a time when the Just Cause myth of the American south was getting its start), superstition, autocracy, blind reliance on tradition, etc. His severity against the Catholic church stings me because that is my faith, but when considering the history of the church and some of the atrocities committed by some church leaders, his denigration is not without some justification.There is much here for philosophical debate. Twain takes an anti-determinist view of what man is capable of accomplishing, but he is fatalistic about the ability of one person to make a lasting change. I think that he missed the point. Hank Morgan failed not so much because of the forces of custom or the clergy, but because he tried force cultural enlightenment. This is like expecting wisdom from ten year olds simply because they have the lessons of their elders available to them. Cultural improvement is a developmental process and comes from self awareness. The character would have also been improved if he had learned more of his own cultural shortcomings from involvement with this different society. Regardless, this is a highly enjoyable book that shows why it, and the author remains of interest over a century later.I disagree with the Editorial Review written by the School Library Journal that this book is recommended for as early as fifth grade. I believe that the subject matter would be better considered and discussed with those in later grades."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court written by Mark Twain is a superb work of literature. This Arthurian novel is different from others because the view point is not from anybody from the round table or that time. The protagonist, Hank Morgan is a blacksmith from 19th century Hartford, Connecticut when he gets hit on the head by a crowbar. Following the incident he is knocked unconscious and transported back in time in a fanciful, diluted dream. There he is taken to Camelot and imprisoned. During his death trial he tricks the court into thinking that he is a magician when he conjures an eclipse. In A Connecticut Yankee Hank rallies against feudalism and idle aristocracy. This novel has become one of my favorites, but I'd only recommend for the 14 or 15+ crowd for Twain's sense of humor and for the confusing Old English."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"\\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is one of those rarest literary treasures: a comedy that, for all it's hilarity, actually has both a heart and a brain. Not just a set of cheap laughs, as most comedy of any sort is, Mark Twain's classic novel enlightens as it entertains, throwing an unflinching spotlight on the darker elements of human nature both in the Utopian (to our eyes) Camelot and of modern capitalism and the American Dream.The plot is a familiar one in our age of sci-fi and fantasy, though it was innovative when Twain conceived it: Hank Morgan, an enterprising 19th-century engineer, is knocked unconscious and comes to in King Arthur's fabled Camelot. Bewildered but determined to make the best of the situation, Morgan uses his knowledge of history and mechanical skills to convince everyone he is a super-magician greater than even Merlin. Once ensconced as the King's right-hand man, Morgan sets about reforming the country into a republic, a sort of prototype America. Most of the book follows Morgan through a series of haphazard adventures which Twain uses to illuminate the great but often forgotten evils of the Dark Ages, including the abuses of the Catholic Church, the ignorant and useless ruling body that inevitably arises from a monarchy, and the pitiful working conditions of the medieval peasant or slave.Nor is Twain's critical eye trained only on the far-flung past. Though Morgan is essentially a sympathetic figure, he struggles to find anything the least bit admirable about the knights and nobles he must live with, and considers the chivalric code merely fit for derision. Meanwhile, Morgan's own capitalist code is in full effect, and he takes advantage of every opportunity to cash in his advanced education for the big bucks.Colorful and sublimely written, Twain's time-travel masterpiece is both a magical fantasy and a stinging dystopian satire. Don't be fooled by the several movie versions of this story, some of which are great fun in their own right. Yes, the novel is funny, often riotously so, but the humorous skin hides a deadly earnestness beneath, and the finale is far less optimistic than one who has first seen the film versions will doubtless expect. A deservedly immortal literary gem."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The book gives a humorous description of what would happen if a modern man was transported to the court of King Arthur.

The edition I have is 575 pages, but I went through it in about three weeks. It is an excellent, entertaining, very funny and thought-provoking book. I enjoyed it very much. If I had read the Canterbury Tales or some other book relating to the Middle Ages, it may have been pretty boring, but this, my first Mark Twain book and the longest I've ever read, was first-rate entertainment."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"If you are unacquainted with Twain's work, this is the ideal starting point. So much of his life was spent by and on the River that it has saturated into many of his greatest works such as Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. His years training as a riverboat pilot (when the pilot was in charge, not the captain) and, years later, his visit to the same towns and cities provide a stunning portrait of how the River played a major role in shaping America. No one has the wit, charm and command of language of Twain."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"In this wonderful book, Mark Twain blends humor and suspense wonderfully. The main character, Hank Morgan, is knocked over the head with a crowbar and is somehow transported back to the sixth century during King Arthur's reign. Taking advantage of the superstitiousness of the people, he saves himself from death at the stake by predicting an eclipse. He earns a position secondary to the king and displays nineteenth century technology to the inhabitants. During his stay in Camelot, Hank learns that monarchy, the Established Church, and knight errantry must come to an end. To help create this wonderful work of literature, Twain gives the characters a definite personality to help describe them. The suspense certainly adds to the reader's interest. This is a book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I home school my daughter and was looking for some works by American authors.

A young man tells Morgan is he is in Camelot in the year 528. Not believing the boy, Morgan insists it is the year 1879 in Hartford, Connecticut. Morgan's adventures are written in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, by Mark Twain. Sir Kay throws Morgan in prison after he finds the Yankee and scares him up a tree. Sentenced to death the next day, Morgan performs a \\"miracle\\" before he is hung and King Arthur, believing him to be a wizard, set him free. Slowly, Morgan works his way up to \\"The Boss\\" of King Arthur's court and brings all of his 19th century knowledge to the people of Camelot, such as the telephone and electric lights.Although I would recommend this book to advanced readers, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is over 400 pages and it was difficult for me to get into the story at first. Also, the language was hard to understand. For example, \\"Fair sir, will ye just?\\" and \\"Prithee do not let me.\\" Despite the length and the language, I enjoyed the way Twain used characters and stories from the Arthur legends and formed them into the plot.

Some consider this work &quot;chaotic,&quot; but I don't agree. Yes, he does attempt a lot in this work- humor, the relation of an exciting tale, and questioning mankind and society, but the book still has a flow. It contrasts the nineteenth century dependence on technology and efficiency with a pseudo sixth century that uses a caste system and rigidly follows codes of chivalry. The ending was not particularly insightful, as one would expect, but it still satisfied me. The book had me chuckling much of the time- I mean, can you just picture Sir Launcelot with a few hundred knights, in their armor, and riding bicycles?! Or a knight, in the lists at a tournament, being lassoed cowboy style?! It was also interesting to read because it gives you a sense of life in Twain's time, with a few references to the Civil War, or the dispute over currency...

It is about a 20th century man who goes back in time. The ISBN number is 978-1613823774, and you can purchase it for around ten dollars online.This book is one of Mark Twain's easier reads, and is even an easy read despite being written by Twain. It is also one of the most intriguing books I have ever read.Hilarious does not even begin to describe this book. Mark Twain did an excellent job portraying the life of a Yankee being sent to live in the 12th century. The clothing and culture differences, and the large contrast between his modern innovation knowledge and the medieval world make for great laughs. Throughout the book the Yankee is criticizing the people he meets, while they're doing the same to him. He comments on their clothes, hair, dialect, and even the way the walk.Mark Twain made me think hard in this book with anecdotes and his sarcasm. It all made sense later in the book when he acknowledged and explained what he meant. Most authors would never do that, which makes the book easy to understand.I would recommend this book because it has hard facts, and is brilliantly written with a humorous tone."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Written by Mark Twain long after the age of steamboats, Life on the Mississippi paints a vivid picture of those wild days on the river. Before the channelization projects, before the bank stabilization projects, before channels were marked by buoys or there were radar and sonar to aid pilots on the river, navigating the ever-changing river was truly one of the great feats of the frontier.

The first half (or so) is autbiographical--about his learning to be a pilot before the Civil War. The second half is his return to the river in the early 1880s, with many observations about how it and the people who live on it have changed. Throughout, there are engaging anecdotes and stories, many of them mixing humor and horror, and these kept me going through the long stretches about how the river has changed its course through the decades. You can see how Vonnegut and Heller can be seen as Twain's descendents after reading the book--the occassionally morbid, satirical voice that seems to permiate American humor.All in all, a bit of a mixed bag, at least for me.

He is a clever foreman and loves the technology of his time. One day while at work, Hank is hit with a crowbar and knocked out. When he is finally revived, he finds himself in Camelot in the year 528. Things seem pretty bleak for Hank, who is immediately taken prisoner by a knight and sentenced to die. He uses the knowledge that a solar eclipse is due in order to gain a reputation as a powerful magician, more powerful even than Merlin.Hank quickly adjusts to his position as adviser to King Arthur, and uses his expertise in the areas of science and engineering whenever he sees an opportunity. Soon all of Camelot is connected by telephones and telegraphs, trains are beginning to be built, and knights travel the countryside on bicycles. Hank introduces American systems of money and has plans to turn Camelot into a democracy after Arthur's death.But Hank has enemies, including Merlin and the church. These enemies are powerful and capitalize on the superstitions of the people living in Camelot.This was a very clever book, highlighting some of the weaknesses of a Medieval society, and the things a modern capitalist might do to improve them.

He gets put back in time and into King Authors Court were he has to figure out how to get out of being hung by the king for being an outsider.This adventures tale introduces how to never give up and make the best out of a bad situation. Although sounding interesting, parts of the novel are written in old English, therefore recommended from high school up. Personally, the book wasn't the best I had ever read. For a young reader, the book is hard to keep on track when reading the lengthful pages.Sounding interesting, Hank Morgan, the boss, struggles to go through 6th century life. Sounding like you'll get a blast from the past, I myself only give this book two stars. Although many very strong readers may like the novel, many people may get lost in the book by falling asleep on the pages."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This book A CONNECITICUT YANKEE AT KING ARTHUR'S COURT by Mark Twain is very boaring. It starts out with a fictional character in King Arthur's kingdom. It then creats a labyrinth of problems that the character solves using the technology of his time. It ends triumphantly with Hank (the main character) winning a huge battle for control of England. Although the book had moments where the suspension could be felt by the reader most of the time the descriptions and characters feelings filled the pages with unnecessary narritive. Because of this the racy plot with many intresting characteristics ends up taking a long time and being slowed down by the thoughts of the characters. Although this book is considered a classic its writing could be compared to the writing of Charles Dickens. The plot of the book is well written and thought out but, in an attempt to make the book seem more realistic both authors throw in space-fillers. Also as in GREAT EXPECTATIONS Mark Twain creates a connection between all characters that happens only within a few pages.Because of all the connections in the book the plot can become hard to follow and in order to fully understand the book it is better to glance over what you have just read. The plot at times is to amazing for any reader to believe, the author gives the main character the ability to make all inventions from his time and, at a glance creat new ones. He makes the character follow a heroes journey of sorts, where he must face entire leigons of soliders but wins by flipping a swich or shooting a gun. In a way, however, it is intresting to see how todays knowledge can be used in the past for conquest and for peace. The story the book gives made me think of what would happen if someone actually did go back in time. Because each new chapter in the book introduces a new character or a new problem it makes the reader carefully follow the plot. This creates the need to read every sentence and that is very demanding on the reader.I did not enjoy the book. It was too much to read for such a limited plot and the ideas were repititive.

He travels back in time to the Middle Ages. He meets new people and pretends he is a magician since he knows so much about the future. He becomes a well known hero throughout the land. The book is pretty much about his successes and adventures as he learns about Medieval times. To me, I thought the book was more on the boring side, but I think someone older might enjoy it more since the book has more complicated events and words. I think it was too long and slow because it would use up pages and pages describing landscapes or how uncomfortable wearing armor is when all I really wanted to do was get to the real point of the story. Also, I don't think the characters were very exciting and interesting because they would never really act like a real person would act during a similar situation. Like how the main character, Hank Morgan, never really wondered how he got to be in the Middle Ages and how he never really missed the 1800's or thought about how he could go back. This all makes up why I don't like this book. So, if you're young and looking for some action or if you're old and looking for some adventure, I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I have always loved Mark Twain since reading Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer as a kid. At one point I had even memorized \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" as a seventh-grader in Catholic school. Twain has always held a sentimental place close to my heart, so when our book club chose to read and discuss A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, I was all for it.I had heard vaguely of Twain's atheist mindset and his antagonism toward religion in general. But until I read Connecticut Yankee, I had no idea how much irrational and unfounded antipathy Twain had for the Catholic Church in particular. The pervasive theme in Connecticut Yankee is that our modern enlightened world is far superior to that which went before and that the \\"bad old days\\" of slavery and oppression were almost completely the fault of the Catholic Church. This anti-Catholic sentiment can hardly be denied as Twain himself urged reviewers not to mention it when the book first came out. \\"Please don't let on that there are any slurs at the Church,\\" he told a sympathetic reviewer in the Boston Herald. \\"I want to catch the reader unawares, and modify his views if I can.\\"So Twain engaged in what we know today as the \\"last acceptable prejudice.\\" By way of a simple comparison, let us imagine that, instead of Catholics, Twain had chosen Jews, Mormons, or Evangelicals as the villains of Connecticut Yankee. Would it still occupy the exalted position it does as an American classic? Or would it be relegated to those dusty shelves where reside other scurrilous works or racist manifestos to be studied as a historical curiosity of a meaner age?For me, the most annoying aspect of Connecticut Yankee was Twain's almost total ignorance of history--or, perhaps more accurately, his decision to turn history on its head to better fit his polemical aims of blaming all the ills of society on the Catholic Church. This is a classic example of what happens, I suppose, when a journalist with a wide breadth of knowledge but no depth attempts to novelize about a historical subject. To address some of Twain's errors:1.) Slavery in antiquity was in no way the fault of the Church. That pernicious institution long predated Christianity and was endemic to classical pagan societies. Indeed, the Church has a long history of making the lot of slaves more tolerable and being among the premier abolitionist institutions in the world.2.) The idea that the Church suppresses intellectual freedom is a fable made up during the Protestant rebellion, though it is heartily embraced by Twain. Far more erudite scholars than I have examined this fallacy in detail, so rather than address this topic in detail here, I would point the reader to Tom Woods's excellent book,How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization.3.) Twain writes naively of democracy, putting in Hank Morgan's mouth the notion that \\"Where every man in a state has a vote, brutal laws are impossible.\\" One wonders what Twain would have made of our modern America, where not only every man, but every woman has a vote, and yet the ghastly practice of abortion is not only legal, but enshrined as a human right. Democracy of itself does not ensure enlightened government. Without the temper of religion, democracy is as likely to produce brutal and repulsive laws as the worst monarchy. De Tocqueville understood this. It's a wonder that Twain did not.There are many more, but this review is already more prolix that I had intended.As always, Twain's writing sparkles in Connecticut Yankee and his lampooning of the style of Mallory is very funny. His characters, however, viewed 120 years later, are crudely drawn. Hank Morgan is an Alger-esque self-made man whose compendious knowledge of all subjects is just a little too convenient. The legendary Arthurians are all soulless pawns that Twain moves around to further his polemic. No insight is offered into their characters at all. They are all cruel and completely self-serving--as they must be in Twain's mind because they belong to the aristocracy. The story ends on a bizarrely depressing note for a tale that was predominantly a humorous satire for the first seven-eighths of its length.In short, this is not a book I will be reading to my kids as a bedtime story. For me, it is to be considered a shameful period piece, written at a time when it was acceptable and even laudatory to be a Know-Nothing and make up slanders about the Catholic Church. That it is a cleverly-written slander is only another mark against it. Amusing slanders are pleasing to read but have the potential to do real harm both to the target and the reader."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"You probably already know the basic setup: a man from 19th Century Connecticut goes back in time to King Arthur's England. The book is both an adventure story and a social satire. It is in many ways baffling, and is a great attempt but not necessarily a great finished work of literature. The book is confused and ill-organized; attempting to do too many things at the same time. A parody of medieval chivalry and romance, an invective against social inequality and political injustice, an attack on human ignorance and superstition, it is at the same time written as if it were for children. Deadly serious and cynical, the novel is also saturated with lowbrow humor. Despite the disjointed nature of the book, there are many great parts in it, and it is certainly well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I read this recently after having kept a copy around for years; I now wish I had read it years ago. It is witty, observant, and a wonderful slice of American history; thenow-vanished steamboat culture comes alive like nowhereelse.

A wonderful book - I simply cannot praise it highly enough."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"If you think Bing Crosby's 1949 movie was anything like Mark Twain's fantasy classic published in 1889...Forget It! Like the precursor novels,'Gulliver's Travels' written in 1726 by Jonathan Swift and 'Alice in Wonderland' written in 1865 by Lewis Carroll were made into movies that are barely representative of the original novels. The film starring Bing Crosby was a musical / comedy only touching on the very basic part of Twain's novel.Mark Twain's view of England's Lifestyle in 528 was very harsh pertaining to church and throne to say the least.On page 246, he says...\\" if one could but force it ( manhood ) out of its timid and suspicious privacy, to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it\\". The book has none of the film's niceties, instead it graphically tells of unjust hangings,stake burnings, murder, slavery, and an unfair caste system. This is a brilliant novel written 113 years after the Revolutionary War and 24 years after the Civil War. The contents truly reveal Mark Twain's political and social views, which I think are worthy of the study they have received. For further information on his thoughts see: 'Autobiography of Mark Twain: Volume 1, Reader's Edition (Mark Twain Papers)'.In the year 1879, Hank Morgan ( his name is only mentioned once ), an arms factory foreman, gets into a fight with a man named Hercules ( no, not him ) and wakes up under a tree in King Arthur's Camelot in the year 528! He is captured by the less then adequate knight, Sir Kay. At first Hank thinks he is in an insane asylum, but then as he is brought before The Knights of the Round Table to receive justice, he realizes that he really is in the sixth century. He is stripped naked and sent to the dungeon and sentenced to be burned at the stake the next day. The page, Clarence, visits Hank in the dungeon and is convinced by Hank that Hank's a super magician. Clarence becomes Hank's right hand man. Hank remembers that the next day will have a total eclipse of the sun. He warns King Arthur and Merlin the Magician that he will blot out the sun if they attempt to burn him at the stake. The next day they don't believe him and as they start the fire under Hank, the sun starts to go dark! The King wants Hank to stop it and become the second most powerful man in Camelot. Hank waits for the eclipse to pass and now becomes known as The Boss to the chagrin of Merlin, now a vowed enemy of The Boss.The Boss with the help of Clarence secretly starts many modern businesses, such as; a telephone system, a newspaper business, a railroad, army and naval academies, an arms factory, an electric company and an advertising company with the knights displaying the ads on their armour, just to mention a few of his enterprises. King Arthur requires The Boss to go on a quest with the damsel, Sandy, to save enslaved princesses from three ogres! It turns out to be a pig sty with three farmers. He returns to Camelot a hero with his now beloved Sandy. He then has many adventures in Camelot, such as; jousting tournaments with the knights armed with lances and The Boss with a pistol ( who do you think won? ), the blowing up of Merlin's Tower, the magical repair of the fount at the Valley of Holiness, and many more. At this point The Boss decides to go incognito with King Arthur into the realm of the peasants. They find many injustices and wrongs amongst the people, but before they can return to the castle, they are captured by a earl and sold into slavery. They are accused of murder and sentenced to hang. The Boss escapes and calls Clarence for help. The next day just before they are to be hanged, Lancelot and 500 knights arrive on bicycles to save the day!The ensuing years are good for The Boss, his wife Sandy and their daughter, Hello-Central ( that's right! ). Unbeknownst to The Boss, Merlin has made his family sick, so The Boss takes his family away from England and goes on a long cruise/ vacation to heal. That's when :The expression [the shit hits the fan] is related to, and may well derive from, an old joke. A man in a crowded bar needed to defecate but couldn't find a bathroom, so he went upstairs and used a hole in the floor. Returning, he found everyone had gone except the bartender, who was cowering behind the bar. When the man asked what had happened, the bartender replied, 'Where were you when the shit hit the fan?' [Hugh Rawson, \\"Wicked Words,\\" 1989] This is the best part of the book, the last 100 pages, or so. I never could have predicted the ending. The interesting thing about this book is that Mark Twain is the narrator! The book starts out with Twain on a tour of the Warwick Castle. He is approached by a old man seemingly knowledgeable about the castle and the knights. The old man starts to tell Twain his story from thirteen centuries ago, but grows weary at the Warwick Arms, and before retiring to his room, he hands Twain the manuscript to read. This was a great book and if you only read one classic this year...make it this one!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"In this novel, Twain invented a common fantasy theme: a modern man travels to an ancient era and introduces modern technology and modern political ideas.I found the fantasy part somewhat lurching and disjointed. Major innovations such as the telegraph show up off-stage. Sometimes years pass between chapters with no obvious notice. The ending feels forced, too.The antagonists are a mixed lot. The knights and Merlin are just foils -- always wrong, always stupid. The King is more interesting -- he is invested with personal courage and dignity. Sandy, too, is maddeningly medieval one moment, and a co-conspirator with Boss the next.Mixed in with the scenes about 19th century technology in medieval England, Twain delivers several scenes about medieval justice, nobility, and slavery. He writes fine thunderous fusillades on the side of human dignity and human liberty. These are the best parts of the book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I really enjoyed this book; it was one of Mark Twain's best, in my opinion. Hank Morgan, a mechanic in a nineteenth century New England factory, is hit on the head during an argument. He wakes to find himself among knights and magicians in King Arthur's court. What follows is a work of satire, in which Twain celebrates ingenuity and democracy over the bumblings of monarchy. But he also asks whether such progress necessarily makes a better society. Gradually as Hank becomes more powerful, he also becomes more ruthless and less able to control events. On top of all that, it was a great story as well. I loved Twain's writing style; it wasn't too overwritten, and I enjoyed the way he alternated from modern style to medieval. Hank's narration is in a more modern style, but the other characters speak with prithees and thous and hasts. Also, the edition I have has wonderful ink illustrations to go with the chapters by Dan Beard.

Not terrible because it simply makes fun of those things, I could easily digest that, but because it seems to seriously attempt to make the legends seem to be groundless and made up, with none of their hidden meaning and mystery.

What an interesting book! I'd never read it before. It's about a guy named Hank Morgan from Connecticut, who gets transported 1300 years back in time to the 590s, and the mythical days of King Arthur. Mr. Morgan is a brilliant, mechanically-inclined, resourceful guy and he goes about trying to civilize the 6th century, by \\"inventing\\" and introducing modern conveniences like the telephone, the steam engine, soap, gun powder, etc. That's fun, of course. I've always enjoyed imagining all the cool stuff I could \\"invent\\" if I was transported back in time. I never realized that someone had written a book about it - let alone Mark Twain! In practice, it would be totally impossible to invent all the stuff that Mr. Morgan invents. Materials just weren't available. But who cares! It's fun to imagine it anyway, and Twain does all kinds of creative stuff with the idea.The book is at turns funny and tragic. The Dark Ages are portrayed as brutal, savage, merciless times...which I'm sure they were. Makes you appreciate living in a modern democracy. Hmmm...what else to say...there's a few weird spots in the book where the story line takes a bit of a sudden jump. One gets the feeling that Twain got fed up with a few bits of it, and just kinda patched it together at those spots. Let's see...what else?

It's an interdisciplinarian's dream as Twain takes on economics, geography, politics, ancient and contemporary history, and folklore with equal ease. Mostly though, one appreciates his knack for exaggeration, the tall tale, and the outright lie. It's a triumph of tone, as he lets you in on his wild wit, his keen observation, and his penchant for bending the truth without losing his credibility as a guide.The book's structure is also modern: He recounts his days as a paddlewheel steam boat \\"cub,\\" piloting the hundreds of miles of the Mississippi before the Civil War, then, in Part 2, returns to retrace his paddleboat route. Although a few of his many digressions don't work (they sometimes sound formulaic or too detailed) most of the narrative is extremely entertaining.

Well, now that you've reached adulthood, you should make time to read _Life on the Mississippi_. It's mandatory reading if you live in a state that borders the great river, anywhere from Minnesota down to Louisiana. It's mandatory reading if you have come to that point in life when you can suddenly appreciate American history and post-Civil War stories written by someone who lived through that time.Writing in the first half of the 1870s, Twain retraces the steps of his youth: the watery highway he knew when he trained to be a riverboat pilot nearly 20 years earlier. He speaks of how life _was_ along the river, and what life _became_. It's almost a \\"you can't go home again\\" experience for him, while the reader gets the benefit of discovering both time periods.I have two favorite parts that I share with others. Chapter IX includes a wonderful dissertation about how learning the navigational intricacies of the river caused Twain to lose the ability to see its natural beauty. And Chapter XLV includes an assessment of how the people of the North and the South reacted differently to the war experience. If I were a social studies teacher, I'd use that last passage in a unit on the reconstruction period. So put this title on your vacation reading list, and don't fret: the chapters are short and are many -- 60! -- but you can stop at any time, and the words go by fast. _Life on the Mississippi_ should make you forget all about any Twain trauma and report-writing you may have suffered as a teenager. [This reviewer was an Illinois resident when these comments were written.]"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This is the book that Mark Twain himself thought to be his greatest. It is basically a memoir in two parts of his life spent on the river with historical sketches, statistics, and other matters thrown in.The first part of the book tells of Twain's early years as a riverboat pilot. He talks about being a cub pilot, about learning about the intricacies of the river and the difficulties of navigating it, and about his mentor Horace Bixby. Twain's love of the river and his pride in \\"mastering\\" it are made obvious in these chapters.The second part recounts Twain's return to the river in 1882, mainly to \\"see it again\\" in preparation of writing this book. Starting in St. Louis, he first goes south through Baton Rouge to New Orleans. He spends a bit of time there and describes life as he sees it in the city (there's a funny chapter regarding the above-ground cemeteries and an argument about cremation). Then he heads north on the steamboat City of Baton Rouge, piloted by his old mentor Horace Bixby. He stops off in Hannibal for three days, just enough time to see how much the town and some old acquaintances have changed, and then continues all the way to St. Paul, Minnesota.Twain's humor, as he recounts conversations with people, sights seen, reminiscences dredged up, and a myriad of other matters that fill the book, is always evident. It's one of the great books on the mighty river, and whether you are a lover of the works of Mark Twain or interested in the Mississippi River during the time period just before and after the Civil War, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"What a great novel! Twain is wonderfully funny, yet his scathing social commentary concerning his own times are as serious as a heart attack.When a Connecticut Yankee gets sent back in time to King Arthur's Court, he decides his superior knowledge should be used to educate such an \\"ignorant race.\\" Of course, we all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and if I didn't know better, I would say that the person who coined the phrase did so after finishing this novel. The story's main character, Hank Morgan, is a likeable, if not laughable character, yet as most of us already know: absolute power corrupts absolutely. Once technology gets on a roll, the beast of civilization takes off running and Morgan cannot pull in the reigns. Total disaster ensues (incase you had not already guessed).This was a fun read and a look at a problem that is still very much alive today. Too much civilization can be like a disease, especially when those who are working to spread it find that they are doing it for reasons other than altruism.Also, do you remember the scene in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" when Indiana Jones whips out his gun to shoot the sword-wielding Sultan? That scene was surely lifted from this very book!Trust me, this is a novel for thought, but one that will not bore you. Twain was a master and this is perhaps my favorite of his novels. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"You might wonder what prompted Mark Twain to sidle from \\"straight\\" fiction into the realm of outright fantasy. Twain transports a Connecticut shop foreman twelve centuries into the past [and 5 000 kilometres!] to Camelot and Arthur's court. Initially confused and dismayed, Hank Morgan's Yankee practicality is quickly aroused and he becomes a major figure among the panopolied knights. With the title of The Boss, his rank equals The King or The Pope with its uniqueness. His elevation doesn't distract him from a more profound impulse, however. Hank's Yankee roots and wide experience evoke an ambition - nothing less than revolution. He wants to sweep away the monarchy and aristocracy and establish an American-style republic in Arthurian Britain.Mark Twain's scathing criticism of the sham of hereditary monarchy bolstered by an Established Church makes this among his choicest writings. He resents the condition of a Church which \\"turned a nation of men into a nation of worms.\\" A fervent believer in individual freedom, Twain uses Hank to voice his disdain of Britain's royalty. It's no more than might be expected of a man who boasted of but one ancestor - who sat on the jury that executed Charles I. Hank knows revolutions never succeed when implemented from above. Revolution be achieved only when the individual's attitude changes from meek acceptance toself assertion. Hank's method reaches people through clandestine schools and factories, publication of a newspaper and establishment of a telephone system. These new forms of manufacture and communication become the foundation by which Hank expects to abolish the ancient, mis-named, chivalric tradition. Does he change the course of history?Twain relocates the roots of American democracy from the heart of the frontier yeoman farmer to the brain of the urban industrial worker. Here the man of wide, practical experience shows how to survive compared to those with a formal education. Hank has a simple ambition - establishment of a republic - but utilizes a broad spectrum of ideas to bring it about. He would gladly replace the Established Church of Rome with his own Presbyterian ideals, but is aware that it would be swapping one evil for another. \\"Each man should select his own religion, or make one\\" he contends. Yet, finally, it is this dread force that impairs his desire for change. The final sequence stands as a peer to the biblical Armageddon, Twain wallowing in a frightful bloodletting unseen in any of his other works.Mark Twain contrasts the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution with the centuries of slavery, serfdom, and poverty that killed countless more people than that spasm of excising of aristocracy. What else spurred him to write of human rights with such passion? He had written of slavery before, but this book is especially wrathful in describing the \\"peculiar institution\\" eliminated in his homeland but a generation before. He forces the king to experience the slave's condition, a form of degradation he would have all aristocrats endure. Every feature of the human condition is examined in this timeless treasure. He challenges you to follow his gaze, considering whether today's societies, monarchical or not, will endure the scrutiny."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"As with all of Mark Twain's work this book works on two very different levels. The first of course is a simple adventure story the second is a bitingly satiric work that unmasks many of the hypocracies of \\"conventional wisdom\\".I have to believe that most of his readers of his time (and ours) did not understand his underlying messages regarding society and its institutions. For me, it was hard to miss the way he unmasked the church, the state and society as a whole. I had to laugh out loud at some of the ways he managed to expose the absurdities of government and religion.This book is a quick read and is immensely satisfying if the reader takes the time to follow Twain's logic to its natural conclusions."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"In Life on the Mississippi, Twain recounts his river experiences from boyhood to riverboat captain and beyond. Encompassing the years surrounding the Civil War, this book is an excellent source of 19th-century Americana as well as an anthology of the mighty river itself. Replete with rascally rivermen, riparian hazards, deluge, catastrophe, and charm, Life on the Mississippi is another of Twain's stellar literary achievements.Wit and wisdom are expected from Twain and this book does not disappoint. It is equally valuable for it's period descriptions of the larger river cities (New Orleans, St. Louis, St. Paul), as well as the small town people and places ranging the length of America's imposing central watershed.The advent of railroads signalled the end of the Mississipi's grand age of riverboat traffic, but, never fear, Life on the Mississippi brings it back for the reader as only Samuel Clemens can. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Life on the Mississippi is by far one of the most wonderful books ever written about the post Civil War era in America. Mark Twain takes the reader on a melancholy look at this period of time in history as you journey into the Mississippi of his youth, adulthood, and the people and the communities he knew so well. He conveys a miraculous picture of this lively river giving it the grandeur and prominence it deserves. He defines the river very much like a living organism with a power and personality all its own. As the book unfolds, he begins in his days when he grew up along the river and became a steam boat pilot, ending that career with the advent of the Civil War. Later he returns to the river after some twenty years and takes a journey as a writer from around St. Louis to New Orleans and back up the river into what is present day Minnesota. You learn about the different cultures along the river, its tributaries, as well as the remarkable people who become part of the forgotten history of our nation. Twain's anecdotes are sheer brilliance, and he has an incredible way of choosing just the right story to illustrate a particular point transporting the reader back into time as if it was the present day and you are standing beside Twain observing what he is seeing. His reflections of his times along the river and his descriptions of the people and places make this a true masterpiece of literature and I highly recommend it. I found myself only able to read short portions at a time, as I personally found the sheer beauty of the entire book was a work to be savored and digested rather than rapidly consumed as you would with any other book. As I poured through the book, I felt often as if I was traveling with Mark Twain as a companion along his charming and magnificent journey during a wonderful period of history."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This is an excellent book. It is by far the best Twain I have read yet, and I give it four stars. In this novel, Mark Twain holds the glory and romance associated with Arthurian Legend up to the standards of 19th century society, and reveals defects in both the romantic ideal of King Arthur and the faith that Twain's generation holds in scientific and social &quot;progress.&quot; Both funny and thought-provoking, this book provides the reader with a new set of eyes with which to view the barbarism and injustice that Arthur and his knights so valiantly fought to preserve. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is the tale of Hank Morgan, a typical 19th century man who is transported back in time to the days of Merlin, Guinevere, and King Arthur. After becoming aware of his surroundings, and deciding to ignore his uncertainty about whether King Arthur actually existed, this man uses the common knowledge of his time period, his practicality, and some perfectly timed arrogance to acquire a position of great power in this land that he finds repulsive and in need of an enlightened leader. The ensuing story is the tale of what happens when the two utopias collide and this man abuses his power in an attempt to bring the &quot;great and beneficent&quot; miracles of the 19th century to the Age of Chivalry. I would recommend this book to any reader in 8th grade or above, but I would discourage people with passionate faith in the purity and glory of King Arthur from reading this book if they do not want to be forcefully presented with demonstrations of chivalry's inhumanities. A fairly well developed sense of humor will help the reader to enjoy Mark Twain's subtle ironies and satirical situations, and some basic knowledge of science helps in understanding some of the scenes, however this isn't vital to the book. The vocabulary is moderately advanced, the subject matter is somewhat mature at times, and the philosophical reasoning is probably beyond the reach of most Junior High students, yet I would encourage anyone who is interested to give this book a try. This novel is also great for the general public because A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court provides the reader with a main character with whom they may identify. The main character, Hank Morgan is presented with situations in which he must deal with being a stranger in a new atmosphere, being a social outcast due to his uncommon beliefs, he must avoid physical confrontation, and he is forced to use his intellectual abilities rather than brute strength to solve difficult situations. Many readers will have faced similar difficulties in their lives, and this ability to identify with the characters will definitely add to the overall enjoyment of the story. With this piece of work, Mark Twain displays his true talent for excellent writing and story telling. He incorporates enough adventurous and action filled scenarios to make the reader want to continue reading vigorously, yet he also manages to discuss very philosophical and thought-provoking topics during the lulls in the action. This book reads very quickly near the beginning and end. The action tapers off during the middle of the story, but not for long, and once it starts to pick up again, Twain demonstrates his true potential for greatly entertaining writing in the very climactic and cleverly ironic ending that brings this all-around great book to an even better close. This is definitely a book worth reading."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This is the fictional journal of a man who somehow got transported into the time of King Arthur. It is told from an interesting point of view because in the beginning of the story the man supposedly wanders into the house of the writer and gives the writer this journal of the events of his life in the 500s. The journal tells the story of how the man first found himself in King Arthur's time, was taken to prison, and was about to be killed when he remembered that there was to be an eclipse at noon. So, he makes the people believe that he is a great magician and that he made the eclipse happen, so if they don't release him and give him great power, he will never bring the sun back. They of course believe him and he comes to be known as the \\"Boss\\" because he is basically the boss of the king. He marries, has children, and then.... The story is captivating and realistic (except, of course, for how he got there), punctuated by witty humor and hilarious circumstances. A must-read classic for everyone!!!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Wow! What a book. I myself have only read one other book by Mark Twain and that was Tom Sawyer and I really didn't like it. But my compliments to Mr.Twain on this one. This is a book that I had a hard time putting down. The adventure, humor, and excitement came with every turn of the page. The book is about Hank Morgan who is a young man in Connecticut in the 19th century who is sent back to the 13th century. There he barely escapes death, and I mean barely and later serves an important position in King Author's Court. During his time there he introduces 19th Century technology to the people of the land of Camelot, making him an instant hit. Even though he barely escapes death he still makes rude and contreversial coments toward the king. To find out how the book ends you'll just have to read it. This was a really awsome book and I really enjoy it. I would recomend this to anyone who has an imagination and loves to read adventures with humor as well. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This book may seem like a perfectly innocent book that you would want your children to read. Mark Twain's a fabulous American author, right? Well, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" starts off innocent enough.... Hank Morgan, a factory owner in 19th century Connecticut is hit over the head with a crowbar by a rowdy employee. He is knocked out, and when he awakes he finds himself with Sir. Kay, one of the knights in King Arthur's Court, who brings him back to Camelot to be executed. The beginning of the book shows off Mark Twain's obvious distaste for 6th century society in Britain, but also has a few of its more humorous moments. We learn that the knights of the round table are nothing more than Vulgar Braggarts, we witness the destruction of Merlin (the yankee's enemy)'s tower, the cruelty of Queen Morgan LeFay, and the antics as Hank and Sandy go on a quest to find several captive princesses (who are nothing more than hogs!)Hank impresses everyone by institutionalizing modern conveniences back into that era (trains, telephones, guns, newspapers....) Anyway, the book takes a darker turn when King Arthur and Hank travel incognito as peasants and witness the downtrodden and oppressed peoples. One of the more touching moments of the book is when King Arthur carries a dying girl out of a hut to her mother, risking getting infected with smallpox. It gets even darker when Hank murders 10 knights with a pistol, then later when he and a handful of other men kill off 50,000 knights with high-voltage electric fences, land mines, and trenches with sharp spears sticking out on the bottom, only to almost die from the stench of the dead. This book is better for the mature reader because it deals with many issues of society, such as discrimination between social classes, and not accepting other cultures. I definetly wouldn't reccomend this for: SQUEAMISH PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH LIMITED READING SKILLS, AND PEOPLE WHO LACK MATURITY. Despite all of the defects of this novel, it sure is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"In this book, It was easy to notice all the small detail such as the accents, rooms of the court's detail and the description of life in Camelot. All those were so detailed it made me think about all the work Mark Twain put into this. This book's detail alone blows any other King Arthur book out of the water. After just reading the first 200 pages, this book has hooked me as its favorite. The beginning was terriffic and will hook you into reading the rest in suspicion about what the Narrator's next adventure will be. The book has taught me (and will teach anyone who reads it) a lot about Camelot and what it would have been like to live there. If you love to read historical fiction books, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Imagine yourself thrown back fourteen hundred years to the kingdom of the legendary Arthur. Add some technical know-how, a touch of arrogance, and a taste for adventure, and you would be Hank Morgan. The successful head superintendent of an arms factory, Morgan is sent back in time by a nasty knock on the head, and finds himself a prisoner at the court of the once and future king. Through an incredible knowledge of astronomy, and mechanics, and his natural intelligence, he finds his way to the top of the Arthurian power structure, and becomes The Boss. Posing as a powerful magician, he impresses the people and the court with magnificent firework displays, stellar predictions, and other \\"tricks\\" that today are taken for granted. As he learns more about the social inequalities in the culture that he has no choice but to live in, he comes to the conclusion that he must free the masses from the oppression of the nobility. Morgan attempts to impose the ideals, governing system, and ways of thinking of the industrialized 19th century onto the primitive 6th century. Secretly, he develops a civilization of his own time inside Arthur's Kingdom, his eventual goal being to destroy every remnant of the old ways, and replace them with the new. Traveling the kingdom, Morgan spreads his influence and his beliefs. He encounters on his adventures both heartbreaking situations of cruelty, and heartwarming scenes of humanity. Throughout the whole kingdom, however, he always sees the need to destroy the feudal system. Twain teaches us something through Morgan's determination, and something else by the calamitous ending of the book. The good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur is probably the most accurate of all the king Arthur Legends, as far as describing the daily life, customs, and superstitions of the people of the period. It does not lionize the Knights of the Round Table, but at the same time it does not speak of them as savages, as some accounts do. Similarly, it makes the people out to be decent, simple, and yes, sheep, but not total fools. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur describes the time impartially, meticulously, and colorfully. There is not the element of glamorization just as there is not the element of degradation. Twain's use of the first-person narration makes the story more realistic; the people who are dying of small pox are horrifyingly well described, and the grandeur with the banners and shining armor at a joust is equally enticing. Most importantly, this book flows well: each event leads to the next, and it all fits together nicely. The twist that Twain puts on the end superbly concludes the story, and it makes you really think. The not-so-good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur does move slowly at times. Also, the main character, Hank Morgan, is excessively American. Twain really overuses the baseball metaphors, and Morgan's contempt for all forms of mysticism and non-scientific explanations of things damages the atmosphere of the book. His impatience with the people who do not understand his speech and ideas, and his general attitude of superiority make him slightly less likeable, and more difficult to pay attention to. It is sometimes hard to bear Hank Morgan's thoughtless destruction of 6th century culture, and his obsession with the wonder of technology. The sometimes absurdly long descriptions, vivid pictures of violence, and overall length of this book would make it difficult for people under about twelve or thirteen to enjoy. Mark Twain is sending several messages in writing this book. The first and perhaps most important is that attention should be paid to the way in which a culture develops. Hank ultimately destroys Arthurian England as it was know, because he advances only the parts of the culture that he personally believes to be important. Twain is saying that if we are not involved in our world, everything is out of our control, and we can only hope that the reins fall into the right hands. Morgan's downfall can be attributed to this and to the fact that he disbelieves all other powers besides science, and even more than disbelieves dismisses them. Another main point that this book incorporates is that no one power should be allowed to become too strong. Twain reinforces this point with the examples of the Church and of Hank Morgan. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur addresses issues that face Mark Twain's time and issues that face ours. It brings many ideas, messages, and themes together into a cohesive body. With Camelot as the backdrop, Morgan's story as the message and Twains engaging style as the messenger, this book is delightful."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"A supervisor (Hank Morgan) in an arms factory in Connecticut is hit along the side of his head with a crowbar and wakes up to discover that he has traveled back in time to England when King Arthur ruled (the year given as 528). The Boss, as he is later known, saves himself from being executed by predicting a solar eclipse. He is made Arthur's minister and becomes an enemy of Merlin. He uses his knowledge of nineteenth-century technology to try and make life better in 6th-century England. But, when he attempts to improve the lot of the peasantry and to end the power of the Knights, he finds himself opposed by the aristocracy, Merlin, and the Church. This is a great satire and illustrates Twain's poor opinions of the aristocracy and of Kings and nobility (&quot;no ability&quot;). Interestingly, it is also the first time-traveling novel in which a character travels to a distant time. (In &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens (1843), the main character travels in time is limited to the periods in which he had actually lived.) This is a classic and it should be familiar to all well-educated individuals."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Mark Twain is, of course, a famous writer and a producer of a number of US classics. But this one is just too much of Mark Twain trying to make nasty remarks in order to be a cynic and too much of pushing American chauvinism, against too little realism to be bearable. Fine, 19th century Americans (and 20th and 21st as well) believe as a religion that their republic was the best invention since sliced bread and every other country in the history of the world was a land of morons. But this story depends on some far-fetched underestimation of human beings (or overestimation of Americans in relation to all others) in combination with sweeping generalizations and a lot of sweeping history under the rug.In short, I didn't like it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I was very suprised by the complexity of this book.

I thought Twain did a great job incorporating the newer (of his time) technologies into the old mid evil times. Not only did I think he did this very well; he had a very interesting take at explaining the great achievements of knights that do not seem to be what we would consider real. Like when knights fought giants and things of that nature, and how magic was explained. I thought it was interesting how he explained that a lot of the knights did not really do a lot of the things that they said, like kill ogres and giants, they only said they did because no one was around, and no one ever questioned the adventures that the knights told of. Another cool thing was how he incorporated newer technologies, like gunpowder, into how he did his \\"magic\\" and made people believe that he was a great sorcerer. This was a very good and interesting book, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I purchased this edition of Life on the Mississippi because I know that Library of America books are the highest quality and most definitive editions available of the works they publish.This edition includes an introduction written by Jonathan Rabin, a British travel writer and novelist (Passage to Juneau,Bad Land: An American Romance(winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award),Old Glory: A Voyage Down the Mississippi, andSurveillance). It also includes an 8 page chronology of Twain's life, notes on the text used in the book, and footnotes.The book is a paperback but larger format than most - essentially identical in size to the Library of America hardcover editions - and as all other LOA editions it is printed on very high quality paper (acid free).In his introduction, Rabin states that \\"Later in life, Twain would claim Life on the Mississippi as his own favorite among his books\\", and articles originally appearing in the Atlantic Monthly in 1875 served as the starting point.This is nonfiction from Mark Twain, reporting his recollections of experiences he gained beginning in about April, 1857, when he became a cub pilot on the Mississippi, and culminating in May 1861, when he made his last trip on the river as a pilot (at age 25). Being nonfiction it is unlike his novels Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, but it is every bit as enjoyable to read.This Library of America printing is a fine edition to purchase if you want a high quality book for your library, and you care that the text of the book is the most accurate available (see below), and it is very reasonably priced. There are many different and cheaper printings available, but not to these standards. This is the version I will always recommend to anyone wanting to add this to their collection or give to someone as a gift.For those who are interested in the specifics of why this edition is different from ANY other presently available (other than LOA's own hardcover), I offer the following, from the Library of America website (this came from their explanation for the hardcover LOA bookMark Twain : Mississippi Writings : Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, Huckleberry Finn, Pudd'nhead Wilsonwhich in addition to Life on the Mississippi, includes the three mentioned other novels by Twain. I have edited this to retain only the comments relevant to Life on the Mississippi:---------------\\"The book reprinted in this volume is presented in the best text now available. As early as January, 1866, Clemens had contemplated writing a travel book about the Mississippi River. Five years later, he told his wife that he proposed to spend two months on the river and take notes, but the actual beginning of \\"the Mississippi book\\" did not come until William Dean Howells, editor of the Atlantic Monthly, pressed Clemens for a contribution to follow \\"A True Story\\" (November, 1874). Clemens wrote twice to Howells on October 24, 1874, first to say \\"my head won't 'go,' \\" next to propose a topic. While walking in the woods with his friend and pastor, Joseph Twichell, he explained, he \\"got to telling him about old Mississippi days of steamboating glory & grandeur\\" as he had seen them from the pilot house. Twichell exclaimed, \\"What a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine!\\" The work that resulted went into seven issues of the Atlantic, January through August, 1875, omitting July.The contribution to the Atlantic was not nearly enough to make a subscription book, however, and only after a series of efforts to persuade Howells or some other friend to accompany him on a note-taking visit to the Mississippi did Clemens at last undertake the journey in 1882. By the terms of his contract for the book with James R. Osgood, Clemens became in effect his own publisher, Osgood--who had no experience in the publishing of subscription books--his agent.Clemens redivided chapters, revised chapter titles, added \\"The Record of Some Famous Trips\\" (334-36), made perhaps forty-five other changes, and the Atlantic material became chapters IV through XVII of the book. In composing the additional forty-six chapters--a wearying task--Clemens made voluminous use of his own travel notes and padded the work with previously written but unpublished tales, such as \\"The Professor's Yarn\\" (chapter XXXVI). He also borrowed perhaps 11,000 words from other writers. Most interestingly, he took the \\"raft passage\\" from his manuscript for what later became Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and incorporated it in \\"Frescoes from the Past\\" (chapter III). Indeed, he crowded so many pages into his manuscript that some became superfluous; he was able to omit some 13,000 to 15,000 words and to move other material to appendices.The first American edition (1883) is reprinted here. Ultimately, the methodically prepared text of the future will involve a comparison of the first American edition and the holograph manuscript held since 1909 by the J. Pierpont Morgan Library. The manuscript contains matter not in the book, and the book, matter not in the manuscript. Except for a few pages that Clemens called \\"the eighth batch\\" and--because of the illness of his typist--sent to Osgood in holograph form, the first American edition was set from a typescript made from the Morgan manuscript. Only a few pages of the typescript survive (at the Morgan Library and at the Houghton Library, Harvard). Clemens revised both the typescript and printer's proofs. That collating the manuscript with the first American edition will reveal errors in the book text has been shown by Willis Wager in \\"A Critical Edition of the Morgan Manuscript of Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi,\\" a dissertation submitted at New York University, Washington Square College, 1942. A few original manuscript readings are given in the notes that follow at 233.3, 380.14, 451.32, and 516.27-28.The standards for American English continue to fluctuate and in some ways were different in earlier periods from what they are now. In nineteenth-century writings, for example, a word might be spelled in more than one way, even in the same work. Commas could be used expressively to suggest the movements of voice, and capitals sometimes gave significances to a word beyond those it might have in its lower-case form. Since modernization would remove these effects, this volume has preserved the spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and wording of the editions reprinted here.The present edition is concerned only with presenting the texts of these editions; it does not attempt to reproduce features of the typographic design--such as the display capitalization of chapter openings. Footnotes within the text are those supplied by Clemens. Open contractions are retained if they appeared in the original edition. Typographical errors in the other editions used here have also been corrected.\\"---------------"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This item arrived in excellent condition.

The beginning of the book had a very interesting attention grabber. Hank Morgan, the main character, was at the colt factory where he worked when he got into a heated fight with a co-worker, Hercules. Hank then got hit in the head with a crowbar, passed out, and awoke to find himself in 6th century England. This introduction to the book made for a real page turner.I also liked the ways that Hank fooled everyone throughout the story with his \\"magic\\". Everyone thought he was a sourcerer because they thought he made the sky completely black, where as it was really a luner eclipse that he knew was going to happen from being from the future. He also said that he could blow up Merlins Tower by fire sent from the sky, but he really used explosives. He used his knowledge and newer inverntions to his advantage when he went back in time because they were things people from 6th century England never knew about.Mark Twain also used a lot of imagery in this book. I feel that it gave a better understanding of what was going on and it made the book exciting to read.One of the reason I only gave this book four stars is because I didn't like Hank and Merlins relationship. I think they should have gotten along instead of fighting and butting heads throughout the whole story. Mark Twain waited until the end of the story for them to get along whereas if he had done so sooner, the two of them would have gotten more accomplished throughout the story.The other thing i didn't like about the book was Hank and Sandie's kids name, \\"Hello-Central\\". To me there seemed to be an unclear meaning behind the name and i'm really not sure why that name was chosen. I think there could have been a better plot behind it or a better name could have been chosen.All in all, I think this is a wonderful book for anyone with an imagination to read and I would definatly recomend it to people in the future."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"In &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;, Hank Morgan is transported to the legendary times of King Arthur and Camelot.

Twain's amazing degree of perception of, and attunement with, the essence of Humanity is on ample display in \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" and readers even in this generation nearly 150 year hence will see and feel the almost eerie connection Twain achieved with the eternal Humanity in all of us. Add to that the fact that Twain's \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" is an exquisitely-crafted, often-poignant, oftener humorous panorama of a gorgeous part of our country during a truly wondrous and kaleidoscopic era of our national journey.

There's a scene at the beginning where cub pilot Twain is being quizzed by his mentor on previous sightings on the river. Twain cannot remember a single piece of information. His mentor cusses him and asks why he thinks he was telling him them. Twain replies sheepishly that perhaps he was trying to entertain him.

I expected to like it. It's got many of my favorite ingredients - time travel, satire, Britain, but I kept finding it falling flat.Part of the reason is that there is no clear setting.

Another thing I disliked was the Boss. He is our main character, and he's supposed to be our link and guide to what is good and lacking between the two societies. Instead he's an unreliable narrator, more guilty of the crimes than the people he attacks.An added point, that I don't think is necessarily inherent in the novel, but one that kept occurring to me as I read, was the question of whether we are actually more intelligent now than in the past. it may seem that we are, because we have the accumulated knowledge of all those that went before us, but are we really smarter? Are we smarter than Twain? King Arthur? Oommgogutuktuk at the discovery of fire? And add to that the particular sharpened stick of hindsight? Would we fare better with our big brains and our racial memories at any time before us? Twain implies not, but I don't know if I'd agree or if I'd attach a greater failing to the man than the idea.(less)"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The Twain tale that pleases me most.

Needless to say, he goes on an excursion with King Arthur experiencing many events along the way. On the journey he learns lessons of how to be noble and be a knight. My opinion of this book is that it lacks something, something that is entertaining. I do not find it interesting or appealing. Mark Twain uses many details like most books he has written. The book went a bit overboard on them. Talking about how it feels to be in armor for a page doesn't entice me. Also Twain goes onto new events too fast by actually lacking in detail. He did not have a smooth entrance to the journey he that the king and him went on. Also, I didn't realize until a chapter or two after Sandy, a damsel going on the journey, was introduced that she was a woman. I thought she was a horse at first. He could have transferred details, meaning using less on particular items and more on entrances. Overall, this book did not appeal to me at all.

The book is boring because in the middle of the book fo about 50 pages they are riding on horses to get to this place to save some princesses that have been turned into pigs. Also the book goes on and on about boring sujects, and the few interesting subjects are over in a few pages. This book is too gory, and there is too much killing.

Throughout the years he invents things we have today, but they didn't have back then. He also educates and helps people of the kingdom and becomes a knight himself. I found the book to be time-consuming and dull because nothing ever eventful happened and the old English they used made it hard to comprehend. They did not have a lot of big events at all. All he did was talk, talk, and talk about what he was going to do. It would have been more stimulating if they described when he was fighting, exploring, or helping others.

He stereotypes shamelessly throughout this book. And despite the fact that both the narrator and people who read this book seem to assert that this tale is set in the 6th century it absolutely is not. You did not have castles, titled lords and ladies, a powerful Roman Catholic church, and French sounding names in 6th century Britain! Had Mr. Twain been more balanced in his writing and more historically factual I personally would have found this book a great deal more readable. A story about someone in the 19th century transported to a time and place where Britons and Anglo-Saxons were fighting for control of the land would have been even more fascinating.

The novel's immediately obvious flaw (and I assume Mark Twain was aware of it but simply ignored it) is the 19th Century hero's ability to communicate with Britons of the 6th Century. They, of course, would have been speaking an English similar to that in &quot;Beowulf&quot;; the book has them talking like characters in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The opening chapters are comic in mood, complete with limp jokes. (When one character introduces himself as a page, the Yankee replies: &quot;Go 'long, you ain't more than a paragraph.&quot; Oh, Lord.) However, the story quickly becomes dark and then increasingly darker. The degraded condition of the masses (which the modern hero compares to 18th Century France) culminates in a tour (with King Arthur disguised as a peasant) of a oountryside corrupted by monarchy and the Church, both of which were loathed by Mark Twain. Feminists should be warned that the author's misogyny is given free rein here: all the ladies of the court are thoughtless twits, and Morgan Le Fay is a shrew who habitually and casually kills her servants. The heroine Alisande (who, of course, becomes Sandy) is a tiresome chatterbox, whom the hero abruptly marries as a sort of social condescension. But his attitude towards women is merely a part of his general misanthropy, leading him to write at one point: &quot;Well, there are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce.&quot; Once the protagonist has established himself as Arthur's right-hand man (he's called &quot;The Boss&quot;), he exercises his Yankee ingenuity to industrialize the realm. With the genius of Gutenberg, Morse and Bell at his disposal, he sets up a newspaper and introduces the telegraph and the telephone to the Middle Ages. (Just how he devises the technology to accomplish this is not made too clear.) At any rate, The Boss is considered a great wizard, and Merlin (or Brer Merlin, as the Yankee calls him) is treated like a fraudulent fool. Motivating all this is a somewhat smug sense of 19th Century superiority. Actually, the Yankee goes beyond his own century and into the 1900's. When Guenever's treason causes the civil war which divides Britain, The Boss drills a group of cadets (his West Pointers, he calls them) that he leads off to battle against the anti-Arthurian knighthood. The result is a blood bath presciently and repulsively similar to the trench warfare of 1914-1918. (The novel was published in 1889.) If this is meant to be an indication of future efficiency, it's an extremely pessimistic vision. But then, the whole story is Mark Twain's gloomy statement on Mankind's uneasy place in a dysfunctional world, be it the Dark Ages or the somber present."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"From what I've read, The Prince and the Pauper was Twain's first foray into historical fiction. He clearly reused one of the major themes from that book in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which was published seven years later - that of a royal who gets a chance to see how the other half lives. In the earlier book, the prince and a young beggar exchange clothes for fun. In this book, it probably isn't realistic to make a full-grown man exchange clothes with another for the fun of it, so Twain gives the somewhat flimsy excuse that the protagonist (who has become the king's right-hand man after traveling back in time) has decided to go see the kingdom in disguise, and the king has decided to go with him. There was almost no more discussion of it than that - I don't think Twain ever mentioned whether the rest of the king's court knew what he was doing. Certainly no search parties are ever sent for him, but it's strange that everyone would let him just go off with basically no protection.In any case, Twain's dislike of sixth-century England is very clear, although, he has ascribed many social behaviors to it that did not actually occur at that time. He even admits to this in a strange preface. At one point, he says, \\"Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole British world.\\" Now, I understand that the protagonist, being from 19th century England, has thirteen centuries of knowledge more than the \\"children\\" he references, but it's still pretty pompous to claim that much advantage over an entire kingdom.The protagonist finds the king extremely stupid and doesn't miss an opportunity to mention it. The protagonist himself does a number of stupid things, including getting himself and the king sold into slavery, but somehow those are just little mistakes; whereas the king's inability to pretend to be a commoner because he has really never had the opportunity or reason to study one, of course, proves that the king is an idiot. In The Prince and The Pauper, the prince returns to his throne with a greater knowledge of his people and rules that much better for it. In this book, the king returns to his throne and then Twain is a little too busy with creating a way for his protagonist to get back to the nineteenth century to really discuss what happens to the king after his escapades.This was fun to read but personally, I prefer The Prince and the Pauper."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain is told from the view of Hank Morgan, later on known as The Boss.

Hank learns from a man dress in a knight's armor that it is the 5th century, he doesn't believe that he traveled back in time, he thinks he is in an asylum. Suddenly Hank remembers that the day that he was told also happened to be the same day of the first recorded full Solar Eclipse. Hank finds that he has wandering into a place where they are hanging innocent people. Hank has some fun and tells the people that he will put the world into total darkness very soon, he hopes that if it truly is the 5th century, the people will believe him. Sure enough the eclipse does happen, all the people are in awe. For the rest of the book Hank is then on known as The Boss.Throughout the whole story, Hank gives King Arthur tips about how to be more successful. Hank goes on a venturous journey with King Arthur and he helps the King train Knights and create a large army. Hank gets a seat at the round table even though he is not a knight. Hank uses his knowledge to reinvent things that were a new invention from his time.

He is promptly captured and condemned to death, but saves his neck through his knowledge of a solar eclipse in the 6th century, which happens to occur the following day. He plays this to his advantage along with his knowledge of 19th century technology and quickly gains a reputation as a magician more powerful than Merlin. He becomes known as \\"The Boss\\" and secures a place in the government of King Arthur and sets about secretly to change the primitive and savage ways of the people, even daring to challenge \\"the Church\\" (the Catholic Church) and trying to institute modern freedoms.The satire is classic Mark Twain, and the situations Hank finds himself in (and his responses to them) are often very humorous. The story, however, was obviously meant as a more serious criticism of the idea of monarchy and especially of the abuses of religion when there is no freedom to choose. While I have no complaint with his logic and reasoning, I found it tiresome to continually read his folksy diatribes on the concepts of noble birth or religion - especially when the same argument popped up so often. What started out as an amusing tale became rather boring when the story stopped for these editorials. In the end, it just wasn't a very endearing story; funny and interesting at times but not enough to warrant a full four stars - call it 3 and a half."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Mark Twain (1835-1910) grew up along the banks of the Mississippi River, and he captures the feel of the mighty river during the steamboat era in this superb narrative and memoir. I particularly liked the earlier chapters, as Twain describes his youthful tutelage as an aspiring steamboat pilot in the years before the Civil War. Readers see what it was like guiding a steamboat over a river full of dangerous snags and sandbars - in clear daylight, through thick fog, and on moonless nights. The author then jumps ahead to his middle age - describing life along the river and in the South after the Civil War, and including politics, epidemics, and the supplanting of steamboats by railroads. The book's second half lacks a bit of the magic found earlier, but remains eminently readable and informative. This is a remarkable narrative by a great writer."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I read this book when I was young and going through a Mark Twain phase.

I re-read it when I was in the Peace Corps serving overseas, and I was struck by two things: First, Samuel Clemens understood the world in such an extraordinary way that, at times, he must have felt like a voice in the wilderness (yet, he was willing to share himself with the world). Second, if you are going to go live in someone else's world, you must realize neither you nor those around you will ever be the same...growth, change, challenge can be incredibly beneficial, but you will lose some part of yourself and take something away from others.I'll be reading this again throughout my life.

This book is great for anyone who loves the humor of Mark Twain."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Wow! That is the one word I have for this book, Wow. Twain once again shows that he is utterly and purely a genius in disguise. Our character is carried from the 19th century all the way back to the 6th century by a blow in the head. A man used to telephones, cigars and newspapers he is completely and utterly suprised by the simpleness and ignorance of mankind in the 6th century.After escaping from a fiery death using his knowledge of eclipses, he emerges from King Arthurs castle hailed as the greatest and most powerful magician that ever lived, he sets out to try to \\"modernize\\" Camelot. With the help of Clarence, a trusty righthand man that he met while he was a prisoner he sets up a telephone system, introduces a newspaper, starts a line of advertising, tries to convince the populace to use soap, along with many other things. Our character also takes part in some very distructive things like trying to overthrow the Church and the King, he even thinks of becoming president one day.Not everyone becomes his friend however, there is one guy in particular who is not so keen on the idea of him becoming \\"The Boss\\". His name is Merlin and he used to be a wonderfully respected magician until our character came along. Now everyone has lost interest in him because they have mover on to bigger and better magicians. Merlin shows contemt and disdain several times throughout the book, trying to win back his title. He never suceeds which I found quite humorous.In conclusion I did like this book because it was witty and slightly far-fetched. The idea of a telephone system, a printing press or the King riding a bicycle is simply prepsterous and therefore humorous. To put it simply, I loved this book because I got a kick out of it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Almost all of the novel features the narration of Hank Morgan, a foreman at a weapons factory in Connecticut who in the year 1879 is hit on the forehead by a crowbar by one of his unruly workers. When Hank wakes up he finds himself in England in the Sixth Century where King Arthur reigns.He is captured by a knight, brought to Arthur's castle and it is determined that he should be executed for he seems to be some strange demon sorcerer, what with his 19th century clothes and speech. But he just happens to be in possesion of the knowledge that on that particular day on which he finds himself in the sixth century, a total eclipse is going to occur. Of course, 6th century England dosen't know anything about eclipses and thinks such natural occurances are the work of various demon sorcerors or signs of god's anger and so on. Hank threatens to use his powers of sorcery to cause the sun to be completely blotted if they go through with his execution. The eclipse occurs and the people in the court are thus flabbergasted. King Arthur makes Hank his Prime Minister and Hank uses his political powers over the next decade or decade and a half to use his elementary knowledge of late 19th century technology and institutions to reform Arthur's kingdom. He introduces telephones, telegraphs, grammar schools, military academies, newspapers. He tries to reduce the barbaric oppression of the serfs and slaves. He tries to introduce enlightenment ideals in the country. He successfully discredits Merlin, the charlatan court magician, in part by pretending to perform miracles, using his knowledge of electricity and construction of munititions. 6th century England, of course is completely ignorant of all these technologies and so takes Hank's use of them as evidence of his extraordinary supernatural powers. He blows up Merlin's castle. At one popular monestary, the monks and nuns are terrified because the water in their very large indoor pool has been reduced by a large amount. They think the reduction has happened because of God's displeasure with them for engaging in the decadent and self-gratifying act of bathing in the pool but Hank discovers that the water is leaking out the bottom of the pool where some bricks have loosened. He constructs a big scene to reveal his miracle, including fireworks which the people have never seen before and the loud sounds and explosive lights he explains are the evil spirit being expunged from the monastery that was allegedly restricting the water level in the lake. This alleged miracle gives Hank the credibility he needs to convince the monks that they could bathe without retribution from God.There is much critique in the narration from Hank on the social, economic and political conditions in Arthur's England. He reports on the conditon of the serfs. What little income such as from the produce that they create on their own plots, is stolen by taxes and as tribute by the nobility and the church. The feudal lords drive their serfs to starvation, disease and death so that they, the lords can live luxurious lives without working themselves. The lords execute or imprison serfs who get too uppity or refuse orders to have their daughters be sexually abused or often times for no reason at all. Hank works to try to release some of the prisoners, whose minds have all been deostroyed by their experience, in the castles of the nobles. The serfs and the slaves, the vast majority of England's population have been trained by centuries of oppression to be mentally docile. They think they deserve to be slaves and think their oppression is the way things should be. Hank notes in relation to this, how the world has traditionally recoiled at the execution of about 10,000 rich people during the French Revolution's \\"Reign of Terror.\\" But there was an incomparably greater terror which affected hundreds of millions of french peasants who suffered a reign of terror lasting many centuries as they were starved and robbed and worked to death by the aristocracy.Hank tries to introduce the elements of the Enlightenment. He tries slowly and subtly to spread the idea that the English nobility has illegitimate power and that the people deserve to control their own destiny. He tries in the same way to inculate a basic spirit of independent thinking, to undermine the spirit of submission to authority. Hank writes that in his opinion true patriotism is quite the opposite of submission to governmental institutions and the laws. Institutions and laws grow outdated, tyranical and ineffective and people who do not voice their opinion about the need to change such things are not true patriots. He succesfully undermines the barbaric and silly custom of knight errantry--he gradually converts the knights into travelling salesman for soap and the other things he is trying to encourage. He fights a bunch of the nights towards the end of the book while wearing gymnastic tights and using a gun and lasso.The end of the story brings a sort of twist and one fully understands the satire as it relates to Hank's vanity and overconfindence in his late 19th century intellect and technological know-how.This a good story, very well written, intelligent, amusing and every so often something comes up in it that makes you laugh out loud.There may be a few minor mechanical problems with the flow of the story, such as one or two actions not being fully accounted for. The last part of the episode where King Arthur and Hank get taken as slaves is kind of rushed through."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"'Connecticut Yankee' is an excellent political satire still relevant to today's world. Everyone's heard of it, and it's been spoofed many times in film. However, few people have read it and they're missing a treat. Mark Twain is one author whose works consistently remain applicable to modern society. 'Yankee' is funny, interesting and highly worth your time."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Summary:Hank Morgan is a fiery shop boss in the Colt Arms Factory in New England during the late 1800s when he is knocke unconscious by another worker who gets the better of him during a fight. When Hank wakes up, he finds himself in Britain during the 7th century C.E. in the time of King Arthur. As it just so happens, before Hank can be burned at the stake for threatening to blot out the sun, the solar eclipse he predicted takes place and everyone in King Arthur's royal court cowers at his command. Hank is given what was formerly Merlin the Magician's position as chief executive and renamed The Boss. The Boss then begins to reform ancient Britain, introducing dynamite, fireworks, bicycles, electricity, telephones, etc.But, as is only becoming of someone of his rank, he must inevitably go on a quest. It just so happens that a damsel in distress, Sandy, has come a-calling and has a mission for a knight. So, Hank embarks on a journey with Sandy and returns victoriously having saved a pen of pigs that used to be a queen and maidens but was mysteriously transformed, though only Sandy knows this.Hank continues with his plans of reforming Britain, but lets slip another plan to the King that he wants to secretly go among the peasants as a commoner himself. The King likes the idea and signs on. They embark on a series of adventures that end with both of them being sold into slavery and very nearly being hung.Due to a misheard comment several years earlier, Hank is forced to battle another knight who was offended by the remark. In an effort to crush the ancient norms of chivalry, Hank not only battles the knight (using a lasso), but challenges all of the knighthood of Britain. His challenge pays off when he pulls out his six-shooters and lays waste to ten of the knights, the rest breaking ranks and running.After this incident, three years of bounty follow during which Hank's reforms become common place - except in the Catholic Church. Ultimately Hank is deceived by the Church, King Arthur is betrayed by his son Mordred and the greatest knight of England, Lancelot, who has been in love with Guinevere for ages. When all of this comes to a head, both Mordred and Arthur are dead and the nation is without leadership except for the Church.Of course Hank can't let this situation stand. Gathering up his very best men, he destroys his wonderful factories and holes up in a cave. The last of the knights, totaling some thirty-thousand, come against him and 53 of his best men (52 and Clarence). Nearly all of the knights are destroyed. But what Hank and Clarence hadn't considered is what the decaying men's bodies would do to them seeing as how they can't leave the cave.In the end, Merlin, the magician that has plagued Hank since his arrival, sneaks into the cave disguised as a woman and casts a spell on Hank, causing him to sleep for 13 centuries or until his own time again. After the spell, Merlin is killed and the story ends.My Comments:There is no doubt in my mind that Samuel Clemens is one of the greatest writers of all time. This book is not only superbly written, but absolutely hilarious and remarkably insightful. Some of Clemens' insights into humanity are astonishing.The story itself is pretty good, though the ending is a little bit well, open. You aren't sure exactly what happened, though you have a pretty good idea. I would love to read something about 'the writing of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court', it likely draws upon Rip Van Winkle as well as numerous other writers and writings of the day.There is also a lot of commentary about the Catholic Church and its oppressive nature. Whether this is based in early American anti-Catholic sentiment or just plain anti-religious sentiment, I don't know (both are possibilities considering the time period). Perhaps the aforementioned book about this book, when written, will answer that question. I chose to look at it as anti-religious sentiment and thoroughly enjoyed it throughout.Overall, this book is a definite must read for everyone. I recall having read a children's shortened version when I was about ten, but reading in its original form is a treat. Read this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Although this book's concept is no longer novel - one may now even call it clich&eacute; - its \\"time travel\\" aspect was - at least in the sense that it is used in this novel - a fairly new concept in fiction at the time Twain wrote it. No less a science fiction authority than Robert A. Heinlein even goes so far to say that Twain \\"invented\\" the time travel story. Now, this is certainly stretching the truth a bit, but one can see how Heinlein was heavily influenced by Twain from reading this book. This novel's time travel aspect is not used for science fiction; no, it is a purely satirical vehicle. Twain transplants an \\"aw shucks\\", no nonsense American smack dab in the middle of The Dark Ages. By having his character attempt to transplant American ideas of technology, government, and morals into this staunch, backward (anyway, by our standards) British society, Twain is clearly forging an attack upon monarchy - which he once called \\"surely the grotesquest swindle ever invented by man.\\" That said, we see from the devastating ending (which surely no one who has read this book wasn't surprised by) that the book is as much a satire on American arrogance and idealism as it is on the British. One may not always agree with Twain's politics, but one must at least respect them. He also demonstrates in this book the oft-forgotten truism that one's tribal customs are not the laws of nature - and what business do we have trying to force ours upon anyone else's? A devastating satire all around."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is definately a departure from what one might consider &quot;normal&quot; literature, exploring the possibilities of a regular man going back in time to visit the grand kingdom of Camelot. The story starts with a man telling of a fight in a factory in which he was foreman, and how he was knocked out. Upon waking he was in the land of Camelot, though he didn't realize it. Being put up for burning, he used his knowledge of the past to save his skin, using an eclipse to bestow his &quot;magical powers.&quot;This display was extremely impressive for the people of the day, who that main character described as a childish race, always exaggerating tales for their own glory. After being given all the power in the land, next to the king of course, he set out on a quest to bring the land of camelot into the realm of the modern with such things as the telephone and telegraph, the railroad, and steamboats. All these monumental changes in the world were taking place without the general public's knowledge of it, and was gradually being mixed into the culture, in the main character's goal of removing chivalry from the cultural mix.After performing several &quot;miracles&quot; to his people, and going off on several grand adventures, the main character has the church turn on him, and try to bring the entire populous back to its simpler time, of swords, castles, damsels in distress, and the quest way of life. That is where I leave it up to you to find out the rest of the plot, if you really want to read it.In my overall opinion, the book seems to be rushed by Mark Twain, where he tries to mix his general opinions of humanity, his ideas for its future, and just a fun story line all in one, too quickly. The story unfolds hurridly and seems to lack direction at times, and needs a bit more development. A great read if for enjoyment, but don't use it for your overall future plan for humanity, as it is a bit lacking there.This book will likely appeal to school kids in the middle to high school range, because of its fair amount of depth and hidden meaning, but will also enjoy quite a good story, and a fair bit of insight as to what life was like back in the old days. It seems that Mark Twain had done a fair bit of research as to what life was in the age of Camelot before having gone out to write this book. Almost everybody will enjoy this, even if for no particular academic reason. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"&quot;Life On the Mississippi&quot; is Mark Twain's tribute to the Mississippi River, which surrounded the earlier part of his life. Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life. For those who are just getting interested in knowing about Mark Twain's writings, I would recommend reading &quot;Roughing It&quot;; as it is humurous throughout. &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; would be the second book I would recommend."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"What else can be said about Twain except great story. Imaginative work paralleling medieval England with Industrial America in the lat 19th century. Witty, adventurous and well written. I have yet to read a Twain book I disliked."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an intriguing novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. I am a freshman in high school, and I enjoyed many attributes of the plot and writing style. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize it's faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time were very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it be a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way which puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"You think that you would know what to expect from Twain after having read much of his fiction, but that just isn't the case. After having read this book, I am convinced that, had Twain put his mind to it, he could have written about two snails racing and it would have been funny, interesting, and enthralling. I just could not put this book down, as I realized that the only thing better than Mark Twain's fiction is wondering about how real his nonfiction is! Twain's humor never fails him. I have never encountered a book that is so mentally involving, yet so relaxing. I say \\"involving\\" because Twain seems to use just the right words and phrases to stimulate the imagination. My recommendation is to grab yourself a hammock, set it up next to a river or stream, and sip on lemonade while reading and chuckling. This book provided me with a few of my best spent hours on a summer's day that I could imagine. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"To me, this book seemed like several rather disjointed chunks of writing about Twain's Mississippi experience. I don't know what happened. Maybe he compiled all his scraps of material about this period and threw them together, not bothering with transitions or filling in gaps, or smoothing out the narrative flow.In any case, I found the writing delightful and in places laugh-aloud funny. I even typed out several large passages in a letter I was writing to my brother. The letter must have taken me an hour to write but I just had to share those passages with someone. That's how good Twain is. You want to share him with others who enjoy fine writing.I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say this is Twain's finest book. But it is well worth reading and it lays out in detail perhaps the cross section of Twain's life that he enjoyed most."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"My first copy of this absorbing work was a small, compact edition published by the Oxford University Press. I read it by candle-light and found myself borne into another world, transported. In the early chapters, Twain focuses on his introduction to steamboating - he wears his YOUTH on his sleeve, recounting his cub-piloting experiences with the delight of a child. In the latter chapters, set in the post Civil-War era, Twain focuses on his returning impressions - he wears his HEART on his sleeve, remembering the world of his youth, burdened by sweet nostalgia, and a sense of finality and loss. If you have ever been young, you will laugh, and if you have a heart, you will probably shed a tear. No other writer in American literature has so completely combined a genius for wit and humanity. This is one of those rare books that can be read more than once, and enjoyed even more the second time."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"He picks you up off the spot where you are sitting and places you standing on the deck of a Mississippi riverboat in pre-Civil War America. His writing craft is so vivid, detailed, and compelling that you feel as if you yourself have followed each bend and turn, avoided each logjam, and squinted over the bow each starlit night of a journey down the mighty Mississippi River. Additionally, he adds context to the voyage, in the form of digressions about the times, the way peole thought and acted, real items from newspapers of the era, and his own opinions and observations of human nature. It is not a novel. It is non-fiction, but it's writing style makes it as readable as a novel. It was pure pleasure"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Was Twain the greatest writer America ever produced? Certainly no other author has written so many genres so well. Life on the Mississippi is one of my favorites by Twain. What a storyteller! From his own personal experiences to explorers, psychics, the Civil War, slavery, geography, steamboat history etc. Twain gives us a glimpse into himself and his country.Twain is of course humorous in this book, but his lesser known quality--insight--is very keen in this book. Twain's style is at once sophisticated and simple. It is pure mastery.While this may not be up there with some of other Twain's writings, it is certainly worth the time and money. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"It was one of Arthur C. Clarke's laws that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Mark Twain predated Clarke by several decades, but he seemed well aware of the idea behind the law, as demonstrated by his novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.The title character is Hank Morgan, a late-19th-century New Englander who - by a blow to the head - is transported back to Camelot. This is no mere dream, however; it appears Morgan is actually there. He quickly learns that all is not nearly romantic as the tales of Arthur and chivalry might suggest; instead, this is a land of ignorance, violence and oppression.Morgan's technological and scientific know-how makes him appear to be a great wizard, much more respectable than the flim-flamming Merlin. First by taking advantage of a convenient solar eclipse, Morgan is soon elevated to being Arthur's prime minister, and starts a process of transforming Old England into New England. Paradoxes don't seem much of a concern.This novel - one of the earliest time travel stories - is an often clever satire with many targets, particularly slavery and caste systems, economics, religion (particularly Catholicism) and the idea of chivalry. Only the most basic framework of the Arthurian legends are \\"true\\" in this book. Where the book is a bit weak is when it gets too talky; there are also not many interesting characters outside of Hank himself. Overall, this is a good book, but it is not Twain's best."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"\\"Life on the Mississippi\\" by Mark Twain is no doubt a classic memoir from the Civil War generation. Although Twain was smart enough not to remain with the southern armies for more than a few weeks, his life is still very much part of that era. His most famous book, \\" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" (which was inspired by the trip along the Mississippi river described in this book), is considered one of the first books which touches upon the racism of the south and its often backward traditions. Twain's work is unique because he is not a northerner like Harriet Beecher Stowe, heralding the inequities of southern life without really living in that region. Twain was from the border state of Missouri.He certainly embodied the divided feelings of his homeland in regards to the times. As witnessed in the book, there is much reverence and nostalgia for the old south along the river that Twain knew so well, but he is able to poke fun at its eccentricities with a wit that perhaps was Twains defining feature as a writer. The sense of personal conflict is a classic point of reference for most writers to the point of sounding clich&eacute;, but Twain's writing is the model from which the clich&eacute;s are derived.The main impetus behind Twain's journey is chronicled in his pages, which is his comparison of life before and after the war. Just as Huckleberry Finn was written twenty years after the war, this book could have only been composed after a considerable interval of time. It is both Twain's memoir of his life as a steamboat pilot and retrospective of the glory days on the river upon returning there in the early 1880's. The steamboat trade is a shadow of its former self as river commerce had been replaced by the railroads. In these shadows Twain writes of all sorts of tales and memories of each part of the river as he travels along it, often concealing his true identity for the sake of getting objective information. The reader can see right away that there is a fondness for tall tales and exaggerations amongst the river folk, as many romanticize the past. Twain's writing seems quite level headed throughout, as he is able to sort through the \\"river lore\\" and relate the important and practical aspects of river travel to the reader (but that is not to say that he is exempt from embellishing to keep the reader on his toes).One aspect of the writing that I thought interesting was Twain's focus upon the practical details of his early days as a steamboat pilot's apprentice. When many think of Mark Twain, romantic notions of travel and freedom are brought to mind, but Twain's first 100 pages is all about the skills of the trade in an ever changing river. The flawless memory needed for the job was quite impressive and no doubt fed his ability to recall his life's work later on. Many forget the man's practicality, which gave him unique insight into the social milieus that he often lampooned or mocked.The mix of personal memoir and river history is done seamlessly, as Twain's early memories are intertwined with certain portions of the river. Just as an aging man looks upon his youth with fondness, Twain recalls the exciting days on the steamboats, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a youth and culture that have passed into history."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I have always received the best service when I have placed an order from you. Outstanding!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This action adventure drama is a Mark Twain tale of a troubled man redirecting his life the fit the sixth century lifestyle. Written from his pen at the low point of his career, Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee was unorganized, and is unable to hold one's attention.After being forcefully struck on the head by a not so gentle tool, Hank Morgan awakes with the realization that he is not in Kansas any more, in fact he is not in Connecticut either. He opens his eyes as a distraught stranger who has collided with a new age of unworldly elements, known as the sixth century. Coming from nineteenth century America, he is only equipped with confusion and bewilderment. Although throughout his existence in his present setting he learns that he possesses the power of knowledge and experience that he has involuntarily drawn from the well of the future. Stealthily using this to his advantage he quickly works his way up Camelot's socioeconomic ladder he then takes a position among the sixth century's finest.Almost immediately after acquiring his coveted political stature Hank is questioned of his worth. He is challenged with a knightly quest. Adventure arouses when he nobily accepts this journey. On the way he partners with a disarranged, yet flamboyant, long-winded maiden who shares Hank's company, while ruining his silence throughout their quarry. All through Hank's entity in the sixth century he indirectly influences the people with his foreign knowledge, all the while going through life altering experiences that will be impressed upon his mind for the rest of his days.It is obviously shown that Mark Twain was in an unhappy stage of his life while composing this peace. Do not be disillusioned by past reputations. The strong and healthy characters, depthful plots, and striking adventure are absent in this book. The story gave a feeling of gloomy misery, and anger. The climax and conclusion were blunt and quite unsatisfying, leaving the reader not only needing more, but wanting a plot as well. Packed with interesting yet depressing insights to mankind, and the actuality of the often glorified Camelot, the story does leave one thinking. Although all the while giving the reader a stale and dismal reaction. Consistently questioning the reader's interest, this book is graced with an unconcluded and depressing response."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Had Twain stopped after the first section, in which he describes riverboat piloting and his exploits therein, I would have come away with a positive impression of the book. His piloting writings were entertaining and interesting, even though not particularly relevant in today's world.However the later chapters ruin the book. Twain documents his return to the Mississippi with a plethora of miscellaneous descriptions and loosely related anecdotes. These sections range from only mildly entertaining to just plain boring, as Twain doesn't even use his humor to save them.In the end the disappointment of the second half outweighs the enjoyment of the first half."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Mark Twain is a great author, but not here. I liked his \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" and, I've a fine appreciation for the man's sheer wit. \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" is the best short story I had to read in High School. \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is an overblown rant against religion dressed in the trappings of novelization.I found the plot absurd. Twain's barbs against religion were witty, but so over-the-top they interfered with the actual story. I kept finding the novel stupid instead of funny, and pointless instead of witty, especially when 'technology/modern civilization' began dominating the court. The use of detail detracted from the story; extremely overwritten. The main character was an 'expert' on everything, and felt more like an author's mouthpiece than a real man, even a caricature of a man. If you aren't amused by old-style religious slanders, expect a plot, and have read modern time travel stories, you'll hate this so-called 'great' novel.Please feel free to discuss in the comments rather than giving me rage-unhelpfuls because you disagree with my opinion.

It certainly doesn't have any of the silly plot devices of Finn, like reintroducing Tom Sawyer into the final part. And while literature professors talk of how radical Huck Finn was for its condemnation of slavery, I believe A Connecticut Yankee is equally radical for its condemnation of capitalism.

While reading his explanation I found that I quickly got bored and tried to hurry through that part. There were a few other chapters like this, but for the most part I thought the story fast paced and quite enjoyable. I would recommend this book to anybody who is a fan of Mark Twain, and who have time on their hands. This is harder reading and the book has 316 pages. This is definantly a classic that people ought to read if they get a chance."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential. As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones. Anyone wanting supplemental material will need to look elsewhere, but this will do well for most, as the text stands very well on its own."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541. He then discusses in great detail his training and early career as a steamboat pilot before the Civil War, and the accompanying science of navigating the river. Mastering the river in Twain's time was a mind-boggling achievement - it required the memorization of the entire river from St. Louis to New Orleans, and this monumental task was complicated by the Mississippi's tendency to change its course constantly. Later in life, Twain and some companions traveled on a steamboat from St. Louis to New Orleans, and he discusses in great detail how the riverboating industry (as well as industry in general) has changed.

He then discusses in great detail his training and early career as a steamboat pilot before the Civil War, and the accompanying science of navigating the river. Mastering the river in Twain's time was a mind-boggling achievement - it required the memorization of the entire river from St. Louis to New Orleans, and this monumental task was complicated by the Mississippi's tendency to change its course constantly. Later in life, Twain and some companions traveled on a steamboat from St. Louis to New Orleans, and he discusses in great detail how the riverboating industry (as well as industry in general) has changed.

Twain wrote such travel literature classics as\\"Innocents Abroad\\", \\"Following the Equator\\", \\"A Tramp Abroad and \\"Life on the Mississipi.\\"Life on the Mississippi was published in 1883 shortly before Twain's greatest novel \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" was unveiled to readers in 1885. In Life on the Mississipi\\" Twain sets out to travel down the long river. Twain (born Samuel L. Clemens) was born near Florida Missouri growing up in nearby Hannibal nestled next to the great river. As a boy he dreamed of becoming a steamboat pilot. As told in the autobiographical chapters of this book he did become one in the years prior to the Civil War. Twain was an apprentice pilot working under the expert tutelage of Horace Bixby. Twain had to learn every inch of the river from St. Louis to New Orleans and back. He left the river to join the Confederate Army. After a few weeks he left the army for the West where he began to write as a newspaper reporter gaining fame for his short humorous sketches.Nevertheless, Twain also wanted to see the river once again. In Life on the Missisippi he sketches the variious towns along the river such as St. Louis, New Orleans, St. Paul, Natchez, Vicksburg and Memphis. He tells tall tales about clever card sharks, grisly murders, Civil War battlesand American Indian legends. His brother was killed in a steamboat explosion and Twain recounts this sad tale. The highlight of the book is his return to Hannibal where he remembers his childhood and what has become of all the children he played with as a boy. There is even an excised chapter from Huckleberry Finn which Twain added to this book.Life on the Mississippi is will live as long as American literature. Mark Twain is the Lincoln of our Literature. The book is a joy to read of a distant day when the steamboat was king of the river!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I thought this was agreat book because it has time travel and all the stuff about King Arthur and Merlin. It was kind of cool because he tried to change how it was in midieval times by adding all this electric stuff like phones and lights and other modern stuff from his time, into the past. He tried to change them entirely to a new government and basically a new place. The ending was different from normal books because it didn't end well. It had a twist to the ending."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"A fan of Mark Twain and a fond reader of Prince and the Pauper, I recommend this read for children's classics series. Though not for a supplement read in the classroom, undoubtedly the book is a great read as you meet the characters:Hank Morgan, the Connecticut YankeeClarence, a page who become Hank's right hand manMerlin, the King's magicianKing Arthur, King of EnglandKnights of the Round Table - Sir Launcelet, etc.King's wife, an evil queen Fay, an old abbot, etc.Having spent his boy hood in a town in Mississippi, Mark Twain is one of the America's greatest and most beloved writers. In this book, Hank Morgan wakes to find himself in King Arthur's England. The Yankee uses all his scientific knowledge to be a Chief Minister in the King's Court. He outwits the magician Merlin and gracefully win the kingdom. There are exciting chapters like the Ogre's Castle, The Yankee and the King sold as Slaves, Yankees fight with the knives, in merlin's cave. Was it a dream and did he get back to Connecticut - You got to read the book. Seriously, if there were no video games or the television shows, kids would have loved to read these classics or rathar listen to the adventure tales like these. A good read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable, easiest reads you will ever find, and yet it may also be the most intellectual of all American novels. That Twain has managed such a mix is further proof of his crowning genius.The story revolves around Hank Morgan, a modern American businessman who is transported back in time. He is shocked by the backwardness, ignorance, and poverty of Arthurian England and decides that the people there deserve a \\"new deal.\\" (This novel is where FDR picked up that phrase)The novel is mostly comic, occasionally tragic, and consistently compelling as it follows this quixotic scheme to its ultimate conclusion. The plot reveals Twain's brilliant insights on the nature of freedom; the trade-offs involved with economic development; America's role in world history; the interplay between capitalism, religion, and tradition; and the tragedies of history, without ever tipping his hand as to what Twain himself believes.And, of course, it is hilarious. The Yankee's misery while wearing armor, his bafflement at chivalric customs, and the bizarre contrasts between his modern innovations and the medievel world make for regular laughs. No other author could make his readers think so hard while laughing so hard.Recently, this book has gained an added resonance, as Twain's take on the Americanization of a traditional culture can be easily applied to our current projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. Twain ends his book with a violent insurgency against the Yankee intruder, and horrific bloody tragedy. Hopefully our project will not end in the same way."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The best work by Twain I've read to date. This combination history, memoir, travelogue, and collection of sketches is both humorous and entertaining. I have also learned a great deal about Twain, his time, and the history of steamboating and the Mississippi. Written later in his life, this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Twain has a way of taking something that we commonly idealize and shooting holes all through it. Where Letters From Earth took aim at religious belief, this time its Camelot. This is a good satire although not as strong as Letters which is a five star multiple reading kind of book.In Connecicut Yankee, the author runs across Hank Morgan on a tour of Warwick Castle. They \\"fell together as modest people will in the tail of a herd being shown through\\". Morgan, however, has an uncommon familiarity with the objects shown and he eventually ends up relating the story of a Connecticut Yankee to Twain after a few hot Scotch whiskeys.Morgan, it seems, after a crack on the head, found himself transported back to King Arthur's time. After being captured by Sir Kay and being delivered to the Round Table as a trophy, Henry Morgan asserts himself as a master magician over Merlin and sets himself up as \\"The Boss\\". He then begins to secretly initiate improvements and reforms such as setting up a clandestine WestPoint, installing telephone lines, starting manufacturing centers and training journalists - all the while balancing the Church and the traditional castes of the country. A misheard comment lands him scheduled to duel Sir Sagramore but is postponed for Sagramore's crusading stint. In the meantime and in preparation for the undetermined date of the duel, Arthur assigns Morgan to the aid of a young girl who comes to the table claiming that a number of princesses are being held captive by ogres. From there he goes on to \\"magically\\" fix the Holy Fountains, a spring to which people pilgrimage but has stopped flowing and then, with King Arthur in tow, attempts to travel as a commoner and lands in a world of trouble after he and the King are taken as slaves. It is a fun story with a lot of humorous situations. This is why it is recommended to young readers, I suppose.However, Twain's biting sarcasm makes it a good book for adults too. His antecdotes are vehicles for pointing out the absurdity of the concept of nobility, the probability that the belief in ogres and magicians meant that the people of the time were largely ignorant and gullible. And in their ignorance, they are cruel. Time and again we come back to this theme. But, back to the sarcasm. For example, one of his methods of getting rid of knights is by turning them into traveling salespeople of various household sundries!Additional meanings, interpretations, etc. are explored in the afterword and, honestly, unless it had been pointed out I would not have caught it at all. I didn't see this as a treatise on the nature of man although, once explained, I saw that that was there. I enjoyed this simply as a light satirical story."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"In the novel, A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court, Mark Twain shows the differences between modern society, and sixth century Great Britain. Hank is a self-assured factory worker who knows how to make just about anything. The protagonist, is mysteriously transported back to the sixth century, when struck in the head by a crowbar.He uses his vast knowledge of explosives and metals to quickly become a leader in the monarchy. His democratic thoughts and ideas become his ambition as he strives to make Great Britain a republic. Twain's novel shows how much of a change society has gone through from the sixth century to the time of the writing of the novel. He also show's how little education anyone received in the sixth century, even the members of royalty are not very wise. Hank's mediocre education is far superior to anybody's in the whole monarchy, because of the advances in education to the present.Twain shows that the laws of the sixth century were made for the few against the many. At one point a woman is put to death for stealing just enough food to feed her baby. Hank tries, throughout the book, to get the royalty to realize how unfair their laws are to the common man.This book makes you feel angry at points about the horribleness of the monarchy, yet ashamed because similar acts still go on in the present. An example would be how the rich and privileged still get the best of everything, while the have-nots get the last and worst of everything, both now and then. Twain has a comic sense in the book, and yet he still shows a contrast between the comic and the serious. This book should be a classic for Twain's creative portrayal of the sixth century, yet also because it makes us think about our society today."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Twain's account of his years on the Mississippi is part travel book, part memoir, and part historical work, with a few sketches, stories, and tall tales tossed in for good measure. There is even an outtake from the not-yet-published \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors. This smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book, but much of it shows Mark Twain at his humorous and humanistic best.The kernel of the volume (and its best, most cohesive section) is in chapters 4 through 17; this material appeared in the Atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s. His adventures as a young man are fraught with danger, full of comedy, populated by a number of ornery, mischievous, and reckless characters, and occasionally embellished (although Twain is a bit obvious when he's fobbing off a yarn). As Twain later wrote in \\"Puddn'head Wilson, \\"if there was anything better in this world than steamboating, it was the glory to be got by telling about it.\\"After he published the series in the Atlantic, Twain added another 46 chapters; much of it an account of his homecoming (incognito--or so he'd hoped) to the Mississippi River in 1882, when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad. Many of these descriptions are unusually (for Twain) melancholy; he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous. His new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion.The material from other sources, unfortunately, tends to bog things down--and there are about 10,000 words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices. Twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents; he also included travel writing from earlier visitors, primarily Europeans distracted by how Americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty. (You almost get the feeling that Twain would have smacked \\"the once renowned and vigorously hated\\" Frances Trollope upside the head if he'd had the chance; she provides Twain with the most interesting, if snooty, descriptions of traveling along the Mississippi early in the century.)The material Twain wrote, however, more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff. As always, he is quotable, witty, amusing, and provocative. In spite of its excesses, nobody has done the Mississippi better."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Who hasn&#65533;t heard of King Arthur and the knights of his Round Table? Along with Robin Hood, the tales of King Arthur are the most exciting tales that British history has produced &#65533; tales of grand chivalry, as gallant knights in shining armour rescue damsels in distress, and fight for courage, truth and justice. But were the knights really so noble and courageous? Through the eyes of a nineteenth century Yankee (Hank Morgan) who goes back in time to King Arthur&#65533;s sixth century court, Mark Twain suggests that the sixth century wasn&#65533;t quite so glamorous. Here&#65533;s a taste of his delightful humour: &#65533;As a general thing &#65533; as far as I could make out &#65533; these murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were simple duels between strangers &#65533; duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other, and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever.&#65533; Twain compares it to boys going at it on the spot: &#65533;I had always imagined until now, that that sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign and mark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond. Yet there was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted creatures, something attractive and loveable. There did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait a fishhook with; but you didn&#65533;t seem to mind that, after a little, because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that, and, indeed would have marred it, spoiled its symmetry &#65533; perhaps rendered its existence impossible.&#65533; (p16) As for the quest for the Holy Grail? &#65533;The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then. It was several years&#65533; cruise. They always put in the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way, though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was, and I don&#65533;t think any of them actually expected to find it, or would have known what to do with it if he *had* run across it ... Every year expeditions went out holy grailing, and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for *them*.&#65533; (p54)Sound wickedly funny? Hank Morgan doesn&#65533;t stop there with his nineteenth century heroic arrogance. Using his superior knowledge of solar eclipses, blasting powder, reading and writing, and electronics, he soon becomes The Boss who single-handedly helps sixth century Britain take a short-cut to nineteenth century civilization. Chivalry becomes a thing of the past, and the knights of the Round Table are converted to more worthwhile endeavours as baseball-players and business men &#65533; some commissioned on more nineteenth century style quests as &#65533;missionaries&#65533; to advertise soap and toothbrushes on sandwich boards. It helps, of course, that the magician Merlin is a faker and con-artist, and that hero Hank can do much more impressive &#65533;miracles&#65533;, which are nothing less than elaborate scientific stunts with blasting powder and cement. Camelot soon finds itself with a functioning telephone system and newspaper. All is wonderful, until our hero is commissioned to go on a quest to rescue forty-five princesses locked in a castle by three ogres. He discovers that being a knight isn&#65533;t as glamorous as it&#65533;s made out to be, because you can&#65533;t even use your handkerchief, and you get dust in your nose. Along with the dim-witted King Arthur, Hank&#65533;s plan to walk around in disguise as a peasant backfires when they are nearly executed as rebellious slaves, rescued only when Launcelot and the boys arrive in the nick of time - on brand new bicycles.Twain&#65533;s irreverence in dealing with the beloved Arthurian traditions garnered him a great deal of criticism at the time of publication. Yet as the peels of laughter fade, it becomes clear that Twain is using his humor to make a very serious point. Is he merely critiquing the vices of medieval feudalism and warning against over-sentimentalising the past? If he is critical of King Arthur, surely it is not a criticism directed at the monarchy or the noble virtues that the knights of the Round Table pursued, but rather at the vices of an unbalanced class structure. Or is Twain using a comparison between the sixth and the nineteenth centuries to make an argument for or against the scientific machinist age of the nineteenth century? It is clear that the protagonist &#65533; the first person point of view used by Twain to embrace the reader in sharing his convictions &#65533; embodies one set of ideals and arrogantly looks down on King Arthur who embodies another set of ideals. The sixth century holds fast to the concept of greatness and position being attained by birth, whereas the nineteen century has little reverence for rank and file, replacing it by a respect attained by achievements alone (p46ff). Morgan is sharply critical of injustices created by the medieval class structure, where people are slaves to &#65533;King and Church and noble&#65533; (p74ff), and is especially negative towards orthodox Christianity (specifically the Catholic church), feeling it safer for power not to be concentrated in one single organization (p56,108). He also mocks the simplistic medieval beliefs in the supernatural, and his own scientific &#65533;miracles&#65533; appear to be a reflection of nineteenth century liberalism and atheistic philosophy, where beliefs in supernaturalism were exiled through the advance of scientific naturalism, and where the Christian God was dethroned and replaced by science. The failures of the faker Merlin appear to be symbolic of the failure of medieval supernaturalism, since it is Morgan&#65533;s scientific knowledge that can perform the true miracles. What Twain unconsciously shows is that faith in natural science is just as much a religion as faith in supernaturalism, because the protagonist doesn&#65533;t convert King Arthur&#65533;s court to naturalism. By projecting himself as a supernaturalist, and taking advantage of King Arthur&#65533;s court ignorantly attributing his scientific miracles to the supernatural, Morgan proves to be just as much a political manipulator as Merlin or the established Church.I cannot believe that Morgan is totally a mouth-piece of Twain, or that Twain uses this work to advocate Protestant America over against Britain, since Twain was in fact an opponent of American imperialism. It is true that eventually Morgan proclaims and defends a republic with electric fences, revolvers and dynamite, exterminating the whole chivalry of England and replacing it with American imperialism and technology. But in the end it proves to be a hollow victory, with Morgan on his death-bed having second-thoughts about his technological achievements, and speaking about medieval chivalry with emotional longing and passionate love. The nineteenth century symbols prove to have the same destiny as those of the sixth century &#65533; they are conquered and die. Is Morgan&#65533;s death a symbol of the fate of the Western machine age, and is Twain asserting that nineteenth century American arrogance over earlier civilizations is misplaced, because it will share their destiny? The final cynicism in which the novel ends can not be overlooked, and is a suggestion that society&#65533;s optimism and faith in technology and science are misplaced because these can never improve humanity. Twain&#65533;s disenchantment with technology and progress is a reflection of the failures experienced in his own life: science in the end is not mankind's god or saviourTo get maximum enjoyment and understanding of Twain&#65533;s humour, I highly recommend reading a version of the Arthurian legends before Twain&#65533;s parody. He occasionally quotes Malory&#65533;s fifteenth century classic &#65533;Morte d&#65533;Arthur&#65533; &#65533; deliberately assigning a very different context and meaning to what was originally intended. To appreciate the conventions and ideals he is mocking, a read of Malory is essential, such as the English rendition produced by Sir Frank Knowles.It&#65533;s a brilliant concept, and makes William Goldman&#65533;s farcical and popular &#65533;The Princess Bride&#65533; look like inferior literary fodder for kindergarten kids. Not only is it funny, but there&#65533;s a great deal of depth beneath the surface, which Twain uses to convey a great deal of seriousness. Yet even while critics argue about just what it is that Twain is being serious about, there is no doubt that this is thoroughly enjoyable and humorous work, just as enjoyable today at the end of the twentieth century as when it was written at the end of the nineteenth. It is not so much the dark and serious underlying tone that has made this work a classic but Twain&#65533;s brilliant humour, creativeness, and story-telling."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The perfect counterpoint to Le Morte d'Arthur. The Arthurian legends are wonderful tales but they are mythic literary productions. Mark Twain gives them a good old-fashioned strapping out behind the outhouse. With the Connecticut Yankee as our guide, we have front row seats on everyday life in Arthurian Britain: White slavery, le droit de seigneur, confiscation of property in event of suicide, nonexistence of impartial justice, the (unintended) degrading influence of Catholicism on the masses, immense ignorance, superstition... And that's just day one. But Mark Twain will never leave you stranded in a dark hell hole. Oh no - brilliance, mirth, and devastating common sense are always surrounding you on any journey with Mark Twain. This book is classic Twain: Funny.A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is chock-full of brilliant Twainisms. My favorite is his observation that a conscience is a very uncomfortable thing to have, and the significant difference between a conscience and an anvil is that, if you had an anvil stuck inside you, it would be a lot less uncomfortable than having a conscience. And Twain clearly concurs with Tom Paine that the English nobility were \\"no-ability\\" - simply the latest in a perennial series of robbers making life miserable for everyone and doing all in their power to hang on to power. A fine modern treatment of this theme is Ken Follett'sThe Pillars of the Earth. Twain also mentions the beautiful mispronunciations of childhood, and how the bereaved parental ear listens in vain for them once the child has grown.You'll never look at castles the same again (and I suspect the Dark Ages will never know what hit them)."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Mark Twain, the most globally recognised of the greatest American writers, comes closest to autobiography in this odd and fascinating book. This is the story of part of his life at least, and lays out much of his unique moral and political philosophy.As a book, Life on the Mississippi lacks a truly coherent story line after the half-way point; it tells the story of Twain's training as a Mississippi steamboat pilot, then, when he returns to the river years later as a successful writer, it drops off into anecdotes as Twain travels down the great river, and can be a deadly bore for some readers.But, oh, what a picture of Twain it draws! There are great tales of characters he meets along the river, told in his inimitably funny style, wonderful bits of his childhood - like the tale of his insomniac guilt and terror when the match he loans a drunk ends up causing the jail to burn down, killing the drunk - and insightful portraits of the towns and villages along the river.This is a characteristically American book, about progress and independence as well as the greatest American river, written by this most characteristically American writer. It is a true classic (a thing Twain despised! He said, &quot;Classics are books that everybody praises, but nobody reads.&quot;), a book that will remain a delight for the foreseeable future."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"&quot;Life On the Mississippi&quot; is Mark Twain's tribute to the Mississippi River, which surrounded the earlier part of his life. Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life.

It began quickly and I was easily intrigued by the author's usage of vocabulary and his extraordinary ideas. He began in such a way that one could not put the book down and I found myself staying up late in the night just to finish that one last chapter. Yet, as I continued reading, my mind began to wander from lack of interest. The book became a little redundant and it was hard to concentrate on reading. I fell behind in my reading schedule because I was unable to stay focused on what I considered to be boring text. Luckily, as I kept reading, the plot began to thicken once again. I was again caught up in the story. The last third of the book proved to be an interesting one. I kept reading even when I knew I had to do other things. My mind stayed with the book even when I wasn't reading. I believe that the character development was done extremely well. You get to know the characters and you know how they feel. Even before someone speaks, you know what their reaction to the situation will be. This is a sign of a very well written book. A book where one can feel the characters' feelings is one that is easy to read. Not in the sense that the text is easy, but it is easy to stay interested in the book. It is beautifully written as a whole. Yet, through the middle it becomes more of a technological book. The inventions created are thoroughly explained. I found that thoroughly boring. Although it was interesting to know what was being created, I wasn't interested in a step-by-step process as to how it was being made. I recommend this book to a more mature audience. Not because of any obscene situations, but because I believe it would be too hard to comprehend before the age of twelve at the youngest. Not only would it be hard to comprehend, but it may be quite boring to those under that age. Of course, it depends upon who the person is that is reading the book. Yet, generally I believe it would be most fitted for older teens to adults. Their ability to comprehend and appreciate the writings of Mark Twain would help to make this book an interesting one to read. All and all, I would generously recommend this book. It is a novel that not only interests you, but keeps you thinking as well. The plot, along with the style of writing, is well thought out and keeps you turning the page each time. Although at times it can become a little boring, for the most part one would find this novel enjoyable. One can probably find it at any local bookstore, any library, or even purchase it on the internet. If you are looking for a good book to read, then I would suggest that you pick this one up today."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"While a bit strange, _Yankee_ makes some interesting points about both medival and modern life. Twain makes some interesting commentary on technology, honor, and human nature with characters that cross a millenium."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading this book. I laughed outloud frequently as Twain poked fun at 6th century England and in turn, 19th century England. Beneath the thick sarcasm, though, were many profound issues such as freedom of religion vs. an established church, democracy vs. monarchy, and the corruption brought on by absolute power."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"It was an entertaining book, at least in parts, but left me cold compared to some of Twain's other books. One thing that bothered me was that it supposedly takes place in the sixth century, but the characters speak quasi-Elizabethan English; the language spoken then would have been nothing like English. Twain also maligns the Roman Catholic church (it causes the downfall of the nearly 19th-century world the Yankee has built up), but England was only beginning to be converted to Christianity, if that. These may be minor points, but I don't think a satire of England of old has much bearing on modern America. Can one expect the world of 13 centuries ago to be like the world of Twain's day or ours?"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"While the critique of the weaknesses of Arthurian society are obvious, this is a really remarkable book for its critique of Twain's (and perhaps our) America. The ending can be seen as a prophetic warning of the consequences for war of the adoption of modern technology. Even Twain's accounts of the problem of instantly democratizing a traditional society seem remarkably current to today's efforts to bring our political system to Eastern Europe, etc. This is no teenage science fiction novel, but as usual with Twain, a book with many meanings and insights."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This book is not a &quot;good&quot; book, in that it fails to achieve its supposed purpose (which is to deprecate chivalric romance). Yet the sheer fascination of this incredibly poigniant failure is enough to keep me returning! It nothing like the &quot;cute&quot; kids versions and movies that it has inspired. Prepare for a vitriolic horror-ride that seems to prove nothing but man's futility--i.e., welcome to Twaine's latter period. Mark Twain's work of psuedo-realistic phantasy is perhaps the most marked and fascinating failure in literature. In the novel Twain sets science and technology against chivalry and romance. Twaine attempts to overthrow a thousand years of fuedal and romantic tradition by means of scientific and economic efficiency. Yet (without revealing too much) in the end the Yankee must praise the romantic hero King Arthur; has used the very superstitions he disdains to dupe the people; come to love an archetype of the simple medieval personality he despises; and, amazingly, has threatened to destroy an entire civilization. In the end the only thing the Yankee proves is that modern man is far too arrogant for his own good, and that it is all too easy to become the villain you hate. So what was Twaine's point? Supposedly to prove the vast superiority of the modern age over the Chivalric Age. But did Twaine actually believe his utterly amazing ending carried out his task? I doubt it; I think the book is a classic example of Twain's disbelief of everything.

What can I say? The title of this review pretty much explains it all. Yet, odds are it could just be me. It is most likely that my complaints are based on opinion, as there is not too much fact within the topic of the quality of literature. The story, which is a clich&eacute;-spawner (more on this later), is about a \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" who is not properly named for most of the plot. In the preface, the Yankee, mostly referred to as \\"The Boss\\", is clonked on the head by a crowbar and miraculously wakes up over one thousand centuries prior. Medieval Times soon turns to be a harsh place for the Yankee, instantly reducing him to the status of a slave. By using his prior knowledge of the date of a solar eclipse, he convinces the higher powers of the land (and everyone else in those times), that he is of magical roots. It is here that we witness one of the biggest thematic sequences of the book. The Yankee is befuddled by the nave nature of the English population, and as an effect, continues to take advantage of this facet of medieval life. The Yankee himself is a very clever character, as we first see with his usage of the solar eclipse, and then again when he \\"MacGyver's\\" together a lightning rod and gunpowder to exterminate Merlin the Wizard's tower. Actions such as this could be easily compared to the antics of Twain's other character, Huckleberry Finn. The Yankee goes through several years with trying to conduct Industrial change years before any such events would have occurred. The push for change continues when The Yankee takes on a quest to help a woman by the name of Alisande, or Sally. On a quest to save a number of maidens, they happen upon two ordinary peasants. Eating breakfast with them, The Yankee questions them about the idea of a more modern democracy, planting the seed for rebellion. The climax of the novel comes when a Tournament with a knight ends with The Yankee displaying his future weaponry in the form of a revolver, in which he uses to shoot his opponent and 9 other knights dead. In turn, he reveals his underground 19th century movement upon the world. In efforts to not give away the ending, I'll stop there. In my opinion, the plot here is one of random events that all concur to the same centralized theme. While this sounds fine in theory, the actual execution of such a technique is hardly appropriate. I found novels such as Huckleberry Finn much more approachable and I was able to enjoy it more, as the plot was much more rich and fun. I would probably recommend this book to someone looking for a satire of history, more than someone looking for a story with a fantastic plot."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This novel tells the story of Hank Morgan, a 19th century engineer from Hartford, Connecticut who through a strange turn of events finds himself in the 66h century England of King Arthur. He is almost immediately captured by a knight upon his arrival in the 6th century and taken to Camelot where he learns he is to be executed in a couple days time. Using his superior modern wit to escape the situation, hank sets out on a grand process of introducing 19th century technology, know-how, education, and values to Arthur's realm.The novel is filled with many humorous moments as is apt with other fiction from Twain but there is also a distinct dark side to the story that becomes ever more apparent. The impact of the past with the present (at least at the time of writing) results in the dismantling of the romantic view of the past while simultaneously reveals the faults in the belief of scientific and social progress. The England of Arthur is depicted as one where the people, although not generally subjected to the institution of slavery, are for all purposes the equivalent of slaves. The \`freemen' of the day have no rights whatsoever and are subject to the whims of a nobility whose only entitlement to rule is blueness of their blood. The Church is similarly depicted as repressing force against the mass of humanity. The protagonist Hank struggles endlessly to awaken in the people a sense of social justice and outrage at being treated as dirt by their noble lords. He is constantly frustrated in his attempts though and concludes that the level of indoctrination is so deep in the people that only large structural changes and the rise of a new generation will provide the seeds for a revolution to overturn the existing order.Hank Methodically sets out to accomplish just such a revolution by starting clandestine centers of education and industry, all the while keeping an eye on the Church so as not to have his program disrupted. With the introduction of modern technology and education, \`progress' moves along at a steady pace. But with all the advances to society also comes the capacity to disrupt and destroy as much if not more. In seeking to replace the controlling ideology of the Church, Hank inadvertently sets up a rival ideology that demands the complete submission of the people as well.Twain's criticisms of the 19th century become all the more apparent when applied against the backdrop of an age unrecognizable to ours. It is rather amazing that the problems he confronts, free market capitalism, mechanization of war, political ideologies, confidence in a historical progression towards a better society, would all come to the fore in the 20th century as pressing questions confronting a world with the ever growing capacity to destroy itself. The novel stays true to Twain's pessimism concerning his day and the \`damned human race' ends with a truly terrifying scene. All good novels have to concern themselves with themes that go deeper than the mere story that they tell. Twain certainly does not disappoint with this effort."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"How is it a book written 120 years ago can still be so funny?

This book clearly reflects that from the beginning to the end. Twain is a riverboat captain, and travels up and down on the Mississippi river, seeing cities such as New Orleans, Memphis, and St. Louis. He describes his experiences in very lively fashion to the extent that the reader can very well imagine what river travel was like in Twain's time. It should not be forgotten that river travel at that time was commercial and an essential way of getting back and forth. And Twain makes the reader feel that riverboat travel was lots of fun and very adventurous even at that time. The book is a valuable contribution to history in that Twain accurately describes what has happened and what the events mean for those who live in that time period. Personally, I feel that this is one of the best books I have ever read.

Not so much a text on the content of the codes themselves as an examination of the many particular questions that relate to the codes - questions that Sapan saw as subject to misunderstanding on the part of his Tibetan contemporaries - The Three Codes has a strongly polemical character. Thus it is easy to see why some readers found the work objectionable in places, others praised it, and all have become fascinated by it.

It's author Raymond Chandler (1888-1959) is a poetic master of hardboiled noir crime fiction. His metaphoric and colorful language; fascinating characters and sparkling prose make Chandler an American original. His works leap the high wall between mystery fiction and true literary art.The High Window opens at a house in the Oak Noll Section of Pasadena. An obese, obtuse and cruel double widow with the name of Elizabeth Bright Murdock has called Marlowe to her home. The grotesque woman wants Marlowe to locate a rare coin known as the \\"Brasher Doubloon\\" which belonged to her late husband. The doubloon has been stolen. Murdock wants Marlowe to locate her former showbiz girl daughter-in-law Linda Conquest whom she suspects is guilty of the heist. Linda has been recently divorced from Lester Murdock the weak little Uriah Heepish cipher who is Mrs. Murdock's son. Marlowe also meets the intriguing Miss Merle Davis who is the virginal secretary of Mrs. Murdock. What lurks beneath the surface? Who stole the coin? What dirty secrets are being hid from the eyes of the police? Answers await as we join Marlowe on a dive into the inferno of sin which lies at the belly of the beast of Los Angeles.This is the opening scene in a novel filled with all the twists and turns we expect in a Chandler novel. Along the way there are three murders as wheel spins within wheel in the shady, cruel, cynical and convoluted morality of the characters inhabiting the Chandlerian universe.We remember Chandler for his skill in realistic dialogue and word paintings of Los Angeles and its 1940s environs. The plots are hard to follow and forgettable.

That, perhaps, is Chandler's greatest talent--he makes his world inviting while never pandering to prurient or common tastes. In A High Window, Philip Marlowe, Chandler's famous American icon of cynicism and subtle honor, is tasked with finding a rare coin and the person who stole it. His client is a bossy, asthmatic, hulk of a woman who downs glass after glass of port and who doesn't mind telling Marlowe her low opinion of his character and skills. Of course, she's wrong. And she's hiding all sorts of secrets of her own. As in all Philip Marlowe adventures, the ride is always more fun than the destination. When you read Raymond Chandler, you're lovingly dumped into a landscape filled with bums, dames, rich psychotics, corrupt cops, and sleazy hotel managers.

But in THE HIGH WINDOW, Marlowe is on the ball. He takes a job for a wealthy, twice-widowed matron, to track down her missing daughter-in-law who, the matron believes, absconded with a precious gold coin from her deceased second husband's collection. The widow's son, abandoned husband of the missing woman, is in the dark and wants to know what gives. He chases Marlowe, as does another detective who is apparently on another, related case. Marlowe out-slicks these guys, along with a semi-tough actor-turned-gangster and his menacing bodyguard, managing to figure out what it's all about, with the murders piling up and the cops breathing down his neck. He even uncovers a murder he wasn't supposed to and proves his good-heartedness in the process by straightening out a very unhealthy family situation. Although he continues to down his liquor as he pushes through the mires of this case, it feels more like social drinking this time, rather than the obsessively self-destructive bingeing seen in the earlier novel. In fact, though Marlowe's employer may be dissatisfied with the result of the investigation she has initiated in a moment of pique, we are not, for he solves the crime he was called in for and sets things that have been very much askew to rights in a most un-Marlowe like manner, leaving matters better than he found them, despite three murders and a darkly tangled familial history. -- SWM"},{"Title":"The high window","review":"Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe detective stories, while never dull, can sometimes have almost hysterical, over-the-top plots which become terribly confusing to decipher. Fortunately the cracking dialogue and bizarre characters compensate nicely. In The High Window the author takes a breather, and delivers a story which is relatively simple ... and enjoyable to read.Like in many Marlowe stories, our naughty private eye is hired by a rich recluse. This time the recluse is a rich widow who believes her trashy daughter-in-law has stolen a rare coin inherited from her deceased hubby. As Marlowe investigates we understand that the daughter-in-law keeps some rather nasty company, and before long Marlowe is tangled in multiple homicide situation. Of course in the end it is all resolved in a surprisingly uncontrived way (..at least by Raymond Chandler standards).My only real complaint, or rather disappointment, is the general absence of Marlowe's normally razor-sharp sarcasm. In other books Marlowe can be extremely brutish with the ladies, and the ladies all fall in love with him. In The High Window we do not see this side of Marlowe, and so he seems somewhat two-dimensional in this story.Bottom line: most definitely not a Chandler classic, but certainly a very enjoyable read.

The situation is this--something of value has been stolen from her, and she suspects the culprit to be her daughter-in-law, the item in question being a very rare and valuable coin known as a Brasher Doubloon.Mrs. Murdock didn't know the coin was missing until she received a suspicious phone call from a dealer named Morningstar making inquiries as to whether the coin was for sale. The thing is that any reputable dealer would know the coin isn't for sale, per the stipulations of the late Mr. Murdock's will. Then she checked and found out the coin was missing. She figures it was an inside job, as those are the only people who would have access to it. Mrs. Murdock wants the coin back, but she doesn't know where her son's wife went--plus she wants a divorce arranged. Marlowe agrees to take the case, and is handed back to the secretary to get his retainer--along with a little information, some voluntary, some not so. He learns that Linda Murdock, formerly Linda Conquest, once roomed with another girl named Lois Magic. And he learns that the secretary, Merle, has quite a thing, in her own quiet way, for Mrs. Murdock's son, which includes keeping his monogrammed handkerchief in a drawer, as well as a small caliber pistol.As Marlowe leaves the Murdock residence, he notices a sand-colored coupe that seems to be following him. But he could be wrong about that.Marlowe returns to his office, and while he's thinking about the case, he receives a visitor--Mr. Leslie Murdock, the son. He's trying to find out why Marlowe's been hired, but the PI is too cagey to divulge that bit of information. Murdock reveals more than he learns--namely, that he still loves his wife, and that he is into a guy named Morny for some big money, maybe twelve grand. Marlowe sends him on his way, and calls up Morningstar, making an appointment to see him at his office at 3 o'clock.He can't find Lois Magic in the phone book, so he uses a connection to learn what he can about Morny. Turns out he married Lois Magic. Small world indeed. He gets an address and heads over there, but the hired help say she isn't at home. Well, there's more than one way to do things, so Marlowe does it his way, and finds out from the chauffeur that Mrs. Morny is indeed at home, in the backyard, along with Mr. Vannier.Marlowe runs into the sand-colored coupe and its driver again, and confronts him. The guy breaks down and admits he's been following Marlowe. His name is Phillips and he's also a PI, working a case. Maybe they can work it together, since the cases seem to be related. He makes a time for Marlowe to come over to his place, and just for insurance, he gives him a key, in case he arrives first.Marlowe shows up, but it's too late for Phillips.And he's only the first stiff.Fake coins, missing wives, cheating wives, terrified secretaries, and a body count that just won't quit. All in the job description for Phillip Marlowe.The High Window is the third book in the Philip Marlowe series. I liked it as much as I did the others. Chandler has a way with words that is truly unique, and he paints a vivid picture of the times and the people, drawing memorable characters. I like that Marlowe has layers, and we see more and more of those layers as time goes on. In this story, he's a real gentleman. We already knew he was honest. The story has all the ingredients of a good mystery--dead bodies, people with secrets, lies, and mysteries. I look forward to reading the next book."},{"Title":"The high window","review":"THe Brasher Doubloon has been stolen, only Mrs. Murdock a wealthy window wants it found.

Marlowe works for a cantankerous old lady who hires him to find a stolen coin. Of course, it turns out to be much more complicated. Marlowe is tough but also a nice guy, and amazingly, he doesn't get 'coshed' over the head in this book!! (I was afraid it was getting to be a predictable pattern, haha...)I'm enjoying these Chandler mysteries because he weaves a plot complicated enough to keep me guessing. I usually don't catch on until the last 20 pages or so. I hate when I figure things out too quickly, and that hasn't happened with Chandler yet."},{"Title":"The high window","review":"Even with all the years long gone, Chandler is still the best. The High Window may not be high profile, but it's still top of the game. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The high window","review":"Having read The Big Sleep and Farewell, My Lovely, I dove eagerly into the next Raymond Chandler novel in queue. The High Window offers the standard Chandler fare of murder, blackmail and general malefaction, though its characters don't form quite as well. Philip Marlowe, the archetypical 40's investigator, is reliably entertaining, but Merle Davis, the flighty personal assistant of Marlowe's client, is so neurotic she defies description. Ultimately, she also defies the plot.It's important to point out that I appraise in relative terms. The author's previous novels were so entertaining that even the slightest Chandler misstep would resound. But, Merle Davis is a difficult proposition to get past and she eventually becomes the heart of the story.Still, it's an engrossing story and, while it might not hit the heights of previous efforts, it is classic Raymond Chandler: 40's-era LA, mystery and menace, and a cunning private eye. Because of this, it deserves to be read. 4 stars."},{"Title":"The high window","review":"I love Raymond Chandler. And Marlowe, the joke cracking private eye who's tough on the outside and golden on the inside and who would be cliched except he's the original everyone else copied...it's vintage noir, hard-boiled action, the world without frills, a trail of murders and blackmail and robbery. It's flawed the way America's underbelly is flawed but it's always clear where Marlowe's sympathies lie...with the poor, the lost, the wicked, the desperate doing all they can to get out of poverty's trap. But he takes everyone as he finds them and gives them their due. It's a fast-paced quick read with suspenseful twists and turns that spin you through an L.A. that is still recognizable, and definitely the L.A. that I love."},{"Title":"The high window","review":"Phillip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's classic noir hard-boiled private detective forever literarily associated with Los Angeles and its means streets is right at home here in his search for a missing family heirloom thought to have been 'taken' by an errrant family member. As always there are plots within plots and it is many a false lead and bump on the noggin' before the intrepid Marlowe puts this one to rest. As usual there is plenty of sparse but functional dialogue, physical action and a couple of plot twists, particularly around the motives of the parties involved. And where does this novel stand in relationship to the other Marlowe epics? Give me those background oil derricks churning out the wealth while looking for Rusty Regan in Big Sleep or the run down stucco flats in pursue of Moose's Velma in Farewell, My Lovely any day.

The book is classic Chandler: beautifully descriptive prose almost wasted on the seedy characters that populate the storyline. The plot kicks off with a wealthy but crotchety old woman hiring Marlowe to recover a valuable gold coin she is sure was stolen by her now missing daughter-in-law. As Marlowe learns more about the matter, a young guy starts tailing him, then admits to being a fellow private dick who might need Marlowe's help with a case. Soon that guy turns up dead; in fact, throughout the tale Marlowe has a nasty habit of finding dead bodies, which only serves to exasperate the police, whom our leading man tends to frustrate by refusing to part with what he knows about whom.In the end, of course Marlowe figures it all out, but not before some surprises bend the plot this way and that. [We won't spoil what the novel's title implies...] One would not suspect this novel is some 60 years old; that it so readily entertains is certain testimony to its withstanding the aging process. Chandler's fine writing skills, bordering on literature, as usual tend to create a screenplay in our heads for us, which adds to the enjoyment.

Chandler called this practice &quot;cannibalizing.&quot;Chandler actually put aside the third cannibalized novel, &quot;Lady in the Lake,&quot; to work on &quot;The High Window.&quot; It's plot is only slightly less convoluted than the other three early novels, and it is slightly contrived, but what is interesting is the way in which it deliberately re-emphasizes concerns developed in its predecessor, &quot;Farewell, My Lovely.&quot; Chandler was pressed to make sense of a detective with so much cultural capital and the ability to turn such a fantastic phrase, and in these two novels the emphasis is on developing Marlowe's class animosities and his determination to preserve the free-agency afforded him by his vocation. He comes across as a relative high-brow determined to take out his sense of failure on those who pretend to be his betters, and who employ him, but who are phonies. It is a novel about class and about Marlowe working to control the exploitation inherent in hiring himself out.It may not be the best of the early four novels, but &quot;The High Window&quot; provides a clear and deliberate vision of Chandler's original conception of Marlowe. After the hiatus in Hollywood, he would begin to loosen the detective conventions and develop Marlowe as a man in existential crisis (in &quot;The Little Sister&quot; and &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;)."},{"Title":"The high window","review":"Raymond Chandler wrote 4 noir novels in the late 30s and early 40s that defined the Southern California hardboiled thriller forever after. I first discovered them 41 years ago and instantly fell in love with them. The High Window, though, I thought at the time, and through several subsequent rereadings, was by far the least of the four. I hadn't reread it in at least 20 years now, but, based on some of the favorable Amazon comments, I read it again yesterday. My opinion of it, I'm sorry to say, hasn't changed in 41 years....Why do I think it's only a mediocre book? Forty-one years ago I couldn't have articulated it. Now, however, it's obvious:Because, basically, it's a boring story.As an earlier reviewer in these columns told us, The High Window was the only one of the first 4 Chandler books that was plotted as an entirety and not cobbled together from earlier short stories that Chandler had written for the pulp magazines. This, however, instead of being a virtue, actually turns out to be the major fault in the book.Philip Marlowe, the first-person narrator and hero, is as beguiling as ever but the story he tells -- basically the search for a missing coin of great value -- is dull and listless. Each individual character is nicely sketched, as only Chandler could do at the height of his powers, and the writing sparkles and pops. But -- and this sounds strange but is absolutely true -- the story itself could equally well have been written by Agatha Christie with Hercule Poirot as the main character. An investigation is mounted; the detective moves from one character to the next; a couple of bodies are discovered; the detective exchanges banter with the police; he talks with a few more characters; he wraps up the case and tells us who murdered whom -- probably.There is no menace directed at Marlowe, there is no suspense, there is no interest in finding out what is going to happen to any of the other characters, there is no action at all (unless you can call finding a couple of bodies action), and the plot itself is pretty dull if you stop and think about it for a few moments.Why is this?The short stories that Chandler wrote in the 30s for the pulp magazines (mostly Black Mask, I believe) were just that: pulp stories. They had action, violence, movement. Things happened to Marlowe (in his various incarnations) and Marlowe made things happen to other people. Guns went off, Marlowe got bopped on the head, he -- and other people -- were frequently in danger for their lives.When Chandler cobbled these stories together into three of his first four novels, he brought all of these elements into the freshly created books. Guns fired, Marlowe was bashed on the head, locked up in padded cells, beaten up by crooked cops, menaced by *real* gangsters. There was danger and suspense -- even if you (and Chandler) didn't always know exactly what was happening or who was doing what to whom -- or why. Chandler's exquisite writing and marvelous evocation of Los Angeles of that time was laid over these pulpish elements and transformed these gothically plotted books into literature. But literature that was exciting and impossible to put down. What *is* going to happen next in The Lady in the Lake? And why? And how is Marlowe going to get out of *this* predicament? In these three books you really want to know.In High Window there are none of these elements and the only reason you turn the pages is because of the wizardry of Chandler's writing and the picture he draws of 1941 Los Angeles and Pasadena during a few hot summer days. Here the cops are more friendly than threatening, all violence is off-page, the semi-gangster nightclub owner and his supposedly deadly bodyguard are minor characters who manifest nothing more than a few lines of tough-guy dialogue -- which then disappears when Marlowe is hired by them to do a job....The transportation back to this vanished era of South California is well worth reading this book for (at least for me); but as a thriller up to the standards of the other early Chandlers it is simply a non-starter.Beware...."},{"Title":"The high window","review":"The High Window is a fast paced, intricately plotted story inhabited by an abundance of interesting and colorful characters.Once again, Raymond Chandler has succeeded in painting very vivid pictures of the various locales depicted with his unique brand of highly descriptive prose. A relatively short novel, The High Window is packed with page after page of interesting twists and turns, memorable characters and sharp dialogue.Hard-boiled detective Philip Marlowe is, as always, hard drinking, wise cracking and supremely self confident. A walking, breathing paradox, he adheres to a very high minded code of honor when it comes to protecting client confidentiality yet is not above tampering with evidence.What starts off as a rather mundane search for a missing rare coin quickly becomes much more complex. Murder, blackmail and the psychological abuse of a vulnerable young woman all play a role in the compelling plot. This novel should appeal to all fans of detective fiction as well as to those who appreciate good writing regardless of subject matter."},{"Title":"The high window","review":"After jumping into the mystery-genre spotlight at the age of 51 with his classic first novel THE BIG SLEEP, Raymond Chandler went on to write six other novels which received considerably less acclaim than they deserved. THE HIGH WINDOW, published in 1942, sees Philip Marlowe, perhaps the most hard-boiled of all classic hard-boiled detectives, searching for a stolen rare coin and once again involved in the sordid affairs of the Los Angeles underworld, dealing with wealthy widows, tall blondes, showgirls, cops, and hitmen, and handling each in turn with the panache that only Marlowe could. Exquisitely plotted and written, THE HIGH WINDOW, like the rest of the Chandler library, is noir and the hard-boiled detective novel at its finest."},{"Title":"The high window","review":"Raymond Chandler's \\"The High Window\\" is catchy; far more so than any similar novel penned by Mickey Spillane or James M. Cain. It has all the noirish elements needed to be a great read: a rare coin is the perfect MacGuffin; a sultry, adulterous blonde provides the jaded sexual appeal; an emotionally-abused young lady is the damsel in distress; a psychotic villain is flawlessly despicable and the labyrinthine plot is well-nigh impossible to predict until the very last page.The above having been said, this well-written novel is not without its faults. My three qualms lie with what essentially was the waste of a spectacular character (Eddie Prue), the retread of \\"The Big Sleep\\" formula and the lack of suspense.Addressing the first qualm, a subtle tension builds between the one-eyed Eddie Prue -- an emotionless bagman -- and wise-cracking Marlowe for the latter half of the novel. This mounting tension is left entirely unresolved and, thus, is dissatisfying.The second qualm is that the Mrs. Murdock character seems to be carbon copy of General Sternwood from \\"The Big Sleep.\\" They share far too many characteristics: a very wealthy recluse, physically disabled, world-wearily disillusioned, hampered by ailments, grim outlook, wayward offspring, etc. It seems that Chandler could have fleshed her character's uniqueness out just a tad more.Lastly, the lack of suspense throughout the novel may bore the casual reader. If it was not for Chandler's lively prose, I would have nodded off. The only time in which I was worried as to Marlowe's well-being was when he first hears Prue's voice in a very well-written piece.Despite these trivial flaws, it is a first rate novel and well-worth picking up."},{"Title":"The high window","review":"I decided to give this Raymond Chandler novel a shot after a vexing round of midterm examinations. If I didn't read something light and entertaining, my head would have exploded! I'd never read noir before, but I found this book to be pretty representative of what one pictures when one thinks of noir: seedy characters and snappy dialogue in a big, dark city teeming with danger. Chandler apparently gave new life to this genre when he wrote a few (an unfortunate few) crime novels starring Phillip Marlowe, a private detective who has since become immortalized in film and T.V. Chandler didn't even start writing these books until he was in his late 50's. Thank goodness he did write them, because this book is a real hoot!The High Window finds Marlowe on the trail of a missing coin called the Brasher doubloon. Within a few pages we begin to see an endless parade of seedy and suspicious characters, such as Mrs. Murdock, a port-drinking hothead who hires Marlowe to find the coin. Other characters include a scummy nightclub owner, a couple of dirty dames, and a cast of supporting characters both wicked and wise. At the center of it all is Marlowe, doggedly pursuing the truth through all the deceits and danger. I really can't go into the story because doing so would probably ruin the suspense for anyone who hasn't read the book. Just be prepared to see some wacky characters and great scenes.This book wouldn't be worth mentioning at all if it weren't for the dialogue. The language in this book is so clever and snappy that it literally makes the story. You'll howl out loud at some of the smart quips Marlowe tosses off as he tries to track down the doubloon. Another interesting aspect of the book is that everything occurs in the present tense. There is almost no history to know or anything in the future to worry about. This makes the story scream along at a fast pace; so fast that you won't want to put the book down. I never really thought I'd care for crime noir, but this book makes me want to read more! Recommended."},{"Title":"The high window","review":"To be honest, it seems kind of silly giving this book only four stars. If you compare it to the vast majority of hardboiled or detective novels ever written, it would deserve five stars. It is only when it is compared to Chandler's other books that it falls short. This was his third novel, published after THE BIG SLEEP (which started the vogue for starting books and movies with the words \\"The Big\\") and FAREWELL, MY LOVELY. In none of those books is plot and story as important as Chandler's exquisite prose, his wonderfully detailed descriptions, or his magnificently decadent characters. But even so the plots of those two look brilliant compared to this one.The number of problems with the plot of THE HIGH WINDOW is legion, but I'll highlight only two. Chandler wants Philip Marlowe to discover a body. There are a million ways to do this, but instead of something elegant and simple, Chandler creates incredibly unlikely scenarios whereby the future corpse gives Chandler a key to his apartment so that he won't be forced to wait around if he somehow doesn't happen to be there. This is such a cheap device that it is almost as if Chandler were trying to parody storytelling. Perhaps even sillier is a bizarre gun swap, in which the killer goes into a nearby apartment, finds a gun under the pillow of the tenant, and switches it with his own. Much of the subsequent story hinges on the strange gun swap.So, as an example of plot, THE HIGH WINDOW is a failure. Nonetheless, there is still the prose. Although Chandler is unquestionably one of the most imitated writers in literary history, no one has quite been able to match his power with words. Marlow enters a club. \\"A check girl in peach-bloom Chinese pajamas came over to take my hat and disapprove of my clothes. She had eyes like strange sins.\\" He prepares to question someone. \\"From thirty feet away she looked like a lot of class. From ten feet away she looked like something made up to be seen from thirty feet away.\\" He describes the residents of Bunker Hill: \\"Out of the apartment houses come women who should be young but have faces like stale beer; men with pulled-down hats and quick eyes that look the street over behind the cupped hand that shields the match flame . . . people who look like nothing in particular and know it.\\"And there are the characters. Though the best characters in THE HIGH WINDOW are not as memorable as the many, many memorable characters in THE BIG SLEEP or FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, there are still several so striking as to not easily slip out of mind.But substandard Chandler or not, he is one of those writers so brilliant and original that he deserves to be read in toto. One should read not this or that novel, but all of it, short stories included. He is one of the few writers to have played a major role in shaping our culture as a whole. But besides that, his books -- even the lesser ones -- are just a great, great read."},{"Title":"The high window","review":"Having read a lot of Raymond Chandler through the years and now, finally going back and re-reading everything with a more widened perspective on the genre, The High Window easily stands out as his finest work.The High Window, unlike a lot of genre Private Detective stories, which so many other authors have spent lifetimes struggling to copy and coming up short, keeps you guessing until the very end. Some authors give you a nibble about half way through a story and it falls apart in your lap and you figure it out. The High Window defies that solidly. You will be guessing about this one until the very end. Nothing is done ham-handedly or over-quick just to wrap it up either. This book could serve as a role model to other authors about how to write an ending, as I'm sure it has -- even if you don't write Detective Noir fiction.If you're reading this review and a certain Humphrey Bogart film brought you here, and you don't know much about Raymond Chandler, just know that he was and is considered one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century. During his lifetime however he was dismissed as just a regular struggling hack novelist, because of the Genre, and not given a lot of attention. A lot of other authors, like Philip K. Dick for instance, another Angelino, suffered greatly under this prejudice during their lifetime because of supposed conventionalities. Sometimes, looking back you just have to wonder if it really was a West Coast prejudice, where anything outside of the New York circle of authors was thought worthless, or the critics just didn't have enough insight into life. Probably both.The High Window moves very quickly, very smoothly, never misses a beat or falls flat for a single page. Chandler did drink a lot and it sometimes shows in his other novels, but with this effort you can see a lot of genius, planning and careful, methodic work ... just like the protagonist Philip Marlowe working a case.The dialogue is as witty as Farewell, My Lovely and the wisecracks are even sharper than The Big Sleep. This book is also absent of the one problem that I have Chandler and that is his disconnection of information from novel to novel. Some of his stories never mention a single word about anyone or anything from his other books, however, in The High Window, I underlined five direct references to his other works. These are nice touches and just things I like, because it's like going to a friends house and being able to recognize the furniture. The Little Sister does a better job with bringing out a familiar cadre of Policemen, but this book is seriously where it's at.The main thought regarding the story though is all about protection of the client and their anonymity. Marlowe knows that if he has to turn over and talk, he's pretty much out of a job. This is a story about just that and Marlowe goes to great lengths to protect that trust and Chandler does a deft job in making it a subtle undercurrent throughout the book, giving The High Window a sort of 'Moralist' back-drop. While he takes on only one paid client, it feels as if he makes an exercise in proving that his word is his bond with just about everyone he meets.Personally, this is easily my favorite Chandler novel to date.There's a few youtube links in the comments regarding some documentary footage concerning Chandler as well a Chandler interview with James Bond author Ian Fleming, where Chandler states that he believes himself to be one of the greatest living American writers -- and Fleming agrees. Fantastic stuff...."},{"Title":"Madeleine Takes Command","review":"As a lover of historical fiction and a student of colonial North America, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

With her parents away, it is up to 14 year old Madeleine de Vercheres and her two younger brothers to lead the defense of a small outpost against a surprise Mohawk attack. Based on actual events, this book gives us comfortable moderns a harrowing glimpse into the rough and perilous past.The characters are charming, sympathetic, and perfectly in keeping with those real people described in the Jesuit Relations and other primary sources of the time period. Though Madeleine is truly a courageous figure, at no time does she become \\"Xena, warrior princess,\\" performing impossible feats of physical strength. Instead, she is able to preserve the family homestead with quick thinking, tireless energy, steady resolve, self-denial, an optimistic spirit, and devotion to family.This Bethlehem reprint is attractively presented and includes a dozen or so illustrations. It's perfect for kids ages 10 and up, and also an enjoyable read for an adult. It makes great supplemental reading for the study of colonial North America and is highly recommended to homeschooling parents."},{"Title":"Madeleine Takes Command","review":"I was very impressed with this book. The story is strong, exciting and not a bit sentimental or over done. Madeleine is a wonderful heroine.MADELEINE VERCHERE'S story is based on a true account of colonial French Canada of the 1690's. 14-year-old Madeleine is left alone with two younger brothers at the Verchere family's fort and few others when the Iroquois Indians attack. We follow the brave and determined stratagems of Madeleine and her small circle.The qualities of courage, self-sacrifice, familial love and devotion abound. (Doesn't the mere mention of those chararacter qualities make you feel desperate for our current generation??)Usually at the end of a book I'll say &quot;yea, that was a good book but I would change this or that to make it better&quot; I honestly can't think of anything I would change in this master re-telling of Madeleine Verchere.I wish Ethel C. Brill had written a dozen other books. She is a sharp writer and this is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Madeleine Takes Command","review":"Madeleine Takes Command was originally written in 1946 and is based on the true story about a 14 year old girl and her two younger brothers as they defend their family fort on the St. Lawrence River against an attack by the Iroquois.The story starts out in the fall of 1692 with Madeleine's father away in Quebec and her mother leaving to conduct business in Montreal. Madeleine is left in charge of her family's seigneury. A seigneury was a piece of land given in New France - Canada - belonging to the French King and managed by landlords. Tenant farmers called habitants farmed the land and paid taxes to the seigneur (landlord) assigned to each parcel. As Madeleine's mother states when embarking on a canoe to leave, \\"...one cannot put much trust in strange soldiers...That's why there must always be some member of the family left in charge.\\" Even though Madeleine is only 14, as the eldest child of the seigneur, she needs to remain behind to keep an eye on things. Her two younger brothers, 12 and 10 years old, stay with her. One thing that struck me about this book was the level of responsibility put on the shoulders of such young children, and yet they were fully capable and trustworthy.Madeleine was left in charge of 10 militiamen as well as the seigneury's habitants. When the Iroquois attack and kidnap or kill all but two of the militiamen, Madeleine is left with her two brothers, an 80 year old retired soldier who is her family's servant and the two remaining soldiers to guard the remaining women, children and the fort itself. The two soldiers turn out to be cowards who threaten to blow up the fort rather than be taken alive by the Mohawk Indians. Madeleine now not only has to manage the fort's defense, she also has to manage these two men who are a liability and unable to be fully trusted. Eventually she is joined by an additional man and his family who narrowly escape capture as they arrive via their canoes on the river.Over the course of a week, the small band manages to keep the Indians at bay through a combination of sheer determination, wits and teamwork. Staying up for days on end with only short naps, the group makes it seem as if the fort is well guarded and filled with many more people than it really is. Madeleine proves to be a resourceful commander and is obeyed without question, despite her youth or the fact that she is a young woman (I say woman because she is most definitely not a child). Even her ten year old brother has an important part to play in the fort's defense and turns out to be a better man than the two adult soldiers who are nearly useless.Madeleine and her brothers were portrayed very realistically. They were afraid and yet brave. Certainly not perfect, you can see them struggling in various areas. Madeleine is a good leader. She isn't some super hero. Instead, she relies on those around her and very capably assigns them duties based on their various temperaments and abilities. Her quick thinking and devotion to do the right thing is the reason for her success, not her physical strength. The others around her all show different strengths and weaknesses. There is the wife of Monsieur Fontaine who lies around crying in the blockhouse all day and solid, dependable Nanette who makes sure the fort's defenders are well-fed with a hearty stew and yet doesn't question or argue with Madeleine when told NOT to come out at night, even though she wants to help. She sets an example for the other women and children. There is Louis who, though he disagrees with Madeleine at times, bends to her will even when conflicted. Little Alexander, who is scared out of his wits and honestly admits it, manages to hang on through the long nights, exhausted but courageous and determined to help in any way he can. There are also the adults who obey Madeleine's commands. Recognizing that there can only be one leader, they LET her lead. Any conflict in this area could mean the forfeit of all of their lives. They follow the chain of command, even when it would be easy to take it over themselves.We read this book for our history studies (Guesthollow's Awesome History Timeline Schedule) and learned a bit about French Canada and the dangers faced by colonists during this time period. The book also briefly mentions William of Orange, King of England and the conflict between England and France which was played out in the colonies as well. The Indians are portrayed as savages, however the Christian mission Indians turn out to be the saviors of many of the fort's captured farmers. This is not an overtly Christian book, even though it's published by Bethlehem Books. It does mention prayer as well as Madeleine finding brief comfort in her fort's chapel. It's clear that Madeleine's family are Catholic as there is mention once of thanking the \\"Virgin\\" or something along those lines. The book also portrays how things were run in New France and what steps were taken to fight the Indians in order to secure the colonist's land. It's clearly presented from the European side, with very little sympathy towards the Indians.The book itself has 18 pen and ink illustrations that are old-fashioned and perfect accompaniments to the story. My favorite is on page 175 where it shows Madeleine resting her head on her arms on a table and sound asleep, when all she meant to do was get a quick bite to eat. The rest show pictures of things like the Indians, the colonists running into the fort, etc.While the book isn't my favorite writing style, my son found it to be engaging and looked forward my reading it out loud each night. While so many modern books have heroes with characteristics I would NOT want my son to emulate, I didn't find that to be the case in Madeleine Takes Command. This was a great choice for our history studies with a good dose of character training to boot. Madeleine Takes Command does this double duty with a heavy splash of adventure and a generous telling of history. It's a perfect book to read when studying the late 17th century and I highly recommend it for either homeschool studies, or just for your child's home library. My young, teen son rates it a very enthusiastic 5 stars."},{"Title":"Madeleine Takes Command","review":"I found the book written in a way that brings you back to the time of Canadian colonization.

Each brought our own guidebook but we quickly ditched 3 of them and used the Fodor's.

It's all you need if you're going on an organized tour, where hotels and meals are taken care of, and you really want some flavor for the people, food, history and culture. Scattered throughout are sections called &quot;Focus On&quot; discussing the mistral (both the wind and the poet!), ecology, cuisine, and of course wine. The maps are unusually good too. But the hotel and restaurant lists are cursory at best, and if you're an independent traveler you'll want to supplement this book with more comprehensive information. For this well-traveled part of the world the internet is a great resource. No one guide has it all!"},{"Title":"Ninja Shadowhand: The Art of Invisibility","review":"History abounds with groups who sought to wrap themselves in secrecy and stealth. In the Dark Ages of Northern Europe \`wolfshirt warriors' (Ulfhednar) the stealth oriented companions to the dread Berserkers; the Knights Templars, an order so secret that their history is still debated; the Cult of Assassins (Hashishin); and of course Japan's elusive Ninja all practiced the \`Art of Invisibility'. The Japanese Ninja became so adept at collecting and perfecting methods of stealth movement and fighting that theirs became a martial art unto itself.In Ninja Shadowhand; The Art of Invisibility, Dr. Haha Lung and Christopher Prowant explain the basics of seeing. We learn how our eyes work, and gain an understanding of how shape, silhouette, movement, and color effect what we see and what we don't see. We also learn about point of view, obscuring a foe's perspective, and psychological blind spots.After explaining how we see the authors show us how we may apply this knowledge in martial arts applications. This is explained through the basic application of ukemi, misdirecting attention and disguising movement.Ninja Shadowhand then mentions \`shadow weapons' such as the yawara (short stick), manriki (10,000 power chain), shuriken (throwing star), and application of modern hidden weapons such as the handkerchief, lapel weapons, and walking sticks.Ninja Shadowhand will not turn you into the invisible man. Embracing the attitude and application of Ninja Shadowhand will not guarantee you perfect safety, but what it will do is sharpen your character and hone your wits providing you with an edge your enemy lacks.In the words of Sun Tzu - \\"Ethereal, a master leaves no trace to be seen, mysterious under Heaven, he leaves no sound to be heard. By these two, a master seals his foe's fate."},{"Title":"Ninja Shadowhand: The Art of Invisibility","review":"An excellent overview of Shinobi Ninja shadowhand (taisavaki-jutsu) techniques, this book has great practical application for any who study the martial arts.

The methods of invisibility discussed and detailed in a very \\"how to\\" manner work extremely well and can be rapidly learned. Moves are explained by narration, schematics, and body drawings.It appears that some of the other amazon reviewers are looking for either an historical review of Ninja tactic, or a cartoon parody. This book is neither. Rather, it is for those who seek a primer for invisibility, disguising or misdirecting attention, and shadowhand striking styles. \\"Avoid being seen... Seen, avoid capture...

Ninja ShadowHand, Knights of Darkness, and a well written book by Peter Jenkins called ADVANCED SURVEILLANCE:The complete manual of Surveillance Training. I don't think I need to explain how all three of these book tie in together. These 3 books are my pride and joy, so to speak. I refuse to get rid of any of one of them.

The difference was not subtle. The Lonely Planet version is beautifully color coded, for easy navigation, while Mr. Steve's book is simple black and white. Lonely Planet is a tiny bit thicker, but is overall smaller in size (nice for your pocket).Mr. Steve's provides a small dictionary, lost somewhere in the middle of the book, with no indication of gender, and no assistance whatsoever with pronuncation of said words. The dictionary portion of this book alone, made the guide a complete waste in my estimation.In addition, if I needed to find a word such as \\"expensive\\", it was not in the dictionary portion of the book at all. I assume this is because it was listed in the phrase section under \\"Le Yin et le Yang\\". By the time you figure out what section a word might be in, the tour bus has loaded, and departed for it's next destination!Lonely Planet, and Rick Steve's book are the same price. Don't waste your money on this one!btw: No, I don't work for Lonely Planet!"},{"Title":"Rick Steves' French Phrase Book & Dictionary","review":"I haven't spoken French since high school, & I'm planning my first trip to Europe (including Paris).

Common situations are covered extremely well and are easy to locate in the book. For example, if I needed to ask if a train was direct or was leaving from a certain track, the book easily allowed me to figure out how to say it. One night, I got locked out of a hotel (they locked the doors before 10!) and I was able to use the book to explain my predicament over the phone. The size is perfect too as it fit in the back pocket of my slacks. Rick Steve's books are great and this one is no exception."},{"Title":"Rick Steves' French Phrase Book & Dictionary","review":"Sadly, this book is not up to the standard of Rick Steves' guidebooks. What a shame! Mr. Steves has a really good sense of what information is needed by travelers to ease and enhance their trip. But HIS PHRASEBOOK is a big disappointment. It is FULL of errors! On average, I would say there is nearly one mistake per page. Some are just misspellings, but others are more serious - faulty pronunciations, bad grammar, and even wrong words. For example, in the section \\"A French Romance\\" on p. 199, \\"baiser\\" is given as the translation of \\"to kiss\\". Non, non, et non! Except in the fixed expression \\"baiser la main\\" (to kiss one's hand), \\"baiser\\" IS NOT USED with this meaning! It's a vulgar word for \\"copulate\\", equivalent to our \\"to screw/lay/f__k\\". If you want to say \\"to kiss\\" in French, you use the word \\"embrasser\\". Oh l&agrave; l&agrave;, quelle erreur! One can only imagine the repercussions if one used this word when asking permission to kiss someone good-night...And it struck me, if there are that many errors in the French I know - Lord only knows what's lurking there in the expressions I don't know! I have seen enough to convince me that the French in this book is not to be trusted.In addition, Mr. Steves doesn't see fit to let the reader know whether words (nouns) are masculine or feminine, not even in the dictionary section. And 9 times out of 10, he doesn't indicate what the masculine and feminine forms are to accompany these words. So how can one hope to do anything other than butcher the French language with this book?It's true that you can probably make yourself understood with Mr. Steves' phrasebook, even with all the mistakes. But that's putting the bar pretty low, isn't it? When you buy a phrasebook, don't you expect something a bit better than the equivalent of \\"I go now, and he go, too\\"? If you're new to French, you'll probably make enough bloopers on your own, without an additional helping from Mr. Steves. Get yourself a phrasebook that gives you accurate French, such as Berlitz, or Fodors (sorry, I'm not familiar with the Lonely Planet phrasebook).I am saddened to think that neither Mr. Steves nor his publisher thought it necessary to have this phrasebook/dictionary proofread or vetted by a French person. It appears from the mistakes Mr. Steves makes that he has picked up the language by traveling and talking to people but has not undertaken any systematic study of the language. How could anyone who has had even one semester of college French say the equivalent of \\"I have already to finish\\" when they mean to say \\"I have already finished.\\"? Surely then it is irresponsible, if not downright arrogant, to assume that Mr. Steves' command of French is good enough to be used as a model for others to copy. Oh, l&agrave; l&agrave;! Quelle horreur! Quelle triste histoire! All the potential usefulness of this book has been thrown away through its slap-happy approach to grammar, spelling, and vocabulary."},{"Title":"Rick Steves' French Phrase Book & Dictionary","review":"Great book! Highly recommended. Easy to use, easy to find the topics you need when you need them. The phonetic words are easy to understand, and are spot on with the real corresponding word (with some other phrase books I have tried, the phonetics were not quite right). There are phrases for real situations, even some funny situations, covering everything from being pulled over by police in your rental car to dealing with pushy street venders (which are abundant in Paris! - which came in handy for us when at the Louvre!). There is a menu and food decoder which we referred to quite a bit so as to know what we were ordering to eat. With this book, we were able to communicate easily everywhere we went: the metro, the train station, eateries, museums, grocery store, and even in the countryside where hardly anyone speaks English.My Spouse and I were in France last month and I had purchased this book weeks ahead of time and began reviewing the phrases inside. By the time we got to France, we both had learned enough to communicate nicely with the people. In Paris, there are a great many people that speak English, or at least understand it a bit, but it's still nice to be able to say something to them in French even if it's just a greeting. But we stayed in the countryside where English is rare, but we got on just fine at the grocery store, the villages, and the cafes with this little book in hand. The easy to use words and phrases are great in a pinch, but as a helpful tip: Don't just buy the book and wait to use it until your there standing at a ticket booth trying to figure what to say - familiarize yourself with the key phrases that are important to you, and where they are located in the book before you even get on the plane."},{"Title":"Rick Steves' French Phrase Book & Dictionary","review":"I don't give negative reviews on items I've purchased very often, but here goes.When we bought this book, along with one for Italian, we thought they were great and very user friendly. This was before we actually arrived in France and Italy and really had to use them. When you're in actual situations where you need to find words and phrases fast, this book doesn't cut it, at all. The simplest of words I tried to find in the dictionary weren't there so I quickly went searching through the various sections trying desperately to find necessary words for the simplest of things like directions, traveling, etc. Amazingly, even though these phrases are the most important to use, the ones we needed, the words actually being used at the train and subway stations, weren't to be found. It was a waste.I finally started using Google translator to put in the phrases I needed, and wrote them down. These worked much better than this book and we were able to do much more. Plus, I didn't have to spend time trying to find the right section, and the right spot where a certain phrase might, or might not, be found.The book might be useful before you leave, to start to learn pronunciation, etc., but you could probably borrow a book from the library and learn the same thing.

I couldn't find it in the book although I knew I had it seen it there when I reviewed it the night before. I gave up and muddled through. That night, I found the French alphabet pronunciation list in the \\"Sleeping\\" section of the book. IMHO, something as basic as the alphabet should have been in a section in the front or back cover or in the tear out 'cheat sheet' for quick and easy reference. At least, it should get its own section that is clearly identified in the Table of Contents rather than being listed in small print under the \\"Sleeping\\" topic.To me, that's the perfect example of how this book was virtually useless in the field.There were no good maps of France (in general) or Paris (in particular) or any other city. (I'm guessing many people complained about this issue and that's why the newest version (2010) alludes to a map in the title.) The only maps were crude, gross, hand-drawn outlines of the world, France, America, etc. that were useless for virtually any real-world application.There was NO information on verb conjugation rules so, if you know something about the language, this book won't help you extend your knowledge and construct complete, proper sentences.So much space was consumed by phrases that might (or might not) apply to your exact situation that there was nowhere near enough room for a decent French/English and English/French dictionary. I rarely found a specific word I needed in the dictionary sections. Also, the dictionary section doesn't indicate whether a noun is masculine or feminine so, even if you do find the word you're looking for, you don't know how to use it in a sentence. Finally, the dictionary offers no pronunciation help.We found the European train system to be very confusing as to ticketing requirements and this book was, yet again, useless in that area. Some of the information seemed to be wrong. For example, the book refers to using a bank to change your US Dollars into Euros. In our experience, there were no banks in Paris or Cannes that allowed that. Instead, we had to use money exchange stores we found.I also had the Italian version of this book for use when we were in Italy and it had the same problems.Although I can tell the author put a lot of work into these books, frankly, I don't see any real use for these books in the field and I simply cannot recommend them.

Pekacz's Music in the Culture of Polish Galicia, 1772-1914 (University of Rochester Press).The Prize committee - Izabela Kalinowska-Blackwood, Andrzej Tymowski, and Halina Filipowicz - wrote the following about the winning volumes:Both books are exemplary monographs based on meticulous archival research. Both provide an important point of entry for exploring a lost symbolic world in a rather out-of-the-way place, at least in geopolitical terms: the multiethnic province of Galicia in the Habsburg Monarchy. Ezra Mendelsohn's elegantly written book concentrates on the work of Maurycy Gottlieb, a founding father of modern Jewish art, who was born in a small town known in Polish as Drohobycz, now associated primarily with the internationally acclaimed writer Bruno Schulz. Jolanta T. Pekacz's study addresses an understudied area - popular music genres in nineteenth-century Galicia - within a well-informed historical framework. In examing their topics, both Mendelsohn and Pekacz also tell us much about the multiethnic society of nineteenth-century Galicia - about its social tensions, divisions, and hierarchies, and about about its strength and fragility.Mendelsohn's and Pekacz's studies not only expand our knowledge and understanding of the social and symbolic world of old Galicia, but they also challenge our tendency to think of culture - any culture - as a static and homogeneous entity (if only to make it possible to talk about it). To do justice to the complexity of their project, both Mendelsohn and Pekacz keep alive several perspectives, chief among them the perspective of cultural studies. They show that, contrary to a common misconception, cultural studies are not primarily concerned with banal populism. They agree that all forms of cultural production need to be studied - not as self-contained and independent entities, knowable apart from their own time and place, but rather in their particular historical contexts. They also agree that the perspective of cultural studies offers fresh insights into the underlying importance of literature and the arts in the formation of national identities.Ezra Mendelsohn's Painting a People: Maurycy Gottlieb and Jewish Art and Jolanta T. Pekacz's Music in the Culture of Polish Galicia, 1772-1914 are highly original studies on the cutting-edge of several disciplines: social history, history of ideas, cultural studies, Jewish studies, Polish studies, and Polish Jewish studies. Both books offer the rare intellectual pleasure that goes with disentangling intricate historical patterns behind the mythologized image of Galicia as a land of pride and tears, where good men and women were busy shaking the dead hand of the past."},{"Title":"Hiroshima diary","review":"Dr. Hachiya's account of post a-bomb Hiroshima is particularly interesting in that he plays dual role of victim and doctor.

It is very interesting and I read it in one sitting from cover to cover. The author focuses on the medical aspect of what happened to the Japanese people in Hiroshima. Obviously, he was flying blind in trying to treat the people experiencing burns and radiation poisoning. He himself was terribly wounded by flying debris and glass, and spent a month recovering from his wounds. His anger at the Americans is quickly changed when he meets the concerned members of the American Occupation.Although interesting, this account lacks something. First of all, it is a narrow perspective of the Japanese suffering. One finds a lot of what happened medically. What happened psychologically? He describes the physical destruction overall. However, how did it affect the city and region as a whole. There are also some prominent misspellings throughout this copy.This is a documented account of what happens when man uses nuclear weapons. It is not a pretty picture. Our leaders should read this before we even think about the purchase or use of nuclear weapons. One also should think if these weapons ever came into the hands of rogue states (Iran) or terrorists. The authors describes the suffering of a population."},{"Title":"Hiroshima diary","review":"Ordered in 2007. Wish I could offer a review but I never recieved the item.

Although medical in nature, I did not find this book at all overwhelming or too scientifically detailed. It was a quite easy read and allowed me to relate the Japanese citizens of this traumatic period.More than a medical documentation, this was a dramatic tale of real people, real situations and real feelings. Surprisingly, it was not depressing and did not leave me riddled with guilt over being an American. I was impressed by the heroic acts of regular Japanese citizens and dumbfounded over their undying allegience to thier plight and country; AT the same time they did not express morosness or hatred twords the incoming American soldiers- instead they welcomed them as notable collegues and almost friends. Despite the disparity of thier people and thier country they were able to see past all feelings of disdain and recogize that the most important thing was family, love and friendship. In addition to it being a beutiful story, I also gained vast knowledge of the effects of radiation and the Atomic bomb-- a seemingly gaurded secreat amoungst American history lessons."},{"Title":"Hiroshima diary","review":"I read this book when I was in college, as a chemistry/chemical engineering major.

I highly recommend this very personal account written from one individual's view of one of history's most significant and terrible moments. There is no flag waving. No political rhetoric.

I don't know if it's because I'm lazy or because I just don't care to do so. However, with this book I feel the need to talk about it. Maybe that's because I've never had a book that was assigned to me (albeit I chose this particular book from a long list of books that discuss the atomic bomb) that I found hard to put down.Let me start out by saying 'Hiroshima Diary' is written from the perspective of Dr. Michihiko Hachiya - the director of the Hiroshima Communications Hospital (located about 1,500 meters from where the bomb hit) - and contains his thoughts and experiences from the moment the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 up through September 30 of the same year.Now, what draws you (and when I say you, I clearly mean what drew me) into this diary is not just getting a first hand perspective of someone who witnessed this momentous event in human history and its impact on the city and its people (along with the recollection of second hand accounts of NUMEROUS other witnesses of the event), but that we as the reader take this journey with him as he strives to make sense of what's happening around him. Hachiya really has no hindsight as he writes his entries on what's going to happen in the future, which is what makes this such a compelling read. You get to understand the mayhem of that period in time, the fear, and the attempt to make sense out of this disastrous event.The diary starts out with general speculation on what actually happened in Hiroshima. When word reaches that it was an atomic bomb, for a while there is speculation that Japan also had a similar weapon and had actually used it in retaliation against America. Also rumors about whether Japan is going to surrender, when and how occupation will occur, how allied troops will treat them - and how those rumors turn from...well...rumors to facts. Then comes the radiation sickness and Hachiya and the rest of the hospital staff trying to figure out what exactly this sickness is. How to differentiate the symptoms of radiation sickness to those who are sick in other ways, what caused it, what the treatments are for it, if there are treatments, why are some people getting sick with symptoms later than others, why do some symptoms lead to death sometimes in certain people, but don't necessarily in others?And yes, there are some medical words used in the book, but in no way does that hinder its readability. Any term or medical event that does occur is explained in a way that someone not familiar with medical knowledge would understand (and trust me, I'm FAR from doctor material, and I had no problem with anything in here). If you can understand two terms: Epilation and Petechiae (which he explains about a hundred times), if you've heard of such organs as the lungs, the liver, the spleen, the pancreas, etc., and what white blood cells, red blood cells, and blood platelets are, then you're golden. And besides, while an important part of the book, it's not the only part of it.Overall, this is just a great first hand account of an important moment in the history of the world from the viewpoint of a man who lived through it. The book is not about the facts of the bombing, it's about speculation and an attempt to recover the facts. It's about getting into the head of someone experiencing that moment in time - someone who doesn't really know what's going on around him. It's about the reaction he and others have to their whole world getting turned upside down, to seeing the dead and dying everywhere, the suffering, the rumors, and the uncertainty of whether they'll live another day or whether more bombs are going to come and finish the job they started on August 6."},{"Title":"Hiroshima diary","review":"In \\"Hiroshima Diary,\\" Dr. Michihiko Hachiya recounts his experience as both a victim of the atomic bomb and a first-responder of aid.Hachiya's account graphically depicts the confusing, terrible weeks that followed the atomic attack on Hiroshima.

The rest of your law school classmates may flail in the darkness of the Socratic Method, but this book illuminates what the prof is attempting to do.I'm an attorney and did not have the benefit of Judge Aldisert's wisdom until after graduation. But he explained many murky concepts that I had only vaguely understood. Before reading the book, I could tell you that one argument was better than another; now I can put my finger on why.

To lack this understanding is to be substantially, if not totally, disadvantaged.&quot;"},{"Title":"Logic for Lawyers : A Guide to Clear Legal Thinking","review":"Great good fortune introduced me to this landmark book in the year of its first publication, 1988, over a decade after I graduated from law school.This book's outstanding revelation to me was neither its (useful) discussion of deductive or inductive reasoning (which, to me, were comparatively elementary), nor syllogistic reasoning (which to me was not only elementary but problematic).The book's discussion of \\"formal\\" fallacies, including syllogisms, is interesting and worthwhile, and knowledge of the existence of these formal fallacies is important. However, I question the need, as a criteria of reasoning validity, of strict, universal application of these formal reasoning structures to an analysis and evaluation of judicial opinions or practical legal reasoning.This book's blockbuster revelation to me was its discussion of \\"informal\\" fallacies, including the need for developing one's skill in recognizing or spotting \\"informal\\" fallacies in the reasoning of others - and in avoiding the commission of \\"informal\\" fallacies in one's own reasoning.Other reviewers of this book comment on the need for studying a course on logic, as an adjunct to this book. I agree, with a qualification. I feel the greatest need, in practical or legal reasoning, is for treatises providing in-depth analysis of each \\"informal\\" fallacy. Fortunately, such treatises are now beginning to appear.Another significant deficiency in modern logic textbooks is their failure to provide compelling and unique examples of the \\"informal\\" fallacies noted (on a theoretical basis) in these textbooks. In this area of illustrative examples, Judge Aldisert's book contains a treasure trove of numerous examples of \\"informal\\" fallacies, the value of which is enhanced by the fact that they are all discussed in the context of judicial opinions from court cases, which Judge Aldisert quotes in his text.No matter how many treatises regarding \\"informal\\" fallacies which have now appeared and will now appear in the future, Judge Aldisert's book will always remain on my bookshelf - this book remains my \\"first stop\\" in my search for relevant issues of \\"legal logic.\\"My award of \\"five stars\\" to this book is not because this book is definitive (it is not), but because it is seminal, and in my heart and mind, is a classic, and remains an indispensable, introductory overview to any prospective law student or practitioner."},{"Title":"Logic for Lawyers : A Guide to Clear Legal Thinking","review":"I am thrilled that some publishers of professional resources are starting to make their books available in Kindle format. I've had the dead-tree version of \\"Logic for Lawyers\\" on my shelf for a couple of years, but I wasn't able to make time to actually read it until it came out as an e-book.Unfortunately, however, the Kindle version needs a major clean-up. Footnotes appear at random throughout the text, often in mid-paragraph and sometimes even mid-sentence. Words and phrases are inexplicably missing. In several places, multiple sentences are intermingled, resulting in gibberish. (I ended up keeping the hard copy at hand so that I could untangle the botched passages.)

The book is clear and concise, offering in-depth commentary on certain logic terms, that even the average layman can understand somewhat. The book also contains a great source of humorous passages, that help ease the strain of learning a process, that can be somewhat mundane at times. However, once you have a full grasp on the concepts explained in the book, every argument from thereon, becomes a collection of categorical syllogisms that you can dissect and understand.The only qualm, is that one should have a logic background, if at all possible. I took a logic class in undergrad, so this book was a refresher in some areas and explained how to apply those unearthed principles to the law. As previously mentioned, an average layman can understand some of the concepts, but in the more advanced areas of the book, having a background in logic would help tremendously and preclude the book from sounding too much like a text/casebook."},{"Title":"Logic for Lawyers : A Guide to Clear Legal Thinking","review":"If you are preparing for law school or attending law school, then you need to read this book.

This book is good in that respect, however I think there are better ways to prepare. Their discussion of Joe Bloggs isn't bad and it will help, but IT WON'T HELP AS MUCH AS THE MASTERY OF THE MATERIAL! I can not emphasize that enough. The Princeton review shows you all these 'tricks' and not enough time is spent on mastering the material. I hope that I catch many high schoolers and they see this review. If you have about a month before the test I urge you to get a few books. First is Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis. The second is The Memory Book by Harry Lorayne. After you read Word Power you will rip through the Verbal section. The Memory book will help you in all aspects (especially memorizing words)and it will cut down study time by 75%. I am pretty good at math so I didn't get any math books. Now I got a 1230 on the PSAT. Then I read those two books and my score jumped to a 1440(750v, 690m). Remember techniques will help, but mastering the material will help a lot more.Good luck on the test!"},{"Title":"Princeton Reviw: Cracking the SAT & PSAT, 2000 Edition","review":"First of all, I must stress the point that many people say is bad about this book. People say that it doesn't teach the material on the SAT. It just helps you out by giving tips and such. While this is true, that is the point of the SAT. You cannot try to learn the SAT material in a book. The people who try to do this usually do not do well. You just need help on taking the test. If you don't know the material, then you wouldn't be scoring well on the SAT. I made a 1300 before this book, and then my score jumped to 1540. I knew most of the material but I fell for a lot of traps. So if you are making decent scores and know the material, this book will help you a lot."},{"Title":"Princeton Reviw: Cracking the SAT & PSAT, 2000 Edition","review":"This book is NOT for you if you are scoring higher than 1300 in your SATs. First, all the questions will be WAY too easy for you, especially the verbal section. I have this book and the Barrons, and the KAPLAN. I took practice tests from Barrons/Kaplan, and I scored about 1340. I did the practice tests from Princeton's Review and it's up by almost 80 points.(70 points coming from the verbal section!) Because it's easier, it will give you confidence about the SATs. But you must also realize that the REAL SATs are not THAT easy.(just a note: I scored 1350 in the REAL SATs, which is close to the BARRON/KAPLAN score but much lower than the Princeton Review) If you're buying this to build vocabulary, buy WORDSMART, or BARRONS SAT. They have much more words for you than this easy book. BUT!! I HAVE TO ADD that this WILL be helpful to those who score in the range of 1000's. I have seen people with those scores who got 100-point boost after studying this book, one aspect being self-confidence and some humorous material."},{"Title":"Princeton Reviw: Cracking the SAT & PSAT, 2000 Edition","review":"I've not read this year's edition, but I'm familiar with the editions of previous years.

The book's practice tests are refreshingly indistinguishable from real SATs; they are certainly the best available, though those in Kaplan's SAT book are quite good as well.Many reviewers have declared this book to be insufficient for those who seek high scores. I disagree strongly. Good advice is good advice, even if presented in a manner less than ceremonial. Pedantic word lists assembled without attention given to what words will likely appear on the SAT, though impressive and temptingly concrete, are not the best use of any preparer's time. Of greater importance than a presentation of all the math and English needed for the SAT is a thorough, insightful walking through of SAT questions, and that's where this book shines.This book, the College Board's book of ten real SATs, and a functioning noggin are all anyone needs to succeed on the SAT. But if you've got money to spare, you might try the Kaplan book, too -- another look at strategy and a few more realistic practice tests can only help.I have not yet taken the SAT. On practice tests, my scores started as low as 1440 but have since climbed well into the 1500's -- even to the point of a 1590 most recently.

The advantage of the Princeton Review book is that they understand that taking the SAT only tests how well you take the SAT. The practice tests were much more realistic than those in the Kaplan book--which are not really set up like SAT questions, and try to test knowledge rather than understanding of the College Board test. I have heard complaints about this book not testing enough actual skills, and while I understand the concern, the reality is that the SAT does not really test actual knowledge either. Being a human thesaurus or math genuis are not necessary to know how to take the SAT, and that is what other books, like Kaplan, don't seem to understand. This book really helped me understand how the SAT was set up, and what I needed to learn to be able to take it better. My only complaint is about their CD roms in some of the books--I got the SAT with the online, and was happy with the software, but later when I got their ACT CD and book I have to say I was dissapointed with the quality. If you get the book, get the cheaper one with the online stuff...it is well worth the 18 bucks, unlike some of its counterparts."},{"Title":"Princeton Reviw: Cracking the SAT & PSAT, 2000 Edition","review":"I am sorry, but I have serious objectionsto the Princeton Review manner of creating study guides. While some attention is given to actually reviewing the material that is on the test, much information is dismissed as unlikey to appear on the test and therefore unnecessary to remember. Princeton Review bets on statistics of what material is most often tested when deciding what it will teach you.Likewise, and more importantly, the Princeton Review encourages students of its book to rely on chance and statistics in regards to guessing multiple choice answers. Princeton Review teaches the students the techniques that are most likely to help them and, on the side, teaches the material that is most likely to be essential. Well, that which is most likely is not the case 100% of the time. While some suggest that tests are so unlikely to have three questions in a row with the same answer that a student should be overly skeptical if he or she finds his or her self marking three questions in a row with &quot;B&quot;, the fact is that I have taken many tests and many times have I had the same answer for four or even five questions in a row. I got these questions right because I did not doubt my answers based on some test-taking techniques I picked up in the Princeton review but because I had learned enough of the material to be confident.Quite simply, this Princeton Review book is not an effective enough resource for helping its readers learn the material they are being tested on. The quality of the book is further decreased by its emphasis on tricks and statistical advantages that just do not prove useful enough in the real world.The SAT is perhaps the most important test a high schooler will take, so don't jeapordize your performance by studying from this book unless you plan to supplement your studies with more material-oriented guides."},{"Title":"Princeton Reviw: Cracking the SAT & PSAT, 2000 Edition","review":"First and foremost, the CD-ROM that is included in this book was made poorly.

The &quot;Hit Parade&quot;, which is a list of SAT words that frequently come up on the SAT is alright. The Verbal section explanations and tricks are satisfactory. They just suggest that you memorize vocabulary and in conjunction, use their strategies. Math (which is my difficulty) is not explained thoroughly in this book. Yes, knowing the strategies is very very helpful, but honestly, there is no way you can get a high score without knowing how to solve the problem. The Math section of this book is shallow and does not provide adequate practice to prepare you for the SAT.For the Verbal Section of the SAT, I recommend you get:1) Barron's Guide to the SAT (21st Edition)For the Math Section of the SAT, I recommend you get:1) Gruber's Complete SAT to SAT PreparationGood luck."},{"Title":"Princeton Reviw: Cracking the SAT & PSAT, 2000 Edition","review":"This book emphasizes too much on teaching the tricks to get around questions, instead of getting you to learn the material.

A man that has entertained us for most of the 20th century. A man that has risked his life to bring comfort to the troops of America's numerous wars and conflicts. A man that just couldn't make enough money or women! It was always known in Hollywood and in the Pentagon, what a flagrant womanizer Bob Hope was -in fact just about to the very end of his life. His wife knew it and with the patience of a saint, she stuck by him through countless affairs and one-nighters, both here and overseas. Thats the way it was. The man who always managed to have an ad-lib ready for any occassion -they were all carefully scripted in advance. Again, thats the way it was. No one likes to hear such stories about their heroes and role models, afterall it kind of makes suckers out of us if we go along and believe something like this book. We figure if Bob was that bad, we would have heard about it long ago. Thats where all those great PR people come in and Bob had the best. Worshiped by the public, the servicemen and all those American presidents from both parties. So who wants to make suckers out of all them, it's worse than burning the flag and then spitting on it. Yes, his image was greater than anyone on Mount Rushmore. What's more, Bob Hope knew it, flaunted it and fully exploited it -all the way to the bank. He became the single biggest private owner of real estate in California. Whereas Jack Benny always traded off his showbiz image of being tight with money, in reality he was the total opposite. However, Bob the benevolent was as tight as they come, extremely shrewd and always politically savvy. Not that all thats a crime, but was he really worthy of becoming the most decorated American in history?Arthur Marx, son of Groucho, a veteran TV writer, playwright, novelist and biographer, took on an impossible and thankless task of showing Bob Hope in the true cold light of reality. But he strongly felt it was something he had to do. Theres no doubt that Bob Hope was extremely talented, his timing was always spot on. Theres no doubt he was the best MC you could ever get, specially at the Academy Awards. Why is it then, that we can take the good and bad when it comes to someone like Frank Sinatra, but not in super-patriot Bob?And thats what this book is all about really. It's worthy of your making up your own mind and not blindly believing in all the PR hype. Politicians court showbiz because they crave that same insatiable fan worship. Superstar's today don't seem to mind if you think of them badly or not, as long as their name stays in the headlines and the money keeps coming in. But thats right, Bob was of another era."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Bob Hope: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"Bob Hope, America's comedian -- at least among white middle-Americans of a certain age. But like any institution, and he is an institution, there is a downside to one of the country's favorite success stories. Arthur Marx pulls no punches in characterizing Hope's many flaws. Chief are the secretly promiscuous womanizing, the penny-pinching among staffers, the ceaseless self-promotion, and a generally curmudgeonly personality. Not really bad stuff, like mixing with gangsters or playing with drugs, the sorts of things Hollywood is generally prone to. But bad enough to tarnish a nurtured image as family man and patriot. Many readers will avoid a tell-all book like Marx's for that sort of defensive reason. Moreover, I get the feeling that like many in Hollywood Marx respects Hope the comedian at the same time he generally dislikes the man. Nonetheless, he is careful to point out Hope's many strengths as a performer -- his matchless ability with one-liners; his energy, verve and sass; his tireless dedication to servicemen,(which appears genuine); and his shrewd sense of the business. Additionally, Hope makes up for a lack of creative spark with a sound sense of comedy, which has helped him stay on top for a remarkable period. I like the way Marx has included excerpts from routines to provide period flavor. They furnish a sense of popular humor over time, and Hope was an expert purveyor of popular tastes until at least the 1960's when the unpleasant war-mongering side took over. Marx's style is easy and readable. Even so, as another reviewer has pointed out, there is a notable shortage of citations to back up fact. What there are consists of a list of persons interviewed for the book, which seems a little over general for a work of this type. Nevertheless, many allegations are also attributed by name from the list of interviewees. So, however you take it, be prepared for an eye-level approach to a legend who is also very much a flawed individual."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Bob Hope: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"Edward G. Robinson was not an Italian Gangster; he was a cultured Jewish Gentleman with a wide-ranging knowledge of Art and an outstanding collection of Impressionist (particularly) and other modern paintings (including a half-dozen by the then young Frieda Kahlo). Groucho Marx was a fine ad libber, but all the classic movie lines that are constantly quoted as signs of his wit were written by Kaufman and Ryskind, Pereleman, Kalmar and Ruby, and numbers of other top stage and film scriptwriters. Ricardo Cortez was not a Latin Lover but a Jewish immigrant from Middle Europe. As his good friend Andy Devine pointed out, John Wayne, a guy from Iowa, when off-screen was far more likely to be found in the latest style suits than a cowboy's outfit. All of which is to say, what it is often hard for fans to accept: an actor portrays a role, a singer who hopes to succeed creates a persona which may, or may not, relate in any fashion, to what he or she is, when not working. Frank Sinatra did punch someone occasionally but he was always accompanied by a bodyguard (about whom public jokes by other actors were common but who, in reality, was the tough guy he looked like). Whatever Bob Hope was when off the air or the screen, has nothing to do with the persona he created which was justifiably admired and enjoyed by the American public for many years. Nothing in the book suggests that he violated the law, failed to live up to his obligations as an American citizen, failed to contribute what, in monetary terms, was tens of millions of dollars of his time and talent, or publically advocated that anyone violate the laws or obligations binding on a citizen. Whether or not he was a philanderer, a tightwad, lacking in private appreciation of his writers (whom he lauded in public) is an irrelevant concern (as far as I am concerned).That segments of the public are curious about an actor's private life, and writers find it profitable to satisfy that need, detracts nothing from the status a performer has achieved through his skill and the skill of those who help him.I have read a number of books by Arthur Marx. He writes well and creates an interesting story. Most of the material he uses in this book, in the books on his father, on Martin and Lewis, and others, is basically unverifiable. Even when detailed citation is given in such books, one is still left with doubt as to the witnesses accuracy: are they making up a good story about a celebrity, are they passing on a story that someone else told that sounds good, are they failing accurately to remember years afterward, are they trimming a story for the sake of effect without realizing it, etc. This is true of any biography, particularly one written about someone no longer alive or so old that distortion is likely to mark his own or others memories.My judgment: here is one take on what the life of the man who played the performer, Bob Hope, was like, off stage, when playing himself. If it suits your need to cut a \\"hero\\" down to size, accept it. If it offends you, reject it. If possible, however, take the scientific/scholarly approach: be skeptical of everything, but apply some measuring rod of truth-probability to everything you read."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Bob Hope: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"Should of had more information regarding Bob Hopes secret life. That was the title of the book! Most of the book was about the things he did in his career. Anyone could of found that information. Few and irrelevant photos. No follow up on stories. Disappointing."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Bob Hope: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"The people who panned this book *clearly* have their shorts in a wad (that's a colloquial phrase for \\"cognitive dissonance\\") over having their shiny perceptual \\"Bob Hope\\" bubbles painfully burst after discovering the rather unsavory truth. Too bad, that's what you get for putting somebody up on a pedestal. Especially somebody who doesn't deserve it. I give the book five stars because it soundly draws a clear distinction between Bob Hope's carefully crafted public persona and what he was REALLY like, \\"behind the scenes\\"... a mean-spirited, self-aggrandizing, womanizing opportunist! In other words, he was a first-class spoiled brat and a major league hypocrite. This book would be a lot less interesting if the dichotomy that is Bob Hope wasn't a fact of life, and admittedly, it will not be very interesting to the people who don't remember him. But for those of us that do, it is an excellent biography. Pretty soon we'll all be dead too, but at least we'll kick off knowing the value of \\"belief\\" in terms of accepting uncritically and without question whatever is tossed one's way by the public relations machinery.... an object lesson which translates neatly not just for the entertainment business, but for media and government as well."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Bob Hope: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"Throughout the history of biographies, official or otherwise, authors who choose to pen books about celebrities, politicians or media figures do so because they either: a) revere or empathize greatly with their subject; or b) have a reason to vilify or skewer that subject's good name. In the case of this book, the latter is in effect. Arthur Marx (son of the great comic actor, Groucho Marx) seems to be doing his best to deflate Hope's standing with the American public. Although a few of his sources seem iron-clad, others appear without so much as a footnote. Lurid tales of Hope's antics, jealousies, and personal feuds are layed out one by one; each paragraph tries to hit harder than the one preceding it. Most will find this book interesting simply because of the sheer ribaldry and titillating content. For instance: Bing Crosby ended up in the hospital in 1948 for an operation, and as is retold by Marx, &quot;Der Bingle&quot; was fellated by a nurse on staff. He was suitably impressed about it that upon being released by the hospital, he promptly told Hope about the nurse's proclivity. It wasn't long before Hope was requesting the same room and the same nurse...with the same end result. Such lascivious behavior should be backed up by corroborating evidence; none, however, is offered. Marx also breaks the rule of biographers: Never include yourself, your family members, or your friends into the life of your literary subject. He introduces Groucho into the storyline in one chapter; and while Groucho was himself an entertainer well-known to millions of Americans, such as Hope was and is, Groucho's life and career didn't intersect with Hope's enough to warrant the inclusion of the elder Marx's name. It was, however, an interesting anecdote, and one Groucho could have easily related to his son. However, some of Arthur Marx's charges may have some validity. When he writes about a special Hope had on T.V. that was almost universally panned by television critics, Hope's spin doctors went into overdrive. They quoted a critic from a paper called &quot;Chicago News,&quot; who said Hope's T.V. special was a &quot;delight.&quot; An observant Los Angeles critic (who panned Hope's show the most vociferously) was contacted IN PERSON by a Hope employee. The man demanded a detraction, and told the critic that Hope could make her life miserable. The sycophant later said that Hope's show was reviewed most favorably elsewhere. The lady critic points out that the fictitious writer of the fictitious Chicago journal was evidence enough that Hope's latest T.V. effort did indeed fall well short of glory. It is not for me to say that Hope had as many affairs as Marx said he had; it may not be so, and I can't just take his word for it. Marx may have a serious axe to grind, and judging by his attempt to fit all of Hope's transgressions into one book makes it seem that way. All things considered, Marx must be taken with a grain of salt. It is up to those who were in the audience of one of Hope's USO shows to judge the validity of servicemen who castigated and booed Hope because of his &quot;hawk&quot; views of the Vietnam War. Marx tells us that although nearly all films show us nothing but laughing and applauding soldiers, the truth was that Hope had many detractors in the military. I won't argue the fact that Hope had some liberal detractors in his audience. Is Marx inflating the numbers of servicemen who really DID resent Hope and his political views? Again, I was not there; I have no say. I prefer to remember the Bob Hope from the &quot;Road&quot; pictures, ambling off to some misadventure or other with Bing. Or the guy who could just say something funny, and get it in before the censor had a chance to quash it. In conclusion, I tend to agree with a few of Marx's observations; the rest seem to extend the realm of reality. Delores Hope won't talk, and Bing and Marilyn Maxwell et. al., have all been outlived by Hope. No doubt, Hope is a man with faults, as have all of us. Keep that in mind as you read this book.Since it is out of print, you may have to consult your library to see if they have a copy."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Bob Hope: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"I read this book a number of years ago, and the thing that really hit home to me was not so much Bob Hope's specific dalliances, but---in reading other stories about other people as well--- how widespread such celebrity behavior was in those so called \\"innocent\\" days and how neatly everything was covered up back then. I will often hear older folks talk about today's stars being a bunch of degenerates, but--it seems---many stars behaved no different then as now. Except they lived in an era where the media was more tightly controlled and/or had a \\"gentleman's understanding\\" to look the other way. Hope, Crosby, Babe Ruth, Clark Gable, Sinatra and other big named celebrities could never hide their behavior today. And that goes for politicians, too. Jack Kennedy anyone?

And, Marx, as the son of the great Groucho, undoubtedly has known a lot of dirt about Hope for years.

Hope was one of Arthur Marx's employers, and it was Hope that turned his father's career around by insisting that he work off the script when he invited Groucho to come on the air with him. Little did he imagine at the time that the thanks he would get for his benevolence to Groucho (a benevolence he displayed throughout his career) would be a knife in the back from his pathetic lowlife son.

It's format is so concise as to be practically useless. It seems to be a bunch of class notes cobbled together. Mulitvariable calculus in a book that is only 5 inches across? What a dis-service to the subject. It can barely contain the full definitions for tensor products. Just silly. Lacking examples or much of anything for the reader to bridge the gap his terse prose leaves. A Font so small that indices are lost on some equations. It is no Differential Geometry. The difficulty is not within the subject matter, but with it's meager presentation. Not at all the quality you would expect from this author. God, I hope this isn't \\"The\\" book on calculus on manifolds. Not to mention the typos. I never knew that f(a)= f(a)+ f'(a)*h...oh wait it isn't, but f(a+h) is!

It's not complete and the subject is too abstract and difficult for such a skimpy treatment to get through to the beginning students.

I found it to be very useless even as a supplement, let alone a main source to rely on. The main problem with this book is the fact that it is very short (Can I say way overpriced? Good thing I got it for free) and it doesn't explain the concepts properly. It is theoretical, but also in my opinion too far out there. I have nothing against theory, in fact I think its great to have theory in a math book. But in this case the material presented very tersely and unclearly. In my opinion books should explain concepts nicely and clearly with a proper use of examples. I do not wish to spend hours trying to understand what an author tried to say, especially when a concept is a really easy one. Another annoying thing about this book is the notation. Author uses \\"modern\\" notation for partial derivatives, but for some reason not many other people use it. It is found mostly in the 1950s era math books. This archaic approach to math is devastating to a student. Avoid at all costs."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"This book would serve well as a self-study introduction to smooth manifolds for a student just finishing a high school calculus course. For those serious about the subject, pick up John M. Lee's \\"Introduction to smooth manifolds.\\""},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"When you are in college, the standard calculus 1,2, (maybe 3) courses will teach you the material useful to engineers. If you want to become a mathematician (pure or applied), you must pretty much forget the material in these courses and start over. That's where you need Spivak's \\"Calculus on Manifolds\\". Spivak knows you learned calculus the wrong way and devotes the first three chapters in setting things right. Along the way he clears all the confusion arising from inconsistent notation between partial derivatives, total derivatives, Laplacians, and the like.Chapter four contains the main objective of the book: Stokes Theorem. I think Spivak does a great job in minimizing the pain students feel when faced with tensor algebra for the first time, by carefully developing only what is essential. By first developing the notions of vector fields and forms on Euclidean spaces rather than manifolds, he eases the assimilation of these concepts. There is a slight price to pay by not developing the notion of tangent spaces in terms of germs and derivations (the modern approach), but this is quite justified for the level of the book. The student who completes chapter four (including the exercises) is well-equipped to study differential geometry.Chapter five is a brief introduction to differential geometry, a teaser if you will, for the amazing ramifications of the tools developed in the book.As Spivak remarks in the introduction, the exercises are the most important part of the book. Spivak rewards the students in the exercises by leaving many interesting developments to them like the indefinite integral of a Gaussian and Cauchy's integral formula.This book is a gem for the student of mathematics."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"So far Im at chapter 2 (just finished it). So Im going to update this once im done with the book.Let me say first this is not a book to read while you are lying on bed, You absolutely need a pen, a paper, and write down the theorems, and then rewrite all the proofs, and write on your own the skipped steps. Note the author says more than one time \\"clearly\\", and those \\"clearly\\" are kinda clear, however proving them will take space, and I think they need to be proven anyway, to get a better grasp on material.! (sometimes if you think the clearly is not near clear, then maybe your thinking wrong, rethink about the problem).Anyway, whats BEST about this book, is that it \\"is carefully developing only what is essential\\" to get to manifolds (which I never studied b4). But comparing this book to other books, Other books introduce LOTS and LOTS of material, that you really might not need to know ALL of it to get to manifolds. I am not saying all those extra material are not important, but to simply study the subject of manifolds, you really do not \\"need\\" them.this book is five chapters:1)Functions on Euclidean Spaces2) differentiation3) Integration4) Integration on chains5) Integration on ManifoldsIT might sound trivial for grad math books, but this book does NOT have solution to the exercices at end of book, however, some of the excerices have hints just right after the statement of the problem, and I think they are kinda solvable.True, not so many examples provided in the book, however, if you sit and write and prove theorems, then you should be able to create your own example, and more like discover things!Simply, if you love studying Math, (some say torture urself with Math), then that's the right book for you.I can not but give 5 stars for this book. Overpriced, not many examples, WHATEVER, The name of the book is calculus on Manifolds (not advanced calc 2 or real analysis 2), and thats what you will absolutely find in the book.*** Update ***now that I'm done with the book. It has been a great experience, especially it's my first exposure to manifolds (also differentials). However, I think this book really lacks examples. If I was not studying this book as independent study with a professor, I would have learned some wrong concepts on my own (especially in the section about n-cubes, examples by the author were REALLY needed there to clear any confusion). The way I studied this book is that I read it, try to rewrite all the proofs on my own rigorously including all the left-out details, then go to my professor, he will give more intuition, and I try to come up with examples in his office. It's been great, I learned a lot. I still think lack of examples is a problem. Though wud not want to change my 5 stars.Now I think studying this book as second (at least not first) exposure to the material would be a lot better, That's if you are studying it on your own! However, IF you have extra time and IF you can discuss the material with a professor everytime you read a section, and He can direct you to develop the right examples, then this book is GREAT (and I think can be covered in one semester)!"},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"This is a very thin book, especially with paper cover. The content, though, is not thin at all. As creamy as one could wish for. Don't let the size fool you.Before buying this book, I suggest you try reading one or two pages (excluding Chapter 1) on the stuff that you think you are best familiar with. If you can understand every paragraph within 30 minutes without having to go back and forth, you must have been a grad student in math for 3 years and about to get a Ph.D. in analysis.

People also do refer to this book a lot.One thing I find quite bothersome is the treatment of measure zero. I think Spivak spent too few pages on it. Well, speaking about spending too few pages, if you see a proof going for more than two pages in this book, be prepared.

I would highly recommend this wonderful bookto anyone interested in studying mathematical analysis.It is an especially useful resource to people interestedin differential geometry and in partial differentialequations.Spivak's coverage of multivariate calculus is more geometricand more intuitive than Rudin's. For this reason, I thinkthat these two books provide complementary coverage ofcalculus of several variables. These volumes open the doorto the serious study of mathematical analysis."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"Students will need a flare for the abstract in tackling the contents of the book.It is not suggested for applied sciences such as engineering or the faint of heart.However, for those wishing an introduction to differential manifolds at a basic level the book is recommended.Spivak recasts notions of differentiability and integration in a more general setting still in Rn ( limits continuity higher dimensional derivatives measure theory partitions of unity etc) and then introduces the concepts of forms and tensors and associated properties and operations. He now gets to the good stuff by introducing manifolds ( structures with patches that look locally like Rn and are sewed together the right way ) and applying the more abstract theory developed earlier to these structures. One learns how to integrate forms on manifolds.Stokes theorem is the result.

It is a clear and concise introduction to multivariable analysis and differential geometry. Use either this or Chapters 9 and 10 from Rudin (or in my case both) and you're golden in R^n for n>=1."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"Let me start by saying that I think this book is the best for an advanced undergraduate or graduate student who wants to learn multivariable analysis and get an introduction to manifolds. There are several reasons for this. The first thing I think this book does well is that it has interesting problems. Unlike other competitors (i.e. Munkres), who offer no interesting problems in many sections, this book is absolutely loaded with great problems. One of the problems is even called \\"A first course in complex variables.\\" Let that tell you about the quality of exercises.Another thing I like about this book is that it swiftly builds up the multivariable analysis theory without too many pit stops. One thing I hated about Munkres is that he too way too long to develop the multivariable riemann integral. Munkres takes three steps to developing it (rectangles, Jordan-measurable sets, and then open sets), and on each stage he reproves all of the facts that we know the integral should have. Spivak, on the other hand, develops the integral over rectangles, tells you in a sentence how to generalize it to Jordan-measurable sets (that's all that was needed), and then uses partitions of unity to define the more general integral. Spivak's method is faster, gives us a good look at how partitions of unity can be used, and uses the fact that the reader should be able to prove and predict the properties that the integral should have based on the assumption that we've dealt with the single variable case before. The makes Spivak a much quicker and interesting read than any other book on the subject.While I do like this book, it is not without flaws. The general opinion is that this book is a little too terse on explanations sometimes. For example, the one example Spivak gives on how to take a derivative, he identifies that derivative of the projection mapping with the i-th standard basis element. That is, he is identifying the dual space of R^n with R^n itself, all the while not telling us. While this is a nice trick that can help us take derivatives faster, this should have been mentioned in the text. Chapter 4 is rough as well. Many times Spivak will say that a theorem is obvious in an easy case, then give you a sentence on how to generalize it to the more general case. There have been many times where I have had to write my own proofs because his were lacking in detail. My margins are full of notes and missing steps because of this. For me, this wasn't too bad because I learned the material really well by being so involved, but I can easily imagine many readers being left in the dust. However, this is a good book, and these flaws only detract one star in my opinion.The next thing we need to ask is what do you need to read this. You will need a very solid understanding of single variable analysis. If you haven't read Rudin'sPrinciples of Mathematical Analysis, Third Editionyet, now is a great time to get yourself a copy. Also, you will need a strong linear algebra background. My personal favorite is Axler'sLinear Algebra Done Right, but many people like the book by Hoffman and Kunze. One you have this background, this is the best place to go if you're looking for a quick lesson in multivariable analysis and your first introduction to manifolds.After you're done with this book, you're going to have to buy a more serious book on manifolds. This book if good for getting your feet wet, but there are so many essential things left out. I prefer the books by John Lee over Spivak's Vol. I, and so I recommend you look into those."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"This book is just the best monograph on the subject available. The author states his goal clearly since the beginning and includes the exact amount of fundamental material needed to get to the main result: Stoke's theorem. The approach is not as general or abstract as it could be, but obviously Dr. Spivak decided to sacrifice that to make the reading more comprehensible, because his goal was not an encycopaedic treaty of analysis and differential geometry, but a detailed explanation of how this important subject is understood by modern mathematicians.Just a word of warning: this book is not for beginners.

It is also a great book when you go back for a refresher, also."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"In the preface Spivak says that this book is accessible to anyone that has had good courses in calculus and linear algebra. While this is true, the term \\"good\\" needs a little clarification. If you've taken a two semester calculus sequence using the \\"cook book\\" approach, you will be grossly under-prepared for Spivak. Ideally you'd have taken one of the many theoretical calculus with honors courses offered at good universities or a nice undergraduate analysis course. I'd suggest preparing by means of Spivak's own book, Calculus, barring that you'll do well with Introduction to Analysis by Maxwell Rosenlicht, Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott, or, if you want to be old school, the first seven chapters of Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin. All the aforementioned books (except for Spivak's Calculus) cover topology and continuous functions at a more leisurely pace than Spivak. For the linear algebra I'd suggest one of Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces by Paul Halmos, Linear Algebra Done Right by Axler, or Linear Algebra by Peter Lax. The book by Lax is a wee bit more advanced and may require more maturity. Also the book by Axler downplays the role of matrices, focusing instead on linear maps as separate entities that can be expressed by means of a matrix given a basis. While this is a good approach, I'd suggest making an effort learn how to play with matrices. A lot of properties of differentiable functions from R^m to R^n can be handled with matrix tricks If you work through one of the three calculus books and one of the three analysis books I've recommended you'll be in great shape for Spivak. It must be said that the exercises in Spivak are challenging and many are proofs of nontrivial theorems. It's hard work and requires significant creativity on the part of the reader. Of course, this makes the book ideal for training up new mathematicians. That's what the book is for and it is excellent at that; which is why I've given it five stars."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"I used this book in my second year calculus class. It is a great book for introduction, but you have to be very carefull with it, one paragraph of this book equals to one whole chapter of other books. The exercises it suggests are quite challenging. This book isn't for people who want to learn only to work with manifolds, but for people who really want to learn calculus."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"Be warned: Spivak is speaking a different language from any I was taught. I have spent hundreds of hours on this book, and have filled three binders with notes on the first three chapters. If you are using it in the right manner, it is a fantastic book; otherwise, it is a nightmarish exercise in frustration. Expect to rewrite the textbook in your efforts to understand it; for some, this is a plus. It is an excellent book for inspiring effort and creativity, but it is dreadful if you do not have outside support. It is NOT a primary text by any stretch of the imagination.The first blow against the book is its claim that \\"only a term of linear algebra, a nodding acquaintance with the notation of set theory, and a respectable first-year calculus course\\" are required. This is enormously demoralizing to the student who has these prerequisites and yet finds Spivak incredibly obscure; but it IS obscure. The problem here is partly one of miscommunication: it turns out that Spivak has written his own \\"Calculus\\" textbook, based on his own notions of what such a course should contain. Having examined and read part of that text, I would describe Spivak's \\"Calculus\\" as a challenging introductory analysis textbook with a deep review of calculus. It is absolutely not a book to learn calculus from in the first place, unless one is prepared to spend five times as much time as it should take, and then to relearn the entire subject in order to be able to communicate with everyone else.The second blow against it is the notation: Spivak has invented his own. Despite having had calculus, and being a successful calculus tutor, I found it nearly impossible to recognize the basic rules of differentiation in his encryption. The situation was bad enough that I felt compelled to devise my own hybrid notation to translate back and forth between the style used in Spivak and the style I have seen everywhere else in my studies, and to add clarity at a few crucial confusing points.The third blow is that there is no clear indication of what tools are expected to be available to the student. I ended up taking breaks to devise and prove large sets of lemmas and theorems in topology and analysis just to make the problems more feasible. I suspect that that was the intent--but one might have said so.The fourth problem is also part of its appeal: it is incredibly concise. This means that there are next to no examples, and huge amounts of detail have been skipped. Far too much has been skipped in places. The Implicit Function Theorem proof in particular was a nightmare; I had to completely rewrite it.This book is most properly used as a challenge problem set for fairly advanced mathematics students, with guidance, to inspire huge amounts of work and creativity. It is least properly used as a primary text, an introduction, or a means to learn anything rapidly."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"This book makes no attempt to present all of advanced calculus.

It's not so easy to read: few or no examples or worked out exercises). But it can be a great little book, with the right supplements.There is another book, by Munkres, called analysis on manifolds. It seems to be very similar in spirit, but it is a fuller version, with examples and explanations of ideas. I haven't really read it (though I do have it on my shelf and have leafed through it), but I thought Munkres topology was excellent, and so I recommend a look at this book, too.When I took multivariate intro to analysis, we used this book after starting with Hubbard and Hubbard. I remember not liking Hubbard and Hubbard, but I'm not sure why anymore: looking back at it, it seemed to give some good explanations and make some concrete computations to clear the hazy abstraction of differential forms.(Edit Feb 8, 2011 - I gave it only 4 stars because of its clear defects. I also recommend - implicit in the above but I'll say it explicitly now - a look at Hubbard^2 and Munkres. There may well be other good treatments.)"},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"I'm giving this review not so much to discuss the contents of the book, which I think is very good and would give *****, but the production quality of this edition which is truly appalling. As an undergraduate I used the first edition (OK, I admit I'm retired) which was on nice semi-glossy paper with crisp printing and figures. This edition from Westview Press looks like it was faxed onto newsprint. The earlier edition is virtually impossible to find so you are probably stuck with this one. If however you can get the earlier one, it is worth paying extra to buy a book and not something that looks like a newspaper flyer."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"This book gives a concise introduction to calculus on manifolds, and the main theorem proved in this book is the general version of Stokes' theorem for arbitrary differential forms.For those not yet familiar with Stokes' theorem, briefly it tells how the integrals on the surface of a region in a manifold are computed by doing integrals on the region's interior. The thing you integrate on the surface is is called \\"a differential form\\" and the thing in the interior is \\"d of the form\\". A special case is the fundamental theorem of calculus.Spivak's approach is to define d of a differential form using an algebraic formula, and then to prove Stokes' theorem, which (given his definition of d) is pretty much an algebraic triviality.This approach is pedigocially (and probably historically) backwards. The culminating difficulty of deriving Stokes theorem is in coming up with the correct formula for computing d! (I certainly doubt that Stokes' wrote down this formula ad hoc and then investigated what theorems he could prove with it.)In particular, I think that Spivak's treatment would have been more motivated if he took the following path:0. Give a few examples of the general Stokes theorem, in simple cases that are physically intuitive. (The divergence and curl theorems are appropriate.)1. Define d of a form by an operational definition to make Stokes theorem obviously true without any algebra. This can be done by considering the integral of a form w surface of little cubes, and taking the limit as the edge-length goes to zero, and saying that dw is the thing you integrate on the interior of the cube to get the same answer.2. Evaluate the limit to derive the algebraic formula for d.This is essentially the treatment outlined in Arnold's \\"Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics\\" (a GTM yellow book), and I didn't truly understand Stokes' theorem until I saw it there. Furthermore, when I saw it in Arnold my comprehension was immediate, whereas I spent two weeks reading Spivak and still was a bit confused.Giving the algebraic formula for calculating d and then proving Stokes' theorem as an afterthought is like naming the culprit on page 1 of a mystery novel. That being said, a mathematically mature reader might be able to reorder Spivak's treatment without being confused by it. But hey, this book is for really for undergrads so the presentation should have been polished and motivated.In summary Spivak's approach is somewhat analogous to defining differentiation using unmotivated algebraic rules, proving the fundamental theorem of calculous for the functions you can integrate and differentiate using these rules, but not stating that the derivative is given by the limit of a difference quotient."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"All you have to do is read 130 pages. Then you'll know Stokes' Theorem. Tempting, isn't it?This book is perfectly rigorous, except for a few annoying gaps. It's clear, except that Spivak does not always go out of his way to convey intuition.I think this book would be easier to read if it were longer, and written more like Spivak's Calculus. But there is something strangely satisfying about having so much knowledge in such a small space.You should read this book along with Mathematical Analysis, by Browder."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"A key thing about this book: it's basically typed up lecture notes. Especially as it gets further along, it displays a notable lack of rigour. Some of the problems are not necessarily provable using information from the book. Furthermore, theorems don't clearly state the assumptions under which they operate. In chapter 5, the author resorts to basically presenting a laundry list of facts about differential forms on manifolds, so it's hard to get much beyond a basic idea of what's going on.I believe this book may be good for a course where the instructor can answer student's questions about ideas that aren't addressed rigorously. For self-study, it could be, at best, a supplement to another book. I'm actually a little baffled about why it seems to be so well-reviewed."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"I doubt that any person who works in this field (advanced calculus) has never heard about this book. It is a very good presentation of that part of analysis that treats Stokes' Theorem from a mathematically rigorous point of view. It pressuposes very little on the part of the reader (only calculus of a single variable and a bit of linear algebra, that can be learnt quickly). It is incredible that it does not pressupose, for instance, topology. That's part of the reason for its success. The other is Spivak's good fluency with his conversational style, and a conciseness and elegance that made a book with only 130 pages so readable and at the same time containing so much information. For a course, this book is better used as collateral reading; but it does so well in explaining the concepts that perhaps it is better to read the ideas first in this book than in the adopted bibliography. A word about the topics treated: its first chapter covers the basic topology, the second treats vector differential calculus, the third multiple integration, and the last two manifold calculus, obtaining Stokes' theorem as the greatest jewel of the development. Because the objective of the book is really in the last two chapters, the treatment of vector differential calculus is pretty incomplete, so cannot be used as the only source - but Spivak makes this clear from the beginning. Of course, the theory is a bit abstract, and I believe that the better profit of this book is made only on Senior level or in Graduate school. Finally, about the author: I know all mathematical books of Spivak (not many) and he has an unique way of writing that I have not met yet in anyone else's book; it makes mathematics a very dramatic, emotional and poetic subject (although most people think differently about it), so the reading is interesting even if you don't like his way of doing mathematics."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"Spivak's book came with high praise, and for the first 3/4 of the book I certainly agreed. Spivak has a style that is at once conversational and precise. He doesn't skimp on the details, but strives to make the content as understandable as possible. His proofs aren't always as slick and polished as those you may find in Rudin, but they are well thought out, and the exercises complement them very well.There are, however, two problems with Spivak's book. The first being that for the most part, it is rather easy. The level of most of the exercises is rather low compared to the material he is presenting, and as the book goes on, they help you adjust to the material less well. Similarly, Spivak's readability falls apart eventually. He introduces complicated notation and concepts without sufficient explanation which serves to make the last (crucial) part of the book nearly incomprehensible compared to the earlier chapters. It reads as if the end was put together in a rush, or at least by a different person. This puts a large dent in the enjoyment to be had from the book, and relegates it from the place of essential reference, to merely a good read."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"Everything good to say about the content of this book is referred to those with positive reviews. I, however, would like to comment on the production quality of this book. It's horrible. The text is fine, but the diagrams look like they were done by copy machine. I have an older edition to compare with, and the difference is drastic. The diagrams with annotations are useless because it's not possible to see the labels or dotted lines due to such high contrast. So, basically you're left with renditions that lose many of the features the author is trying to illustrate."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"This is a good book if you want to learn the basics of Stokes' theorem on manifolds (in euclidean R^d) space. A logical follow-up to this book would be Madsen and Thorehave's From calculus to cohomology. But back to Spivak. The real value of this book is conciseness: i.e., if you want to learn the topic fast. It is not suitable for the average physicist or engineer unless he/she has a decent background in mathematics. An average physicist would require the solutions to the problems in order to make progress, but those are not published as far as I know. For a mathematician, this book may be too elementary, and would normally be covered anyways in a course on analysis. What this book is, is basically a condensed version of a modern course on analysis - it tries to sell analysis as calculus. The mathematician would learn more from reading Walter Rudin's book on mathematical analysis, which covers everything you will find in Spivak, but in greater details. Rudin is also concise (perhaps more so), but covers a lot more topics. But in the end, you can't beat the price of Spivak's little book, which makes me think this may be the reason it is so popular: well written, concise, and great price."},{"Title":"Calculus on manifolds: A modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus","review":"When I was in my 2nd semester of Adv.

He decided to ask Horton the elephant to sit on the egg for him. He says he will and the bird flies away to go on vacation. He sits and sits on the egg and the bird doesn't come back. Eventually people find the elephant sitting up in the tree and he will not leave because he promises he will sit on it for the bird. Some people take him to a carnival as a show. Then the bird shows up at the carnival and sees the elephant on the tree. The egg starts to hatch and the bird comes back to take all the credit for it but when the egg is hatch it is an elephant bird.This is a story that shows that you can't just let someone else do all the work and expect to get something. This is a great moralistic tale and I think Dr. Suess does a really good job illustrating this point. I think that this is a great book for children because it teaches them a lesson and it is a fun story at the same time. It also has great pictures as all of Dr. Suess books do."},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"I just love this book! My 2 year old loves it too, but she just can't fully appreciate the wonderful witty style it's written in. Every page is a joy to read!"},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"Dr. Suess is the author of numerous children&#8217;s books, for years his titles have been favorites for children. Horton Hatches the Egg is no different. Dr. Suess combines wonderful pictures with a clever plot that make this story enjoyable for readers of all ages. The characters are well developed and very appealing to the audience. Horton, the elephant, is an amusing character that commands respect. Another benefit to this fun story is the lesson it teaches about human nature. This review will examine Horton Hatches the Egg in a critical light, emphasizing the characteristics that make it a high-quality children&#8217;s book. The story begins as Mayzie the lazy bird is complaining about sitting on her egg all of time; she is tired and wants a break. Mayzie spots Horton, the elephant, walking through the jungle that she dupes into sitting on her egg for a short time. Mayzie never returns, leaving poor Horton to take care of the egg. The story continues as Horton stays with the egg through months of mishaps and tribulations. Horton and Mayzie meet at the end, through coincidence, and Horton is eventually rewarded for his efforts. The setting of this tale in begins in the jungle. There are smooth transitions from one scene to another. Also, the pictures describing the scene are not too distracting to the reader, but they help to paint a picture in the reader&#8217;s mind of where the story might actually be taking place. There is no time period given for this story, which makes the story relevant in today&#8217;s society. The setting also contains events and places that young readers might have had some experience with, and those who have never been to a circus or a jungle would still be interested in the story. The setting also helps to create a happy and light mood, which is important in children&#8217;s literature (Norton, 1999). The strong development of the characters makes this story very appealing. From the beginning, the lazy Mayzie bird wishes to leave her egg, she is tired of sitting on it. The Mayzie bird remains inert the entire story, readers will also note that the she does not benefit from being this way. Horton, the elephant, is a strong character that remains committed to his promise. Horton is a cute character that children would be attracted to; he is also very humorous. The story follows Horton from beginning to end, which allows young readers to develop a relationship with him, as they laugh and learn from him. The plot is quick paced and full of humor, which makes it very appealing to children. Horton is constantly doing silly things. The wording and language of this story make it flow and every enjoyable as well. The story is interesting and keeps the attention of the readers. The plot is never dull and inspires children to think about other events in life. Another aspect children&#8217;s literature that is substantial is involving children with the theme. Often times themes are not that easy to pick out of stories, but if children can identify themes they feel even more connected to the story (Norton, 1999). The theme of this story teaches children about life, working hard and keeping promises benefits all those involved. Overall, this story was well written with humor and realistic characters. The rhyming words would also appeal to children. I must admit that I found the story to be fun and delightful. At certain points I felt bad for the elephant. Horton is a well-developed character that is very appealing to children. Horton Hatches the Egg is a book that children will love and should definitely read."},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"Another lesson taught by our dear Dr. Seuss.

Horton does all the real nurturing, and out comes an elephant-bird, a Lamarkian triumph and an inspiration to adoptive parents.

Most importantly, my daughter loves it."},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"This book clearly deserves more than five stars!Horton Hatches the Egg is one of my very favorite children's books. The story opens with Mayzie, a lazy bird, sitting on her nest hatching an egg. She's terribly bored and tired and wants a break. She persuades Horton, the elephant, to take over for her. This is a good choice on her part because, &quot;An elephant's faithful -- one hundred percent!&quot;So Horton props up the tree so it can take his weight, climbs up onto the nest, and ever so gently . . . sits on the egg.Mayzie decides a little vacation in Palm Beach will be in order. Once there, she says . . . &quot;why bother?&quot; and abandons her egg.What Horton didn't know is that this egg needed 51 more weeks of hatching! But, never mind. &quot;He said what he meant and he meant what he said.&quot; He sat on that egg, no matter what.Through a long series of misadventures, Mayzie and Horton are reunited just as the egg hatches. Mayzie wants her egg back, and Horton doesn't agree. Then the big surprise happens and Horton gets his reward!Teaching children patience and persistence . . . well, that takes a lot of patience and persistence. Horton Hatches the Egg is a way to provide a small fictional example when setbacks and delays occur. My youngsters didn't understand Thomas Edison's comment about genius being 99 percent perspiration until they were well past their Dr. Seuss days. I like to think that their hard-working adult selves (for the three who are adults) were formed in part by Horton's example in this book.This book contains many valuable lessons to encourage such as: keeping your word; being honest; looking out for those in need; sticking through to the end; facing your fears; and many others. It's a remarkable thing to realize also how well the ridiculous image of an unhappy elephant sitting on a nest is a bare tree can create all of those good notions. Way to go, Dr. Seuss!"},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"Horton Hatches the Egg is a wonderful tale for young and old alike. I read it as a child and now read it to my own children. I was the library coordinator for my child's first grade class and was having a very difficult time controling twenty two unruly kids. Horton to the rescue. The kids loved the tale of the faithful elephant shouting out each and every time that this elephant was faithful one hundred percent. You will love this book one hundred percent !"},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"This playful and imaginative book is about an elephant that comes across a bird that is extremely stressed and does not wish to sit on her egg anymore. So Horton decides to sit on the egg so the bird can take a break. Well the bird ends up taking a tropical vacation and doesn't want to return. Well Horton very patiently sat on the egg through sleet and rain and the most horrible conditions. Well some people decide that this is a hilarious site and feel that he should be on display for all to see. So the men dig up the tree in which Horton is patiently perched and is taken down south. When Horton and the tree reach the south the mother bird finds Horton just as his egg starts to hatch and she demands it back. Horton is very displeased and states that he did all the work and deserves the egg. Well just as that was said out of the egg jumps an Elephant bird, which is a trophy for all Horton's hard work.Dr. Seuss yet again did a wonderful job with rhymes and engaging children to read. I love the moral that was being put into place that if you work hard and stay focused then it will all pay off and you will be rewarded in the end.This is one of my favorite Dr. Seuss book if not my favorite. I have always been a fan of his ability to draw children in and engage them in reading. Also the rhymes and silly words are great for young readers. Also what better then to have a moral tied along with it?"},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"Horton Hatches the egg was one of my favourite books when I was a child and it is lovely to be able to read it to my children and it has become one of their favourite too. I certainly prefer this one to many of the Seuss books available (I have never been a huge fan of Cat in the hat or Green Eggs and Ham) This one has a hugely appealing story.Mayzie is a lazy bird and doesn't enjoy just sitting on her egg, she needs a holiday from sitting around doing nothing on the egg (a lovely ironic touch for adults here, I think this is one of the reasons it is so appealing!) So she convinces Horton the Elephant who is passing by to sit on her egg for her. She doesn't really care that he is 'immense' she persuades him that he will be able to do it.So Horton props up the nest and sits on it - all through the day and night, through storms, through winter ice, through teasing from his friends because \\"an elephants faithful, 100%\\"Then one day some hunters come along, but instead of shooting hiim they capture him on the nest and drag him over the hills and onto a boat (where an elephant is seasick, 100%) and back to New York to sell him to the circus.There he sits on the egg being dragged around the country until one day they go to florida where Mayzie the lazy bird has been lying around. She has been there a year and has decided never to go back to her nest. When she sees the circus in town she flies in and sees Horton on her egg, just as it hatches. Now Mayzie gets angry and claims that it is HER egg.But the egg hatches with a new type of creature, an elephant bird. It is purely Horton's creation and the circus and the people send him back home where no doubt he will live a long and happy life with his little bird/babyIt is a nice book with a great message of working hard for reward despite the slings and arrows around you. It has a wonderful rhyme and good catch phrases which kids can learn easily to help with early readersthe illustrations are simply coloured in black green and red but enormously effective - Dr Seuss was an extraordinary illustrator!Overall one of our favourite - and highly recommended"},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"As I kid I loved this book because I thought Horton was a pure wonder. I always loved the line \\"an elephant faithful 100%\\". And my little innocent heart took it all very seriously and I wanted to be just like Horton... faithful 100%. As an adult this book has taken on a very new stronger meaning that I did not see as a child... And I am very happy to be passing along the message to my children."},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"Reading this story to a child that you love is one of life's great joys. Horton is a character that I cherish. As a teacher, I read this story to every one of my classes. As a mom, I read it nightly to my children. As always, Dr. Seuss' rhymes are enchanting, clever and fun. Within these delightful pages are lessons about character, commitment, decency, responsibility, justice, and the nature and value of true love. That's quite a bit of bang for your buck, I'd say!Even with all of the tremendous new books made available to children year after year, there is a reason why publishers have been reprinting this since 1940. -- You'd be hard pressed to find a better book of this type. -- The truth is, we all deserve to know someone like Horton. And even after all this time, it is reassuring to know that 'an elephant is faithful, one hundred per cent'."},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"I bought a Horton stuffed animal for my grandson at Christmas time, so I thought it would be natural to include \\"Horton Hatches An Egg\\" and \\"Horton Hears a Who\\"with the doll for the whole family to share and enjoy. Both of these books are classics for very good reasons. First, they are well written and engaging, but more importantly, they each teach an important life lesson. I use other Seuss works to teach values: \\"Sneetches\\" for brotherhood, \\"The Lorax\\" for the environment. \\"Green Pants\\"helps illustrate our commonalities, \\"The Butter Battle Book\\" graphically exposes the absurdities of war. Every child should access to all of these, with a caring adult's support and discussion."},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"If I am reading the reviews right, a great deal of people on Amazon who buy children's literature were either never children themselves, or they grew up in a land made out of pillows.I don't believe the central theme of this book was ever adoption--it has always been a story about commitment and keeping your promises, really--but on the other hand, neither do I believe that it will scar for life the tortured soul of any adopted child unlucky enough to stumble across it in a dentist's office.My family adopted three children growing up. We had most of Dr. Seuss' books in the house, including both of the Horton stories, and all of us, including my two sisters and younger brother, have grown up as well-adjusted and happy members of society. In fact, Horton helped in that. Not once were the Seuss stories ever perceived as a threat; they provided great comfort in endless afternoons.As for the worries expressed over \\"violence\\" in this story because of the hunters, let me say this--if you weren't affected by it enough to even remember the event, or remember that it was in the book at all when you buy it today, why skip it when reading it to your kids? I should think that the fact that as a child you were so unfazed by the hunters that you didn't remember their guns at all would be proof that there is no need to skip them.Besides, I have three boys and I've been reading them this story since they were three years old. They love the story and they also love danger and suspense, and the brief peril of Horton just pulls them into the story all the more, rooting for the proud and brave elephant, and clinging to my arm. Kids understand and can handle a lot more than adults who want to coddle them think they can.Horton Hatches the Egg--still stirring up trouble after all these years. May he ever do so!"},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"You've gotta love the Horton man. Dr. Seuss's popular elephant starred in not one but two of Theodore Geisel's great picture books for the kiddies. Now with the 100th Anniversary of Dr. Suess's birth nigh upon us, it's a good idea to take a look at some of his most successful books to appreciate them fully once again.Mayzie bird is a lazy bird, and would much rather be flying off to somewhere fun rather than tend to her egg. But when friendly (and gullible) Horton passes by her, Mayzie sees her chance to grab a little R & R in sunny Palm Beach. She convinces Horton to sit on her egg, a ploy that works despite Horton's concerns. Once gone, however, Mayzie decides \\"never\\" to go back to her nest again. Horton, stuck with the egg on his own, does everything he can to ensure it's safety. Through blizzard, teasing, capture, and seasickness Horton is faithful to his promise, \\"One hundred percent\\". When the egg finally hatches (and Mayzie insists on claiming it once the work has been finished) the result is a surprise and delight to the patient elephant.There's a lot to love in this old story. The Seussian rhyming schemes (often parodied but rarely equaled) have the perfect amount of syllables per line. Every page scans easily, and you cannot help but hear the words spoken in your brain as you read them. I remember growing up in Kalamazoo, Michigan as a child and delighting at the reading of the places Horton travels (ala circus) that mentioned my own rhymable home town. Such lines are coupled with the fabulous illustrations that show every minute of Horton's misery in wrenching detail (though not so much that you ever think the elephant is under too serious duress). Thus the payoff at the end is even better than you could hope for. It's amazing how memorable I find these illustrations, even now some twenty years later. There's something about Dr. Seuss that just connects with children on the deepest level imaginable. And there's something about \\"Horton Hears the Who\\" that deserves that connection."},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"I grew up listening to this book on a record. These days, rhymes, like Mother Goose, are not taught in school or pre school like they once were. I teach ELL but even English speakers are having more difficulty with hearing rhymes which has a direct correlation to their phonemic awarness development. This is one of the major components of pre-reading readiness. Horton also is a good example of empathy and we certainly could use more of this in our public schools among the students!"},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"Hacton the Elephant and the egg and that lazy momma bird.Oh momma bird just waiting to trick some animal into watching her egg .Then comes Mr,Elephant .Oh poor Mr.Elephant gets stuck sitting on a tree for months.

The bird takes off and decides that Horton can do the time and she will come back and get the reward of the baby bird. Well, time went on and on and the lazy bird never returned until she found out that the egg was about to hatch. Horton was true to his word through whatever weather conditions prevailed. As you read the story you wonder why it is taking so long for this egg to develop until the end when you realize that there is a great reward in Horton's efforts and loyalty and a very good moral to the story. And a great deal of anger in the bird who thought she could pull a trick on an elephant who had a sense of values and she had none.The ending is a delight and unique. I loved it as much as my son did an we both laughed together.

She loves to pretend that she is the Mayzie bird - but a better Mayzie bird, who hatches her own eggs. Ever since we first read this story, she keeps a basket of Easter eggs nearby that she sits and sits on, trying to be a good bird and hatch.In HORTON HATCHES THE EGG, Mayzie is too bored and too lazy to hatch her own egg. She convinces Horton, an elephant who is faithful 100 percent, to egg-sit for just a short while. But, Mayzie is gone for nearly a year, and our faithful Horton sits on that egg come rain, shine, snow, hunters, kidnapping, and the ridicule of his friends. And in the end, he is justly rewarded for his hard work and faithfulness.Only Theodor Geisel can tell a story like Dr. Seuss. Kids and adults alike are drawn to his weird and whimsical characters, and his wonderful, meaningful messages. His tales are all told in rhyme and are pleasing to the ear and the tongue - perfect for reading aloud.HORTON HATCHES THE EGG is a lesser known work of Dr. Seuss, but my daughter and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it. It is a great lesson about faithfulness, trust, and doing a job well. And a whole lot of fun, too!"},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"One of Dr. Seuss's best messages is convened in this book over and over again ~ \\"I did what I said and I said what I meant.

While she takes off for someplace like Florida, poor old Horton is sitting on her egg, just like he told her he would, waiting for it to hatch. In the midst of storms, good weather and sneers from others, Horton sits on the egg until it does hatch. When it does, mother bird just \\"happens\\" to appear and wants her baby back. However, the baby is a flying elephant bird! It's a very cute story and teaches kids to keep their word as promised. It's also great if you have an elephant lover in your house!

As an adoptee myself I can say that this book sends a horrible message that first mothers are lazy and willing to just cast off their children without a second glance. Nothing can be further from the truth! I will never allow this book in my home, nor will I ever allow my son (who was also adopted) to read it, as I can't imagine the horror it would cause for an adopted child of tender age. Luckily for me, I was not introduced to it until I was an adult and better prepared to cope with this horrible piece of writting.On my own behalf:I couldn't agree more. I am also an adoptee. I would have been deeply, deeply wounded as an adoptee to have it insinuated that my mother simply abandoned me out of laziness. I hope that adoptive parents, before using this as an \\"adoption story,\\" will think first of how it could deeply wound their child to come to believe that they were surrendered simply because their biological mother is lazy. What if one day your child doesn't feel like doing something, do you want them to now wonder if s/he like that terrible lazy person that abandoned him or her?The book has some other great lessons, but it doesn't belong anywhere remotely near an adopted child."},{"Title":"Horton Hatches The Egg","review":"I would not recommend this book to any parent who's child came to them through adoption. This book sends several bad messages about the first (birth) parents of a child who was adopted. First, it sends the message that the first parents just didn't feel like taking care of them and wandered off, sticking some stranger with their care. Second, children who were adopted identify with their first parents. This book sends the message that the first parents are bad and, in a childs mind, therefore they must be bad also. Third, what I see in the ending is that children who were adopted need to be like the family that adopted them. What we celebrate about our children is their uniqueness. My oldest daughter is a spectacular artist. So is her first mother. I can't draw stick figures. She also loves ballet, she gets that from me. It is not necessary to be just like your family to fit in. I wasn't adopted, I'm nothing like the majority of family, they love me. Last, I think it sends a bad message to children who weren't adopted. Most of the children out there know someone who was. I don't think it's good to teach them that the reason their friend was adopted is because they were abandoned by their first parents. To me, this book just tells children who adopted that they were unloved and unwanted and a nuisance.I love Dr. Suess and will continue to buy his books and read them to my children.

I'm disappointed bacause as soon as the book arrived, I picked it up and started reading it. I had to improvise quickly to get through the \\"hunter\\" portion of the book.

Especially, the circulated grades. I read the comment someone else wrote about the pictures. Actually, I had the same reaction the first time I saw this book and ended-up purchasing a photo grade book with great pictures. But the problem with photo grading books is that they do not go into as much detail regarding the grading. That is where this book comes in. I would highly recommend purchasing both a photo grading book and this book.I'm sure everyone has at one time purchased a coin in a slab (PCGS, NGC, etc...) and thought, \\"How did they come-up with this grade? When I look at the coin, it looks like it should get a higher grade.\\" Purchase this book and see if you still feel that way after checking the grade using the guidelines in this book. You will probably start to understand why the coin in the slab you are looking at received the respective grade.Look at it this way: You can learn how to grade coins with the purchase of this book & a good photo grade book and a little experience.

It tells you what sort of hairlines and how many are allowed, the type of luster or lack of luster and the eye appeal needed within each grade.Moreover, it covers all grades, such as MS-70 thru MS-60 and all the AU and EF grades, etc.This is a hardback spiral bound book, which makes it very easy to reference as needed. If you collect coins or invest in coins, you need this book. That doesn't negate your need for other references.

Writing in a simple and straightforward manner, he describes the process of \\"cutting it straight,\\" a term he borrows from Paul's message to Timothy in 2 Timothy 2:15. Though the passage is most often translated \\"handling accurately the word of truth\\" the literal sense is \\"cutting it straight.\\" This book is thus divided into three sections. The first deals with how to make straight cuts, the second with avoiding crooked cuts, and the third with living out your cuts.In the first several chapters Mayhue lays out the proper methods for studying Scripture. He speaks about presuppositions, methodology and rules for interpretation. A significant portion of the section is devoted to recommended study tools - concordances, dictionaries, commentaries and so on.The bulk of the book contains rules to avoid making poor cuts. In other words, the author discusses many of the common errors in interpretation. The list of errors is extensive, but a few of the topics are: spiritualizing, embellishing, culturalizing, anglicizing and experientializing. They may seem like difficult terms, but they are all explained in sufficient detail and with plenty of examples.The final chapter provides four pointers for translating straight cuts into a life. Interpreting Scripture properly is just the first step in allowing the Words of God to penetrate and change our lives.What I most appreciated about this book is that the author provides examples for everything he writes about. When he discusses rules for interpretation, for example, he exposits Psalm 13, showing how he would go about interpreting this passage. He shows the questions that should arise when discussing it and how he would answer each of them. Another strength in this book is the questions at the end of each chapter. So often I find that the questions authors put in their books add little to the subject, but in this case they truly ensure that the reader has read carefully and understood the content of the chapter.The only shortcoming I found is that the author sometimes does not go into quite enough detail about regular Bible study habits. I would have appreciated some suggestions on how to begin a regular pattern of inductive Bible study.Despite that small shortcoming, this book is an excellent introduction to the principles of Biblical interpretation and I heartily recommend it. I would suggest that it might be well complemented by a book that specifically covers the inductive method of Bible study, such as Kay Arthur's \\"How To Study Your Bible.\\""},{"Title":"How to interpret the Bible for yourself (Moody elective series)","review":"I ordered this book for students in an introductory Bible Interpretation class I teach at the church I pastor. I selected it because of its simplicity and readability. It has chapters on proper tools for Bible study, and many chapters on avoiding common errors in Bible interpretation. The author writes from his own experience, citing practical examples of how he has seen others misinterpret the Bible. For more depth, detail, and scholarship, I would recommend How To Read The Bible For All Its Worth, By Gordon Fee."},{"Title":"Ancient Egypt","review":"This book is a must for all those children who are eager to know more.

Wonderful content as well."},{"Title":"Big Book of Airplanes","review":"My five year old loves this book. He's actually gone in his room to \\"read\\" it by himself. The pictures are great. If you have a plane lover, this is a great book."},{"Title":"Big Book of Airplanes","review":"My 2-1/2 year old son loves to \\"read\\" this book, and I enjoy reading it to him.The text is definitely written to an older child (I would say that a child would have to be in at least second grade before reading it on his or her own). Fortunately, there are enough snippets of information that an adult can tailor the words to fit the child as she or he reads aloud.The photos, though, are what make this book so attractive. Each type of aircraft (to include experimental aircraft, Chinook helicopters, and future space-shuttle-like craft)has a two-page spread of photos in this oversized book. Most types feature at least three photos: one from the side, one from directly in front (the SR-71 Blackbird and the jumbo jet are particularly striking!) and one from the rear. Every type of aircraft has a photo taken while flying.My young son is learning that jet planes don't have propellers and that rocket engines look different from jet engines. Of course, at first, he was more interested in the striking colors of the aircraft chosen for the photos, but this book allows him to grow. He has a while yet before he learns \\"it all\\", unlike some of the other airplane books for young children.An enthusiastic thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Big Book of Airplanes","review":"This book is designed for children, but will appeal to anyone with an interest in aviation. The photos are clean and show the planes, helicopters and spacecraft well. The information provided for each aircraft is easy for children to read and understand."},{"Title":"Big Book of Airplanes","review":"As a 70 year old, I was so fascinated with this Big Book of Airplanes while at the dentist's office that I have since sent one to my grandson for Christmas and recently purchased a second one for a neighbor boy and a third one for myself."},{"Title":"Big Book of Airplanes","review":"This book is such a great treat to read with my 4-year old plane-crazy son. The photos are so clean and uncluttered. There's a ton of information, so this book would be great for older kids as well. From this book alone, my son has learned so much. We recently visited the Air museum in Chantilly, VA, and he ran around naming the different planes. As soon as we walked in, he said \\"A Blackbird!\\". Super book!"},{"Title":"Big Book of Airplanes","review":"I had thought that my 5 years old loves this book as the pictures are big and great along with the information..... Yes, information is very important for those ages since they observe very quickly. First, we need updated information on it. This book was published 2001. During the course of this past decade, there have been so many changes happened. I take my boy to Smithonian Air and Space museum and he naturally learned the updated information. In matter fact, my boy pointed out some of it. For example, 'Black Hawk' has been retired long time ago. (but this book says that the plane is active so as Space Shuttle.) If you are looking for the kids who loves airplanes, but not looking for the aculate information beside the great photos, this will be a wonderful book. If DK makes updated edition, it would be GREAT."},{"Title":"Big Book of Airplanes","review":"This book was purchased for an older individual who had past experience with airplanes. The book is replete with colorful pictures and diagrams that engage someone who knows (or wants to know) the basics of airplane types. Not for the sophisticated reader, but rather for someone who wants to enjoy memories with sufficient amounts of text. Also for younger readers with an interest in planes."},{"Title":"Big Book of Airplanes","review":"The quality of the book is in keeping with other DK publications (the eyewitness guides, etc.). The book is large format and provides an engaging visual reference for kids (and their parents alike). Additionally, some of the comments on various features or history of the planes is an interesting read.Parents should keep in mind the following(a) This is a regular book, i.e. not made exceptionally sturdy for children (it is not a \\"board\\" book), so pages can be easily torn-up or wrinkled (made even easier by the large format of the pages)(b) Most of the planes shown in the book are unique (e.g. laboratory trains, supersonic fighter jets, etc.), instead of the more everyday varieties that one sees on an airport or in the sky.Otherwise, my 2-year old son loves the book!"},{"Title":"Big Book of Airplanes","review":"My 2-1/2 year old daughter has become obsessed with airplanes.

(This is the only non-board book I let him handle and he is so careful with this prized possession!) It's nice that there are snipets of information about each plane on the page so we learn a lot without having to read through paragraphs of text. It's great because as he gets older we can delve even deeper into the details of each plane. We both know so much more about planes than before picking up this book.

His struggles take him across two continents, and I think he has more honor and class than any of the Wangs.

Enjoyed the 2 prior books and look forward to finishing this one."},{"Title":"A House Divided (House of Earth, Volume 3)","review":"I liked all three volumes equally and yet, differently. The first was to set the stage of the \\"beginnings\\" of a family. At least, where she starts us. There is more going in that volume with all the changes, hardships, struggle. More traditional story than character. At least for me. The second volume really sets up the personality differences within the family, the changes from the father to his children. Then, in the last volume, much much slower pace..........much to say about the the world, how this 3rd generation has so changed with the times. And of course they had the money to do it. We see a more global approach to society and much of the frustration that Yuan and his generation feels as a result: prejudice, struggle between classes, and still a clinging to old Chinese customs.Others who reviewed this said that they thought the ending was unrealistic. I am torn on only this point. But I was so sad for Yuan by the end, I wanted resolution. And maybe, just maybe we saw it as abrupt when all the while Pearl planned it that way because, the reader like Yuan was not privy to exactly what Mei Ling was really thinking and feeling. Or perhaps she didn't know herself until she saw him with his dying father."},{"Title":"A House Divided (House of Earth, Volume 3)","review":"This book mainly concentrates on the son of Wang the Tiger (and the grandson of the original Wang) but it does reveal a bit here and there of the three sons of Wang. Wang the Landlord and Wang the Merchant come across as spoiled even though they grew up on the farm and didn't get really rich until their adulthood. In this book, the Revolution is in full swing and it was interesting to see Wang's grandson deal with life in America. You can't help but feel sorry for poor Wang the Tiger after all he'd been through and what he did for his son to ensure the future of the son he loved. While 'The Good Earth' remains the best book in the trilogy - and one of Ms. Buck's best works overall - 'A House Divided' is a very good book in itself and is a definite must for any Pearl Buck fan."},{"Title":"A House Divided (House of Earth, Volume 3)","review":"The first two books in the Trilogy were so good that I was skeptical the final book could keep up the momentum but this was fantastic.It leads the Wangs into modernity with relevant historical facts hidden in the deep heart of the Tiger's only son who struggles to find his place in the world."},{"Title":"A House Divided (House of Earth, Volume 3)","review":"The best of the trilogy. Pearl S Buck creates a Tolstoyesque picture of Chinese agrarian life: harsh, simple, man vs nature. Important today in understanding Chinese roots and how far that huge nation has come in the past few decades."},{"Title":"A House Divided (House of Earth, Volume 3)","review":"I love the condition the book arrived in. I also appreciate the fact that the transaction and delivery process was done in an efficient way. Thanks!"},{"Title":"A House Divided (House of Earth, Volume 3)","review":"It is my second favorite, it is written diferently than the other two. It's themes of finding love, and the new generation vs. the old. I'm glad the triology ended when it did; I don't think another book would have ended it as well."},{"Title":"A House Divided (House of Earth, Volume 3)","review":"I would say that this book could certainly stand alone simply because there was so much happening in this turbulent setting of the revolution. In many ways \\"A House Divided\\" was my favorite of the \\"House of Earth\\" trilogy, (still, The Good Earth was beautiful!) because it was an adventure that spanned the globe. Yet there was no lack in telling how the main character evolved emotionally and intellectually from the first page to the last.Many times throughout the book, Pearl Buck successfully showed how Yuan's world was filled with black and white; no grey. For example, a person was expected to be 100% revolutionary, or a 100% traditionalist. Or one had to be 100% Chinese, or 100% foreign. Yuan was a very conflicted man from the start and struggled with these issues pretty much until the end. To me that was the most intriguing part.I was fascinated with Yuan's six-year stay in America. He experienced racism first-hand, the confusion of living in another country, trying to assimilate, seeing and appreciating the beauty of the country and the friendliness and openness of some of its people, the freedom to pursue one's happiness and potential, but clearly his own traditions and culture prevented him from fully accepting the foreigners into his heart.I think the author gave some real insight into the minds of people living during the revolution. Many people, like Yuan's cousin, Meng, were fevently passionate about it. It was clear that it took a certain kind of person, with a linear, unwavering focus in order to hasten a violent change. In this case, that meant one had to be filled with anger and hatred.Also through Yuan, we were exposed to the hypocrisy of the revolution as well. While the ideology spoke for the common people, the revolutionists were frustrated and repulsed by the common people's ways of life, such as they were for centuries. Eventually, many gave up on the older generation, and focused on the youth of the poor, because they were more easily influenced. Of course, it touched on the fact that no one was permitted to question this new state. Those who followed the cause were expected to accept it blindly.In keeping with his torn mental state, Yuan's hesitation to decide where he stood in terms of the cause was understandable. His experience gave him first-hand knowledge of how frustrating it was to live under the old filial rules, yet he'd also witnessed the softer moments with his father, and others who represented the old world. He at least was mature enough to realize that people were deeply complicated, which made it impossible for him to truly believe that \\"rich people are evil, poor people are good.\\" At the same time, as much as he loved the land, and found peace of mind working among the common people, he was at times, disgusted by their surroundings, their \\"odor\\" permeating his space no matter where he went.Pearl Buck eloquently described the same black and white issues of the heart in Yuan. Time and time again, he wished to be emotionally open, yet didn't dare. Yuan was repulsed by the display of free behavior of the new generation of China and the young Americans. Again, his reaction to the American women who danced with his cousin Sheng was an interesting glimpse into his perception of himself. Although Yuan hated the white women who ignored or rejected Sheng because he was Chinese, he had no respect for the white women who did dance with Sheng. And he felt ashamed for Sheng for \\"lowering his standards\\" to such women.Yes, perhaps the end was unrealistic, but as a hopeless romantic American, I can appreciate it. However, one can see the huge circle this book fills out with the trilogy. Yuan is ultimately the one who understands and respects his grandfather's efforts with the land, back in the first novel. Yuan is the one who finally repairs the ties to his father and ends the cycle of broken relationships. The trilogy ends as his father, the Tiger, spends his final days in the earthen house where he was born.When I read certain books, I sometimes imagine what they would be like on film, and I think it would be fantastic to see it done with the entire \\"House of Earth\\" trilogy. But then again, is it even possible to make a film that would do this epic justice?"},{"Title":"A House Divided (House of Earth, Volume 3)","review":"I would have ranked this book five-star, if the ending had not been so abrupt and unrealistic.A House Divided is a novel with many good contrasts in its themes. Certainly, in almost all Pearl's novels, there is the contrast of the East and the West. Then there comes the comparison of the different generations. In addition, the conflict of the old and the new ideas is also successfully portrayed. People from different class have very difficult behaviours. Throughout the story, the book focuses more on &quot;The rich have the rich's things to worry,&quot; a sentence in the first Volume of the Good Earth.Characters are three-dimensional. Their behaviours are most of the time Chinese-like, though we have to accept the fact that Pearl has been influenced greatly by western romancism love tremendously, being an American herself. I would like to praise the part of the story in which Yuan goes to America to study. I think it is very faithfully written. Perhaps one of the reasons why I prefer this book to its first volume &quot;The Good Earth&quot; is because A House Divided is closer to my life ---- I am a teenager who is studying in a foreign country alone. That is what Literature is all about ---- our life. I truly have reflected upon all the difficulties Yuan has faced during his American studying, and it matches my situation well.If you are a reader who is very interested in Chinese culture, this book is definitely a good choice for you. It has helped me to understand my home country -- China better too. I indeed am surprised by the good work of Pearl Buck. She has indeed shown the West the East well.The story ends in the near-death time of Yuan's father, the Tiger who has treated Yuan extremely well despite his bad temper. However, Pearl ended by writing that Yuan tried to kiss Meiling, the girl who he loved. I do not think this is appropriate in a situation where a person, especialy the father is to die. What filial piety does this Chinese son have? Well, I shall the chance is so slim that it is almost zero percent.Give it a try. I like this last volume the most among the three Good Earth Volumes."},{"Title":"A House Divided (House of Earth, Volume 3)","review":"This third book in The Good Earth series was somewhat a slower read the the previous two. However, the story was wonderful, and despite the ending, which some might find unrealistic, I enjoyed it. I was so pleased that Yuan found happiness, acceptance and love.I found the themes of the book relevant today in that our culture, ideas, lifestyles, and the influence and relationships with our children, effect their lives and influence future choices.Yaun was deeply loved by the Tiger, however, was not free to grow into an individual. This somewhat stunted Yuan emotionally, and he found himself in constant conflict over the ideas of his father and the new China. His time in America began to mature Yuan. It allowed him to return home to begin his journey into manhood and make choices about his future. However, although he now had choices, he was still duty bound to his family by a debt incurred by the Tiger.The book was wonderful and I am sorry to see the Good Earth series end."},{"Title":"A House Divided (House of Earth, Volume 3)","review":"The final book in the House of Earth trilogy was my least favorite and most disconnected of the three. She jumps into the third generation and third book with not a whole lot of background or character development (except for Yuan), so I cared the least about the characters, their situations and trials. The story was interesting, but I found that I could not relate as well to the characters or understand their plight. But I think she did a marvelous job at showing the differences between the generations and how exposure to new ideas, cultures and technology can quickly change the traditions of a culture; sometimes the change is good and beneficial, sometimes it's detrimental. I also like how she juxtiposed Yuan, who tries to hold on to his tradition and country and resists change, to other family members who embraced the change with all their hearts. I think that The Good Earth is a brillant read, but if you missed the next two in the trilogy it wouldn't be a tragedy."},{"Title":"A House Divided (House of Earth, Volume 3)","review":"A HOUSE DIVIDED is the final book of Pearl S. Buck's trilogy about the family of Wang Lung, the protagonist of THE GOOD EARTH. This book finds his grandson, Wang Yuan, son of the warlord Wang the Tiger, graduating from the war college at the beginning of the first Chinese Cultural Revolution. Yuan, a serious, thoughtful, but willful boy does not want to follow in his father's footsteps, but instead feels an affinity with the earth and growing things as his grandfather Wang Lung did.Yuan defies his father and runs away to live in his grandfather's old mud farmhouse. This begins a chain of events which take Yuan across the world. He ends up in the coastal city where his half-sister and her mother live, as well as his uncle, Wang the Landlord, along with his spoiled family. Yuan gets exposed to, but never really embraces, the westernized party lifestyle of his half-sister and the revolutionary activities of his cousins Sheng and Meng.After Yuan is arrested as a revolutionary, his family ransoms him and sends him to study in America, where he spends six years attaining an advanced degree in horticulture. Being a foreigner in a strange land causes Yuan to examine all his feelings, beliefs and prejudices. He is doubly introspective when he returns to China and sees his country anew through foreign eyes. Yuan is caught in a trap by his education, neither belonging wholly to either the old China or the new, his heart as divided as his family - half live in the modern coastal city and half live back in the country.I thought this was the best of the trilogy because Yuan's introspection makes him the most well-developed and conflicted character in this multi-generational tale.

And yes, Mary Anne is getting new plots (NOT a new boyfriend, which is good). Her heart has just about healed from Logan;I'm glad Ann didn't latch her onto another boyfriend like so many other series would have done. I liked that she joined the yearbook in a previous book &amp; she's doing more things. It's so heartwarming that her house has been re-built &amp; she &amp; her family move back in. I loved the descriptions; I felt as if I were right there with Mary Anne &amp; my heart just warmed for her. She's been through so much pain &amp; suffering in her life &amp; it's good that she's happier now &amp; at peace. She deserves peace &amp; happiness; she's such a good, courageous person! I liked how she sensed that Sunny was still hurting from losing her mom, even though Sunny was hiding her pain under a facade of cheerfulness &amp; she comforted Sunny, even when Dawn got mad at Sunny. It was funny how when the girls snuck off to New York City, Mary Anne felt so guilty. I was sooo sure that she was going to break down &amp; fess up! I'm surprised that she didn't. The ending was gave such a sense of peace &amp; closure &amp; I'm glad that Mary Anne's feeling peaceful these days."},{"Title":"Welcome Home, Mary Anne (Baby-Sitters Club Friends Forever #11)","review":"After several months of sorrow, pain, and fear, Mary Anne finally grounds herself. She discovers where she belongs, and she feels a sense of peacefulness again.After loosing her home, (and everything she owns) in a fire, Mary Anne feels lost. I'm glad that she has regained some self-assurance.I disagree with the reviews below me on how Mary Anne should have &quot;moved on.&quot; You never get over something like that entirely. It was very realistic to create three books in this series on her situation. (Four if you count the BSC series) If Ann wrapped up this plot to quickly, her character wouldn't have gone through the grieving process of loosing her home realistically.In #131 of the BSC series, you saw Mary Anne shocked because she's lost her home, but she's numb. She doesn't really feel that pain until the end of the story. In #3 and #8 in the Friends Forever series, she's trying to get over that shock.#11 concludes the fire. It's put out in her mind, at least for now. She finally feels as if she's gone home. I look forward to reading more about Mary Anne Spier. Meanwhile, I also enjoyed how Sunny Winslow was tied into this book from the California Diaries series. It was like Ann tied in two main plot lines from two different series and put them both into one story. I too lost my mom to cancer (in fact she died a month before the book where Sunny's mom passes is puplished), so I can relate.Good job Ann Martin for a touching ending to this plot and for Sunny's story to be brought in as well. I look forward to reading more about both of your strong characters."},{"Title":"Welcome Home, Mary Anne (Baby-Sitters Club Friends Forever #11)","review":"I TOTALLY recommend this book for people that like Sunny, Dawn, and the rest of the BSC friends Forever series. in thsi book, Mary Anne has finally moved in to her new house, and Dawn is coming to Stoneybrook with Sunny, the best friend of Dawn's that's mother died from Lung cancer.

I thought it was funny how active Sunny was."},{"Title":"Welcome Home, Mary Anne (Baby-Sitters Club Friends Forever #11)","review":"I thought this book was okay. I liked how Mary Anne helps Sunny and all, but I think that the book focused too much on Sunny's situation. It was nice hearing about the house and about Jeff though. I think it was very sad when her house burned down because they had so many memories of it. Dawn seemed shocked by the changes at first, and Sunny was going hyperactive. But the book really wasn't that good. The next one seems better."},{"Title":"Welcome Home, Mary Anne (Baby-Sitters Club Friends Forever #11)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book as much as I usually do the newest in this series, but I have a problem with the plot development. This is the 11th book in the series and Mary Anne's plot line is still focused on the fire and its effects on MA. While I am sure that a family catastrophe like that would have lasting effects on a girl her age, I think Mary Anne's next installment book should have a new adventure or experiance. Kristy's books in this set have had diversity of plot and so have Stacey's. Let's get Mary Anne some ineteresting new story lines. A new project at school (she could work on yearbook or newspaper) a new hobby, or even a new boyfriend would improve her plot considerably.

I think it focused on Sunny and Dawn too much. I think that MA needs some new hobbies, etc. to make her books more interesting! My fave books out of this series are the ones on Stacey and Claudia 'cuz they're the only ones that seem real enough to me! I think that Ann Martin needs to make MA seem more interesting; such as getting a new BOYFRIEND cuz Logan is such a bad boyfriend. the most interesting book on Mary Anne is Mary Anne's Revenge. but after that it's this one.

Libertus the main character is a freedman, working as a Pavement maker (Mosaic Artist) in Glevum (modern day Gloucester.) He has an influential Roman patron Marcus Septimus who calls on him frequently because of his ability to solve mysteries. These books differ from the Lindsey Davis and David Wishart books as Libertus is portrayed as a person attuned to his surroundings rather than with the manner of a New York cop. For those who have read the other books, this is just as good. Not much about the plot here, but why spoil it. Buy the book."},{"Title":"Murder in the Forum (A Libertus Mystery of Roman Britain)","review":"This is a very good entry in Rosemary Rowe's interesting series of Roman Britian. Libertus and his patron Marcus solve a mystery involving the death of a very unpleasant character called Perennis Felix. Along the way we meet up with some fascinating characters and learn quite a bit about Roman life, particularly in Glevum (modern Gloucester). Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Murder in the Forum (A Libertus Mystery of Roman Britain)","review":"Rowe's third Libertus offering - \`Murder in the Forum', is a splendidly crafted effort. We are plunged immediately into a difficult situation for Libertus as he is confronted by an overly obnoxious and well connected imperial representative, Lucius Tigidius Perennis Felix, who has swept into Glevum with the apparent intent to marry his plain daughter Phyllidia to Marcus Aurelius Septimus, Libertus' patron. Unfortunately, continuing straight from the previous novel, Marcus is happily living with Julia Delicta (the ex-wife of the murderd Corfinium decurion, Quintus) several hours away and Libertus is forced to race to \`fetch' him with Felix's imperious guard and hinted lover, Zetso. Realising the real reason for Felix's visit, Marcus hastily married Julia before speeding back to the civic banquet thrown (under some duress) for Felix at the house of the dog-loving Gaius Flavius Flaminius.Having thoroughly set up Felix as a universally hated man (in no means by his brutal murder of Marcus' envoy) it comes as no surprise we watch dispassionately as he seemingly chokes to death on a nut halfway through the banquet. Immediately Libertus suspects the redhaired Celt masquerading as a noble, Egobarbus, and Zetso, both of whom have gone missing. The suspect hasty departure of Octavius (later found to be the beau of Phyllidia) also has Libertus chasing shadows until he located one of Gaius' dogs dead of poisoning. There is a moment of splendid parody as Gaius commissions Libertus to construct a mosaic for him dedicated to the fallen canine.So, Libertus ends up being robbed, we have to deal with 3 suspicious almond smelling phials of poison, Octavius' \`confession', and Felix's mysterious dealings with the red haired Celts before we move towards the denoument. There is a neat scene where Libertus has to represent Marcus at the funeral rites to his herald (an action which gives us the methods by which the Celts escaped the city after the murder)A quick scamper north to a mansio reveals the true state of Egobarbus and Libertus is able to track down Zetso which with much impunity that results in him questioning an imperial seal and being thrown into prison for his troubles, allows him to garner more half truths. As Rowe neatly uses the trick of one character giving further incriminating answers to questions that he is misunderstanding, it means Libertus is able to uncover a far greater conspiracy. It all ends with Libertus up on charges of treason in front of Pertinax with Zetso. The latter panics, reveals all whilst still under the misapprehension that everyone else knows about the greater conspiracy and thus permits Libertus to escape his crime on the basis of saving the emperor.Rowe's third installment is excellent. Her writing style has progressed enormously since the first book and the adventures of Libertus and Junio are a delighful addition to the Roman murder mystery genre. Well worth reading...."},{"Title":"Murder in the Forum (A Libertus Mystery of Roman Britain)","review":"Marcus drafts Libertus to investigate the death of an arrogant visitor with Imperial ties. But Libertus' suspicion of the Imperial warrant may end in his own death.Involving story, as Libertus tries to solve the mystery without getting himself or his patron in trouble with the Emperor, and a satisfactory ending.

I have cultivated an unspeakable tie to this unique land and its people. I began screening movies such as Kundun and Seven Years in Tibet. I have imagined and pictured Tibet according to Harrer's lively and mindful description during his residence in Lhasa. &quot;The Spirit of Tibet&quot; graciously allows me, for the very first time, to see Tibet unveiling its mysterious yet solemn beauty. A few other readers have complimented on the artistics and aesthetics of this collection. The collection really touches me because it communicates an unfailing passion. After the Chinese invasion in 1950, it is the Tibetan spirit and passion that sustain and unite the country and its people. When you look through the pictures, try to look into the Tibetans' eyes. Behind these eyes you will free yourself from the ordinary and see their life struggles, one and one, rooted deep in their mind and soul."},{"Title":"The Spirit of Tibet: Portrait of a Culture in Exile","review":"As a photographer and teacher of the photo arts it is easy to realize the quality of capturing the humanity of the people in this beautiful book. Alison Wright has done an excellent job. Place this in you home so that the tragedy that has been inflicted on the Tibetan people by the brutal and ruthless government of China is not forgotten.Additional reads on the subject should include Tears of Blood / A Cry For Tibet by Mary Craig and for those who like their history in the style of Hollywood check out Kun Dun by Martin Scorcese, 7 years in Tibet, and Little Budda.This book will move you to write your elected officials and ask them to support policies that will get China out of Tibet. You may also want to visit the official website for the Government of Tibet in Exile."},{"Title":"The Spirit of Tibet: Portrait of a Culture in Exile","review":"One thing is clear from this beautiful and touching portrait of Tibetans living in exile in Northern India: Alison Wright was devoted to capturing the essence of the Tibetan character, and she did so brilliantly. Not only do her photographs capture the stark color contrasts and subtle shades of light in the tiny mountain village of Dharamsala, but she masterfully captures the almost-inexplicable joy and humor that the Tibetans display despite their ongoing hardships. Her subjects range from small smiling children with rosy cheeks to weathered old monks whose eyes seem to hold a million stories. Central to the work is her unique portraits of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Her picture of the Dalai Lama's hands holding a string of prayer beads is particularly captivating. Another exceptionally good photograph shows a young Tibetan man waiting reverently to see the Dalai Lama, his head turned expectantly, looking excited yet restrained. In sum, there are many collections of Tibetan images available these days, but, in my opinion, Ms. Wright's work should be the first one you buy. Bravo, Ms. Wright! Give us more! -- by S.A.

In her vibrant visual sojourn with the Tibetan refugees in Dharamsala, India,she reveals lives rich in reflection and celebration, and creates a doorway into a culturethat survives in spite of travail. Nuns, monks, musicians, yak herders, children, the survivors of political prisons and His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, animate the pages. Her compositions are stunning, the color and light with which she adeptly enflames her subjects exuding both strength and intimacy. A short forward by the photographer underscores the spirit of the composition, but truly this is a book that needs few words. Wright, whose work appears frequently in the Examiner, is most articulate in her photography; and that is worth countless lines of text. &quot;Good intent very important.

Instead, she gets on the only plane available from the Vancouver airport and heads for Hawaii. But, that isn't nearly far enough away to get away from Rob's drug dealing Stepfather. Greg has a reason to eliminate Rob and Aunt Penny. While Rob didn't see Greg kill his mother who is now missing, he did witness Greg kill a fellow drug dealer.Instead of just running, most people would have gone tot the Police. That wasn't an option for Penny, as she doesn't trust the Toronto Police. For eleven long years, her father, severely wounded in a bank heist and forced to live his days in a wheelchair, has been a suspect in the robbery. Virtually broke, he has denied all and his family has lived with the public humiliation of being a suspect. Now, with no other option readily available, Penny has fled to Hawaii and taken Robb with her.Unbeknownst to her, there is a contract out on her and the boy, put out by Greg on behalf of his bosses. She is being tracked and the killers are moving into place to take them out while making sure that everything appears to be an accident. At the same time, so are the Police in the form of Detective Jack Kinkaid. Unaware of the contract or what Robb saw, he follows them both to Hawaii thinking that Penny comes from a bad family and is a drug courier. Before long, he begins to realize that not only is he attracted to her as he hangs around her undercover, she may be in fact totally innocent. But will he put the pieces together fast enough to give their romance a chance, let alone save Penny and Rob's lives?Featuring complex human characters driven by family dynamics and a need to find happiness, this mystery is very enjoyable and features a frantic pace with a shocking twist at the end. Wile most of the elements of the mystery are identified very early on, removing all questions, the read is still very entertaining as Penny and Rob do their best to elude everyone while trusting almost no one. At the same time, facets of each character are slowly revealed and done so skillfully, that the story does not slow down at all. As the pace picks up so does a very complicated romance between Penny and Jack that shocks both characters with its intensity. Then, when the reader thinks everything is settled, there is one final twist in this 197-page book that caps off the wild tale, making this book well worth the read.Book Facts:Tour Into DangerBy Lea TassieElectric eBook Publishingwww.electricebookpublishing.com2003ISBN # 1-55352-076-9Large Trade Paperback$13.95 US$18.95 CanadaKevin R.

The boy's mother, Penny's sister Angela, is nowhere to be found. Penny's years of mistrust of the police, the aftermath of the bank robbery which cost her father his health and reputation, prevent her seeking help from them.The book follows Penny and Rob as they try to elude unknown forces that menace them from every side.

If everyone treated people like this gentlemen did, life on earth would be spectacular."},{"Title":"Horse Sense for People","review":"Monty Roberts is to me - and no doubt to thousands of others - the no 1 &#34;Horse whisperer&#34; around. I am happy to have met him, here in Sweden, and also having interviewed him on TV. We are the same age and I am also part of the &#34;horse world&#34; as it were.Now, in this book he widens the context to include parallells with the &#34;human world&#34;, which makes this &#34;horsebook&#34; infinitely more interesting and attractive to a much, much larger readership. And Monty is &#34;spot on&#34; with humans as well!"},{"Title":"Horse Sense for People","review":"Poorly organised and written, interminable yarns from his stables, and one not particularly original idea (willing cooperation is better than coercion).There is one practical application offered, the positive and negative contract blackboards for children, which may be worth a try.The horse starting/breaking stuff is interesting (if you haven't heard it before) but also frustrating because he leaves out so much detail. For example he keeps referring to giving horses the choice of joining up or work, but doesn't say what work for an unbroken horse means."},{"Title":"Horse Sense for People","review":"More horse sense from Monty. If you love horses and want to understand them better, Monty's books are a \\"must read.\\""},{"Title":"Horse Sense for People","review":"Monty Roberts is a horse trainer who has developed a deserved reputation as a horse psychologist. He is one of a growing community of horse, dog and other trainers who work with the natural instincts of the animal instead of trying to break the animal's will and force it to yield to ours.In this book, he applies some of his horse insights to people and human relationships. That's less far-fetched than it sounds. Roberts has a significant consulting business, bringing corporate types out to his ranch to show off his leadership techniques. He has also fostered a few dozen children, and has a lot of experience in trying to do that effectively. This book includes a lot of stories from both corporations and foster children, along with some stories of his own past and working with his horses. He has some interesting ideas for child rearing, dealing with troubled adults and children, and team building in the workplace.Unfortunately, the resulting mix is pretty disorganized, especially in the first fifty pages or so. After that, his chapters on violence and trust are much more unified, but then the concluding sections get disorganized again. He has lots of insights into human relationships but they are scattered. Roberts also includes substantial irrelevant materials, including a horrific story about a woman's abuse as a child - - it's meant to show how animals can heal damaged people, but he never actually tells that part of the story or how it connects to his general theory of \\"Join-Up.\\"Roberts also seems unaware of the paradoxes in \\"Join-Up,\\" which he envisions as a non-coercive technique for allowing the horse free will to do what he wants it to do. Join-Up always entails the horse \\"choosing\\" to accept a saddle, bridle, and rider. It does not entail Roberts choosing to join the herd under a stallion's leadership. It is indeed non-violent but it does entail power, hierarchy, and subtle coercion. So do his recommendations for families and the workforce.Make no mistake - - his ideas are a big improvement on the status quo. But a more self-critical approach to the ideas and (especially) a much tighter organization would have made this a much stronger book."},{"Title":"Horse Sense for People","review":"This book is an easy read for people interrested in horses- combined with people recoveries.

It helped me makeing sence of a whole bundle of feelings, ideas, perseptions and ideals.

I didn't end up finishing this book."},{"Title":"Horse Sense for People","review":"I enjoy self-help/psychology books, and was intrigued by his idea of using body language to communicate with horses. I haven't read any of his other books, so the information about Equus (the language of horses) was new and completely fascinating.Roberts' main method of transferring his horse ideas to people is by telling heartwarming 'communication' stories from corporations and by telling heartwarming anecdotes about how he saved yet another troubled teen's life with his kind and steadfast nature.As much as I can admire someone who starts horses in less than half an hour, and as much as I can agree that it's better not to hurt defenseless animals, extrapolating these theories to &quot;violence is never the answer&quot; makes me roll my eyes.It would be better if he had stayed with specifics and not tried to lay down a world-guiding philosophy. Because when you get right down to it, if the question is serious enough, (Like, &quot;should the South secede from the Union&quot;) violence is the only possible answer.The stories are interesing enough to make up for it, but I could have done without the self-congratulatory air.

It is not eloquent, but it is gentle and easy to understand. I liked the book because he describes, in full, how the language of Equus works. Then, by comparing horse stories and human stories, both from his experience, he shows how a non-violent, positive relationship builds rapport and effectiveness in dealing with people and animals alike.The book felt pretty repetitive about half way through. That is why I was glad that I had checked it out at the library instead of spending twenty-some bucks on it at a bookstore. Although I didn't agree with every one of his points, I liked his message and having the opportunity to see issues, such as parenting, from another point of view."},{"Title":"Horse Sense for People","review":"Monty Roberts' \\"Horse Sense for People\\" is a good book about an extraordinary person. Rising above his own abusive childhood where he suffered 71 broken bones by age 12 from his father's beatings he has shown that his Join-Up method with horses can be used to \\"tame\\" unruly children. He and his wife Pat raised 47 foster children plus three of their own. Roberts said, \\"I had show there is a better life if you get rid of violence.\\"Roberts turned the horse world on its head and gained international fame when he developed a technique called Join-Up based on communicating with horses using their natural body language. He says communication among humans and horses enables Join-Up and has identified 187 signs with which he can communicate with a horse. He says, \\"The language of the horse is the language of gestures. It is a gift we all have.\\"Roberts has trained over 70,000 wild horses and usually gets and out-of-control horse to accept saddle, bridle and rider in 30 minutes. He learned to \\"listen\\" to horses by paying attention to the way they communicate with each other with their ears, eyes and body postures. An essential part of Join-Up is the breakthrough moment when a horse bonds and nudges him.Now 70, Roberts rode his first horse at age three, won his first riding trophy at age 4 and spent most of his life working as a competitive rider trainer, winning four world championships and training hundreds of stakes-wining racehorses.Roberts is the author of three best sellers including the book \\"The Man Who Listens to Horses\\" that sold 4.5 million copies. He wrote the book at the urging of Queen Elizabeth II who invited Roberts to train her equestrian staff. His work inspired \\"The Horse Whisperer\\" a best selling novel by Nicholas Evans that was made into the movie starring Robert Redford.Roberts travels the world giving lectures and demonstrating his techniques. Much of the money from his non-profit organization goes to local charities and communities he visits. He also holds dozens of workshops at his \\"Flag is Up\\" farm in California for corporate executives (representatives from over 200 corporations attended the past decade), businesses, educators, social workers and other leaders who want to create conditions that foster trust, cooperation and partnership to improve efficiency, motivation and satisfaction.For years the educational authorities were skeptical about Roberts' discipline methods until a failing British School adopted his practices in a last-ditch attempt to evade closure. The results were spectacular. In less than four years the Kingshurst Junior School in Solihule was transformed into a center of excellence. The 290 pupils with 40% special needs children love going to school now.Roberts, a grandfather with a cowboy hat, is now inundated with requests for help from schools all over the world. For discipline he uses signed contracts titled \\"A Road Map to Excellence\\" that outline the effects of children's positive and negative behavior. Roberts says, \\"Before they act they must know the consequences of their actions. Contracts allow kids to manage their own lives. It's about assuming responsibility...there is no such thing as teaching-only learning.\\"Roberts discovered that many people who cry or faint when the horse nudges him in Join-Up have experienced mental or physical abuse.Roberts says people, like horses, perform better in environments that \\"request\\" rather than \\"demand\\" where they are willing partners.Central to Roberts' horse training methods is the complete elimination of physical and emotional violence. He says, \\"The more you use pain, force and coercion, the more the horse holds back and tries to fight.\\"Roberts admits that applying pain may result in obedience and compliance but says it is ultimately counterproductive as there is no choice. Teaching through partnership allows the freedom to choose and produces a sense of accomplishment that is more productive than force and intimidation.Roberts has performed his horse-gentling techniques before hundreds of thousands of people around the world. He says, \\"Remaining cool and getting out of the punishment business is critical to having an effective relationship with horses and children.\\""},{"Title":"Horse Sense for People","review":"Monty Roberts finally crosses from the realm of horses to that of people. It's about time. His non-violent approach to horses and his lessons well learned and described in &quot;The Man Who Listens to Horses&quot; are finally extended to the world of human interactions, from family dynamics to the corporate sky scraper. How will we survive and flourish together? Monty goes to the heart of these issues and brings a philosphy necessary for Millennial Man. We can live by Monty Robert's philosophy or wallow in the muck of the disintegrating status quo. If everyone who reads this book comes away with one new idea then it is a resounding success.Monty maintains his easy style and voice and uses the anecdotal approach to teaching. It is extremely readable. Some people may not be comfortable with Monty outside of the horse world, but in fact he never leaves it, using analogies whenever appropriate.I hope that this book is one of many where experts in empathy, understanding and non-violence leaves the niches and comes to the forefront so we can all learn to make the world a better place for all living things."},{"Title":"Horse Sense for People","review":"I haven't read his other books and didn't expect him to be Ernest Hemingway. I know him as a magician with horses, not words. However, I was very impressed with his simple style; he doesn't belabor a point or show-off with big words. Therefore, his message shines through loud and clear; our general thinking about how to raise kids and relate to each other has much to be improved upon and he shows us a way to do it that is miles ahead of anything I've read anywhere including the mental health field. I understand Publisher's Weekley's criticism from a literary point of view but, heh, let's focus on the message; a message that is the answer to our present 'civilized' society's major problems. Any criticism of his book manifests a tenacity to hang on to traditional ways of thinking, thinking that has taken us to war overseas, in our schools, and into our own backyards. Monty is simply telling us to learn from nature, and its telling us that violence disrupts, gentleness and patience restores."},{"Title":"Horse Sense for People","review":"Less Horse, More PeopleI'm not that interested in social reform, so I liked this book least of the three written by Mr. Roberts. It's about applying Join-Up principles to people, at all levels of society. Philosophy is interspersed with stories of the author's experiences with remedial horses and people. Key statements are 'Violence is never the answer', 'Violence is always for the violator and never for the victim', and 'No one of us was born with the right to say 'you must or I'll hurt you' to any other creature, animal or human'.The book is not clear on exactly what it means by violence. (Page 68: -quote- All of this raises the question, \\"How do you define violence?\\" It's a very difficult question with no simple answer. -endquote-) 'Coercive Violence', is my best guess. I am unsure if the nonviolence statements were meant to extend to human self-defense.The author himself describes man as 'fight', horses as 'flight'. Thus, they're very different. It seems logical that horse-human analogies must fall apart eventually, specially if you believe (as I do) that people are moral beings and can choose to do right or wrong in ways that horses cannot. The book also gives brief opinions on a few subjects that really deserve thorough study and discussion before conclusions are drawn; firearm restriction, criminal incarceration, tracking devices for offenders, spanking.*Content Note: Parents getting this book for pre- or young teens should know that it includes a vivid story of sexual abuse, told in the victim's words.If you are looking for information on horses and Join-Up, I suggest you buy Mr. Robert's other fascinating books \\"The Man Who Listens to Horses\\" and \\"Shy Boy\\". Give \\"Horse Sense for People\\" a test run at your library before parting with cash.These are my personal opinions only and you may react to the book quite differently. This review is not intended in ANY way as a detraction of Mr. Monty Robert's fine work with horses or even of the application of some \\"Horse Sense\\" (common sense?) to people."},{"Title":"Horse Sense for People","review":"This book will appeal to people who love animals and children. It has a genuinely sincere voice that engages the reader despite the ghostwriter's slightly offputting imprint. I was charmed, moved, and inspired by Monty Roberts' common sense advice. If this book lacks literary eloquence, it is more than made up for in the meaning of the stories it tells.&quot;Gentle Wisdom&quot; may be redundant, but this book is not.If you have children, or animals, or you know someone who does, this book deserves to be placed in your library right next to Dr. Spock."},{"Title":"Horse Sense for People","review":"Monty Roberts is a master in all methods of knowledge (horsemanship, writing, etc.). This book, although not quite to the level of his great The Man Who Listens to Horses, still contains vital information for all those who would like to learn about the many lessons that life has to offer. His books should be read by all, including those who have to knowledge or interest in horses."},{"Title":"Horse Sense for People","review":"Monty Roberts has crossed the line from horses to the realm of people. It is about time. Monty reaches down to take out everything the horse have taught him and gives a straight-forward and pragmatic description of how people can better interact without physical violence or emotional domination. How easily his ideas move to families and the work place!This book is long overdue. While other books try their best to unearth their way into an aspect of human behavior, Monty uses his gentle style to sketch the framework for an entirely new way for human to relate with as little friction as possible.Books like this don't come often and are rarely couched in a way that is easy to understand and intuitive. It is truly a backbone work for Millennial Man."},{"Title":"Horse Sense for People","review":"I liked this book because of the author sharing his respect for all living things.

I especially like his books as am a horse lover myself."},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"This is not a &quot;three steps to understanding organizations&quot; type book. The people posting negative reviews for this were looking for something simple and digestable - this book is not that. However, if you take the time, you will find it profoundly alters your thinking about understanding organizations.This book provides solid theoretical models for understanding what is occuring in organizations. I read this book over 10 years ago and STILL find it the second best and most enlightening thing I have ever read on organizations. This has dramatically aided me in being a very successful business consultant.The foundation of this book is the notion that you cannot understand complex organizations in any meaningful way through a single perspective. People in the organizations operate on many different perspectives. Each view of the world creates its own understanding of the organizational problems, solutions and daily pattern of interaction. This book provides you the tools for understanding organizations through a number of key perspectives or metaphors, and gives you indications on how to perform a multi-perspective systems analysis.If you spend the time with this book, you will find yourself able to understand your surroundings FAR better than your peers."},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, thinkers have used evocative images in trying to explain just what a corporation is. Have they succeeded? Gareth Morgan presents a thoughtful, well-documented look at images that arise from our theories and metaphors about reality. He discusses how they shape the way we view the corporation as an entity and how we act. His analysis involves a mix of philosophy, history, sociology, anthropology, biology and organizational examples. He moves from industrial-age notions of the organization as a machine, to biological analogies about the organization as an organism. Other metaphors - the organization as a brain, as social reality, as the source of cultural difference and as an arena for power struggles - shape what occurs within corporations. While this book is not an easy read, it illuminates the dynamics of organizational life. We [...] recommend this book to executives, and to readers intrigued by serious societal expositions."},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"Morgan decribes common assumptions about organizations - he helps to reveal the hidden assumptions behind the managers perceptions. What do we mean when we say that 'organizations are like animals'? It is pretty easy to start to think from a metaphor, and end up in literal believing in it (e.g. that 'organizations live and die', 'organizations have evolutions'). Such reifications are carefully described by Morgan - several most recurrent metaphors of organizations and popular organization theories basing on them are clearly described, and their pros and cons are pointed out. Having read 'Images of Organizations', it is much more difficult to adopt illusionate metaphors, and to get persuaded by a biased visioner."},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"Gareth Morgan's book provides an antidote to the finance, marketing and HR texts that are required reading for an MBA student. The clever use of metaphor allows the reader to absorb the huge anount of information contained within the book (check out the bibliography!) - you don't even realise how much you are learning until you start relating concepts to others around you. My fellow students, colleagues and even my parents had to listen ...I found it a very easy to read book, if you are willing to put aside your existing ideas (psychic prison) about the way the organisation works(?) If you prefer big words, read Morgan and Burrell's Sociological Paradigms and Organisational Analysis - essential reading, but even more brilliant as a companion to Images.Learn the stuff you are expected to know from your finance, marketing, statistics, strategy and HR texts, but understand the stuff that will change your world from Images of Organisation."},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"This book is quite accessible to the reader. It's not dry like most textbooks, but talks about organizations in a straightforward manner. Morgan presents various ways of looking at organizations through the use of metaphors.This is what made the book so good. Each chapter examines a different metaphor applied to organization. Metaphors such as &quot;...as machines&quot;, and &quot;...as brains&quot; shed light on different aspects of organizations. What makes the book even better is that, in the summary of each chapter, Morgan also looks at the weaknesses of each metaphor, thus giving the reader a very thorough examination of the concept.The reason I didn't give this book 4 stars was the fact that, later in the book, it got kind of hard to follow. By the time he got to &quot;Organizations as Psychic Prisons&quot;, I was way out of my league. The chapters got convoluted and hard to understand. The chapter summaries ended up being half as long as the chapter itself. I just kind of gave up on some of them...they weren't helping me at all.All in all, if you want to learn about how organizations work, this is a very good book, but be wary of the last third or so."},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"thanks for your dealing i will deal again and again with you because it was nice to deal with you"},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"I am a graduate student in organizational development. Although this book has some good underlying concepts, I found most of the book hard to follow and not very engaging. It was often difficult to see how many of the concepts actually apply to organizations. There may be good ideas, but they often get lost in the rambling chapters."},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"This is a fantastic book for those people who are slowly losing their grip on reality. While some of the basic underlying concepts are good I don't find myself practically applying the concept of psychic prisons to my organisation, nor do I view my staff as ameobas that make up a large organism. I have to admit though that I know of others who found the paradyme of organisations as instruments of domination highly arousing."},{"Title":"Appearance of Counsel","review":"&quot;In Appearance of Counsel, Andrew McAleer has written a marvelous Boston crime novel focusing on attorney Joe Gleason and both his family and friends around him.

This one, an edition of four hundred copies, contains a single Bukowski poem. A quick trip to bookfinder.com shows that it's going for between $75 and $100 these days, or well over ten dollars a page. (There were another two hundred issued in 1994 to commemorate Buk's death. Don't bother, they're going for the same price.) While it's questionable whether any poetry is worth more than ten bucks a page, \\"If We Take--\\" is one of Buk's finer achievements. He both keeps the language at the \\"elevated\\" level definitions of poetry call for and, as a bonus, sticks pretty close to the image, as much of his best material does. As well, unlike most Buk poetry, this is (obviously) a very small dose, so the reader isn't confronted with four hundred plus pages of Bukowski. A fine introduction to the man's work, but really quite overpriced at this point. ****"},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"I remember reading this book some 30 years ago.

An excellently written book, it depicts more than oil scandals and an obsession-worthy transatlantic flight, but the psychology of a nation in a period of profound, rapid, and radical change. One finds plenty to laugh about as well, as it is very witty and insightful. The two aspects I found dull or misguiding were the following: 1) The Nicaraguan &quot;situation,&quot; as the book calls it, is not well-depicted at all. This is because the book was written barely out of the Twenties; I suppose Allen did not find the subject important enough to discuss in any length above 4 sentences total. Consider Peter Davis's &lt;i&gt; Where is Nicaragua? &lt;/i&gt; for a more accurate portrayal of what the U.S. was involved in until 1931 in that country. 2)I am a high school student severely lacking expertise in economics, thus I found the last chapters rather difficult.

The country is already divided between the forces of \\"decency\\" and the predators, who, at the most articulate levels, profess \\"laissez faire capitalism.\\"The object of this French term is the United States government. By 1918 it was a fast ship, roaring to the aid of the beleaguered peoples of Europe, tipping the balance in the \\"war to end wars\\" in favor of the right side. In this spirit also, prohibition was passed. The moment the war came to an end, the American people fled from the banners of decency just as fast as their legs could carry them. The government became a derelict hulk captained by token presidents.Wilson drove himself to death trying in vain to bring about a \\"just and lasting peace.\\" Harding, the great American \\"good guy\\", enmeshed himself in the \\"Teapot Dome Scandals\\" perpetrated by his friends, the Texas oil millionaires. The author speculates that his rather unexpected death was a concealed suicide. The oil intended for U.S. naval reserves went elsewhere at a large profit, much to Japan.The south rose again in the form of the resurrected Klu Klux Klan (the book does not mention its previous disbanding by the actual confederate veterans). They ruled at the state and local levels (hence \\"states rights\\"). Justice was an open joke, but who cared about it? The American people were busy pursuing a sexual revolution and illicit booze. The satirist, H. L. Mencken, had a field day. Al Capone ruled Chicago. Hundreds of rackets sprang up everywhere and small businessmen paid taxes to the mob.Why did the government not act? Mammon was God and was being preached not only by the clergy from the pulpit but by its new apostles, the salesmen. \\"Hands off\\", they said, and that will be the best. The little people attempted to defend themselves and their jobs through unions and were assaulted by reactionary forces acting at state and local levels. Anarchy and disorder were on the increase. The IWW reached maximum extent, especially in the west. Reactionaries countered with \\"the red scare.\\" Sacco and Vanzetti were executed for a crime the judge and prosecutor knew they did not commit, because they were \\"anarchists\\" (they were not).Reaching the end of the decade, the author gives us the handwriting on the wall: the crash of late 1929. Laissez faire, he hints, was not going to work in the 20th century. He could not then know of the rise of FDR, the suppression of the Klan, the legalization of unions, and the strengthening of the government into a social regulatory force and quasi-empire. Nor could he know that the divisiveness would continue, and the protagonists would be roughly the same. What a pity."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"This engaging account of the 1920's is an especially remarkable book given the year it was written: 1931. With remarkable detachment and prose which has stood up to the test of time, Frederick Lewis Allen wrote about the 1920's just after the decade had ended. Writing in a voice that is half that of a journalist and half that of a historian, Allen covers everything from presidents and presidential politics, to prohibition, the economy, sweeping social changes, the coming of mass media through radio, syndicated columnists, and increased attendance in movie houses; the red scare, the rise of business and science in popular esteem, religion, and a variety of other cultural and social events and trends. The modern era, it could be argued, began on Armistice Day, 11/11/1918.The trends and issues of the post-World War I decade resound with amazing familiarity today, at the dawn of the 21st Century. Through reading Allen's account the reader is reminded that McCarthyism that oft referred to &quot;ism,&quot; was hardly the invention of McCarthy, nor was it unique to the late 1940's and 1950's. A red scare based on hysteria and fear proceeded &quot;McCarthyism&quot; by a good thirty years. The red scare that was brought about by the Bolshevik Revolution was ferocious in its intensity. Fanned by the winds of a handful of true radicals, the red scare that came immediately after the war was characterized by labor unrest, the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, the trampling of any ideas or books that had a hint of &quot;Bolshevism,&quot; mass deportations of Communists (or suspected Communists), and the waiving of due process under law with mass arrests.Allen says the big red scare faded quickly, as it became all too evident that there really wasn't much Communist or Bolshevik subversion to begin with. Also, the country was ready for The Next Big Thing. &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; details a series of manias that swept the country in the twenties. One of these manias was a revolution in morals. Here too, the reader of the year 2000 is reminded that the sixties and early seventies were not the only time period of a sexual revolution in twentieth-century America. The post-war decade of the twenties was a dramatic precursor to what came later, and an important breaking off point, for many at least, from Victorian mores.Tired of Wilsonian idealism and weary from the First World War, American's were starved for a return to &quot;normalcy.&quot; From Marion, Ohio, Warren Harding seemed like just the man to succeed Wilson. Harding was swept into the White House in what would be the beginning of twelve years of Republican rule from Pennsylvania Avenue. No great intellectual, Harding was a genial man and the country took to him. Meanwhile, as it would be revealed after his timely death, Harding ran one of the most corrupt administrations in the nation's history. The scandals came to light after Harding died and the moralistic (although not necessarily idealistic) Calvin Coolidge was just the man for the times. The &quot;Coolidge Prosperity&quot; is aptly named in that most of the 1920's were good times economically for all but a few sectors of the economy. Coolidge ran the country with a maxim of what was good for business was good for the country. If he had any ideology that was probably it.The most capable of the three Republicans, or at least certainly the brightest, was Herbert Hoover, elected at the height of the Coolidge prosperity. Hoover was in office just over six months when the bubble burst The stock market-fueled by speculation-crashed, followed soon by a general economic collapse.With the Scopes Trial, sports mania, and the introduction and popularity of radio, the nation went from one craze to the next. Whether it was anti-Bolshevism, or stock market mania, these were all national manias with the help of new forms of communication as well as new ways of mass manipulation by editors and announcers.

Thus, he provides a quick, fresh glance back upon this exciting period - the \\"Roaring 20's\\" - that he'd personally just experienced.Allen touches briefly, but poignantly, on all the important political, economical and social aspects of American life in these years.

Harding - handsome, personable, decent, but unaware, apparently, of the scandals taking place around him; of \`silent' Calvin Coolidge and his era of prosperity; and of Herbert Hoover - well-meaning, but unable to find answers to the deteriorating economy and the approaching depression.Allen also describes the people, events and activities that impacted the lives of Americans in those years, including the fear of communism and socialism (\`The Red Scare'), women's emancipation, the growing proliferation and influence of radio, the impact of new magazines dealing with the movies, adventure, romance and true confessions, the importance of newly created newspaper empires and chains, beauty contests, changing fashions, cosmetics, advertising, and new automobiles (Ford's Model A). He describes the country's heroes and its new obsessions and fads: Babe Ruth and baseball, Charles Lindbergh and aviation, Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan doing verbal battle over religion at the Scopes' Monkey Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, Jack Dempsey, Gene Tunney and boxing, Bobby Jones and golf, Bill Tilden and tennis, flag-pole sitters, flappers, marathon dancing, scandals and crimes.Allen provides a wonderful chapter on prohibition - one of the really great issues of the era. The oft repeated message that man is destined to repeat past mistakes if he refuses toheed the lessons of history is demonstrated, I think, in this very chapter. Having succeeded in legislating this specific moral behavior (i.e., abstinence)the federal and state governments quickly learned that the people were not going to obey this law voluntarily, and that no one was going to be able to enforce it (sound like somebody's 'drug war'?!). Prohibition introduced - indeed, precipitated - a fascinating, new period in U.S. history: the country was soon awash with bootleggers, bathtub gin, speakeasies, gangwars, lawbreaking, hipflasks, sex, and exuberant hell-raising. Al Capone arrived in Chicago from New York, hired some 700 goons, armed them with shotguns and machine guns and tasked them with monopolizing Chicago's beer and liquor trade. When enormous profits started rolling in, the gangsters then moved into other lucrative business activities - gambling, horse racing, boxing, dance halls, prostitution, unions, restaurants, distilleries, breweries, etc. Life was good.Allen's chapter on the \`Big Bull Market' and the subsequent \`crash' of 1929 reminds one very much of America's more recent adventures involving Wall Street - of atime when investors were mesmerized by the seemingly perpetual rise of stock prices, while being at the same time oblivious to any possibility that stock prices could fall and thereby wipe out almost overnight their newly acquired fortunes. Of course, that's what happened then, and that's what happened to current investors quite recently. So much for respecting thelessons of history.On a happier note - history also shows that readers have been buying, reading, and enjoying this little book for some 7 decades. So, please do heed just this one lesson: read this book yourself! It's history reading at its best!"},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"The summer of 2002 is a very interesting time to be thinking about the 1920s, and this book is the perfect way to do that. One of Allen's major themes is the Big Bull Market of that decade -- how it gradually, little by little, seduced many economic thinkers into believing that the business cycle had been permanently changed for the better, and how stocks turned into a nationwide spectator sport. Sound familiar? As with our more recent bull market, the end wasn't pretty. But one of the things the book suggests is that we haven't seen anywhere near the calamity that followed the crash of 1929. (Allen finished the book in 1931.) I don't know that the book offers much guidance about what will happen next for us in 2002, but it does teach a powerful lesson about the ways that history repeats. Allen covers other ground, too, like the Teapot Dome scandal and the rise of Al Capone, as well as some of the more frivolous &quot;hot&quot; stories of the time. Among the other d&eacute;j&agrave; vu themes he hits is how easily distracted we are by trivial stories when the economy is good. Nicely written, still holds up remarkably well."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"Allen does not limit himself to the &quot;great man&quot; school of history, but gives a wide-ranging and colorful view of a decade disquietingly like the 90s/00s - a careening stock market, a failing war on drugs, and oil company execs in to clean up the White House. This book would get five stars for the Prohibition poem alone: &quot;...it doesn't prohibit worth a dime/Nevertheless, we're for it!&quot; One of the most interesting parts was what Allen doesn't - and couldn't - write about. Only Yesterday was written in 1931, before the full effects of Versailles had been felt. Viewed in that light, Allen's portrait of Wilson, while romanticized, astutely outlines why Wilson's ideas for the peace treaty were wise, and why they were so unlikely to ever be realized. From hemlines to geopolitics, Allen pulls it all together in a fascinating book."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"Anyone of the dwindling band of stock market contrarians will find fresh ammunition here. A bull market ushered in by a President beset with sex scandals and allegation of peculation, the rise of the stock market as the greatest ballyhoo of them all, the simultaneous collapse in commodities and the Fed's foredoomed efforts to stabilize the international system all have their counterparts today. A compelling social history intertwined with the ineluctable progress towards the disaster on Wall Street has all the elements of the finest tragedy. A book to rival 'The Titanic' in its sweep, it leaves Galbraith for dead as a narrative of this most fascinating of decades. Also consider Allen's follow-up account of the 30's aftermath in 'Since Yesterday' for an eyewitness account of the Depression and a surprising perspective on Roosevelt and the New Deal."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"This is exactly the type of history book I like to read. The subject matter is brought to life in a way simply not found in other authors. It reminded me quite a bit of Howard's Zinn's &quot;A People's History of the United States&quot; because I read that first and I wonder if Professor Zinn took a hint from Mr. Allen's style because they are very similar.I will remember events, people and places in this book long after I am done reading it (for a college class) simply because of the way the author seems to be talking directly to you.It is as if you are just sitting down for dinner, or a chat, and he's laying out the 1920's to you because you asked.I am throughly impressed with this book and I am glad my Professor exposed me to it. I recommend it to anyone who has ever wondered what the &quot;Roaring 20's&quot; were all about."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"Only Yesterday offers a glimpse into the nineteen twenties from someone who actually lived it. First published in 1931, Frederick Lewis Allen writes of a decade that had just past. Most historians will tell you that it takes about twenty years after a decade before you can truly come to terms with what the decade was all about. However, this was not the case with Frederick Lewis Allen's work. He was able to show the decade for what it was, a truly amazing accomplishment in 1931!His purpose was to show future generations, what his generation considered important in defining their times. In doing so he helped create a bridge between his generation and future generations who would later conduct research on the 1920s. In fact, while studying this period one soon find out, most historical works on the 1920s site Only Yesterday in their bibliographies. In fact, a through and comprehensive study of this period is not possible unless it includes Frederick Lewis Allen's works.Furthermore, Fredrick Lewis Allen attempted to record the social and cultural history of the times. In 1931 this was a new and different form of history. (Just about as radical as the 1920s.) Frederick Lewis Allen can be regarded as a pioneer social historian. Prior to his work most mainstream histories were based solely on politics and international affairs.More than half of Only Yesterday is on social and cultural events, which is one of the strongest points in his book. With the exceptions of chapters two and six, \\"Back To Normalcy\\" and \\"Harding And The Scandals\\", Allen's writings are geared towards the common people and how events of the day and the cultural changes affected them. These events and cultural changes are clearly illustrated in chapters five, \\"The Revolution In Manners And Morals\\" and chapters eight, \\"The Ballyhoo Years\\". Allen was able to show his readers the major social/cultural events of the 1920s. An example is his coverage of the automobile and the \\"Red Scare\\" in the early years of the decade. Clearly his coverage of these two events are his strongest points.His writing style deserves some mentioning. He writes in a style that allows for a multitude of readership interest areas: politics, social, cultural, industrial, religion and even sports. This is especially seen in his sometimes-humorous approach in covering certain topics. Another, great example of his writing abilities is his narrowing of a central point at the conclusion of his paragraph.Despite his strengths in his writing and his coverage, something must be said regarding his lack of a bibliography. Without one, it weakens his work. When you find something interesting, you have no way of looking for sources. Furthermore, he was not able to pick up on the population changes taking place in the 1920s. Rural to urban population changes were not addressed, nor was the \\"great migration\\" of African American coming to northern cities addressed either. Today, one just need to be aware of these event in the 1920s, Allen in the 1930s just wasn't able, for whatever reason, to see the importance of these events.Without any doubt, the strength of his work certainly out number his few weaknesses. I truly enjoy reading Allen's book. In the future I will revisit Allen's work for his superb writing style and his gift of narrowing his main points at the end of his paragraphs. A truly remarkable book!"},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"Very good account of the historical events of America in the 1920's. The vivid description of the period enables the readers to &quot;live&quot; through that time again. The change of collective mentality is another focus of the book. For example, it reflects the general public attitude towards the war that is outside of their continent.Therefore this book have given me a lot of insight of how USA comes to be what it is now. And moreover, it can be read as a FORWARD-LOOKING book: the Globe is closer to the blink of Great Depression than ever. We can spot a lot of parallel between US then and US now: speculation of real estate, stock; the style of the media (aren't they all interested in soapie-like story?). As well, we can spot all the syndromes in our current econ situation that were present in US in 20's. If the world leaders cannot learn from History and steer the course correctly, we will soon dive into the merciless age of depression again, and soon someone else will follow the author and wrote us a book of World in 90's, &quot;Yesterday Once More&quot;(?!)"},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"This is a well written and fascinating blend of popular and academic history. A broad survey of the 1920's, it covers everything from the Teapot Dome Scandal to the revolution in manners and morals to the single best account of the 1929 stock market crash I've ever read. Frederick Lewis Allen is a fine storyteller, and thankfully he sticks to the interesting figures of the day, so while you get to read in detail about subjects such as the Scopes trial and Lindbergh's flight to Paris, you don't have to wade through dull anecdotes of average people sitting on flagpoles in a desperate bid for attention. In hindsight from 70 years later, his filter for determining what was important about the decade is almost flawless.I think what makes the book so special is its modernity. The author impartially examines all the events of that turbulent decade with a sort of bemused detachment which has worn very well. It's awfully hard to believe the book was written on the immediate heels of the decade; it seems as if it could have been written Only Yesterday. Only Yesterday deserves to be widely read; there's a reason it's still in print today."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"Reading this book should be mandatory. The decline of formal religion and the sexual revolution all happened in the 1920s; the issues then (and this book was written in 1931), a time that seems like ancient history now, are the issues of today. Terrorism, business fraud, government corruption, investment mania, rapid technological advance, the move to the suburbs, are all covered. I found this book because it was referenced in several other books I read and consider it extremely important for everyone today. Our modern problems are not as modern as we think."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"This book is a wonderful source of information about the 1920s in the USA. It has lots of facts and makes them personal with anecdotes and the sort of details about daily life that textbooks omit. It was written shortly after the decade and still holds as one of the best sources of information about the decade."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"This is an excellent historical book, on the zeitgeist of the 1920's.It reflects upon all the major people,places,and things that define the epoch of American 1920's.If you had to read one book about that excessive time period of vanity,i would definately recommend this one.It's the best of the genre.Not all aspects of the 20s are covered here.Yet,it would be too cumbersome and boring to read if any longer.The parallels of the 20s to the later 1980's is quite amazing.The same beliefs developed,yet with different characters playing the parts.Time has not whithered the potent veracity of the book. If you're doing a history class project,Frederick Allen's respective on the 1920's,is the ideal quick reference from the era."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"Recently while doing research for an exhibition on the 1920s, I purchased this fabulous little book called Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the 1920s. Historian Frederick Lewis Allen wrote it in 1931, before Prohibition was even repealed!I bought it because I wanted a contemporary perspective on the decade from someone who was there. I was astounded at his insight into a decade that he not only lived through, but also did not have much distance from.As a rule, historians generally wait at least a decade in order to examine the recent past. When you are still living through it, you often don't have enough perspective to evaluate what the implications were or are going to be.However, Allen was spot on with his analysis of the 1920s. He admits early in the text that he is not trying to make any sweeping historical observations, and he is keenly aware of the dangers of trying to interpret events that were so recent. Instead, he says he is writing to capture the spirit of the age, as he remembers it.But I found that many of his statements were consistent with current historical scholarship of that era.His analysis of the Red Scare was particularly insightful. He writes, \\"...upholders of every sort of cause, good, bad, and indifferent, all wrapped themselves in Old Glory and the mantle of the Founding Fathers and allied their opponents with Lenin...A cloud of suspicion hung in the air, and intolerance became an American virtue.\\"Considering he was writing only 10 years after fear of communism swept this country, I was impressed with his courage to be honest about what was really going on. Although by the end of the decade, people were no longer concerned about a communist revolution, those who led the charge were certainly still alive.His attitude toward Prohibition represented the common thought of the era that the \\"noble experiment\\" was indeed a failure. Yet, it would be two years after his book was published that the 21st amendment was ratified.He accurately describes the spirit of the times, writing, \\"In those days people sat with bated breath to hear how So-and-So had made very good gin right in his own cellar, and just what formula would fulfill the higher destiny of raisins, and how bootleggers brought liquor down from Canada.\\"The 1920s were of course a time of radical change in manner and morals. People rejected anything \\"old fashioned,\\" looking instead to what was current and up-to-date. \\"It was better to be modern - and everybody wanted to be modern - and sophisticated, and smart, to smash the conventions and to be devastatingly frank,\\" Allen writes. \\"And with a cocktail glass in one's hand it was easy at least to be frank.\\"Allen also writes about the Scopes \\"monkey trial\\" - challenging the teaching of evolution in schools - with a hint of humor that really captures the bewilderment of the locals: \\"It was a strange trial. Into the quiet town of Dayton flocked gaunt Tennessee farmers and their families in mule-drawn wagons and ramshackle Fords; quiet, godly people in overalls and gingham and black, ready to defend their faith against \`foreigners,' yet curious to know what this new-fangled evolutionary theory might be.\\"When my book arrived, it was obviously a bit tattered. My copy was from the 1964 reprint, so it looked a bit dated from what you expect from modern history books. The print was quite small and seemed intimidating when I first opened it. There is a 1997 and 2000 reprint available as well.But it turned out to be the most interesting read of any book I used for my research!Allen is witty, extremely intelligent, and has the unique perspective that can only be achieved by living through these events yourself.If you are a Roaring Twenties enthusiast, or only casually interested in the era, I highly recommend this book. It provided me with a wealth of information, and lots of snappy quotes that really added to my exhibition."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"This was an excellent and very readable history of the 1920's.

Author Frederick Lewis Allen captures the feel of the decade, with its new technology and prosperity (except for farmers), expanding cities, social rebellion, shorter skirts, flappers, Al Capone speakeasies, prohibition, bootleg alcohol, etc. The Presidency passed in 1920 from a broken Woodrow Wilson and his desire for a League of Nations, to three Republicans (Harding, Coolidge, Hoover) with laissez-faire, isolationist views. Increasing technology meant more people drove cars, had radios, watched movies, bought goods on credit, and adopted more sexually carefree, do-it-now lifestyles. Sports blossomed, as people flocked to see Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey, Red Grange, Bobby Jones, Bill Tilden, etc., also watching them on newreels at the movie theatre and hearing their exploits via radio. Of course, not all was perfect; farm incomes fell, wages rose too slowly, and rapid change created a backlash of new adherents to the Ku Klux Klan with its hatred of blacks, Jews, Catholics and immigrants. Finally, 1928-1929 saw the stock market boom via false hopes and margin buying - the disastrous crash of October, 1929 and increasing Great Depression were quite fresh as Allen penned these pages in 1931.Frederick Lewis Allen (1890-1954) was a popular historian, magazine writer, and editor of Harper's Magazine. He gives a surprisingly informative and well-rounded look at an interesting era, one that reads just as well nearly eight decades later."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"A very good, accessible history of the period from 1919 to 1931. Allen does a nice job of discussing what was on people's minds during this time. I especially enjoyed the sections on the Red Scare and the mania leading up to the stock market crash. My complaints are that this is mostly an urban, East Coast history, though there is reference to what was happening in the countryside and elsewhere in the country. I wish Allen had done a follow up or revised the edition after it first came out to include the New Deal era.

It was the general belief that young women acted perfectly. They never drank, smoked, or did anything wrong, for that matter. Some young men could be expected to slip up, and give into the temptations of sex, but that was only with women of low class and disrespected families. Thus, boys and girls had a lot of freedom to be together. Parents just assumed that they wouldn't take advantage of the situation. This wasn't the case. Young women began to smoke and drink much more.The way women acted wasn't the only thing that changed, however. Women were beginning to wear clothing that revealed way too much skin. The skirts, in fact, were now beginning to show kneecaps. Yet another reform was in music and dance. The good ole' elegant music of the violin was being replaced by the loud, up-beat saxophone. Kids were now even dancing with their bodies touching each other. For the elders of America, this was too much. Most felt that these kids were morally lost.There were a couple of reasons for this revolution in morals. First, these kids had just gone off and fought a war. They had been through hell in Europe and now came back to America after facing some emotional times. They returned home expecting an exciting life. They just couldn't settle down and live by the moral code already laid down. Also, women were growing more and more independent at the time. They had just won women's suffrage in 1920, giving them equality to men. Women's role of housekeeping was also becoming less important.Another big cause to the moral reform was the automobile. At a time when cars were becoming more and more popular, kids saw a great opportunity for freedom in the automobile. At any time, kids could just jump in and go somewhere without supervision from a parent or chaperone. Kids could drive out to a dance in another town, where they could act more freely, without people they knew all around them.Finally, there was prohibition. The 18th Amendment, passed by 1919, banned any sale of alcohol in the United States. This law, of course, was never followed. Bootleggers and speakeasies were created as safe havens for alcohol. Drinking became thing to do because it was a way to revolt.The change in women's dress was another key change in the \`20's. From 1921 to 1924, the skirt length only shortened by a little bit. Paris, in fact, predicted that skirts would return to longer length, but women just kept on buying the shortest length they could find. By the end of the decade, the knee-length skirt was the regular skirt length. Women began to wear rayon, too. Rayon was a skin-colored stocking that was extremely popular. They were wearing less and less clothing in general. The amount of fabric needed for a woman's outfit had shrunk from 19.25 yards to just 7 yards. Clothing wasn't the only big change. Women also started to wear their hair shorter, another freedom that they had never experienced before.Barriers between men and women were being broken. Both views of drinking and smoking were changing drastically, too. Women began to widely accept smoking. Before the \`20's, it was something women didn't do. Another such barrier was found in drinking. Men and women were now drinking together. Speakeasies were one popular scene for mixed parties. People would also go out to hotels to drink. Men and women would lie on the beds in their rooms and drink away. During these years of prohibition, alcohol was drunk in more abundance than ever before.With the weakening of morals and the increase in sexual activity among kids, the divorce rate began to rise. In only 8 years, the divorce rate rose by nearly 8 percent. Divorce, in earlier years, was really looked down upon. To get a divorce was a shameful disgrace to you and your family. By the end of the \`20's, however, it wasn't such a bad thing anymore. At the beginning of the decade, people thought that you would find the perfect spouse and get married and live happily ever after. Now the attitude was that it was okay to settle for somebody, because you could just divorce them if it didn't work out.Overall, there were three big results from this reform in morals and manners. First, the nation became very sexually active. In fact, it almost became the nation's obsession. Sex magazines became very popular. More and more people became enthralled by it. Also, there was the change in manners. In fact, manners at that time were not very mannerly at all. Finally, people dropped the old moral code for a new one. The old code had set values in it. This new morality didn't really have any clear values. It could almost be said that morality was thrown out the window in this age."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"From the view point of a sixteen year old who was assigned this book for school reading it is not very interesting.

I concur with the reviewer who wrote that it is a great source of background information to the writer. It does have a nice immediacy to it; strange fads that are mentioned in an offhand way, with the assumption that the reader will already be familiar with them, only add to the charm. The last couple of chapters about the stock market are particularly interesting reading, particularly considering the bizarrely similar economic climate we are living in today. They are, thankfully, written in a straightforward and clear manner --- perfectly accessible to those of us who don't have an economics background. One beef with this paperback edition --- where are the lovely illustrations from the original addition?"},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"I purchased this book mainly as research for a novel I am writing set in the time period.

He puts culture into its proper context by pointing out how rapidly things were changed by technological innovations of the time. For example, on page137 he notes &quot;there was no such thing as radio broadcasting to the public until the autumn of 1920, but that by the spring of 1922 radio had become a craze.&quot;The nation was in some ways, still in the remnants of an agrarian society, poised to enter the industrial, urban era, but not making the full plunge yet. Perhaps a transitional time would be a better label to put on the snapshot of this period. The reason I say that is due to the description he gives of the swearing in of Calvin Coolidge. &quot;Business was booming when Warren Harding died, and in a primitive Vermont farmhouse, by the light of an old-fashioned kerosene lamp, Colonel John Coolidge administered to his son Calvin the oath of office as President of the United States&quot; (p. 132).The book is full of glimpses which fit together to provide a hoistic portrayal of the decade."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"In my US History studies in school, I have focused on studying the Wars--Revolutionary, Civil,WWI, WWII, etc. I have learned so much less about other periods in US History.

As an Advanced Placement United States History student during my junior year in high school (last year), I was given the opportunity to read Allen's work on the 1920s. Allen's journalistic style and thorough coverage of the events during the &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot; made this a fascinating read. The book is so well done that I had to occasionally stop and remind myself that this was written right after the decade addressed--it could have been written in the 1990s! The only major difficulty with this book (a minor one it is) is the explanation of how the stock market crashed (there are many numbers and examples cited), but it IS more thorough than most high school textbooks. What's also nice is that it covered the whole spectrum: politics, social atmosphere, the economy, etc. Many books focus only on one or two. This is a great resource for those who wish to understand what may be one of the most interesting decades of the twentieth century. It's a shame that &quot;Still Yesterday&quot; covering the 1930s is out of print-- it'd hate to miss more of Allen's wonderful work."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"For anyone who thinks that the &quot;New Era&quot; of Wall Street is at all new or different from similar periods of psychological mania of the past.

Generally, when I read non-fiction, even on topics I'm extremely interested in (like the 1920s), I will skim the dry passages and chapters. I have not been tempted to skim a single line in this book, and that's not because I'm deeply interested in every nuance of the era's politics and financial state. Mr. Allen's style and pacing are just so tight that I don't want to risk missing a moment of his insight, or his subtle, wry humor. If anyone reading this review happens to be a teacher or professor, I would highly recommend this book for high school and college students studying 20th century American history. Today's teens will be shocked by just how similar the lives of Post-War youth were to their own!"},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"Written only at the beginning of the Thirties, this is probably the first book concerning the Twenties ever written, and probably one of the closest to the matter at hand.Maybe this is why I had great expectation about it. This is certainly not the first social history book about the Twenties I've read, but because it was written so close to that period, I was expecting a different take at it.Well, regarding the subject matter, it's not very different from other books about the Twenties I- and this is probably a merit to the author that was able to capture the most important aspects of a time he did live - but on the other hand, its flavour is maybe a bit amateurish, the analysis of causes and effects are sometimes questionable... in my opinion. This doesn't really sounds like a study of the period, but more like the remembrance of someone who lived it, and was also quite critical about it. The style is very colloquial and judgmental at times, which is, in my opinion, the weakness of the book as well as its strong point. We don't really get an objective treatment of the Twenties, but we do get the feeling of how people lived this period of incredible, sometimes shocking changes.The author covers the political life of the country in details, although here too we don't really get a scholarly examination of facts and circumstances, but more an \`inside view', the version of someone \`who was there' and maybe isn't detached enough to really make an analysis of the matter. Some parts sounded even a bit gossipy to me.A section in devoted to the changes in the lifestyle of people, with particular regard to young people. And honestly I did expected a bit more from here. The social analysis of the huge change in behaviour and feelings of what was acceptable, with special regard to young people and women in particular, seems a little superficial to me. I was also surprised that so little space was dedicated to Prohibition and the jazz, and I wonder whether this depends on the author failing to see their reverberations on the following decades - which of course can't be blame on him, he just wasn't in the historical position for judging it. On the other hand, space is devoted to things that are never covered in other books on the matter, things like the popularity of the game of Mah Jong and the success Freudian ideas had inside that society. Maybe this is because they weren't after all as significant as the author thought, but they do give an additional facet to the decade. Events that marked the time, like the two important trials - the Scopes and the Sacco-Vanzetti - are swiftly dealt with and never entered in an in-depth social analysis - which is quite a shame.The last part, which includes a few chapters, covers the building up, the explosion and a brief followed up of the Big Crash. Here the author becomes quite technical, so much so that I had a hard time following his analysis.On the whole, it's a nice book on the Twenties, certainly worth reading. It does give a sense of the decade from a first-hand source. Just don't content yourself with this if you are interested in the Roaring Twenties."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"Frederick Lewis Allen's book on the 1920's was first published in 1931. His informal history of this time period has withstood the test of time. He identified and described the major events and trends in that decade, without the benefit of what historians like to call a \\"decent interval.\\" His writing style is lively, with a keen ability to capture the essence of broad historical trends. Once again, as Faulkner so eloquently said: \\"The past is not dead; it is not even the past.\\" So many elements of the \`20's have parallels today, certainly the economic bubble that burst into the Great Depression, but also the use of foreign \\"threats\\" to reduce the constitutional liberties of Americans.Allen commences his book with the end of the \\"War to End All Wars,\\" prior to the adding of a \\"I\\" after the \\"World War.\\" Wilson lacked the support of the broad American people for his post-war initiatives, as they had a strong desire to return to \\"normalcy.\\" Allen's chapter on \\"The Big Red Scare\\" is most illuminating, showing how readily government officials could use \\"fear\\" to void the Constitution. \\"It was an era of lawless and disorderly defense of law and order, of unconstitutional defense of the Constitution, of suspicion and civil conflict- in a very real sense, a reign of terror.\\" (p39). \\"In Hartford, while the suspects were in jail the authorities took the further precaution of arresting and incarcerating all visitors who came to see them, a friendly call being regarded as prima facie evidence of affiliation with the Communist party.\\" (p48). \\"Innumerable patriotic societies had sprung up... and must conjure up new and ever greater menaces. Innumerable other gentlemen now discovered that they could defeat whatever they wanted to defeat by tarring it conspicuously with the Bolshevist brush...\\" (p49).The author is equally strong examining the changes in morals. He relies heavily on the Lynn's excellent sociological work, \\"Middletown.\\" Hemlines were shortened, and numerous state legislatures tried to pass laws specifying, by inches, how much female flesh could be exposed. It was also an era of endless political scandals, and much corruption, epitomized by the Tea Pot Dome scandal. Concerning the President of the United States, Allen says: \\"His liabilities were not at first so apparent, yet they were disastrously real. Beyond the limited scope of his political experience he was \`almost unbelievably ill-informed,'.... His mind was vague and fuzzy. Its quality was revealed in the clogged style of his public addresses, in his choice of turgid and maladroit language.... It was revealed even more clearly in his helplessness when confronted by questions of policy to which mere good nature could not find the answer.\\" He could easily be describing George W Bush, but is actually describing Warren G Harding. Although America's Imperial reach was just in its infancy, still: \\"Only occasionally did the United States have to intervene by force of arms in other countries. The Marines ruled Haiti and restored order in Nicaragua; but in general the country extended its empire not by military conquest or political dictation, but by financial penetration. (p146). It was also another era that pitted fundamentalist religion against science, and Allen does a good job of describing the forces behind the Scopes trial.Certainly one of the largest parallels was the increase in financial speculation that, as we know now, left at least a 10 year \\"hangover,\\" and was only finally resolved by another \\"Great War.\\" Allen devotes an entire chapter to the less well remembered real estate rush, and speculation in Florida. He also devoted a chapter to the more familiar stock market bubble and bust. \\"The market, as Max Winkler said, was discounting not only the future but the hereafter.\\" And for those currently contemplating the sorry state of their \\"301k's\\", \\"It seems probable... that stocks have been passing not so much from the strong to the weak as from the smart to the dumb.\\" (p269). And in his chapter entitled \\"Crash,\\" another thought for our times: \\"Prosperity is more than an economic condition; it is a state of mind. The Big Bull Market had been more than the climax of a business cycle; it had been the climax of a cycle in American mass thinking and mass emotion.\\" (p281)Overall, an excellent book for our times, now that we might have more time for the simpler pleasures, like reading."},{"Title":"Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties","review":"I read this for the first time when I was in sixth grade and it continues to be one of my favorite books on the 1920's.I will agree that maybe it's not the best place to start for a complete Jazz Age neophyte because it requires the reader to get over his/her modern-day attitudes, but after a little starter research, it's fascinating.Obviously, since it was first published in 1931, it lacks long-term analysis, which some people might find frustrating. Personally, I think that the fact that it was written when these events and views were still so fresh, and that it does not have modern ideas projected onto it, makes it a valuable and interesting comparison to later perspectives on the decade."},{"Title":"A Higher Call","review":"note that this is the same book as &quot;The Calling of Dan Matthews&quot;. It is the sequel to &quot;Shepherd of the Hills.&quot; It is a good story. One grows fond of the characters. The author paints a rather grim picture of the church run as a social and business club rather than as an organization which should be caring for the needs of people around it. Dan figures things out and there is a happy ending."},{"Title":"A Higher Call","review":"A Higher Call is another dulcet gem from the pen of Harold Bell Wright. Technically a sequel to his most famous work, &quot;Shepherd of the Hills,&quot; this latter story can easily stand on its own. Except for a few references to &quot;Shepherd&quot; characters and the brief appearance of Dan Matthews's parents who figured prominently in the prequel, &quot;A Higher Call&quot; is an independent tale.While never critical of organized religion, the novel does point out how hypocrisy can too often be found in churches' inner organizations. Unlike Hollywood's commonplace Christian-bashing which always fingers the clergy, this novel celebrates an idealistic young minister up against some self-important lay people who wield too much power and militate too many church policies. It is the embrace of true Christianity that Wright's works often subtly embrace, done here in a more overt fashion.Readers should beware that &quot;A Higher Call&quot; is the exact same book as &quot;The Calling of Dan Matthews.&quot; A new title is the sole difference. To paraphrase the Bard, a book this uplifting by any name is still a good read."},{"Title":"Bring Back the Man You Fell in Love with","review":"This book advises women about what to do when the honeymoon is literally and figuratively over. How can you bring back the romantic man of your dreams? According to Bushong, it's through establishing equal power and honest negotiations.Using abstract theory and concrete examples, she shows how men will only treat women as badly as the women allow. This simple concept of reclaiming power is one of the most important ideas that runs throughout the book. It can be applied to male-female relationships as well as parenting and on-the-job situations. She offers many examples of how to do this effectively. I tried some of her ideas. They worked.Her four steps to powerful negotiations seemed a little awkward when I first read them. How can you comfortably introduce a set negotiation formula into a casual conversation? Reluctantly, I tried this, too. It also worked.\\"Bring Back the Man You Fell in Love With\\" offers some wonderful suggestions for restoring the love and romance from those early newlywedded years.

Trapped aboard a badly damaged shuttle during the brief battle, Captain Janeway can only watch in horror as her ship is apparently destroyed. Suffering from severe burns she escapes the carnage in a space pod that flees the sector, eventually being rescued by the Warranter Zingara and its Commanding Shipmate Quen. Her saviors are not sure what to make of her, since no sane woman would want to be on a space vessel and especially since this alien with the very long name that they shorten to &quot;Kay&quot; insists that the Menace are coming to conquer their home world. Things look equally strange from Janeway's perspective: these people have technology completely different from anything she has ever seen before and run their ships in a disorganized, inefficient manner that baffles her. In short, they run their ships as a democracy while obeying the dictates of a dictatorial &quot;temporary&quot; government on the planet. But the most important thing is that her new shipmates neither trust or belief this strange alien woman. Fortunately she has her hatred of the Menace to keep her going until she is proven right about everything she has told her new shipmates.It only took a couple of chapters to recognize that &quot;The Fire Ship&quot; was the best of the first four books in the Captain's Table series. Half way through it became clear this is one of the best Star Trek novels I have ever read. Unlike a few of the other novels in the series that keep disengaging from their narrative to work in the reactions of the audience in that special bar that transcends space and time (and the gecko), Diane Carey goes in the other direction, with only a couple of comments indicating Janeway recognizes she has a physical audience outside of the framing device at the beginning and end of the novel (apparently there were comments and interruptions, but Carey conveniently omitted them all). The two things that define this series are that the stories are told First Person and that they reflect upon being a captain of a starship. In this latter regard &quot;The Fire Ship&quot; is the best of the bunch, reducing Janeway to this new culture's version of a deck swab (imagine cleaning a house made of bathroom tiles with a toothbrush for days on end). Janeway is very aware of how much her life has changed and Carey does an excellent job of charting the adjustments &quot;Kay&quot; makes to be accepted, as well as her planning for the imminent arrival of the Menace. However, there is one slight additional twist to the tale, because Janeway does not know everything she needs to know about the people she has dismissed with that perjorative label.This is a story about Kathryn Janeway, exploring her not only as a captain but as a person in a way few stories have done, whether on the television series or in a novel. If you burn her hair and clothing off, wrap her in foil, drop her on a ship, injured, alien, and raving, would she still be able to cope? After all, there is a good chance she will be spending the rest of her life on this new ship above a strange new world, which means she needs to be accepted even if she is not believed. However, doing so requires taking the Pledge, a new oath to her new captain and her new shipmates that would replace the vow she took when she joined Starfleet. The problem is that Kathryn Janeway does not take or break vows lightly. If she takes the Pledge, there would be no going back to her old life if she were to find Voyager had survived the attack. &quot;The Fire Ship&quot; takes both its characters and its story quite seriously. I am working my way through this set of six novels in order and so far this is far and away the best of the lot. Even if you do not read the entire series or do not especially care for Voyager, I have to think you will really enjoy this book if you are a Star Trek fan. Final note: Do not hold your breath waiting for the meaning of the title to become clear, because that comes near the end and its not worthy of being the title of this good of a story."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"What I mean is, I read the beginning of Rudyard Kipling's book Captains_Courageous, the story upon which this installment of the Captains' Table series is based, when I was in 3rd or 4th grade, and I hated it. But I like this book. Go figure, huh?While this book is not, in my opinion, the best of the Captains' Table series, it is quite a good story in its own right. Captain Janeway's attempts to fit herself into an alien culture and crew with a quasi-Victorian view of women are interesting, and her growth into compassion for a woman of the mysterious &quot;Menace&quot; race is touchingly realistic, as she struggles to overcome the hatred for them which is almost all that has kept her going since the destruction of the USS Voyager, which she has witnessed. Plus, there's a special twist to the ending, but I won't tell you what it is, except to say this: the story does not end exactly the way one might expect it to. Buy it, especially if you like &quot;coming-of-age&quot;-type stories."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"I am very loathe to give any Star Trek book more than three stars. Star Trek books are almost by definition entertainment light, and mere entertainment should not, generally, receive more than three stars. But then along came Diane Carey and Fire Ship, and try as I might I cannot bring myself to give it only three stars.Like Sulu, Picard, and Sisko before her (Kirk had been there before), Janeway stumbles into the incredibly dopey &quot;Captain's Table&quot;, a bar exclusively for captains of ships from all times and places. Like her predecessors, Janeway must tell a story. But there the comparisons with previous Captain's Table debacles ends. Carey boldly ignores the Captain's Table conventions and lets Janeway tell her story without the constant interruptions that plagued the previous books.And what a story it is. Janeway finds herself alone with an alien crew, forced to adapt to no longer being in charge and literally swabbing decks. Carey has found her stride as an author (see the atrocious TNG novel Ghost Ship for an earlier effort), weaving a narrative that is compelling, interesting, and evocative. There are, inevitably, some bits that do not entirely &quot;work,&quot; but this was the first Trek novel in a long, long time that I a) didn't want to put down and b) looked forward to picking up again. It is also the first Trek book in recent memory that I actually *want* to read again.An observation about the negative reviews. I have never been a big Voyager fan. I am familiar with the characters, of course, but, except for the Doctor, am not attached to any of them. So, the lack of other Voyager crew did not bother me in the slightest. Similarly, I am by no means a Janeway afficionado. Is &quot;Fire Ship&quot;'s Janeway a realistic portrayal of the original? I have no idea; it was to my inexpert eye. However, &quot;Fire Ship&quot; is so enjoyable that the Star Trek aspects of it are really beside the point. Read &quot;Fire Ship&quot; and enjoy it for the wonderful tale it is."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"This was indeed a very thrilling book because you dont know the characters and its makes it very unpredictable!

I am a devoted Janeway/Kate Mulgrew fan, and I found this story irresistable.The fact that it takes place away from Voyager and the rest of the crew was a bit daunting to me at first. (I was in a rut, and liked it just fine.) But I quickly realized that that fact alone made this book unique and memorable. And Diane Carey delivered all the way through. The story was well thought out and entertaining from beginning to end.This was a look at a side of Janeway we never saw on Voyager. Can you imagine Kathryn Janeway swabbing the deck? Wonderful! And the thing I loved the most about this book was that Carey portrayed Janeway with dignity and grace, even in the worst cirmustances imaginable. And on a far more shallow note, it also answers the question about what happened to her long hair.If you are a Janeway fan, you simply must read this book."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"A totally wonderful book! At first I did not warm up to the idea of Janeway 'losing' everyone on Voyager, but Diane Carey did a great job! With first-person narration by Janeway, we get a look at what makes her tick, which adds a great deal to the TV character we're used to. Carey's portrayal of Janeway threw me off a little at first, but in the end it gave me a greater understanding and 'respect' of the CAPTAIN.A great read if ever there was one -- and an extra comforting ending too!"},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"I basically enjoyed this book, but I sometimes found that Carey's characterization of Janeway did not match my own impressions of the character.

Still, I often found myself asking: &quot;would Janeway really act this way?&quot;"},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"It was a gripping book, but the start was a bit hazy and don't really know what was going on. The story was well thought out, but I just feel it didn't really fit into my image of Janeway. Yes, the woman was tough, strong minded and very clever, and earned her way up in the alien ship, but the gut feeling tells me that there's something missing to make it real Janeway."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"I adore Diane Carey. She does what every good writer should do, she &quot;writes what she knows.&quot; She's a sailor, and it shines through every novel. Living in Baltimore as I do, where everything's nautical, I enjoy her stories very, very much. I know I'll never become a sailor myself, but it sure is fun reading about sailing in her books! Who said you can't learn anything from fiction? HA!The &quot;Captain's Table&quot; bar is a good backdrop for this swell Janeway romp through space unknown, in a ship unknown, with Janeway serving as little more than deckhand (Ms. Carey told me the exact job title, but I forget what she said!).

Good Stuff."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"I love &quot;Captain's Table&quot; series, and while I am not a big fun of Janeway, this book embodied the best of Star Trek attractions, even though some of the elements are not entirely original.

The way it builds up the story."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"Although I have enjoyed Carey's past Trek novels I found this one to be a bit dull. Voyager's strength is in its' ensemble cast. Writing an entire book around one character (Janeway) with no interaction with other crew members is a mistake. And why give so much attention to aliens? I thought a requirement for Trek novel publication was to adhere to Trek characters...not base an entire story on non Trek characters.

Are you reading this Pocket Books?????"},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"My favorite of the first four Captain's Table books (I haven't read 5 or 6).Janeway is taken away from everything she has - left broken physically and emotionally - and then begins to cope with the circumstance in a truly inspiring way.I'm afraid that nearly everything I want to say about it is a spoiler of one kind or another - I'll just say that it was a good read, especially for a fan of Voyager that is most interested in Captain Janeway. While this may be borderline spoiler to say: she also finds herself in a situation where she is the only woman, for 95% of her tale, and among the challenges she faces it presents one of the most interesting threads throughout the story.The Captain's Table 'framing device' that this series utilizes is hardly mentioned in this book, which I actually found to be a relief.I'd been reading all of them in order and, even so, the CT concept hasn't been holding my interest very much. ****1/2"},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"This was a pecuilar book compared to the earlier previous Captain Table's books- for starters, there were no interruptions with the secondary characters whatsoever. I was always curious as to see how a member of Voyager would cope with if the ship had been destroyed, or had left them behind. Janeway had to cope with a bizarre and completely alien situation- she was hurled from Voyager, stranded in space, rescued by the Omian, and finding out a baffling and puzzling conlifct while trying to stop the \\"Meance-aka Lumalit\\". The book also showed that Janeway was spoiled with command decisions, and had to work her way up. The book was much different that the other Captain's Table but brought more to offer on Janeway's behalf. This book was truly unique in that it showed a different side of the Captain in their unique journey home."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"Like all of Diane Carey's Star Trek books, this one has good pacing and characterization. Like all of her original works (many of her Star Trek books are novelizations of episodes, for which she doesn't get credit for the plot) this one has good action and an interesting plot.Unfortunately, also like most of her other books, there is a real tendancy here to have an occasional very strange and distracting turn of phrase. It isn't nearly as pronounced as in her worst works (\\"The Search\\", \\"Descent\\") but it's much more noticeable than in her best works (\\"Day of Honor, book 1: Ancient Blood\\", \\"Ship of the Line\\"). It's about on a par with \\"First Frontier\\" and \\"Flashback\\". If you don't mind (or even notice) an occasional misuse of a word or overzealous attempt to use words creatively (\\"'Don't make jokes', Ruvan miserated.\\") and enjoy the Voyager series, you'll probably enjoy this book. If, like me, you find misuse of the language in the misguided attempt to be creative to be annoying, you'll at the very least find that enjoyment diminished.Also, like all of the Captain's Table\\" books, this one expects us to accept a concept that is clearly incompatible with canonical Star Trek stories, something of a \\"Callahan's Crosstime Saloon meets Star Trek\\", and which requires the main characters to clearly violate the Prime Directive in order to participate. So I don't take the Captain's Table frame seriously; when praising the plot of this story, that's entirely the interior story that I'm praising.

But guess what? It's a story that Janeway's telling. Maybe it happened, and maybe it didn't. That's what we're left to guess at. Here's another way to think about it: Chakotay making up Indian stories to prove a point to someone. Jesus coming up with a parable. Did it happen? Probably not. Or maybe not that exact way. It's a story and you just 'go with it' and enjoy the ride.Anyway, back to the book... Basically, Janeway is exploring and comes upon this little bar where all these captains sit around telling 'war stories'. She's asked to tell a story and begins. The whole novel is her story, basically.What did I think of the book? I loved it. It was an interesting story and I really couldn't put it down when I first read it.

It seemed very much out of character for her and just didn't mesh well with what we know of her.I was constantly overcome with the feeling that this book was written for someone else or with someone else as the main character initially.I like the unique approach to the alien's technology and the immediacy of the hazards they faced in space. So often we forget, in the Star Trek universe, that SPACE is lurking just outside those graceful hulls.The lady in this story is tough, smart and capable and eventually proves it to her new crew, the author just didn't make me feel like it was Janeway.

She gives Janeway her chance to shine and show her leadership colours under extraordinary circumstances.By no means a brilliant novel. I would have preferred an ensemble piece rather than a Janeway solo tale, but otherwise, an enjoyably pleasant book."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"I don't really expect a lot from Voyager novels. Fact is, I rarely buy them unless they're part of a series like this one. So, I found myself pleasantly surprised by this one. Carey doesn't rely as much on the bar to jar the reader in and out of the story and it's stronger for that. She gives Janeway her own unique voice and makes reading the book a pure pleasure. My only gripe is that Carey's love of sailing shows through far too many times and is getting a bit tedious since it's been the focus of her past several Trek yarns. But otherwise, an enjoyably pleasant book."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"An ever so excelent story. Well executed, and Janeway is excelently protrayed.

It was great, and deserves the best of reviews."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"Although my biggest complaint is that I couldn't imagine captain Janeway doing or saying many of the things that she is purported to have done in this story, overall the story was pretty original. So often, star trek novels fail to flesh out the cultures that litter the stories like so many props. The aliens here are definitely more thought out than normal. Very involving, quite a fast pace and it kept me turning the pages. I would actually have liked it to have continued another 300 pages or so, and then we could really have had something quite worthwhile. Alas, the 275 page limit that seems the standard for Star Trek is still in force here. Still, for voyager fans, a great read."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager - The Captain's Table #4: Fire Ship","review":"Although not as good as its predeccessor in the series, it's an interesting look at Capt. Janeway in a role of a subordinate peon rather than a fearless, take-charge leader. I could see her confusion as she enters the bar, feel her frustration as she knows the answers but isn't allowed to speak them, and all the emotions she goes through in this book. The story itself isn't as thrilling as Capt. Sisko's, but the way it's told makes it a very good read."},{"Title":"Embracing the Sky: Poems Beyond Disability","review":"Being familiar with Craig and his family, I can validate that the words in these poems are straight from his experience and his heart. This gifted young man has gone from elementary school, junior high, high school, and on into college with a number of different aides to help him transfer his words from his mind onto paper with varying degrees of assistance. He now does much of his work with little to no physical support. His teachers and professors will verify the quality and authenticity of his work. One need only watch as he ponders and edits his exams and essays to realize that this individual has a highly active and intelligent mind, and that his aides are only providing the assistance his body needs in order to facilitate movement (similar to a Parkinsonian movement disorder).Craig's poems about life with autism and cerebral palsy brought to light many struggles and issues his parents and aides were unaware of, and revealed the person trapped inside the disabled body. Craig has a unique personality with thoughts, insights, and ideas that those around him would not have imagined. While he may bring you to tears, Craig can also make you laugh, reflect, hope, and become angry--a sign of a truly gifted writer. His poems are alive, rich, genuine, and his own."},{"Title":"Embracing the Sky: Poems Beyond Disability","review":"Craig's book of beautiful poems includes themes about both isolation, and coming into contact from isolation --- and how both of these feel. Sometimes the isolation is intense, and sometimes the contact is a shocking contrast. While his situation is not universal, I think these themes are universal human experiences, in one degree or another. In reading the book we get to celebrate Craig's experience of coming out into contact and community, and his staying in contact, even though it is sometimes painful. I like the prose writing at the end of the book as much as any of the poems. I admire Craig's kindness and fierce motivation to stay in contact, and his desire to help others through sharing his experiences and perspective."},{"Title":"Embracing the Sky: Poems Beyond Disability","review":"As the mother of a young ASD child, this wonderful book of thoughtful (and yes sometimes painful) poems gives insight into the world of what it must be like for a lot of children that cannot verbalize expressively.

I was very moved after I read the peotry, and i believe I am a better person for doing so. This would rank among some of the best books of poetry that I have ever read.

It brings tears along with awe and joy in the inestimable power of the human spirit so eloquently expressed by Craig.

His mother has always denied her son's problems. This is sad and hopefully someday she will come to the realization he will never be normal. Craig has competed everything with her by his side, she guides his hand on the keyboard, she speaks for him (which is really just her talking), basically she has completed school for him. Craig is a sweet person and he has a wonderful caring family.

This part alone is an excellent overview of the latest knowledge which the archealogist's trowel has been able to bring to bear on the period. Orgainized in categories such as cities and religious sites, the book considers Sub-Roman patterns of site usage throughout the country rather than focusing on a site-by-site survey.Very accessible reading which leaves you wishing for more."},{"Title":"An Age of Tyrants: Britain and the Britons, A.D. 400-600","review":"Snyder provides a thorough survey and sound evaluation of the documentary and archaeological evidence for the Fifth and Sixth Centuries in Britain. These two centuries are the &quot;lost&quot; period in British history, lying between the better-known Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. Snyder provides insight into a period of great changes and adaptations, showing how Roman era political and social institutions and concepts were transformed to deal with altered circumstances. In a sense, Snyder's work could be seen as a partial update of the invaluable _Arthur's Britain_ by Leslie Alcock. &quot;Partial&quot; because Snyder intentionally deals only with those surviving documents that are contemporary to the period (e.g., St. Patrick, Gildas, Life of Saint Germanus). He deliberately avoids the accounts of this period which were written in slightly later times (e.g., Bede, Annales Cambriae, Nennius, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle). These later sources are based upon early documents (since lost) and oral tradition, and are therefore more problematic than the contemporary documents. Snyder thus carefully avoids the controversy surrounding the question of the historical basis for the King Arthur legend. This omission does not, however, render his work less valuable to Arthurian enthusiasts; to the contrary, it provides a firm factual foundation from which those daring souls may approach the more problematic material and tackle the Arthurian controversy"},{"Title":"An Age of Tyrants: Britain and the Britons, A.D. 400-600","review":"It is very refreshing to read a book about this period of British history that is not obsessed with the Arthurian legend, interesting though that is. Mr Snyder uses the little written evidence there is from the 410-600AD period to try and form a picture of the conditions at the time. The second part of the book discusses the archaeological evidence in depth and the final part constructs a coherent picture of what life must have been like in post Roman Britain using the evidence of the first two sections. Arthur and Merlin are mentioned in an appendix and at a few points within the text but only to point out that the historical evidence cannot say one way or the other whether these personalities existed.Mr Snyder has settled on the title &quot;An Age of Tyrants&quot; to describe the era as being preferrable to &quot;Sub-Roman Britain&quot;. I'm not sure if this title is adequate but it is superior to the somewhat demeaning &quot;Sub-Roman&quot; description. This period was clearly not as savage as has previously been thought.My only minor criticism is that I would have preferred to see more illustrations of the archaeological sites and artefacts but overall I found this an extremely interesting book that was difficult to put down."},{"Title":"An Age of Tyrants: Britain and the Britons, A.D. 400-600","review":"I must admit, like so many others, I was originally drawn to the post-Roman period by the &quot;historical King Arthur.&quot; But the period is a rich and diverse one, worthy of study in its own right--not only as &quot;Arthur's Britain.&quot; In this incredible volume, Chris Snyder--probably the greatest expert on post-Roman Britain alive today, in my opinion--paints a picture of Britain that is anything but a &quot;sub-Roman&quot; &quot;Dark Age.&quot; If you ever raised an eyebrow when your history textbook skipped from the Romans in 400 CE to the Anglo-Saxons in 800 CE, then you should read this book.

SnyderThe Pennsylvania State University Press, 1998ISBN 0-271-01780-5This is a wonderful book to bring to life a cohesive mosaic of the two centuries that followed the removal of Britain from the Roman Empire to the arrival of the papal mission under Augustine in 597.Published within the past few years, this book bring together many of the latest elements in the trail of King Arthur available to the modern scholar. His book is filled with the most credible theories based on academic consensus, drawing from the most recent translations and comparisons of ancient sources.What is most singulary worthy of this book is the lack of judgement on the topic of Arthur and Merlin. After laying out the entirety of the context within which Arthur and Merlin may have lived, these two characters are dealt with only in a brief three page appendix. Snyder describes the historical basis for the two characters then ends his brief discussion without trying to postulate who they actually might have been. &quot;What the historian can contribute, however, is a better understanding of the period and place in which Arthur and Merlin may have lived for those who wish to pin down these legendary figures to time and space.&quot;Indeed! This is precisely what he has done. Anyone interested in playing Pendragon or reading Arthurian literatute will appreciate how he frames the era in terms of these &quot;tyrants&quot; -- self-made men who usurped traditional authority to re-establish order and deal with the chaos of the dissolution of the Roman empire.As a scholar what I like is that the author has made a thorough documentation of where he gathered all of his information. This book itself is short, at 260 pages of text including appendices. Yet it then has 124 pages of rich and curious notes and a lengthy bibliography from which he cited his information.Christopher Snyder is Associate Professor of History and Chair Department of History and Politics at Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia."},{"Title":"An Age of Tyrants: Britain and the Britons, A.D. 400-600","review":"Christopher Snyder says the inhabitants of what is known today as England, Scotland, and Wales would not have called themselves Britons before the arrival of the Romans. In pre-Roman days they would have been known by names associated with their tribal affiliations. Many of the individuals might have referred to themselves as 'Combrogi' or 'Cymry' the latter a Welsh term referring to friendship and/or love of place. The Romans named the &quot;big&quot; island across the &quot;English&quot; channel Brittania. About 400 years after they arrived, the Romans formally withdrew from Britain and left behind a changed place (and probably a few ex-Romans) -- including the name by which the inhabitants knew themselves.For a long while scholars referred to the period following the departure of &quot;official&quot; Rome and the final &quot;conquest&quot; of Britain by Angles, Saxons, and Jutes the 'dark ages'. More recently, scholars have referred to this era, which stretches from about 400-600 A.D. 'sub-Roman Britain'. Christopher Snyder says he would prefer to call it the Brittonic Age, although his book title names it AN AGE OF TYRANTS.Snyder's book is divided into three parts. First, he explores the written record -- the writings of Britains Patrick (5th Century) and Gildas (6th Century) and other non-Britonic witnesses. He discusses Latin terms from the extant written material, such as the word &quot;tyrant&quot; which was construed differently by different people in different places speaking different languages. Snyder suggests the &quot;tyrants&quot; described by St. Jerome or the Honorable Bede may not have been as badly behaved as the negative connotation of theit term suggests. In fact, Snyder says the tyrants distant churchmen described may have been more akin to the &quot;tigern&quot; or Celtic lord.In the second part of his book, Synder discusses the archeological record of the Brittonic Age--which has been overlooked and undervalued as it falls between the rich material record of the Roman (Cirencester, Bath) and Anglo-Saxon (Sutton Hoo) periods. I found this section of the book illuminating as Snyder has systmatically inventoried and synthesized the evidence from a many &quot;digs&quot; into a coherent whole.In the third section of his book, Snyder uses the material from parts 1 and 2 to describe life in the Brittonic Age in various kinds of settlements (towns, villas, forts, etc.) and the social structure of the people including aspects of government, religion, military, and economic. He says the Britains were a Romanized-Christian people who did not revert back to the tribal behavior that existed before the coming of the Romans.Snyder is a professor at Marymount University and for all I know he is a member of a religious order, but having graduated from Georgetown University myself, I know that religious affiliation does not mean one cannot be objective. However, Snyder's conclusion that pagan ways disappeared in the Brittonic Age as the population became Christianized may not be exactly accurate.Based on a reading of the material in Snyder's book and other material, I suspect Celtic ways and the Christian ways merged into an entirely new religion. According to Snyder, Pope Gregory suggested at one point that as the clergy converted pagans they should adapt &quot;pagan temples and rituals to Christian usage in nonviolent ways.&quot; I think that is exactly what happened, and I think that explains in part why The Blessed Virgin Mary became so important in Great Britain--which Snyder, a professor at MARYmount might have noted."},{"Title":"An Age of Tyrants: Britain and the Britons, A.D. 400-600","review":"I would highly recommend Dr. Snyder's writings to anyone with an interest in Celtic history and lore; he breathes new life into subjects often erroniously viewed as carrying a thin layer of dust.

We want a man of the fireside or the pub or the family service; but we are met by a man of the wilderness.\\"And\\"In the end, there are two ways of dealing with the gospel according to Mark: either we throw the book away and opt for a gentler religion, or we act on it and attempt to follow this man through glory and through terror.\\""},{"Title":"Hungry For Peace: International Security, Humanitarian Assistance, And Social Change in North Korea","review":"Hungry For Peace: International Security, Humanitarian Assistance, And Social Change In North Korea by Hazel Smith (Professor of International Relations, University of Warwick, England) is an impressive, scholarly, and in- depth study of the international relief efforts in North Korea.

Well, Banville violates this principle left and right, much to the delight of at least this particular reader. There is hardly paragraph, much less a page, that does not stop you cold you with image or simile or metaphor or simply brilliant construction, and you gladly forgive him each and every time.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves the English language. It is written by someone who probably loves it even more."},{"Title":"Athena","review":"Yet another book by John Banville that one can only characterise as a work of art - Why this is so is hard to explain to the uninitiate. Banville's prose is both subtle and oceanic. Above all, it is seductive. Things always seem to begin simply enough in his works. But, somewhere along the way, one is taken suddenly by the realisation that s/he is under the spell of a virtuoso, a master craftsman, nay, a magician of sorts who turns every subject that falls under his pen into a work of high literary art.The plot, such as it is, has been covered by the other reviewers. I have just a couple addenda: I'm not so sure that this book and Ghosts are sequels, as such, to The Book of Evidence or if it's particularly important if they are. Banville's narrator, especially in Ghosts, is much-taken with the notion of multiple or parallel universes. That seems to me the best way to read these works, as following Mr. Montgomery into entirely different worlds. ----Also, a bit of a personal peeve, one wishes one could get through a Banville work without his using the term \\"flocculent\\" to describe everything from clouds to pubic hair (herein). But this is a quibble.Below a couple citations of Banvillian prose here:The light in the room, the colour of tarnished tin, was the light of childhood. I would see again afternoons like this in the far past and myself as a child at a window watching the day fail and the rooks settling in the high, bare trees and the rain like time itself drifting down. p.151But this is how I want it to be, all smeary with tears and lymph and squirming spawn and glass-green mucus: my snail-trail. P.220And so it is, a lulling, seductive, dark snail-trail of poetic prose to the narrator's beloved. Follow it!"},{"Title":"Athena","review":"Banville proves that Nabokov is not the only author who can envelope a reader in a plot of sensuality and obsession. Each reader who has had a tragic love affair (real or imagined) will see themself in this story of self deception."},{"Title":"Athena","review":"The old dilemma: award stars according to the author's mastery (close to 5) or to reflect my own enjoyment of the book (2 or 3 at most)? There, right on the front cover, is a quotation from the San Francisco Chronicle: \\"A thriller... by Ireland's master of the exquisite and uncanny whose brilliant use of prose narration places him in a league with Joyce and Beckett.\\" True -- yet it made me reflect what a dubious legacy Joyce bequeathed to Irish intellectuals who followed after.\\"My love. If words can reach whatever world you may be suffering in, then listen....\\" The book begins in words, with this incantation, and it continues in words. Not events, not characters, not time and place, not even any tangible reality, but words pure and by no means simple, creating the atmosphere of a dream that may at any moment turn into nightmare, words spun out, questioned, erased, words rich in apparent meanings that the next moment may well be denied. The narrator must have a past, but we are not told what it is; even his name, Morrow, is assumed, chosen almost at random and since regretted. His love is referred to within the same paragraph sometimes as \\"she\\" and sometimes as \\"you\\"; he calls her \\"A... It's not even the initial of her name, it's only a letter, but it sounds right, it feels right.\\" The town house in which they meet seems impossibly vast at first description, though later it shrinks to more more normal proportions. Although some facts and details eventually emerge from the swirling verbal fog, the prevailing atmosphere is one of hallucination. Banville is indeed a master of words, but he uses them less to pin down normal meanings than to create a shifting web in which meaning itself is questioned.Nonetheless, several narrative strands do begin to come visible; quite separate at first, they gradually intertwine, but never become entirely connected. The narrator appears to be some kind of expert in Flemish baroque art, and he is called in to authenticate some paintings in an old deserted house. On the fringes of this are a number of lowlife characters (many of them quite bizarre), a hovering police presence (called \\"Guards\\" in Ireland), a possible theft, and some unexplained murders. The narrator also looks after his Aunt Corky, a woman of equally mysterious background, who is in some kind of home. But his most significant relationship is with A -- an erotic obsession that escalates through physical passion into some of the darker reaches of sexuality; these sections are among the best in the book, because at least they use the realities of flesh to anchor vagaries of feeling. Another kind of quasi-objective anchor is provided by the catalogue descriptions of various paintings that come in between the chapters. But even these artworks are displaced; although supposedly painted by artists from the Low Countries (all imaginary), their themes from classical mythology are more typical of the Italian Baroque. Yet the progression of subjects, with their undertones of eroticism and violence, parallel the narrator's developing obsession in a way that, to an art historian, may actually be clearer than the main narrative.The one negative in my review of Banville's Man Booker prizewinning novel,THE SEA(written ten years after ATHENA, in 2005), was a certain self-consciousness about the style; however, as it becomes apparent that the narrator is a writer, we come to understand that stylistic fingerprints such as questioning his word-choices or narrative technique reflect on the character, not on Banville. But in ATHENA, we never learn much about the background of the man who calls himself Morrow, so the same stylistic tricks seem more like the author showing off. If you admire verbal legerdemain and have a liking for Mannerism or the Baroque, certainly give the book a try. But it is not for everyone. [The color cover of the Vintage paperback edition, incidentally, is entirely misleading. Its bland watercolor portrait is the polar opposite of Banville's highly-wrought style, and its subject totally lacks the fascination of the erotic earth-spirit in the book.]"},{"Title":"Athena","review":"Banville writes exquisitely. Athena should be read slowly, like a fine meal. Interested readers might be advised to read his Book of Evidence, then Ghosts, before turning to this one."},{"Title":"Athena","review":"This is the 4th work by Mr. John Banville that I have read, and I am nearly finished with his fifth. There is much that is factual about this writer, amongst these would be, his intellect, his range as a writer, and the competency he writes with while ranging through very different subject matter and material. As others have noted he is adept with metaphor. I feel his talent is not that he uses the device so frequently, but does so with such a subtle touch, it is more akin to absorbing his thoughts, as opposed to checking them off, or making a list.This is easily the most difficult of his works that I have been through. This is not because he is vague, or style overrides substance. He is clear in what he says; placing it all into proper context and order is another matter. I do not suggest this book is an exercise in chaos. I do feel it is a reading experience that is in fact as far from definitive as the book jacket suggests it to be. Another reader has suggested that prior to reading this book that, \\"Ghosts\\", and \\"Book Of Evidence\\", should be read first. I am sufficiently unsure that I came away from the book with the Author's entire message, so if you can read the other two first, it may help.Primarily written in the first person in the voice of, \\"Morrow\\", a new name to distance himself from a past, allows the reader to listen in as he recounts his period of time with, \\"A\\". At times we witness events in the present, but more frequently we are told of what has already taken place, what decisions were made and why. Just the explanation of how Morrow arrived at his new name will either bore you, or entice you into Mr. Banville's narrative style. For Morrow nearly everything is the result of, or likened to another, be it an event, a person, a name, or a moment in time. The relationships he devises are indicative not of a man who was an unsuccessful felon, but more of a mind bordering on that of an Oxford Don.Regardless of how well educated our narrator is, he is also willing to engage in a relationship with \\"A\\" that evolves into what some may compare to Nabokov, although this time age is not the issue. And then there are the balance of the cast all that are creatures that might be termed, \\"Banvillian\\", just as Marley and Drood are classified Dickensian. Dickens players had their kinks just as Banville's do, although Banville's are closer to seriously bent than kinked.The plot line that is sketched on the jacket of our Morrow and some paintings of dubious status together with a mention of \\"A\\" does not begin to explore the depths of this work. As has been the case with all the books I have read, his writing is so well constructed, his characters so well detailed, that even if the surface storyline is as far as you choose to go, you will be rewarded. However, to do so would cheat you, of all that is there to be interpreted, and all that is almost there, or almost definitively referred to.This Author's more existential work may be more of an acquired taste, than, \\"Doctor Copernicus\\", or, \\"Kepler\\". In any event any reader who enjoys talented writing will find time well used that is spent with Mr. Banville's work."},{"Title":"Athena","review":"I read this after \\"The Book of Evidence\\" had introduced Freddie Montgomery, in this sequel of sorts out of prison and under an assumed name continuing his forays into the art world's underworld. Descriptions of various paintings he analyzes in the style--at least in the first few--of a catalogue raisonne make for a challenge, as it forces you as the reader to imagine what FM conjures up by words from what he only sees as art. It makes for a great distancing effect, one that another novelist might have undercut if he had insisted upon including (cf. W.G. Sebald's entries of prose, postcard, photo within his similarly undefinable free-floating books of associations--the comparison is not meant to criticize Sebald) reproductions themselves.This book's less witty, and brims less with black humor, than \\"The Book of Evidence.\\" Reading it for the erotic bits would be akin to picking up Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" or Beckett's prose for their sexual scenes. Like his Irish predecessors, Banville chooses to focus not on the act so much as the desire, and this makes for more elusive, if more realistic--a word not otherwise applicable to this mise-en-scene--sensation. You do hang suspended in the introspective, self-absorbed, obsessively ruminating realm that Freddie creates. Perhaps only the philosophically or aesthetically rarified few readers will persevere. Still, Booker Prize winner that Banville now is, perhaps more will make the effort to explore his past fictional landscapes of devotion and desolation.The ending, as with many of Banville's novels since the 1990s, gives a twist, here only in the very last pages. It did surprise me a bit, but not that much, for Banville's narrator throughout's a slippery character among many just--if not more--as chameleonish. This does make for some imprecision that weakens slightly the storyline in its final resolution. This shape-shifting milieu I wished had been clarified a bit more than it is, and the welcome reappearance of Inspector Hackett is not as sustained as this character deserves. Yet on the whole, readers of Banville will be satisfied again by this installment. His character of Aunt Corky, in her slow decay, is as funny and as harrowing a figure as he has ever attempted to sketch out and then fill in on these pages.As I have in my other responses via Amazon to Banville's books, I want to include a couple of my favorite snippets to show you his command of what he evokes in his spare but detailed style. First, as he delves into \\"this Bermuda Triangle of the soul,\\" he addresses his appeal to A., the recipient of this book-length outpouring of longing. Freddie's extended letter of love and loss and lust, who represents the \\"ineffable mystery of the Other (I can hear your ribald snigger); that is what I have plunged into again as into a choked Sargasso Sea wherein I can never find my depth. In you I thought my feet at last would reach the sandy floor where I could wade weightlessly with bubbles kissing my shins and small things skittering under my slow-motion tread. Now it seems I was wrong, wrong again.\\" (47)Later as he recalls his embraces of A., now speaking to her as in the third person: \\"devouring her slowly, minutely, as in an enraptured cannibalism of the senses. How palely delicate she was. She glimmered. Her skin had a grainy, thick texture that at times, when she was out of sorts, or menstrual, I found excitingly unpleasant to the touch. Yes, it was always there, behind all the transports and the adoration, that faint, acrid, atavistic hint of disgust, waiting, and reminding. This I am convinced is what sex is, the anaesthetic that makes bearable the flesh of another. And we erect cathedrals upon it.\\" (121)Certainly the polarities of attraction and repulsion have been diagrammed in so many books for so many millennia, but here once more I believe Banville shows his skill in making such magnetism and rejection fresh and as powerful as they have been expressed in Joyce or--here especially--Beckett."},{"Title":"Sigmund Freud: The Man and His Theories","review":"\\"Sigmund Freud has been called the \\"father of psychiatry.\\" The Austrian scientist and originator of psychoanalysis was one of the great revolutionary thinker of the twentieth centruy. He changed our world by changing our way of looking at it. There are few branches of human endeavor which his discoveries and theories do not illuminate.\\"This book by Gerard Lauzun presents not only a colorful human portait of Sigmund Freud but the living history of a great achievement. Undeterred by public indignation and by the opposition of orthododx medical circles, Freud lived to see psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic theory established and accepted all over the world.\\"Included in this volume are a summary of psychoanalytic developments after Freud, selections from Freud's own writing, and an evalution by Stefan Zweig of Freud in his last years.\\"Chapter titles:\\"In search of the self; or, among the byways, 'changed into himself' by reality, autoanalysis: the dreamer breaks out of his vicious circle, Early disciples; shocks and dissensions--the departure of Adler, the departure of Stekel, the departure of Jung, the war years, new questions and old questions reconsidered, the last act, the succession; or, how the estate was divided up, psychoanalysis, the interpretation of dreams, introductory lectures on psychoanalysis, totem and taboo, stefan Zweig on Freud, short bibliography.\\""},{"Title":"Austerlitz (French Edition)","review":"Like fellow author without a country Nabokov, time and memory become interconnected. The anchors become the buildings. This was a very enjoyable examination of history as well. I would strongly suggest this novel to anyone interested in the above subjects."},{"Title":"Broken We Kneel Reflections on Faith and Citizenship","review":"This is a moving and informative book. For those of us who have read Strength for the Journey, we get to catch up on Diana Butler Bass's life since the end of that book. In her distinctive style, she combines history, theology, and her own story in a way that transcends characterization but is extraordinarily readable. The starting point this time is September 11, 2001--the events of that day had a profound impact on her life in the Washington area. But this is not a book about September 11, or the war in Iraq, or any other current event so much as the record of a Christian trying to be true to the gospel when it seems so many misunderstand, misapply, or ignore it. The church, it is said, missed an opportunity when attendance rose dramatically following the terrorist attacks. It is never too late. Bass's prophetic voice against the conflation of church and state provides a helpful example of how a Christian can live with integrity in these difficult times."},{"Title":"Broken We Kneel Reflections on Faith and Citizenship","review":"Diana Butler Bass writes for the many Christians whose horror at the attacks on September 11 was compounded by the abduction of Christian terms for nationalist, militarist, and imperialist goals, and the enthusiastic unquestioning enrollment of innumerable congregations and church leaders in a neo-medieval crusade.A meditation framed on the experience of conflict with the Washington D.C. congregation on whose pastoral staff she was serving at the time, the chapters will call to mind the works which indelibly marked the path of Christianity in the 20th century, whether theatrical, like 'Murder in the Cathedral' or 'A Man for All Seasons', confessional like Merton's letters and meditations on the American war against Vietnam; but the language is not the language of the polemic or the theatre or even autobiography, but the language of lament, of exile, even of excommunication. There is no ease in such language, and there are no simplifications in the book, which opens with the author's confession to her (Episcopal) priest that she had removed the United We Stand sign from the church entryway, because it was a call to vengeance and to a national crusade. When the priest informs her that the church belongs to the congregation, she responds that it's God's church, and from there, travels from the powerful political congregation which dedicates its faith to nation to the celebration of Easter some 20 months later in an inner city church three blocks from the White House.Those who seek the company of the suffering servant of which the gospels speak, rather than the Nordic warrior messiah that stands at the center of the American war cult as much as he did at the heart of the German Church of the Third Reich, will find a familiar voice &amp; a kindred heart in 'Broken We Kneel'."},{"Title":"Broken We Kneel Reflections on Faith and Citizenship","review":"Diana Butler Bass shares hope with the church, and all who care deeply about the role of faith in our national life. Bass dares to speak boldly of the hope with in her, and of our challenge to be members of an alternative intentional community, the Church within the Empire. Her words give courage to all whose hearts ache for another way to be both Christians and patriots, to humbly tell out from our souls the greatness of the Lord. Bass' text is a welcome antidote to the myopic zealotry that has been so prevalent in our national landscape after September 11th. I pray that from the hope renewed in reading this significant little book many, \\"proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight, the hungry fed, the humble lifted high.\\" An engaging and inspiring read for all concerned about faith in America. Share this book with your friends, your pastor, grandmother, and reading groups. Would be an excellent springboard for parish discussion groups."},{"Title":"Broken We Kneel Reflections on Faith and Citizenship","review":"The deepest implications of 9/11 have nothing to do with George W. Bush or Osama bin Laden, and everything to do with Christians' duty to oppose violence and empire wherever they may emerge. As Butler Bass explains, the confusion of the state with the church has perilous consequences, both theologically and throughout human history. In the face of war, Christians are called to remember that they are \\"in the world, but not of it.\\" They must love and forgive all people, even those their kings declare are enemies. (One of the most innocently radical elements in \\"Broken We Kneel\\" is Butler Bass's discussion of oikos - the concept that we are all one family.)Indeed, though Butler Bass bills her book as a lament, it is equally a gentle reminder that Christians are aliens in the City of Man, and that bombs falling on Iraq and Afghanistan can neither return our missing loved ones nor answer our own prayers for healing. She also offers hope that through renewed commitment to hospitality in the tradition of Jesus, we may strengthen our citizenship in the City of God.God is speaking to us, even now whispering good news of comfort and hope. If September 11 challenged you as a Christian, Diana Butler Bass will help you to listen to God again. Buy this book now."},{"Title":"Broken We Kneel Reflections on Faith and Citizenship","review":"As we enter the fifth anniversary of 9-11 and the mid-term elections, Diana Butler Bass' book is well worth a second look. Using her personal experiences attending church in Washington, DC post-9/11, Butler Bass reflects on what it means to be a Christian and an American in a post 9-11 world. As Christians, do we drape the cross in the American flag or do we follow the cross of the risen Christ?"},{"Title":"Broken We Kneel Reflections on Faith and Citizenship","review":"Bass has a talent for expressing keen social observation and scholarly analysis in clear, engaging prose. In &quot;Broken We Kneel&quot;, she is able to lead the reader through big ideas about church and state by drawing on her experience as a mother, scholar, and church worker in the Washington DC area. The result is a book that is both accessible and insightful--and most importantly a joy to read!Bass' strong Christian voice, rooted in Augustine, is desparately needed in current discussions about peacemaking, patriotism, and citizenship. While challenging, it is generous and hopeful that Christianity's long tradition has important and unexpected insights for today's world."},{"Title":"Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practice","review":"You'd expect a book with the title \\"Graphic Design Manual\\" to be comprehensive, covering all the fundamentals of graphic design. This book falls far, far short of being a complete guide to graphic design. To give you an idea of how short, the book has a dozen pages of text. That's it. I know graphic designers are fond of pictures but 12 pages of text out of 172 for a manual? (I'm reviewing my copy which is the 1965 edition.)That said, this *is* a good book on design. The little text that there is is informative and the graphics nicely illustrate and extend the text. Much of content of the book has to be generated by the reader himself, as he reads the brief introductory text and then studies the examples.Hofmann's approach is logical and hierarchical. He starts off with the basics and illustrates each with a simple series of graphics. Then over the course of a few pages the examples get progressively more complex but still depend upon and illustrate the point/s being discussed.I highly recommend this book to someone who wants to learn or refresh their grasp of the fundamentals of design. Hofmann is a master and the graphics he has chosen for this book are compelling and informative. This book is probably beyond the novice level as it is so compressed, with very little discussion of each point but a lot of examples. A beginner will be hard pressed to follow the development of examples without some more guidance as to what he is looking at and how the more complex graphics relate to the original point. But still, you will learn a lot from this book, especially if you return to it later in your design education.In short, despite its title this book does not cover graphic design, it covers the elements of design, things such as the dot, the line, text and illustration and the interplay between these elements. You will not find any discussion of important principles such as hierarchy, alignment, grids, layout, color (in fact all graphics are black and white). This is however a valuable book that deserves careful study and will teach you a lot about the fundamentals of design."},{"Title":"Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practice","review":"George Nelson states in the preface that Armin Hofmann \\"arrives naturally at the conviction that if problems can be correctly stated, they can be solved.\\"This gets at the essence of what motivates Hofmann's thinking and teachings. Design is about problem solving and Hofmann's work is a clear and beautiful expression of the design process, at its most basic.The book describes the relationships of the dot and the line within a wide range of compositions that explore balance, hierarchy and rhythm.A classic guide for motion media students/teachers and graphic designers alike. Beautifully illustrated, this book implicitly follows the strong methodologies established at the Basel School of Art."},{"Title":"Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practice","review":"I picked this up because it's listed on nearly every Graphic Design reading list. Reviews rave about it and call it a classic. At the risk of sounding like a philistine, I don't get it.There's a nice little intro by Armin Hoffman, where he touches on some of the core elements to visual design (dots, line, contrast, letters). After that, it's approximately 150 pages of black & white form studies. You get out of it what you put into it, I suppose.Also, the price of this book is a little ridiculous. It's a basic softcover with black & white printing coming in at less than 200 pages."},{"Title":"Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practice","review":"Even though Armin Hofmann has made a grand contrubution to the design world, I surely don't consider this book as a beginners manual. The one book that I can only consider to open the beginners horizon is &quot;A History of Graphic Design&quot; by Philip B. Meggs. In the long run, this is a good book, but not for the freshman."},{"Title":"Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practice","review":"THIS BOOK IS THE BIBLE OF GRAPHIC DESIGN...FOR ALL OF YOU GRAPHIC DESIGNERS, YOU NEED TO KEEP THIS BOOK AS A GUIDE.

The fact of history is that writers transmit the message of revolution to those looking for a new way of being. It is writing that incubates the successive stages of human thought. The Gospels, after all, are the work of writers; Plato, the writer, tells us the thoughts of Socrates; Voltaire and Swift entertained while exposing hypocrisy, encouraged alternative thinking. In Writers in Revolt, Richard Seaver, Terry Southern and Alexander Trocchi frame the work of twenty-one writers, from Dostoevsky to Herman Hesse, Baudelaire to Ginsberg, in the same light. These are the messengers, they tell us, listen if you will! That the editors themselves are all worthy to be included in the collection certainly is a fact that commends it. It is a good idea to put these works together, because in it we perceive the continuous threadline of mortal pain these artists experience. They see the world as it is, not how it should be, and great courage is required to endure the punishment of such vision. The words that emerge from the crucible are true words, and don't fade with time. Find this book if you can, and put it in your messenger bag.Roll call, in order of presentation: Allen Ginsberg, Sade, Austryn Wainhouse, Baudelaire, Sartre, Dostoevsky, Hesse, Artaud, Celine, Malaparte, Henry Miller, Iris Murdoch, Genet, Chapman Mortimer, William Gaddis, Evan S. Connell, Jr., Charles Foster, Edward Dahlberg, H.L. Mencken, Hubert Selby, Jr., William Burroughs, Ionesco, Beckett.I believe this is the only book where you will find these writers cohabitating.

But, it is my fault for not reading the description (it says it's 30-something pages long and spiral bound). I even read the reviews complaining about how thin it is, but figured it just wasn't like the usual thick cookbooks you see from Betty Crocker or something.The point of this recipe book is to instill a way of life into your cooking, and have your cooking instill your way of life. So, of course there's no braised rack of lamb recipe or lard pie dough recipe. These are very focused recipes that follow the Gerson way of living.After the initial shock of it's thinness for $10, I opened up the book and started reading the recipes. Most of the recipes are pretty simple and straight forward, using fresh fruits, vegetables, and wholesome sweeteners and flours, like oat flour and honey. It had a pretty good variety and looked very palatable, capable of pleasing even non-vegetarians (perhaps not the kind of people who are completely opposed to veg and fruits. Although, they need these recipes most! :] ) There are recipes ranging from a vegetable (stock) soup to the innovative (at least in average households) way of using fruits as a base for sauces to add flavor, and ways to make creamed corn without cream, or flavorful stuffed vegetables, and also a few (just a few) dessert items that do not use cream, butter, etc. This book also calls for the use of a blender allot (Like I said, it utilizes the flavor of vegetables and fruit).Unlike most \\"diet\\" cookbooks, these recipes use REAL natural food. So, no margarine junk, no fake sweeteners, etc. It's good for you because it's made soley of simple, good-for-you plant products. And I was extremely please that Charlotte Gerson includes notes that specific why you must or musn't use a specific item. She also has notations about what items you should avoid using if you are trying to follow a simple-version of the Gerson regimen. I think all-around this is a good tool to help you become cognisant of how to make healthier food. Why not learn from someone who has done this for decades and has decades of research and medical treatment to guide these recipes and food preparation!Afterall, we spend $10 going to one movie that last 2 hours.

Old SF but still good.though some carracters aren't developed, the basic idea and the interaction are excellent. Loved the ideal of anti-racism which is still appropriate today."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"DOUBLE STAR, written in 1956, was the first Robert A. Heinlein novel to win a Hugo Award. Interestingly, in his memoirs, Isaac Asimov referred to this book as the best thing Heinlein ever wrote. I disagree with Asimov -- DOUBLE STAR is certainly a fun read, but nowhere near Heinlein's best.This book is essentially about an actor shanghaied into impersonating a powerful politician. The job is originally meant to be a short-term one, but eventually evolves into something much bigger and more important. Most of DOUBLE STAR consists of the actor faking his way through one high-profile situation after another. The results are consistently entertaining, and Heinlein's prose is first-rate.DOUBLE STAR is a short read, and contains almost no hard science. This is a novel about politics, but the political ideas are dealt with in a rather superficial fashion. All the major characters are colorful, but not as well developed as I would like. The ending is also extremely predictable. This was probably a cutting-edge novel for its time (i.e. the United States of the 1950s, when SF novels were first entering the marketplace), but it doesn't compare favorably with the more complex SF novels of today.Still, Heinlein's erudite prose is a joy to read, and he was certainly the best stylist of SF's golden age. DOUBLE STAR is good, old-fashioned fun, and anyone interested in reading classic SF should definitely give this one a whirl."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This is sort of a retelling of \\"The Prisoner of Zenda,\\" and the plot succeeds or fails based on whether or not you buy the possibility that, with just a little grease paint and some talent, one man could pass himself off as another, at close range, to people who knew him. The other part of the story is that this man whom you are impersonating is a key political figure in the story of mankind reaching out to the stars. He brings an end to human-centered government, and xenophobic relations between Earth and the other inhabited planets in our Solar System. Heinlein takes on this sort of theme much more powerfully later in \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.\\" This book is more of a romp, with some stuff to think about just coming along for the ride.How different was the world of late 1950's sf publishing. Novels could be 140 pages long. No need for warp drive in order to meet aliens (though some sort of relativity drive makes it possible to get from the Earth to Mars in a matter of weeks), because they're right here! They live on Venus, and Mars, of course. Did we really know so little about conditions on Mars as to think big people-sized creatures could live there, in 1956? Hard to imagine we were that ignorant still. Of course, we had still not one satellite in orbit in 1956, let alone sent any robot vehicles off to the Moon and planets. But canals with shrimp growing in them? And an atmosphere that would allow someone to breath, albeit only for a short period. Mars would kill you in a matter of seconds, it's barely better than the Moon. Several themes of Heinlein's later work are on display here, though he develops them a lot more later on. His whole interest in the impersonating schtick is to explore what it would be like to inhabit another person's...life. In a later work, he has an old man taking over a young woman's body (\\"Time Enough for Love\\"). All of this raises interesting questions about what is it I'm talking about when I say \\"I\\"? Also, the motif/theme/whatever it is of the Wise Old Man is here, in the person of the politician, Bonforte. He's not preaching and pontificating yet, as he will in later novels, but he is there. I enjoyed reading this, but be prepared for some major boners in future-prediction. There are mountains of microfilm filling up vaults on the Moon, which I'm guessing the \\"robot brains\\" (computers) can read somehow. Slide rules still...rule. As another reviewer here said, it's more Ruritania than sf, but what the hey. Give it a read."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This is a story for everyone. Kids and adults can enjoy this story of intrigue and action. Set in the future includings mans exploration of the solar system. There are even Martions on Mars! I have read it many times and it has become one of my all time favorites!"},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This one isn't really \\"science fiction,\\" since, with only changes, it could be set in the here-and-now, or in Ruritania -- but it's pure Heinlein, and better written than many of his earlier works. At only 128 pages, it's also pretty short for a novel -- but it works. Lorenzo Smyth (a/k/a Larry Smith) is an actor convinced of his own talent (which, as it turns out, is actually considerable) who is hired to impersonate the Good Guy leader of a major political alliance, who has been kidnaped on Mars by the Evil Opposition. Against his better apolitical judgment, Lorenzo takes the job because it's a challenge, and almost immediately regrets it as the limited engagement spins itself out indefinitely. There's a minimum of strident overwriting of the sort Heinlein was often guilty of in pursuit of his moral and ethical positions, with the quietly-made exception of a plea for racial tolerance."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This short novel is typical Heinlein fare, which is IMHO quite good. In short, Double Star is the story of Lorenzo Smythe, a young actor full of himself who gets drawn into events larger than even his own ego. It's an enjoyable tale overall, though I don't quite see why it won a Hugo."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Reading through the Hugo's chronologically, I've just finished Double Star. As with &quot;The Demolished Man,&quot; this book could succeed totally independent from the sci-fi genre. It is a pleasurable analysis of politics. My first Heinlein book, and I enjoyed it. I've noted that I'll be reading several more of his novels that have won the Hugo. Interesting side-note to see his development of the character Penny. So 50's ish. Would never fly today!"},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Probably one of the best written of Heinlein's novels, this slender book is more a character study than traditional gee-whiz science fiction. The hero is an actor chosen to impersonate a prominent political figure. The story, though set in typical Heinleinian future history, is largely the story of the actor growing into the role of, and eventually becoming the statesmen. Heinlein handles this somewhat hokey plot in a surprisingly effective way, eliciting considerable sympathy for the protagonist. Heinlein uses a traditional science fiction device, the growth of an immature hero in a novel environment. Heinlein used this device in a number of other books and its effective because it encourages readers to identify with the hero. In this case, however, the novel environment is less the future history that is the backdrop of the story than the world of politics and electioneering.I suspect that Heinlein may have originally planned a more complex and longer book. The doppelganger aspect of Double Star is mirrored by the unusual biology of the Martians who appear as minor characters. My guess is that Heinlein intended to do more with this aspect of the story but settled for a shorter and simpler plot. This book also reveals one of Heinlein's best features, his intense dislike of racism. Published in the mid-1950s, Double Star is partly a barely veiled attack on racial bigotry."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Double Star is a brilliant tale of political intrigue set in a science fiction mileiu. Ignore the space ships, ignore interplanetary travel, and ignore the other trapping of SciFi, this is a story of an actor drawn into the most brutal, deceptive, treacherous environment known to humanity; politics.The actor, Lorenzo, has the right build and face to play the stand in for a high ranking politician, and it is not clear whether or not he'll ever get out of the role... or want to.In addition to being a great tale, there are a number of worthwhile lessons hidden in here. The best example is the habit of taking notes on people you meet, even folks junior to you that appear to be nobodies, in order to cultivate a relationship at a later date. Machiavellian? Mmmm... yes, but also good manners for anyone who meets and works with a lot of people.A great story, regardless of the setting. Easily one of Heinlein's best and most underrated.E. M. Van Court"},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This is one of Heinlein's four Hugo-winning novels. A rather lightweight actor is shanghaied away from Earth and more or less forced to impersonate a kidnapped politician. As he understands what the politician stands for, he falls more willingly into the role. The politician is recovered, but in such condition that the actor must remain in the role, and when the politician dies, adopt it for life.Lorenzo's transformation from lightweight actor to Churchillian libertarian politician is interesting to watch, and the science fiction is not essential to the plot--the Empire could, with some plot modifications, be in Roman times, or the British Empire, or in the twentieth century.Two problems: We see two sorts of characters we encounter too often in Heinlein's later books here--the two-dimensional female (Penny) and the yammerhead (Bill). It strains credibility that someone like Bonforte would tolerate someone like Bill near him for several years (sure, he does good work, but surely there would be thousands of nicer competant people available to a high-level politician), but the plot needs a bad guy close enough for the readers to focus on. But we see too many Pennys and Bills in the later Heinleins. Second problem: Heinlein's parliamentary system is ill-thought out. Wouldn't the Grand Assembly be heavily dominated by Asians? Yet, all of Bonforte's associates are American or English. (I don't think we even see an Asian, other than the Emperor's attache. Where's Quiroga from? South America?) How is it, in a Grand Assembly where the districts must have the population of New York City (say, 800 members, 8,000,000 per district), that there can be \\"pocket boroughs\\"--districts for space pilots, and university women, and a district for Lapland? And, would these districts be content to have their representatives be Mr. Bonforte's secretary and crew?Still, a great book."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"If there was a definition for a page turner, it should include the words Double Star. Start this book. Your fingers will start turning the pages faster and faster (regardless of slide rulers and native Martians) until without even realizing it you will reach Double Star's moving finale.But until then:You will have enjoyed one of the best first person narratives ever in science fiction.You will have read a fantastic case of somebody's personal singularity, witnessing his personal Gethsemane Gardens, but also his apotheosis.You will have extremely liked the excellent cast of supporting characters, the petty politicians, the sarcastic nobles, the unexpected villains and the hive extraterrestrials.Easily among Heinlein's best. Quintuple star for double star."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"...swipe from the best, and Heinlein certainly did here, lifting his plot from Anthony Hope (hodgeson)'s classic swashbuckler \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\".The interesting things about this book (which is NOT one of RAH's juveniles) that at first appear to set it apart from the majority of Heinlein's output are all characteristics of the narrator, Lorenzo.Lorenzo is a xenophobe, an unheard-of trait for a Heinlein protagonist.Lorenzo is completely incompetent at mathematics -- while RAH (through the mouthpiece of Lazarus Long) has opined that no-one is truly human who cannot understand higher mathematics.Lorenzo is completely uninterested in politics or anything having to do with government, except as he personally may find himself interacting with law enforcement officials.Lorenzo presents himself as something of a coward.And Lorenzo is a raving egomaniac.But Lorenzo learns to deal with his fear of Martians.He never does learn math, but we gradually come to recognise that Heinlein has pulled a switch on us, and that Lorenzo is still our old friend, Heinlein's Competent Man -- but that his competency lies in another direction.Because Lorenzo is recruited for the greatest challenge of an actor's career -- to impersonate, literally in front of entire worlds, an immensely famous politician, who has been kidnapped by his political enemies in order to derail an important treaty with the inahbitants of Mars.And, gradually, as Lorenzo comes to know the man he must replace -- know him from the inside out, and \\"become\\" him, to the point that he can extemporise politically sound speeches in the Great Man's style -- that he begins to understand that politics is all-important in making it possible for the masses to live in peace and security, Lorenzo Grows Up.The Lorenzo we meet on Page One is a cheerful, flippant, shallow and actually fairly immature man. The Lorenzo we see by the end of the story proper has matured, seen some of the wrongs that need righting, and has realised that someone has to step up to the line and take a stand or the wrongs will simply continue; that all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.And that is what the story is about, really -- like RAH's juvenile, \\"Starman Jones\\", this is mostly a story about a man growing up and accepting a man's role and responsibilities.And, as the much-older Lorenzo adds as a short coda at the very end of the book, learning the important thing about the faceless masses, the thing that so many politicians lose sight of -- that they have lives of their own.That they can hurt.(At least one previous review has alluded to the excerpts from Bonforte's speeches -- i strongly suspect that, as the character of Bonforte himself seems to be by the man, they are heavily influenced or inspired by the oratory of Winston Churchill. Particularly, when i read the passage about choosing sides, i hear Winnie's voice in my head...)"},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This story of a provincial actor forced by circumstances to play the role of the Solar System's most broad-minded statesman is perhaps Heinlein's most under-rated novel, even though it has sold millions of copies and won the Hugo. A true actor, Lorenzo manages to become the role -- expanding his own horizons as well. In his epiphany, he starts with the only principle he ever subscribed to -- \\"the show must go on\\" -- and follows it to include all fair-dealing and professional ethics, and continues until he reaches eternal truths and a philosophical outlook. The scene is a marvel of thought and emotion (and not a bad start for a personal philosophy). His depictions of actors, politicians, and modern monarchy all ring true.(Gee, and I didn't even mention the kidnapping, murders, dirty politics, rockets, death rays, and Martians!)"},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"While Double Star did win the Hugo Award for the best science fiction novel of 1956, I would not call it one of Heinlein's most important works, nor would I rate it as highly as a good number of his other novels. It's a great story, but it strikes me as rather peculiar. There is not a great deal of science fiction in the book, for one thing. More importantly, although the plot revolves around politics, Double Star is much less political than many of Heinlein's other novels. No great questions are probed very deeply, and one finds oneself entertained more than intellectually stimulated or morally challenged. Here's the story in a nutshell. Lorenzo Smythe (aka The Great Lorenzo) is a fairly good actor currently down on his luck. A seemingly chance encounter with a space man lands him a role he never dreamed of playing. At first, he is only told that the job involves impersonating an important person. Two dead men and one dead Martian later, he finds himself rather unhappily bound for Mars, and he soon learns that his assignment, which he has reluctantly agreed to, is to play none other than John Joseph Bonforte, the head of the Expansionist movement, a man loved and hated passionately throughout the solar system. The real Bonforte has been kidnapped just days before an important event. If Bonforte misses that event, in which he will be formally adopted into Mars' most prominent native family, all of the goals of the Expansionist movement may well be doomed to failure. Smythe gives the performance of his life, but his hopes of returning home are squashed when the real Bonforte is recovered in very bad health. Smythe is asked to continue the charade just a little longer. One thing leads to another, and he finds himself essentially becoming Bonforte, holding the Expansionist party together by his presence and working to make Bonforte's goals a reality. His original self had no interest in politics and had a natural aversion to Martians, but Smythe changes fundamentally as his command performance extends from one encore after another.Some readers may say that there is too much politics in this book; this is true only insofar as the story is about politics. I really would not call the story political at all. Besides expressing an argument for the equality of all members of the empire, be they Martian, Venusian, Jovian, Terran, etc., the story is relatively free of the types of political and philosophical arguments that typify many of Heinlein's later novels. Those readers uninterested in politics should not pass this novel over out of a fear of politicization. Double Star is a very entertaining story and a fairly quick read. There is nothing earth-shattering or conscience paradigm-shifting about it, and that is the reason I am somewhat surprised that it received the Hugo award. This actually would be a good crossover introduction to Heinlein for readers not interested in science fiction in and of itself."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Robert Heinlein is one of the legends of science fiction for a simple reason: he was a masterful storyteller. There have been finer prose stylists, and a few sf writers have crafted novels of greater power than Heinlein's, but rare are the authors who have so consistently grabbed a reader and commanded rapt attention from the first scene to the last, in novel after novel. Double Star isn't one of Heinlein's best novels, but it was good enough to win a Hugo, Heinlein's first.Spaceman Dak Broadbent hires Lornzo Smythe to impersonate a man. Although Lorenzo is a talented actor (just ask him!), he is more of a con artist than an accomplished thespian. Before Dak can explain the role, Dak and Lorenzo are fleeing, having killed a Martian and a human during a shootout. The individual Lorenzo is to impersonate turns out to an important politician -- important to Earth's relationship with Mars and to the Expansionist Party's future. As you would expect in politics, betrayal motivated by unrealized ambition threatens exposure of Dak's scheme. Can Lorenzo get away with it? That's the question that drives the plot and captivates the reader.If we're confident today that there are no Martians on Mars, it's still fun to imagine the future as Heinlein saw it: a colonized moon and outer planets, space yachts, the strange customs of Martians and Venusians, and all the other trappings of 1950s science fiction that Heinlein helped create. It is a future that his characters, who are living in it, naturally take for granted -- unlike some current, ego-driven sf authors who can't resist bogging down their narratives with detailed descriptions of the technological advances they envision.Heinlein, of course, loved to pontificate, and Lorenzo's crash course in politics gave Heinlein a chance to opine on a variety of topics, from philosophy to moral instruction, from economics to political equality. Not surprisingly, the freedom-heavy political model that Lorenzo adopts mirrors Heinlein's own: free trade, free travel, a minimalist approach to lawmaking, the primacy of the individual (balanced by the individual's understanding that functioning communities require self-sacrifice). Yet Heinlein's gift was his ability to put story first. His characters pontificate because, in the context of the story, it's the natural thing for them to do. Their opinions never get in the way of the story; in fact, they often advance it. Heinlein always managed to convey heavy opinions with a light touch, a technique that few authors have managed with such skill.Politics, Lorenzo learns, is a game often suited to dirty players, but what if an election is based on a hoax? Yes, I know, conspiracy theorists and party hacks are always claiming elections are based on hoaxes, making Double Star a novel that will always be timely. But is it a great novel? Double Star is an entertaining send-up of politics, making the point in stark terms that great politicians are great actors, that the difference between performance and reality is often blurred to obscurity, but the novel lacks the depth of Heinlein's best work. The ending is a little too obvious, a little too easy. Even second-tier Heinlein, though, is a better read than most authors can manage. Double Star is an unpadded novel written in a breezy, fast-moving style. More than a half century after it was written, it is a novel that both sf fans and readers of political fiction can continue to enjoy."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"For a book that was written over 50 years ago, it's a fine read. It's cool to read sci fi from back then since it wasn't as accepted a genre as it is now. I rather like Lorenzo's character and his thoughts. There's a bit of acting advice here that real-life actors could actually use. Some people might decry the implausibility of the plot, but we need to remember the time and content that this story was written in. While I LOVE the Lazarus Long books, I have found Heinlein's older works to be a treat as well. If you're a Heinlein fan, read this. If not, you might still enjoy it. Just keep in mind that this was written in the 50's, so much of our technology (current) outpaces what is in the book. It's interesting to see Lorenzo do his best to be a double, and starting to enjoy it and care about the role rather than just seeing it as a job."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Heinlein's disdain for politicians doesn't stop him from knowing that the game of politics is the most important thing for all sentient life. The ablility for living things to live together in harmony, and for the greater good, hinges on interactions in the political arena, and that is the true nature of this story. The subtext of the well-woven plotline is secondary to the lessons learned by the protagonist, and that is what makes this great literature. Read the book, don't just watch it like a TV show, and you will know. Another great by the best."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"I was pleased to renew my acquaintance with this book recently via the audio cassette version. The story is read -- or more accurately, performed most excellently -- by Lloyd James. I leave it to the other reviewers to give a synopsis of the plot. It's fun to see what Heinlein &quot;got right&quot; in some of his future predictions and where he &quot;missed&quot; (no mobile phones? -- part of the plot would have collapsed). If you enjoy travelling with an audio book, this should be a fun companion."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Winner of the 1956 Hugo Award for Best Novel, Double Star is a passable, light-hearted, political adventure story albeit with a pretty interesting main character -- Lawrence Smith (\\"The Great Lorenzo\\").The Plot (some Spoilers!)The actor Lawrence Smith is drinking his last money away in bar when a spaceman enters and attempts to hire him for a suspicious job. Smith initially refuses but is cajoled into assisting -- eventually they viciously kill some Martians who try to stop them (an aspect of the story which is never fully explained since all the other Martians are really nice).Slowly the extent of the job is revealed to Smith -- impersonate the prominent expansionist politician John Joseph Bonforte whose been kidnapped by his political enemies! Smith doesn't agree with Bonforte's politics and hates Martians -- Bonforte on the other hand is palls with the strange fission creatures and their stinky smells and half-brained children. This doesn't jive with the job he must perform as Bonforte -- a speech to the Martians so he can join their hive and eventually make them full citizens of the Earth Empire! Some hypnosis so Martians smell suddenly like perfume and before long Smith's internalized all the mannerism and traits of Bonforte. The plot thickens and Smith slowly is forced to win Bonforte's elections since the real politician's been temporarily mind-wiped... A visit to the Earth Emperor (A Constitutional Monarch) and his toy trains on the Moon spells potential disaster! Will he be caught? Will the real Bonforte recover?My ThoughtsSince Heinlein has \\"The Great Lorenzo\\" tell his tale in first-person, the transformation from an irrationally racist egotistical actor into Bonforte himself is well done and we get some fascinating insights into his mind. However, since the novel abruptly stops when Smith has to actually become Bonforte at all times the 'who actually am I' is never explored in much detail. However, this is a fun adventure with unbelievably silly aliens, dumb emperors with no power playing with trains....I think Heinlein realized that describing Martians is a futile endeavor -- hence they are but a back story here and even more of a back story in Stranger in a Strange Land. Also, what starts out as an adventure story quickly turns into a turgid political 'let's win the election story.' If only Heinlein buckled down and decided to be serious -- the Smith/Bonforte character deserves a better backdrop (especially since all the the other characters in the novel are interchangeable and dull). I remain unimpressed. If you like Heinlein, pick it up -- it in no way belongs in the ranks of Heinlein's best despite its awards..."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"I'm a big Heinlein fan but the book is not always entertaining.

It clearly was a different time and mindset.I did enjoy this book, I can not deny that. While it did not enrapt me, I was very curious to turn the page. But, when all was said and done, this book did not move me in any meaningful way, nor leave me with any new thoughts. I wouldn't quite call the book forgettable.

Many many many have featured Interplanetary Space Travel, as this one does. Many have themes of alien contact, which this does. Many address political struggles, which this does.But very few actually have a political campaign -- in a Parliamentary System, not an American Congress style system -- as its central conflict. And no others I can think of use Theater as a central theme as well.Heinlein's protaganist is a method actor with sideruns into vaudeville -- those who believe the two are incompatible haven't worked in the trade, which I have. Lazlo comes across as an &quot;authentic&quot; actor. Self-important, delusional about his own importance in the universe, opinionated and terribly terribly refined and effete. But it never falls into parody (I worked with many Lazlos during my time as an actor, and was one more than once). Its hook -- later stolen wholesale for the movie &quot;Dave&quot; -- involves Lazlo being pulled into a role he doesn't want -- the impersonation of a kidnapped Minister of Parliament, and one of the most influential politicians alive. Complicating Lazlo's immersion into the role are his dislike of the man's politics and having to work with his staff, who revere the object of Lazlo's study and resent Lazlo's intrusion into his role.This book won a Hugo award and deserved it. It's a fun ride and highly enjoyable. Pick it up and lose yourself for a while"},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"...but then even Heinlein's worst is still pretty good.

I have read and reread this book numerous times over the years."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"World famous actor (at least according to his press releases) Lorenzo Smythe is currently 'resting between roles' i.e. out of work and suffering some 'temporary cash flow problems' i.e. he's flat broke. He is sitting in a bar contemplating this sorry state of affairs when he strikes up an acquaintance with a stranger, a recently landed spaceman. Within a few hours Smythe finds himself a) employed b) nearly killed c) an accomplice to murder and d) leaving the planet. Smythe's new role will be a bit of a challenge for him, he has been hired to impersonate a famous politician who has gone missing. Smythe is sure that the role is well within his capabilities, it is just that the job well take place on Mars, and the needed performance is before an exclusively Martian audience, a race that Smythe finds particularly distasteful. Still the show must go on and Smythe is nothing if not a trouper.This is one of the novels that Heinlein wrote during the 1950's that was aimed primarily toward the young adult audience. As such the more outspoken sexual situations that appear in his later works (STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, I WILL FEAR NO EVIL, TO SAIL BEYOND THE SUNSET etc) do not appear here. The story is on the surface that of an adventure, will Smythe get away with his impersonation or not, but, as with all of Heinlein's work there is a deeper layer. Smythe undergoes a great change in the course of the story as Heinlein once again addresses his familiar themes of the complexities of government and an individual's duty to his society.Fans of Heinlein will not want to miss this charming adventure which is a great read in itself as well as foreshadowing themes that will return in CITIZEN OF THE GALAXY and THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS. Those new to Heinlein's work could happily begin with this one even though it is not RAH at his peak. It is unusual for Heinlein's work in that the reader will probably wish the story was longer rather than wonder why editor had not trimmed it."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"An flat broke egocentric actor, Lorenzo Smythe, is hired to be a body double for a high stand politician: John Bonforte, head of the Loyal Opposition and leader of the Expansionist Party. The double assignment was supposed to be temporary, but Lorenzo finds himself on the way to crucial ceremony at Mars where Earth's politics are at stake. And Lorenzo hates Martians, he's scared of them, but as substitute he must deal closely with them. Lorenzo enters in the midst of the acting challenge of a lifetime.Book starts out light and comical. Eventually we see how arrogant, immature, and xenophobic -- but also a a mimic -- Lorenzo, transforms himself into a perfect copy of Bonforte both in psychical and emotional level. He must act, speak and think like stage would never end. \\"Double\\" star is about taking responsibility and how person steps into shoes of a world leader. In the background the political angle is used to imply racial issues; as observed from the schism between the Earth and Martians.Three (3) stars. This short, quick read, book won Hugo 1956. It is somewhere in between the juvenile stories and Heinlein's serious works. As literature it's more entertainment. None of the characters other than Lorenzo are much more than stand-ins: e.g. we encounter childlike high executive secretary. The politics is fairly light and action is more the dominant factor. An undemanding and light read."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"\\"Double-Star\\" is very good fiction. It was written in the 1950s, but is set in the future (with rocket ships and space travel), thus it is \\"science-fiction\\". However, the core of the tale has to do with human psychology.An out-of-work actor agrees to become a stand-in for a politician for a few days, on Mars. The politician gets sicker. The actor plugs on, winning an election for a high office for the polician. And, things get stickier and stickier and stickier.It was and still is a very good story. For Heinlein, this tale rates \\"above average\\" (in my opinion). For writers as a whole, Heinlein's \\"average\\" rates four stars, at least, and has won SF's highest award."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"For me, Heinlein's books have always fallen into three categories: the biggies (The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Time Enough for Love, Stranger, etc.), the juvees (many of them excellent, e.g. The Rolling Stones, Rocket Ship Galileo, Orphans of the Sky), and everything else. I tend to think of the \\"everything else\\" books as his \\"small books\\"... not necessarily fewer pages, but -- as a rule -- less ambitious... drawn on a smaller canvas.This deft retelling of The Prisoner of Zenda is one of the best, perhaps the best, of the small books. The storytelling is tight, and Lorenzo Smith is one of Heinlein's most memorable characters... He also one his most human and self-aware characters. Heinlein characters tend to preach tolerance and acceptance of otherness. Lorenzo *learns* tolerance. He's one of the few Heinlein characters that truly develops."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This is a well-written, well-plotted story, as you would expect from such a respected author.BUTPersonally, I have a problem with the story. The man character looses his individuality, becoming someone else. The (explicitly stated, too) message is that the trade-off was worth it - rather than being another unsuccesfull actor, the protagonist has become a significant political personality and can carry on realising his original's vision.This does not go well with any notion of the individual human being's intrinsic worth and I'm surprised that no one else seems to be troubled by this.Still, a very good and diverting read.The snapshots of a Martian culture are particularly memorable."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Reading it from Smythe's point of view was the best part because he's relating his thoughts to the readers as he enters into a bizarre impersonation job. He has to impersonate very convincgly a controversial figure.

If you've never read a Heinlein book, start with The Puppet Masters. It is one of the greatest sci-fi novels ever. I say 'one of the greatest...' simply because I haven't read all the books that have been written. Double Star, however, is still an exciting narrative, though sometimes the cultures and structures can be hard to get straight. If you're a libertarian or a conservative, dig in and enjoy, and if you're a liberal, don't worry, this book isn't too conservatively oppressive."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"The year is 1956. Eisenhower is in the White House, following a long line of military men to reach that post. And this slim book appears, presenting the wild idea of an actor, perhaps not even a very good actor, who manages to reach the position of head of state. Obviously an idea like this could only appear within the realm of science fiction! What a difference in perspective an additional twenty five years will make, as once more science fiction becomes fact.The route Lorenzo Smythe takes to reach this post is, however, just a little different from that of the real-world actor. The Great Lorenzo, as he styles himself, is conceited, arrogant, out of work, and down to his last half-Imperial when he is offered the job of doubling for a well-known political figure. The job is so obviously beneath his dignity that he is ready to turn down the offer when the Martians take a hand, and Lorenzo finds himself involved in murder, kidnapping, and slicing both humans and Martians into small pieces to flush down the disposal.Forced by these circumstances to take the job, Lorenzo is even more disturbed when he finds out the identity of the person he is supposed to double for, none other that the leader of the opposition party, Joseph Bonforte, whose politics, what little he knows of them, he despises. But his own inflated idea of his abilities allows him to steady down and start studying for the role, a role he will play for much longer than he could ever anticipate.This book is a character study, carefully and artfully detailing how Lorenzo changes under the influence of having to pretend to be someone he is not, aided by the immediate staff of the man he impersonates. It is fascinating to watch him change from someone you probably wouldn't invite into your home, to confused and beginning to search for some moral basis to his life beyond 'the show must go on', and finally to a man doing his best not just for himself, but for all intelligent beings, truly becoming the man he is portraying.The other characters here are pretty sketchy, mainly props to help move the plot and aid Lorenzo. This is most noticeable with Penny, Bonforte's personal secretary, who suffers from the typical Heinlein failing (at that point in his writing career) of portraying women as one-dimensional beings. However, this limited portrayal of these secondary characters does not detract from, but rather enhances by contrast the masterful portrayal of Lorenzo.Heinlein makes good use of his own experience in running for the California State legislature, as he describes the mechanics of running a political campaign, just how decisions are reached, how dependent a politician is upon the quality of the staff he selects, so that these items ring with real-world ambience. This is also probably the first book that clearly showed his leaning towards what would now be called Libertarianism, but this exposition is fairly muted, unlike some of his later works. And it wouldn't be a Heinlein book without his side commentaries: here he covers monarchies, civil servants, patronage, media management, taxes, unions, truth and lies, prejudice and xenophobia.Published at a time when a novel of character was practically unheard of in the science fiction world, this work, like so many others by Heinlein, expanded the boundaries of the field, another step in lifting it out of its self-imposed pulp ghetto and back to the world of literature. This is probably part of the reason this book earned Heinlein his first of five Hugo awards for best novel of the year, a record matched by no other author. The rest of the reason? It's a fun, fast, great read; a story that hasn't lost its power to engross, entertain, and expand your view of the world.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"I read this book over 10 years ago. I still remember it and I'm still fascinated by the whole theme of pretending to be someone makes you into that person that you were pretending to be. Less heavy handed than Vonnegut's Mother Night with the same theme, this Heinlein book is a delight on many levels. First the main character's smart aleck tone is highly entertaining. &quot;If a guy walks into a bar dressed like a hick acting like he knows the place, you can tell that he's a space man&quot;. Heinlein's use of character voices is one of his strengths (like in Podkayne of Mars). Second, the role that this actor is playing becomes him and makes him into a responsible human being which is a nice idea in that a person can change and become a good person despite their best efforts to the contrary.There are problems of course. The Martians aren't that fleshed out. The shift from jerk to statesman seems way too abrupt. Some may find the main character grating. But Heinlein's strength rest in that his storytelling doesn't allow you to dwell too much on his weaknesses."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Heinlein was one of the best, and you would be missing out if you passed up the chance to read this, one of his many masterpieces. This story can still hold its own (despite being printed in 1957) against others in the genre- again, Heinlein was a master story-teller.Enough people have given the summary of the book, but Heinlein wrote beyond the surface. The story is of an actor who truly discovers a greatness within himself that he at first only pretended to own. It's a story of humanity- in the politics the actor must represent- that humanity must not be doomed to repeat the same mistakes of seeing itself superior to other races, but instead try to learn to live in harmony. Like any good story it takes believeable characters and puts them in seemingly real situations in fantasy worlds, and tells us how we could only hope to act were we in such a predicament.I'm lucky enough to own a first edition in great shape. I happened across it at a yard sale and had to pick it up. To me it was a \\"new\\" Heinlein novel as I hadn't heard of it. It's a light read, and although short, it's deep and fun. The plot loosely reminded me of a certain movie about an actor who impersonates the president... Of course this book was written LONG before that, and is much better. Read this book because it was written by Heinlein. Love it because it was well written."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This is a crisp story, with action and intrigue from start to finish. Lorenzo Smythe is one of Heinlein's most engaging characters, and a real departure from the typical Heinlein hero. He also goes through a lot of changes, as a good protagonist should.Heinlein generally doesn't have a lot of good things to say about politicians, but John Joseph Bonforte (another critical character) is his exception that proves the rule. He's honest, capable, caring - in short a saint among politicians.Another reviewer complained of too much politics, but that's rather silly in my opinion. The book is about the world of politics in the future, so it has to talk about it. But there is very little of Heinlein's trademark libertarian philosophizing. The book moves so fast, there isn't time for it.This is Heinlein's only short work to win a Hugo award, and I consider it quite worthy of the honor. It's not one of Heinlein's series of juvenile novels, but it can be read by teens as well as adults. Get it - it beats 99% of the science fiction ever written, and practically 100% of the stuff being put out these days."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Lorenzo Smythe has to be one of the best examples of a character you love to loathe in the beginning, and winding up loving by the middle. The way that Smythe, like so many of Heinlen's first person narrators, reveals things about himself, sometimes inadvertently, is just as interesting as the stories he tells. &quot;Double Star&quot;, as far as I'm concerned, is his Heinlen's virtuoso performance of narration, and a terrific plot to go with it."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"I first read Double Star when I was a teenager.

Not alot of gadgets or pure sci-fi, just an interesting story, interesting people set in an interesting time (the future). If you have any experience with politics, theatre, crime, soap operas or mysteries, you'll enjoy the read."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"The other two are _The Door into Summer_ and _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_. Heinlein also wrote a handful of near-great novels as well as some third-tier stuff that I don't care about rereading. (And his nonfiction, unlike Asimov's, isn't worth the paper it's printed on.) But these three novels are magisterial, and as close to perfect as anything he ever wrote.This time out, our \\"hero\\" is Lawrence Smith a.k.a. Lorenzo \\"Lorrie\\" Smythe a.k.a. \\"The Great Lorenzo\\", a self-important and out-of-work actor who, at least initially, isn't all that heroic. He's approached about a job, and it turns out to involve serving as a double for a famous statesman in a public appearance. The rest you'll have to read for yourself.It's a fast-moving, well-paced, meaty story, and it raises all sorts of fascinating questions about personal identity, character, and such. And Heinlein handles it all very deftly. Smith (why _are_ so many of his characters named \\"Smith\\"?) contends at one point that in order for an actor to portray a character properly, s/he has to _become_ the character, and it's impossible to do so without coming to like the character somewhat. Well, that's just what Heinlein does here with Smith himself. (Another of Heinlein's Smiths would later describe this process as \\"grokking\\".)Oh, there are a few soapboxy bits, but they don't interfere much with the story. For example, at one or two points we get a few pseudo-profound quotations from statesman John Joseph Bonforte that sound suspiciously like Heinlein himself at his tub-thumpingly silliest (or perhaps some lost excerpts from the notebooks of Lazarus Long, which may be another way of saying the same thing). But it's kept under control. (In other words, this is not _Starship Troopers_ or _Farnham's Freehold_.)This is one of Heinlein's finest and most tightly constructed tales, and almost fifty years after its publication it still holds up well. This is the master at his best -- and his best was very, very good."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"When compared to the body of Heinlein's later work (i.e. the mid-sixties to the late 1980s) _ Double Star_ hardly holds up. However, given the period in which this book was written it is truely a marvel worthy of its Hugo award winning status. I admire Heinlein for the way his hard sci-fi usually fools you to believe the events that are occuring. But in _Double Star_ Heinlein does less than he can to make the stroy believable. My understanding is that Heinlein kept the novel short to attract both adult and juvenille audiences. Maybe that's why he kept one aspect of the story very simple as well. The aspect I speak of is Lorenzo's transformation from pompous actor to a high ranking political official. What I mean by simple is that even in a science fiction story set far in the future, this transformation, which fools the public at large as well as many who are close to the senator, is accompshed with makeup! What I do like about the novel is the fact that Heinlein inserts a socially important message regarding prejudice. In the future realtionships between humans and martians parallel the race relations between whites and blacks during the time the novel was written. Heinlein is able to skillfully use the art of speculative fiction to draw this comparision, thereby creating an effective vision for social reform. In this regard the novel works well, and I would have liked to have seen more of it. It does, however, provide a blueprint for things to come from Heinlein, as he would elaborate more on issues of this nature at a later date. The novel could have been better even by 1956 standards. I believe it was lessened by Heinlein's conservative nature apon entering the world of adult sci-fi. Thankfully he loosened up as he entered the 60's. For fans of Heinlein _Double Star_ is a must read despite flaws."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Most definitely!!!

That's all I'll say on the plot, but do not think this book will be dull simply because you think politics is boring (just as I did)...it is NOT boring, once you get past the first few pages.The Master has created another collection of words that you will have a tough time putting down..."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Many of Heinlein's early novels are aimed at a younger audience, and those which aren't tend to be more light-hearted. \\"Double Star\\" falls into the latter category, with an unlikely premise and an unusual character as the narrator and hero of the story. Although, it is also difficult to call this an early novel considering he had 12 published prior to this one, and that is not counting his first novel which wasn't published until after his death. \\"Double Star\\" was published originally in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" from February to April of 1956, and then in book form later that year.For me, this is one of his best early novels. He stays within the boundaries of the story, and doesn't rely on a \\"big surprise\\" to try to lengthen the plot. The hero is Lorenzo Smythe, an actor who has a rather high opinion of himself. He is engaged by Dak Broadback for a performance, but not a typical performance. Instead he is hired to be John Joseph Bonforte, the former Supreme Minister and leader of the opposition. Lorenzo will need to fool people who have known Bonforte for years, as well as many others, and worse yet he will need to be surrounded by Martians, whom he can't stand the sight or smell of.The story is cleverly put together, obstacles arise as the result of politics and situations, but they are certainly believable within the context of the story being told. This had been a problem with his earlier novels, at least it was a problem for me. The story is a bit predictable, as Lorenzo is forced to continue the role longer and longer as new situations arise, but that didn't bother me as it was very enjoyable to read. This isn't going to rank as Heinlein's best, but it is a cut above most of his earlier novels. It is a enjoyable light read, and certainly a viable Hugo award winner from 1956. It has also been remembered on some fan polls ranking 44th on the 1987 Locus All-Time Poll for SF novels, and tied for 41st on the 1998 Locus All-Time Poll for SF novels from before 1990."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This book is very difficult to characterize.

I have reread it a few times down the years. Each time I re-realized how much it influenced my understanding.

For some reason the subject matter, combined with the cheesy cover picture just didn't do anything for me. However, since I'm on a current mission to read everything I can find by R.A. Heinlein I picked it up to read. It was better than I was expecting.An actor is tricked into accepting an unlikely assignment. Since he's out of work, and a bit desperate to do something he takes the job, and soon finds himself wishing he hadn't. He is to take the place of a very public political figure. In what comes to be the most challenging acting job of his life, he pulls the job off with flying colors. Through his study of the charachter he must incorperate a personality which goes against his own in many ways, and in some ways he finds it almost more than he can handle.Through the course of his job, Lorenzo finds himself pushed further into playing his role, making dicisions, becoming this person. Like many novels by Heinlein, science fiction is merly the genre which allows situations to take place which otherwise could not....allows a normal guy to be faced with abnormal situations, and to grow because of this. Because of this, his stories are not only highly entertaining, but introspective as well. Double star examines what makes a person who he is by showing what is involved in assimilating another person and portraying them. It shows how a person can make a consious choice to be who they want to be, and take on the nessicary responsibilities to become a more honorable person.I would reccomend this, as well as a number of Heinlein's novels as tools for a person who is working to better themselves and examine thier role in life."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This is a highly curious book. As SF it is very much dated: the &quot;science&quot; is ludicrous by today's standards. Despite the comments of other reviewers there is not really all that much politics in it. I have reread this a few times (one of the few books that allow this) and find it gets better each time I read it. I feel this is a book that very much expresses Heinlein's philosophy, and can hold its own beside &quot;Space_Cadet&quot; and &quot;Starship_Troopers&quot;. The one-dimensional young female character so typical of Heinlein's later work is here, but in reasonable proportions (I will go with the mainstream view that Heinlein never wrote anything worth reading after 1961). I guess this indeed is a classic although it is full of laughably silly little details."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"In this short novel Heinlein tells the story (in first person) of Lorenzo Smythe, a man of the stage, as he stumbles upon the role of a lifetime in a bar over drinks with a pilot. Lorenzo quickly finds himself embroiled in caper too far to turn back from and eventually becomes involved in a political coverup that is way over his head.For the most part I enjoyed Double Star. It started out light and comical, but eventually lost those two elements the more we learn about the political situation...and the more Lorenzo sinks into his role playing a double. Now that I look back there is very little science fiction involved in this book other than trips to Mars and the Moon. Beyond that it is a novel that focuses on politics, acting, and the theatre. There are many references to Shakespeare; elements of which are the main plot of this book (deception and disguise). Not being a fan of politics in general, I thought the heavy political aspects eventually pulled the book down. But that's just my view. There are many people who enjoy this type of narrative. I wish Heinlein would have maintained the light and fun tone throughout. Regardless, it was an enjoyable read on my trek through the Hugo &amp; Nebula winners."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This is a Heinlein, so it is worth reading. It's an interesting story, with a unique plot (for science fiction) at least, and is a politically charged work, for those who like that side of Heinlein. In reality, this book could easily exist outside the genre of science fiction, so readers who don't normally like SF might dig this book. That said, this isn't one of Heinlein's best stories. There is almost no science whatsoever (not that unusual for RAH, but alas), the dialogue isn't up to his usual standards, and the story never really picks up steam like you expect it to.So, all in all, this is a book for the Heinlein devotee to pick up after they have already read most of his best work, an RAH newbie should look elsewhere. A good book, but I can't see why it won a Hugo."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"Although there's a fairly strong plot to the novel, as in all the Heinlein I've read, its strengths lie not so much in the action, which in some ways seems rather dated now, but in its comments on the political process, which has stayed pretty much the same.There are also some amusing references to the British system, such as when Lorenzo hands the Emperor a scroll which is supposed to be a list of Ministers for approval, but which is actually blank, and the discussion on the relationship between the Emperor and the elected politician.This isn't the most profound of books, but it's none the worse for it, and well worth a read."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"As an avid reader of Heinlein, I was a little disappointed by this novel, but not overly so. A fairly interesting little mystery, but you can pretty much figure out the plot within the first few pages or so. In fact, this book lacks a great deal of the social commentary that is Heinlein's hallmark, though it is not devoid of it. Read it as a study in character development -- he does a fine job of letting the main character develop and change, and while our heartstrings aren't tugged quite as mercilessly as in other RAH novels, it's still an enjoyable read for an evening."},{"Title":"Double Star","review":"This book definitely deserves five stars. The author has a way with words that is not so common among today's writers. The story is believable and relatable, and enjoyable! Plus, there are so many good, thought-provoking quotes.

I came away from reading this book with the distinct impression that the early Church had a definite problem convincing the masses that Judaism and Christianity had to be treated as distinct and separate beliefs, and that a certain amount of propaganda as well as intimidation was required to get the message across. While the theologians and exegetes like Cyril were debating the consequences of fitting angels onto pinheads, the people were routinely mixing and matching Jewish and Christian rituals bad doctrines. Little wonder that &quot;heresy&quot; found fertile ground in which to mushroom. Wilken does a good job, if at times repetitively, of describing Jesus' portrayal as The New Adam, the redeemer of Adam's sin, who, as Man and God, was able to defeat death, a feat that Moses, still only a mortal, and the law brought down from Sinai was unable to do. This was the basis of Cyril's refutation of Nestorius, which seems like a bit of an overreaction to what Nestorius really meant.I would have liked to have seen a bit more discussion of why Cyril was so adamantly anti-Jewish, though from his discussion it's pretty clear that this was partly because Cyril perceived them as &quot;mad&quot; and &quot;blind&quot; for their failutre to accept Jesus. But Cyril's orchestration of the pogrom in Alexandria deserved a bit more exposition vis-a-vis Cyril's ongoing polemical war on Judaism. This is a trifling criticism, though.A must text for patristic history buffs."},{"Title":"Darwinism and Divinity: Essays on Evolution and Religious Belief","review":"This book has two main sections. The first deals with Darwin and his views on science and religion. The second addresses a motley group of issues, such as the relation of religion to biology, and early opinions about evolution. Unfortunately, there is little in this book to interest most readers. The creation/evolution debate is barely covered at all, except to a slight degree in the last chapter. Most of the contributers do not specialize in either science or religion, and write with the assumption that their readers think as they do. The result is a boring book with little to say about anything, and of interest to few outside of narrow academic circles.

He holds to the convention that God gives no new revelations, only that written Scripture is clarified.For example, &quot;Word of Knowledge&quot; according to the author, &quot;enables the believer to search, systemize and summarize the teachings of the word of God.&quot; It is then shared with others. The difference between this and teaching, he says, depends whether we emphasize communication or knowledge. Thoughout the book, he implies that some of the gifts are not for today and if they are for today, that they are for set and determinable circumstances.A good point the auther made, was lack of a gift does not excuse us from abstaining in a particular area. For example, we all should give and exercise mercy regardless of whether we have the gifts or giving and mercy. He made many other good points as well.What we have to realize is that we are all the body of Christ. How we define the gifts is not something that will keep us out of heaven or get us in.For most of my Baptist brothers and sisters in Christ, this book is for you. My Assembly of God brothers and sisters probably will not agree with some of the definitions used and some of the limitations placed on the gifts. My other brothers and sisters, it depends on your definition of &quot;charismatic.&quot; I have to admit, if I was Baptist, I'd give the book a 5 star rating.In addition, regardless of the interpretation of the Scriptures on this subject matter, the book is well written and well organized. It is easy to follow and holds your attention."},{"Title":"19 Gifts of the Spirit","review":"I read this book when it first came out in the 1970s and recently got the updated version. I have always found it helpful, but wish Flynn had not limited himself to 19 gifts (what about the gifts of intercession, creativity and craftsmanship?). The book is very helpful for the gifts it does cover, though."},{"Title":"19 Gifts of the Spirit","review":"Dr. Flynn does a great job of breaking down a large subject that can be difficult to understand. Unlike many commentaries, this one is straight forward, with illustrative stories. It is biblically sound and the women in my Bible study have found it very helpful in furthering their understanding (as well as mine) of spiritual gifts in general, as well as which gifts they possess. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"19 Gifts of the Spirit","review":"Ever read a book of this type that just drones on and you say to yourself, \\"just get to your point!\\" Well, this one makes the point without being wordy. It's great to use for busy adults who want something thought provoking with great scripture referance. It's great for adult Bible Studies for folks that don't have alot of time for homework or prep but want to grow spiritually and be challanged on what was thought to be their Spiritual Gift(s). Only negative is that this rewrite from the original (1970's)could have updated some of the examples that adults under age 40 may not be familiar with."},{"Title":"19 Gifts of the Spirit","review":"This book was a huge learning for me! I understand myself and my gifts more fully and I am using it daily in my coaching practice! I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"19 Gifts of the Spirit","review":"I found that this book wrote more on the indiviual gifts than most commentaries and theologies that I've read"},{"Title":"19 Gifts of the Spirit","review":"In the spirit of the fruit - the main one - love, I respond. Having read the book, I too found the information more useful toward the Baptist denominational followers more so than Charismatics just as one other reviewer has mentioned.I disagreed respectfully with a number of statements which seem almost qualified with scripture given but leave somewhat of a questionable nature on the actual and factual method for delivery.It would seem the gift Giver is obviously the one to seek, not the gifts. Jesus pointed out He would send the Helper and greater things would be accomplished. Nevertheless, Jesus did point out the Helper would be sent. Since the Helper is the Holy Spirit and the giver of gifts then why wouldn't anyone want to follow through with their ministry or just being a Christian in seeking out the most beneficial gifts that would make that person a more effective Christian in his/her life as well as a giver of the message of love to all those in the world?In a nutshell, you may have some success as many ministers, evangelists, etc. have had in doing the good battle and having done all stood; however, some of the persons quoted as not having the Baptism of the Holy Spirit but still leading effective ministries arises for question as well. Dr. Moody I believe is one of the prime examples that questioned two women in his services as to why they prayed for him and their response to effect being 'because you need power'. To which on a later date he sought that power and upon receiving it became aware that his effectiveness in preaching advanced by leaps and bounds from his previous methods.Billy Graham in his book on the Holy Spirit even admits there are some things he cannot explain. Could that be because there is an actual furthering beyond the intial salvation experience. And again, the query as to what constitutes an \\"experience\\" vice a validated biblical foundation for such an action is qualified by Christ -Amplified Bible, Mark 16:17 \\"And these attesting signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages; they will pick up serpents; and [even] if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will get well.\\"Then why not ask for it? Amplified Bible, Luke 11:13 - If you then, evil as you are, know how to give good gifts [gifts that are to their advantage] to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask and continue to ask Him!About those \\"tongues\\", the statement in the book similar to \\"why didn't the converted 3,000 at Pentecost speak in unknown tongues if it was to be an evidence of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit?\\" Who's to say some did not? The initial focus was upon receiving Christ as savior first and foremost; however, that does not nullify the possibility that those same 3,000, or a part thereof, sought the gift of the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues.I find it rather difficult to equate the gift of such a wondrous and divine experience to Hindus, Mormons, Zulus, etc. as mentioned in the book without qualification of 1 John 4:1-4 Amplified Bible, 1.BELOVED, do not put faith in every spirit, but prove (test) the spirits to discover whether they proceed from God; for many false prophets have gone forth into the world.2By this you may know (perceive and recognize) the Spirit of God: every spirit which acknowledges and confesses [the fact] that Jesus Christ (the Messiah) [actually] has become man and has come in the flesh is of God [has God for its source];3And every spirit which does not acknowledge and confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh [but would annul, destroy, sever, disunite Him] is not of God [does not proceed from Him]. This [nonconfession] is the [spirit] of the antichrist, [of] which you heard that it was coming, and now it is already in the world.4Little children, you are of God [you belong to Him] and have [already] defeated and overcome them [the agents of the antichrist], because He Who lives in you is greater (mightier) than he who is in the world.It is interesting that the author points out \\"forbid not\\" under the portion concerning speaking in tongues. This seems to be a qualifier in itself.Another questionable avenue of thought in the book was the \\"inconsistency of Paul to deliver in his other letters more information concerning this most controversial of gifts \\"speaking in tongues\\" which the author points out as a proof that it is not that important. His argument is the Corinthians had a problem which needed to be addressed. I would have to say to that point, aren't we all Corinthians in this day with not only that problem but others as well? Paul on the other hand addressed other problems - law vs faith as in Galatians for example in which he was very upset with that group of followers. How about in the book of Romans in having to settle that the Gentiles are also given the gift of salvation?And what about Paul speaking more than anybody else in \\"tongues\\"? I don't think he really had a problem with it. Why should we?People don't just automatically start speaking in tongues, there has to be a source. I would think it's obvious - the Holy Spirit if asked will bless. If you ask for healing do you receive it, if you ask for anything from God do you not expect Him to answer. Doesn't it say:Amplified Bible: Matthew 7:7,8 - Keep on asking and it will be given you; keep on seeking and you will find; keep on knocking [reverently] and [the door] will be opened to you.8For everyone who keeps on asking receives; and he who keeps on seeking finds; and to him who keeps on knocking, [the door] will be opened.Obviously the other gifts are not questioned, but this one is isolated. Rather than isolating it and the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, perhaps it should be characterized as the will of God as a sign as was indicated in the early Church and is still being used as such in this day and present age; and, perhaps we should be a lot more careful on trying to disprove it and rather accept it having studied and gained and move in faith.Amplified Bible: Hebrews 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please and be satisfactory to Him. For whoever would come near to God must [necessarily] believe that God exists and that He is the rewarder of those who earnestly and diligently seek Him [out].Do we disqualify angels because they were present in the past? Do we question God and say that was then, this is now and different? Do we discredit God by saying we are in the age of science and therefore faith has no substance?In essence, do we put God in a box and expect Him to stay there because of our humanism and lack of understanding?To that I say, choose. Either God is real or He is not. If He is, then why wouldn't all of the signs and wonders and gifts and the Holy Spirit follow just as Jesus said. And more that He hasn't even revealed to us yet? God, being so loving and having such long-suffering puts up with us. We're the problem, but He has given the solution.As far as entries on Campus Crusade for Christ as a foundational stone to go by in the book, here is my experience. In the year 1973, March 14 at New Mexico State University, I received Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior and became acquainted with Him through a reading of the tract the 4 Spiritual Laws. The blessed man who led me to the Lord, Gary Ramm, who I thank and think very highly of to this day and discipled me in sharing my faith with others was an incredible person to look up to. My experience was a complete turn around so much so that a great many students on the campus became quite aware of my life changing experience, many of which could not explain what happened to me but said at the time \\"He Got Religion\\". I did not get \\"religion\\" but it became quite clear what I did get was Jesus Christ and a 180 degree about face. I became BOLD and ON FIRE for the Lord.I also read the other tract Campus Crusade for Christ had at the time about the \\"Infilling of the Spirit\\". I knew there seemed to be more than just the initial faith-based asking of the Lord into my life (Revelation 3:20). Later, as my student teaching proceeded in my next to last semester at Las Cruces, New Mexico, I went back to Aztec and Farmington, New Mexico. There I met a couple that were Christians but very unique. I queried that difference and was told to read 1 Corinthians 12, 13, and 14. I studied those chapters inside and out, upside and downside, but they just did not make any sense. I questioned the authority of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, I even went so far as to attend a Full Gospel Business Men's Meeting in which the Lt Gov of New Mexico spoke. I listened intently. When the invitation for receiving Christ as saviour was given I saw nothing contrary to what I had seen before and the enriching and overflowing of love that poured out was inspiring. Then the call for those who would like to receive the Baptism of the Holy Spirit went out and I went up. I did receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and arose laughing and speaking in tongues. I became BOLDER and MORE ON FIRE for the Lord.Upon my return to NMSU, I ran into a fellow Christian. After a short but pleasant visit and fellowship we set about to drive onto the campus. However, his car would not start. I told him, let's pray and lay hands upon it. We did and the car started right up with the lights on. He told me, this is just like some of the things that had happened in the past.When I met the one that led me to the Lord, he could not explain what had happened to me, but did tell me he thought I was going down the wrong path. Talk about an unsettling experience! Here I was attempting to follow the Lord closer than I've ever been and to be told I was wrong - well, it was heartbreaking. I could not deny what happened to me, but yet the enemy sought to set me on a path of questioning myself as well as those whom I knew were sincere Christians.Later, the Campus Crusade for Christ members along with the Navigators held a meeting to discuss the strange happenings that were taking place all over campus as the Holy Spirit continued to be poured out upon more and more students. From my roommate's feedback who attended the meeting, \\"They decided it is not for today and there's nothing to it.\\" Eventually, my roommate attended a Full Gospel Business Men's Meeting within the city in which one of his former employers was the speaker. This man whom my roommate had a close kinship to convinced him that the Baptism of the Holy Spirit was real. My roommate asked for the gift and came back speaking in tongues. Before this he would attempt to do so and it was obviously just jibberish, the transition to the real deal was incredibily wonderful.I could go on and on about how my dearest friend the Holy Spirit has done miraculous things in my life and has led me to the feet of Jesus in understanding more and more the sacrifice the Father allowed to happen.And normally, I would let this pass; however, I think I would be remiss if I did not say something.The good Doctor's book does have some wonderful direction, but it seems to lack \\"meat\\" and I mean to say that in the most respectful way I can. It leads to the possibilities of interest and \\"experiences\\" which is in opposition to \\"biblical based\\" guidance as he puts it. However, let's just say suppose the Holy Spirit, Jesus, God the Father - the trinity wants you to pray for someone to receiver their sight? Can you do it? What if you're the only one around that person trusts to pray for him/her? Are you going to shirk and pass it off or will you allow God to give you the gift necessary to accomplish the task as it presents itself. I think a lot of us feel very disqualified when God is actually telling us you are equipped, if you're not then ask and get equipped. That's not to say just go out there without the direction of the Holy Spirit, but it is saying maybe He's calling you for greater things and \\"us\\" being just a bit shy may be holding things up. Again, seek the gift giver.For those of you seeking the Gift Giver, I would highly recommend Catherine Marshall and her book \\"The Helper\\". In fact, Doctor, I would highly recommend it for you as well, I think you will see something even more incredible and I look forward and challenge you to write a better update on your book after you have studied a lot more.And as far as Campus Crusade for Christ, they gave me the left foot of fellowship simply because I was too on fire for the Lord for them to handle.Be it known, like Joshua, Amplified Bible: Joshua 24:15 - And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.Let me tell you of a dream I once had and then a second dream of like nature. I saw Jesus standing to my left facing me. To my right was a door. I watched as Jesus opened the door outward. Inside was a room full of glittering gold and silver objects. I smiled and picked one of the objects up and turned to the Lord. To my dismay, I saw a saddened look upon his face and I realized what I had done. Instead of being intent upon the Lord, I was intent upon the gift but now the door was closed and I could not put the object back. A few months later I had a similar dream, but this time when the Lord opened the door I did not take anything, instead I put the gift back that I already had and looked up at Jesus. He smiled at me and said, \\"Now you have learned that I am your source for all good gifts and the focus upon which you should concentrate, the door is opened for you to use any gift I desire for you to use for the benefit of others, enter and I will guide you.\\" To that I reached up and took hold of Jesus hand and we entered the room. To my surprise I discovered it was a storehouse of gifts without end.From the two dreams I have found whatever gift the Lord wants to use on a day by day basis seems to be the right one. Oftentimes, it's more than one. Sometimes it's praying for someone to receive a physical heart for a transplant, sometimes it's simply a kind word to the janitor and letting her know she's doing a great job, sometimes it's speaking to a supervisor to let them know I work as unto the Lord.But sometimes it's praying in tongues while taking five mile long walks, praying with the gift of faith with a pastor who's church was vandalized and burnt to the ground and expecting the rebuilding to begin immediately with funding sources God opens up, or speaking to people who have died and come back from the dead with a good report that Heaven does exist. And sometimes it's demonstrating the act of writing which I believe is a talent God has given me and which more and more of you will witness as I allow my Lord and Saviour to use me as He sees fit.One more thing which I do agree with the good Doctor on that I did learn from his book concering prophesy involving encouragement. If this be prophesy then it be a good thing: May God, the author and finisher of your faith, enrich your lives and direct your paths in all the ways that you should go and strengthen your hearts with the truth of the word as directed by the Holy Spirit. And as Campus Crusade has indicated: God does love you and does have a plan for your life."},{"Title":"19 Gifts of the Spirit","review":"If you are tired of the Charismatic and Pentecostal confusion surrounding the subject of the Fruits of the Spirit this book is a breath of fresh air. Written from a dispensational interpretation of the Scriptures it tenderly encourages the use of and development of your own Fruit of the Spirit to the betterment of the Church of Christ as a whole and even your own local church of which you may be a member."},{"Title":"19 Gifts of the Spirit","review":"\\"Do not neglect the spiritual gift that is within you,\\" wrote the apostle Paul to his helper Timothy--a solemn admonition for those who are Christians. Do you know what your spiritual gifts are?This is not a perfect book--but it is still the best Scriptural treatment of spiritual gifts that I have seen in print. Dr. Flynn's approach is generally dispensational, without being hyper-dispensational. He deals well with difficult and controversial subjects such as healings, miracles, and tongues. he does not lightly dismiss the subject with the over-used and unhelpful expression, \\"that's not for today.\\"Highpoints include his treatment of the much-misunderstood gift of prophecy and his discussion of the apostolic gift in its secondary sense of missionary. Since the Bible says little about some spiritual gifts (such as the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge), some of his conclusions are debatable, but thoughtful and worth reading. His chapter \\"The Gift of Government\\" is somewhat disappointing. In it he lumps together both administration and leadership--represented by two different Greek words that may suggest two different gifts--one organizational and administrataive (behind the scenes); and one that is true leadership.All-in-all, this makes an excellent tool for studying what the Bible says on the subject of spiritual gifts."},{"Title":"19 Gifts of the Spirit","review":"This book has the gifts in the right order, as far as I am concerned.

It is absolute, utter GENIUS and this is the fifth time I am reading it cover to cover. These stories are cinematic, crackling with realness, mysterious and magical. They cast a spell and stay with you long after you've read them. Read them again and again to sift through their many layers and be with their characters who are as real as our family and friends. Thank you Alice Munro!!!"},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"All things considered, my favourite fictional narrative is the short story. If you read a novel, you may struggle through a hundred pages before realizing that you have wasted your time. A short story can avoid this dilemma by giving the reader either instant gratification or dissatisfaction. Two universal attributes of a great short story are that they are short and that they tell a story. Anything else is a long narrative.My favorite short story writers are Chekhov, Maupassant with defernce to William Trevor and Penelope LivelyYears ago I read the Moons of Jupiter an earlier collection of Ms. Munroe. They were enjoyable with all the attributes that I look for in a good short story. She has an obvious grasp of human relationships. though the quality that I liked best was the emphasis on choice. Everyone was free to make their own decisions, no Thomas Hardy predeterminism here. The later collection shows a change in technique. Jakarta, Save the Reaper, and Rich as Stink (what a sense of poetry!) are complex stories with frequent shifts of time and place. I find this constant confusion distracting. Please don't abandon the sequential universe!!!There are however many qualities in this collection that I enjoyed. The first episode with children in a small town in the late forties was similar to my own experience in a mining town during the war. Her portrait of the awful Mrs. Quin was masterly and believable. The problem is that I do not think that the linkages of the three seperate events really succeeds. By far the most successful story is the Children Stay. This is about a Canadian Anne Karinina scting out her role while playing in an amature dramatic production of Anouilh's Orpheus. Here we have a woman willing to leave her husband and family to run away with a semi itinerant for immediate sexual passion, which is of only brief duration. I liked the final scene in Rich as Stink wher Karin, wearing the wedding dress of the wife of her mothers lover suffers third degree burns when it catches fire. This is a nice ironic twist as it implies that marriage for Karin is like playing with fire. Meanwhile Anne and Derek (the mothers lover)have resumed their marriage and run of into the sunset.For me Jakarta was the story that provided the most interest. The background and action mostly take place in the sixties. Two couples are used to illustrate the two divergent views of society at that time. Kent and Kathy Mayberry are a conventional careerist couple, Kent being a pharmacist climbing the corporate ladder and Kathy a middle class housewife. Sonia and Cotter are are a counter culture couple. Cotter is a progressive journalist and Sonia the adoring doormat of a wife. The first part trace the friendship of Kathy and Sonia and uses two short stories The Fox by D.H. Lawrence and Kathleen Mansfield's The Bay to show the essential way that these two marriages differ. Kathy sees marriage as an equal partnership though as witnessed in the beach party shes not above having a fling. Sonia is Lawrence's ideal women seeing herself as an adjunct to her husband . She would never cheat on her husband though he openly sleeps with many other woman. The fate of the two couples is interesting. At the end of the story Kent is married to his third wife a girl younger than his daughter . Cotter who disappeared in the late sixties is presumed to have died in Indonesia. We are led to question whether this is genuine or staged. In spite of the implied setup, Sonia still dreams of going to Indonesia to find him. After this event Sonia spends many years looking after Delia Cotter's blind mother. Once a doormat always a doormat.My final thoughts is that when Ms. Munroe sticks to her regular style she is very good at capturing the time and place of an event. When she expands we are confronted with a blizzard of words hiding cryptic clues and at times a meandering narrative. At this point I long for my Chekhov."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"This book is wonderful. Munro packs more into a few pages than most authors get into a full length novel. Great storytelling and compelling insight. Readers may also be interested in Fried Calamari, another book that provides interesting insight into a woman's psyche."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"Some famous author was being interviewed and was asked what book he might currently be reading. It was this Alice Munro book, so I just had to read it. After 3 chapters I couldn't find a logical outcome for the story line and the chapters did not interrelate. I tossed this book. I will always remember it as a book of stories that go nowhere and test your patience along the way.R.S."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"In Munro's Love Of A Good Woman 8 stories set in British Columbia or Ontario involve secrets and choices. Of these 8, only 2 are good. \\"Save The Reaper\\" and \\"My Mother's Dream\\" are the only two stories that have a plot! You know plot? Conflict + Resolution? The other six are just story fragments, offering a smidgen of conflict (someone isn't happy) and smidgen of resolution (a decision is made with no impetus whatsoever put on the results). Yawn. When the conflict is this vague, it does not lend itself well to a short story format. To resolve such character-driven conflicts as these, the stories need room to breathe. Instead these short stories avoid happy and inevitably sit-comish endings or pessimistic endings and are left with only one other option: no ending at all. Maybe this is supposed to be presented as clever or provocative but in my mind it was frustrating. If only they were expanded into individual novels. Who can't come up with conflicts and leave them unresolved? However, Alice Munro's unpretentious dialogue and revealing characters are intriguing and when she uses them in actual complete stories, such as Reaper and Dream, near- perfection is achieved. The only reason I say \\"near\\" is because of a tiny (but huge) disjointed sentence in Reaper. As the grandmother character finds herself out of one perilous situation and into another; sitting next to a prostitute with her grandchildren in the back seat of her car, Munro's preoccupation with sex thrusts the reader back into reality. Momentarily ruining the fantasy. Up to that point, I found my heart beating synchronously with the grandmother- and when the prostitute touches the grandmother's thigh I found myself wondering if things could get any worse. But then I was jarred out of the story altogether. The grandmother was slightly awakened and turned on by the prostitute! Yeah, right! However, I ended up liking the story so much that I'm making an effort to ignore that line (obviously with little success so far). My Mother's Dream at the end was complete perfection (a good note to end on). It had a fully realized plot and no absurd sexual remark. If only the rest of the book was that good."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"I would only recommend this book if you have trouble sleeping at night and need a sedative.

I am a regular reader of short novels published on New Yorker and seems most stories in this book were published there, according to the introduction. I have to admit that I still could not understand why Ms. Munro is such a big figure in North America's modern literature world. The stories are full of too many pieces of ordinariness and dullness, and make you feel the heaviness of your life. Her stories makes you feel like, &quot;Why do I have to read in words about some DULL things I've seen/experienced in my life?&quot; By the way, I've lived in eastern Canada for 9 years and have very warm feeling towards that region.And her writing is also so plain and REGULAR!

But let me say what I particularly like about Alice Munro, what distinguishes her from other great writers.First of all, there is a unique impression of authenticity. There are certain conventions in fiction about what is regarded as important or interesting; Alice Munro ignores them. She knows that tiny incidents can be the defining ones. She knows that spending a weekend with one's own daughter can be an unbearable challange which almost drives you mad. These stories do not gloss over the mundane aspects of life we have to struggle with most.Second, Alice Munro's stories believe in human dignity and choice. Hers is a moral universe. It's not just the title story which shows us a person making a choice. We tend to just let things happen to us and pretend we cannot do anything about them; these stories show that sometimes we can (but they do not deny that very often we cannot). There is also a great story, &quot;Jakarta&quot;, which implies that such choices are not valid forever; it's not enough to decide against betraying your husband today. The decision may feel momentous, but if you decide otherwise tomorrow it doesn't matter all that much. The problem is, however, and the story shows that too, that when you take those decisions you are very often incapable of feeling their impact.Read these stories! This is a book for grown-ups. It will help you understand the world."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"I have been reading Munro's stories for years and even the profound admiration I had for her work could not prepare me for the force of this collection. It is literally impossible to find a better book. Each one of Munro's stories is worth hundreds of lesser works. The prose is gorgeous, the vision expansive yet percise and humane. Read, &quot;Save the Reaper&quot; last. It is a reworking of American fable and Flannery O'Connor that shows Munro has surpassed even that great American writer."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"In the title story of this collection, Enid, the self-sacrificing practical nurse, is transformed into someone else after she has the sickly and evil Mrs. Quinn as a patient before Mrs. Quinn dies.

Does &quot;the love of a good woman&quot; have the power of redemption:? Read the story to get Alice Munro's always astonishing perspective on the subject of goodness.In another fine story from this collection, &quot;Before the Change&quot;, a young woman uses an abortion to test her father and her lover and they both come up short.In &quot;Jakarta&quot;, my personal favorite, Sonje is such a good woman that she takes on the care of her lover's blind mother while Cottar continues a traveling, leftist journalist.

Let me say that &quot;Open Secrets&quot; is THE book (okay, one of the books) I recommend to people for books that I love. And most of her early stuff ain't bad either. Let me say that as a way to lighten my negative opinion about this book. I think this book can be summed up by one of the characters in the first story (I'm paraphrasing) who's thinking about how as she got older she realized that life took more than she had and left her with less. (Something to that effect.) These stories read as if this were Munro's problem too, as if she's given her best and now she's still got to give more and she's out of gas. The stories seem tired. Case in point: she replaces the brilliant connections and observations she used to make in a paragraph with ten-fifteen pages of incidentals. So much seems like padding. Anyone has a hard time topping themselves as they get older, granted. And I think it would be hard for any mortal to write a book like &quot;Open Secrets&quot; in the first place, and I think it's doubly tough to try and top that. Frankly, I think she didn't top it this time or get very close. And I don't know if she's trying so hard. Since &quot;Open Secrets&quot; she's had a &quot;Best of&quot;, this collection and the National Book Award. After reading these stories I think the award was given for the body of work she's created and not for the book itself. &quot;The Love of..&quot; feels like a book written to capitalize on someone's reputation and not to capitalize on what lies ahead. And who knows? Maybe she has another &quot;Open Secrets&quot; in her to share. I hope so."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"This must be some of the most beautiful prose I have encountered. I cannot say enough about the way Munro turns a phrase, takes the commonplace to an extraordinary place, uses language. This is not a book to take to the beach -- rather, this is work to be savord for the nuance, the subtlety and the ordinariness-turned-on-its-ear. Buy the book."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"Get this collection simply for The Children Stay, one of themost effective evocations of ache and regret ever set down on paper (and then, because she is Alice Munro, she quickly shows us how ultimately meaningless regret can become in an individual life, given time). In her stories, there are no right or wrong choices, there is no fate, and the stories often extend long past the consequences of her characters' actions, for better or worse, often, whatever they've done, however extreme, they are not punished nor rewarded. They are not saved. The moments of recognition or realization are sterling, perhaps, but not permanent in her characters' lives. They go on."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"I have a hard time reading short stories sometimes, but these were excellent. The first one, which titles the book, is almost a novella, very well crafted. With a murder at the center of the story, you read about how this death has affected different characters, and their take on it. My second favorite story is My Mother's Dream, a very vivid account of family dynamics at a time of loss and happiness.Each one of these stories left me satisfied, with a sense of completion, and that is something i often miss when reading short stories. I highly recommend this excellent work by Alice Munro."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"Alice Munro was recommended to me as a master of the short story form and I was not disappointed. This collection is wonderfully deep and complex - simple and ordinary on the surface but seething with subtle passion beneath.Her ability to shift time and viewpoint is effective and powerful.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"Once again Alice Munro reveals her exquisite knowledge of the less stellar human qualities.

The lifes descript are quietly in surface, but it's hidden in certain dramatic situations to which Munro has very sensibility for the human details.Therefore the lecture results fluent and intersting just for those situations, and also for the elegance of the style."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"This collection is cited as a primary influence by many modern short story writers. Read it and you will understand."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"This book was disappointing and annoying. The plot was so contrived that it was difficult at times to figure out what was going on. It seemed like an exercise for the author to display how well read and erudite he is. I plowed through it, but was never convinced by the characters or the plot."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"A series of related stories told by a master, this collection kept me riveted for days.

Extremely well written short stories, crafted by one of the best short story writers ever."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"Because I was reading this book on my Kindle, it was not immediately obvious (to me) that this was a series of short stories and not a novel, so I was a little disconcerted when the narrative changed at change of chapter. I kept waiting for the two themes to connect until I finally caught on (dummy!). Some of the plots are perfectly magnificient and they will haunt you for a long time. Munro can certainly tell a story. The only criticism I have is that occassionally she jumps around in time so I was not sure where I was - but it all eventually comes together. This book has made me hungry for more of Munro so I am looking forward to her newest book which I think is coming out soon. If you like fiction, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"Alice Munro is definitely the queen of the short story genre, and this book which was a Giller Prize Winner solidifies her position. I really like Ms. Munro's stories. They are about life, love, disappointments, and with a few zingers thrown in that sometimes change the entire direction of the story. It keeps them interesting and fresh. And Ms. Munro's writing is so wonderfully crafted. She is a wonderful author, and any of her books are well worth reading. The stories are each little gems in their own right."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"The title seems to refer to a poem about reapers. I have been unable to find the quote. Help, anyone?"},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"This is an amazing collection, arguably Munro's best (but that is saying a lot). Like many of the best short story writers, Munro is fully steeped in localism and vernacular, and while her stories are not as violent as Flannery O'Connor's or as bleak as Raymond Carver's, hers is one that shines a light on unpleasant truths, but ones that reward us with understanding.That Munro is a feminist is unarguable, but one that fights small battles instead of loud ones. Like the last story in this collection, \\"My mother's dream,\\" one gets a genuine sense of what life is like for a woman caught in life almost without choices, and how this reality is passed down to her child. Nowhere have I read a more powerful description of what it is like to be a woman, and if I were one, this story would be my manifesto. It is in the small moments, artless and unguarded, that you taste Munro's bitter world, but one that has an aftertaste that being familiar is ultimately comforting."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"After the first fairly gripping story, the fiction quickly falls into some Alice Mundane prose and it seems like it's going to be that way for the long haul. The author seems to have forgotten the necessity of plot in several stories, and the reader is left dragging along to the end only because of confidence in an otherwise accomplished writer. &quot;Cortes Island&quot; has some worthwhile character development, but &quot;Jakarta&quot; and &quot;Save the Reaper&quot; feel like directionless wandering, as if Munro is playing the grandson's alien chase game with her story development: see a possibility, grab onto it there for a while and see where it goes and then grab onto another. While this technique can certainly be successful and give the image of &quot;living&quot; or &quot;evolution&quot; fiction, it doesn't always work, and these three stories prove it.Furthermore, the &quot;shocking&quot; action of her characters is not believable enough because, despite all the drawn-out development, the reader still can't see the justification in the character's minds. Sure, everyone does the unexpected sometimes, but if all Munro's characters do that, we lose the idea of the story. Pauline, for example, in &quot;The Children Stay,&quot; seems to feel too much devotion and affection for her children to be able to just forget them completely for a wild night of sex that leaves her sore, even though they interrupt her life. Most women find that children interfere with the professional, artistic, social (etc) lives they had before becoming mothers, so what sets Pauline apart to actually be able to leave the girls forever for a romance that turns out to be a fling anyway? Munro didn't prepare us enough for her decision, and the story is weakened.The real genius of her work starts to emerge again, though, with &quot;Rich as Stink.&quot; A mature little girl and her childish mother create an interesting role reversal which must meet its limits finally in a powerful way, when nature takes charge. This story feels glued together with real intrigue, although the purpose and development of the minor characters could have been improved.&quot;Before the Change&quot; is reminiscent of Munro's previous work, with a letter-writing young woman revealing her story to her (ex) lover. Here we see Munro's capability with powerful character development and loose links which neatly connect in the end.Certainly the finest story in the collection is the last-- &quot;My Mother's Dream&quot; was so intricately handled it is worth an award by itself. Munro provides, finally, a more appropriate number of characters for a short story and is able to present and enrich them throughout the work effectively. She brings us into the world of the family here, pulling us in with suspense and connection, making us truly care about the people and hope for them and with them and get completely involved. Finally, as is true of the entire collection as well, Munro does not disappoint us in the end.Just when you were about to say, &quot;She's losing her knack for the great short story form,&quot; she whacks you with three whoppers and whispers, &quot;My dear, I am never too old to tell a great tale.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"Alice Munro's stories leave you pondering long after the story has stopped (they never end). These stories look at relationships between inlaws, mothers and daughters, fathers and daughters, lovers, friends. It is more a &quot;woman's book&quot; than a man's."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"I have read every single one of Munro's collections, and this one is pretty weak compared to some of the other gems she has written. \\"Save the Reaper\\" is just bizarre and unbelievable, \\"Jakarta\\" is probably her weakest story ever, and not even Alice Munro can pull off a story in which the narrator is an INFANT. (\\"My Mother's Dream.\\") \\"The Children Stay\\" is horribly cliche, the Munro version of a Lifetime movie. Perhaps the only good stories in this collection are \\"Before the Change\\" and the title story. Go back to stuff she wrote in the Eighties and you will see why she is so renowned for her writing. Here she's just going through the motions."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"Munro's tone and style have only improved with time. The Love of a Good Woman has depth and insight the mark the author's rare voice. A true delight to read, filled with pathos and moments that will cause the reader to smile softly, thinking, &quot;Yes, I know exactly how that feels.&quot; Worth the price and for many, will be a beloved part of a personal library; it stands repeated readings."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"The theme of this short story collection is the various paths that love escorts individuals down. Some of the stories are filled with passion; other nostalgia. The characters vary as the stories vary. Love can be man and woman, mother and daughter, siblings, etc. The stories do not always end happily ever after as the characters dive deeper into morass due to one exposure after another of some dark secrets.Alice Munro has a deserved reputation for some of the best literary works of the nineties. Her current anthology, THE LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN, overall is a well-written collection, but does not seem to reach the level of excellence set by the author in her previous works. Though several of the eight stories are excellent, some of the tales seem to need constant shock therapy to keep the heart pumping as Ms. Munro reveals one new disjointed surprise after another to keep the story line moving, but only jolts the reader's flow. Overall, this is a fabulous book, but readers need to be aware that it is not on the Munro level of quality.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"This collection of anachronous, dense short stories intrigued me. As a first-time Munro reader, I at first found it difficult to appreciate the patterns, details, and lack of plot. Eventually,however, a common thread develops and the reader is drawn in to these dream-like stories. &quot;Save the Reaper&quot;, contrary to what other reviews might say, is the jem of the collection. The look exchanged between the little boy and the grandmother near the end make this story the central story around which the others revolve. The understanding look that says, &quot;Don't worry, I'll keep your secret&quot; provides a central theme for the collection. &quot;The Love...&quot; provides portraits of secrets, the uncertainty of the thoughts and actions of loved ones, and the burden that comes with this knowledge. A must-read for someone learning to get past looking for a plot."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"The title story alone is worth the price of admission. It's like Agatha Christie on acid: A murder mystery told from several different points of view, but a murder mystery in the same sense that \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" is a murder mystery. \\"Jakarta,\\" with its jarring time-shift, is also a memorable story. Alice Munro paints a vivid if often bleak canvas of provincial Canadian life, and each of her short stories contains the depth of character and density of plot that you'd ordinarily find in a novel."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"Just read it and you will know for sure how astounding a writer can be. Try it and you will not regret it."},{"Title":"The Love of a Good Woman : Stories","review":"It has to admitted right up front that this is not a book I would ever have chosen to read on my own. However, as it was a selection for our bookgroup, I plowed in, and unlike many others in the group, finished it. Now, I'm sure that there is a demographic somewhere, for whom these eight stories really resonate and connect with -- but it sure isn't me. Set in the mid-1940s through the 1980s, the stories (five of which were first published in The New Yorker) take place in Munro's own milieu: Ontario and and British Columbia.In general, they are about everyday life and the quiet desperate struggles that go on in ordinary lives, and are thematically bound by a sense of disappointment. Indeed, this is not a book to give to the newly affianced, filled as it is with dissolving marriages and forlorn women (good luck finding a positive male character anywhere in the pages). Repeatedly in these stories, the reader is confronted with women whose lives have not evolved the way they had expected or desired. Now, this is certainly a truth in life, but the stories all start to run together after a while. And when there is an incident that stands out, it feels unbelievable. For example, one story climaxes with a girl getting set on fire, another has a moment where a grandmother feels a sexual frisson when touched on the leg by a young woman, another has a daughter unwittingly talking to her father's corpse, another has a loving mother abandon her children, and so on. In each case, a tale of the problems of ordinary life is suddenly turned into melodrama with a jarring change of pace.Certainly Munro is a skilled craftswoman, her prose is clearly labored over with great care and precision, but that only gets you so far. None of the characters are particularly interesting or compelling, and one is hard-pressed to care about their respective situations. There's a wan fatalism holding them all down, and that makes for gloomy reading. It might be that coming across them over time in The New Yorker, they'd feel a little more individual, but when collected, it feels like a one note concert. It should be noted that the title story is a bit different, much longer and much more scattered in style, it's also much more interesting. The last story is also stands out, as it is the only one that offers a sense of hope or happiness, which is probably why it was placed at the end of the book. So, while Munro does have a dab hand at description, the lack of interesting people in the stories and the uniformity of tone leave me unlikely to recommend this collection to anyone I know."},{"Title":"Blue Glass (Harvest American Writing)","review":"Blue galss by Sandra Tyler is an interesting book, different from other novels, still it is very easy to relate to. The book is not trying to tell the story of a family through time, it rather focuses on one event. This event may stretch over 4 or 5 years, yet in our lifespane, this is concidered one point in time. The book struck me as a series of scenes, ordinary scenes from our daily life, however, when we watch these scenes go by, we can see that they are not so ordinary after all; there is more than meets the eye. The elements of the book are simple and common: an adolescnet girl, a mother who built her life around her family, and a husband who grew tired of his life style. From one scence to the next, the writer shows very subtle changes and very small incidents that eventually change their whole life. I think the book tries to show us that small things that happen routinly mean something and that we shouldn't assume how the people close to us feel or think; there are things about them that we may never know. The elements and events in the book take place around us and we never notice. They are not special or important. However if we look carefully, we see that they mean a lot and they are very important for those who live through them. Each one of these scenes needs a star and each line needs an actor. Our simple daily lives is a long movie, it is not dull, not ordinary. We are not ordinary people, we are the stars of our own movies, of our own lives."},{"Title":"Blue Glass (Harvest American Writing)","review":"I was impressed with Sandra Tyler's first novel Blue Glass. Leslie, the main character, holds a solid voice throughout, one that is allowed to age and grow over time. Also, the myriad of secondary characters: her grandparents, cousins, aunt and uncle and parents are each given room to interact and I saw them as three dimensional people rather than filler. Moving the story from Leslie's house to the lake house to the grandparents' home was a good plot device that aided in creating new situations while not losing the characters or the multi-faceted Leslie. The book is character driven and moves like an elongated conversation that takes place over Leslie's impressionable junior high and high school years. Blue Glass did not lose my interest and I found myself returning to it to see what the next chapter would bring.Most moving to me was Leslie's parent's divorce and how her father, slowly moving towards his own freedom, becomes a background character to Leslie and at the novel's end lives across county and is not there to celebrate her entrance into college; Leslie's final prayer only for herself and her mother is a poignant reminder of this. Perhaps most striking of all the characters is Leslie's mother Mary. Mary, who lives to love and serve and continues to love and not blame her husband after he moves on, is allowed to grow as a person; we see change in small ways but the overall picture, her sweetness and adaptability, and with it her inherent limitations, remain the same. Powerful were the ways in which Tyler showed Mary's deep loss at her divorce. We don't know if the mother will remain alone; the jagged edges of her life are softened by her upbeat nature, but the book does not take a sentimental shortcut by giving her Mr. Right, the opposite happens actually, and Blue Glass shows the emotional needs and unmet longings that people face.I think that Blue Glass reads somewhat like a first novel....this comment is easier said than explained....but it is a good first novel. Care and development are part of its fabric; it does not waste our time."},{"Title":"Going for the Bronze: Still Bitter, More Baggage","review":"Sloane Tanen has done it again!
